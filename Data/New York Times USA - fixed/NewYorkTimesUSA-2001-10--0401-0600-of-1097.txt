HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ECONOMY; 
House G.O.P. Tax-Cut Plans Jeopardize Chance of a Deal

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Republicans in the House said today that they planned to draw up their own package of tax cuts and begin voting on it as soon as this week, casting doubt on efforts to reach a quick bipartisan deal to reduce taxes and increase spending in response to the economic downturn.
 Congressional aides said tonight that the House Ways and Means Committee would take up the Republican package on Friday, and Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said it could include a wide array of tax-cut proposals. 
 Among them, Republicans said, may be a cut in the long-term capital gains rate for stocks and other assets bought after Sept. 11. The legislation, they said, is also likely to include an acceleration of the individual income tax rate cuts included in the tax bill signed into law earlier this year by President Bush, as well as several provisions to reduce taxes on businesses. 
The decision by House Republicans to push ahead with their own tax bill reflected frustration among the party's conservatives that in negotiations with the White House on an economic stimulus package, Democrats were pushing for a heavy emphasis on increased government spending and less on tax cuts. 
That decision by the House majority led to a strained meeting between the top Democrats and Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee this afternoon, people who were briefed on the session said.
The Democrats in the room, Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, both suggested that it would be difficult to move ahead with bipartisan negotiations on a stimulus package if House Republicans went their own way with a tax bill.
Afterward, Mr. Rangel said any attempt by the Ways and Means Committee to pass a Republican bill would become a "food fight."
Administration officials and members of both parties in Congress said there were continuing discussions about how to meet a central priority of the Democrats: providing a one-time payment to low- and moderate-income people who did not qualify for the tax rebates issued this summer. 
But Democrats said the administration was advocating an overall level of tax cuts that would be fiscally irresponsible and ultimately harmful to the economy. Senator Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committee, said the package of individual and corporate tax cuts advocated by Mr. Bush would be far more costly than the $60 billion to $75 billion that the president has suggested he would support.
Mr. Conrad said Mr. Bush's plan would cost $100 billion for the current fiscal year, and $177 billion over the next five years, if -- as in one option -- only the personal income tax rate currently at 27 percent was immediately reduced, to 25 percent. Under current law, the 27 percent rate is scheduled to drop to 26 percent in 2004 and to 25 percent in 2006.
If all income tax rates were immediately reduced to their planned 2006 levels, as many Republicans would prefer, the tax cut would cost $114 billion this year and $244 billion over five years, Mr. Conrad said.
In the House, Democrats pressed their case for including big new spending initiatives in any stimulus package. They circulated a plan to spend up to $75 billion this year on what they termed security measures, ranging from at least $1 billion to make government computer systems less vulnerable to a proposal that would increase financing to make schools drug-free.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DONATIONS; 
$850 Million for Charity, Not Centrally Monitored

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW 

 BODY:
A month after the terror attacks in New York City, a system for distributing some $850 million in charitable donations is fast emerging. It is a system that largely rejects centralized decision-making, depending instead on individual relief groups to collaborate informally on how best to help victims with a wide range of needs. It is also one that is rapidly expanding the notion of who deserves aid to include recipients well beyond the families of those killed or injured.
 But if a decentralized system promises speed and flexibility, it does little to assure that all donations will be distributed equitably, relief officials acknowledge. It also offers no clear way to avoid fraud or wasteful duplication, and some relief workers are worried that a decentralized network will prove confusing for traumatized families to navigate. 
 Rather than constructing a unified mechanism of philanthropic relief -- as happened after the Oklahoma City bombing -- organizations are coalescing around specific categories of victims and types of aid. 
Those raising money for scholarships -- like Citigroup, former President Bill Clinton and the Silver Shield Foundation -- are banding together, as are the major funds for the families of firefighters and other rescuers who died. Similar clusters are forming for mental health, the unemployed, the orphans, even displaced artists.
But there is no central body to provide overall coordination -- nothing at all like the large committee of relief agencies in Oklahoma City that met each Friday to decide, victim by victim, how to distribute benefits.
"They are going to need that," warned Gwen Allen, an Oklahoma City mental health worker who attended the weekly sessions there. "Unfortunately, there are going to be people who say, 'I didn't get anything,' and in fact they were given the world. Unfortunately, there are going to be people who use the system, and without some kind of central point of reference you have no way to defend against abuse."
In New York City, however, a consensus has formed among charity and relief groups that such a model is inappropriate for a disaster of this magnitude. When there are so many victims and so many relief groups, many of them brand new, pursuit of a centralized system of distributing charitable donations is viewed as foolhardy, even dangerous.
"You would get gridlock if you get everyone in one big room," said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, a senior vice president and chief executive for human services at the United Way of New York City.
Only a week ago, Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York attorney general, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani were each vying for a central role in stitching together the diverse and overlapping relief efforts. So far their efforts to assert control have been of little consequence. 
Often with surprising speed, charity groups are organizing and making decisions on their own. Mr. Spitzer, for example, made public yesterday a Web site, www.wtcrelief.info, that describes what various charities are doing to provide relief. Three private organizations had already done the same thing.
The Ford Foundation revealed how it intended to spend $11.2 million that it has pledged to the disaster -- including $3 million for financial assistance to nonprofit organizations and small businesses in Lower Manhattan -- without checking first with Mr. Giuliani's office.
"It needs to be coordinated; it does not need a czar," Susan V. Berresford, president of the Ford Foundation, said of the charity effort.
Underlying this view, she and other relief officials said, is a basic faith in New York's abundance of "muscular" nonprofit groups. These are established organizations that are accustomed to working with each other, often with little guidance from public officials.
Mr. Spitzer, though, said yesterday that he would continue pressing for some kind of central coordination, even if he has to cajole reluctant relief organizations. He also said his office, which is charged with investigating fraud among charities, had come across only a handful of organizations that seemed suspect.
Mr. Giuliani also continued to express concern yesterday that the charities may lose track of some victims. "You have a large group of people that were lost that don't fit into any particular category," he said.
The charity effort, immense in scale and complexity, is the biggest outpouring of giving in American history. There are hundreds of disaster organizations, nonprofit groups, foundations, government agencies and corporations involved. 
Each day brings more announcements of benefit concerts and fund-raisers. Harnessing the good will, and channeling it both efficiently and fairly, poses logistical challenges never before confronted by veteran aid officials.
"We are definitely in new territory," said Ken Curtin, an official with the Federal Emergency Management Agency who is helping to organize local charity and volunteer efforts.
Very little of the money pledged to date -- less than 10 percent by some estimates -- has actually been distributed. This is partly by design. There is wide agreement among relief officials that it would be unwise to spend too fast, particularly since the landscape of victims is still evolving. Indeed, government officials are urging charities to conserve their money for what may be years of need.
But donations are also piling up because many of the new relief funds still do not have the basic elements of governance in place, such as boards of directors, mission statements, written standards. Distribution has also been slowed by uncertainty about what victims will receive from the Federal Victims Compensation Fund, and concern that pledges may be substantially greater than actual receipts. 
When donations have been distributed so far, the process has sometimes been haphazard, and money has occasionally gone to those fortunate to know a relative or friend in a relief group.
Some spending decisions, driven by the urgency of the moment, are being made with fragments of information. The Robin Hood Foundation, which has raised $14 million in donations for low-income victims, gave about $400,000 to the Children's Health Fund to buy a "mobile medical crisis intervention unit" for Lower Manhattan. David Saltzman, the foundation's executive director, said the decision was made in less than 24 hours, without any clear sense of whether the contribution might duplicate what others were doing, or whether it served the greatest need.
"I'll be honest with you," he said. "There is this balance between speed and effectiveness."
Behind such quick decisions, however, order is taking hold. Coordination is flowing from many directions at once. It comes in the form of loose coalitions connected by the Web and late-night meetings over pizza and beer. There are task forces and phone trees, all forming at a rapid pace.
An example of this coalescence has emerged among those raising money for scholarships, a crowded field of people and organizations determined to eliminate tuition from any stricken family's list of worries. But with the good intentions comes the threat of duplication, administrative waste and confusion.
It was with this threat in mind that Chip Raymond, chairman of the Citigroup Foundation, attended a recent meeting of nonprofit officials at the Ford Foundation's Manhattan offices. There, Mr. Raymond stood and asked anyone interested in scholarships to give him a call. Citigroup, he said, had already committed $15 million to scholarships, and millions more were coming from its customers and employees. He argued that it was important to create "one-stop shopping" for families in need of scholarships.
As it happened, Mr. Clinton was worried about the same thing, and he and Bob Dole, the former Senate majority leader, had already announced plans to raise $100 million on behalf of the Citizens Scholarship Foundation of America, a Minnesota-based company that manages about 900 corporate scholarship programs.
When an assistant to Mr. Clinton read about Citigroup's efforts, Mr. Clinton's former press secretary, Joe Lockhart, urged him to call Sanford I. Weill, chairman and chief executive of Citigroup.
As a result, Citigroup decided on Tuesday to join forces with Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole.
"There's no reason in the world to have nine competing organizations doing the same thing, each one burning money on administrative costs," Mr. Lockhart said.
A similar process of self-organization is occurring among the proliferating funds for firefighters and police officers. There, much of the leadership is coming from the Twin Towers Fund, established by Mr. Giuliani and now approaching $80 million in pledges. For low-income victims, the Robin Hood Foundation is emerging as a leader, and it hopes to raise more from a benefit concert on Oct. 20 at Madison Square Garden featuring Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton, Billy Joel and Paul McCartney.
The best seats are selling for $10,000.
But right now, when it comes to directing charity dollars, the most influential people in the city are Ms. Barrios-Paoli of the United Way and Joyce M. Bove, a vice president at New York Community Trust, who, together, sit atop more than $300 million in donations pledged to both organizations since Sept. 11.
Their two organizations have approved a dozen grants worth $5.8 million, the largest going to Safe Horizons, a nonprofit agency that is distributing cash grants to victims. The two women are now considering 100 or so other grant proposals, everything from asthma research to relief for families of Mexican workers killed in the attacks.
"I think the definition of victim is widening as people understand the ramifications of what is happening," Ms. Barrios-Paoli said. "The need is going to be so different from what we all expect."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: MEDIA WATCH; 
President Is Using TV Show and the Public in Combination to Combat Terrorism

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

 BODY:
Osama bin Laden skillfully used television news programs to deliver his defiant message.
 President Bush retaliated by joining forces with a popular Fox network entertainment show. 
 By requesting that Fox pre-empt other programming to produce quickly a special episode of its weekly reality crime show "America's Most Wanted," to give viewers a chance to help hunt down terrorism suspects, Mr. Bush took his battle with Mr. bin Laden into an entirely new arena: show business. 
Together, the two foes have made television an even more important weapon than was imaginable during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, when images of tracer fire and missiles dominated television screens. In this murkier war, viewers are mostly witnessing arching volleys of propaganda. Mr. bin Laden seeks to scare them; Mr. Bush wants them to believe that it is Mr. bin Laden who should be afraid.
The president yesterday unveiled two steps in his media strategy. First, his aides tried to dissuade American television news organizations from broadcasting pretaped statements by Mr. bin Laden and his followers, and, second, Mr. Bush was at F.B.I. headquarters, lending his prestige to the television manhunt.
"I want to thank the American people for understanding that we are engaged in a new war, a war that will require a new way of thinking," the president said in remarks covered live by all major networks.
John Walsh, the host of "America's Most Wanted," said Scott Sforza, a White House aide, called him on Tuesday and explained that in a meeting, White House aides had brainstormed ways to engage the public and hit on the idea of enlisting his show.
Mr. Walsh said the show, which uses law enforcement information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies to profile suspects and encourage witnesses to call in with tips, had helped track down hundreds of suspects in its 15 years on the air. He said the White House sought his collaboration both to assist law enforcement and soothe Americans' thirst for vengeance.
"He told me they were sitting around a table talking about how the American public is frustrated, angry and heartbroken, and want to do something, and 'America's Most Wanted' does something," Mr. Walsh recalled. He said he was quite certain Mr. Bush had seen the show, since both his parents were fans.
White House officials could not verify last night the president's familiarity with the show but agreed that Mr. Bush was eager to enlist it in the chase. "The evidence is clear that the show catches criminals," said James Wilkensen, the deputy White House communications director. "The show can be of help in the president's desire to bring the terrorists to justice."
When White House officials were told that the Fox network had pre-empted the next three episodes of "America's Most Wanted" to broadcast the baseball playoffs, the White House contacted Peter Chernin, president and chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which owns the Fox network, to ask him to find a time to broadcast the special.
Mr. Chernin's office said tonight that the one-hour special would be broadcast at 9 p.m. Friday in place of a new drama, "Pasadena."
Mr. Walsh said the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, would probably make an appearance, but he did not rule out an appearance by the president himself.
The special cooperation between the White House and Fox network is not incongruous. Mr. Murdoch is an open Bush supporter, and his network is highly popular with conservatives. But the arrangement led to odd moments on television yesterday. Twenty-four-hour cable news stations like MSNBC and CNN lavishly and repeatedly promoted the special, showing pictures of the suspects who are to be profiled on the rival show.
The Fox network, in contrast, kept to its regular programming, featuring talk shows and courtroom reality shows like "Texas Justice," where domestic violence and marital infidelity still hold sway.
The Bush administration's embrace of the world of entertainment is broadening. After the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Army planners sought the advice of Hollywood film makers, who were asked to dream up exotic possible terrorist attacks in order to help the military thwart them. 
According to Variety, the entertainment industry newspaper, which first reported the meeting, one member of the Hollywood brain trust at the meeting was Steven E. de Souza, the co-writer of "Die Hard," a 1988 hit about terrorists attacking a Los Angeles office building.
Michael Macedonia, an Army scientist based in Orlando, Fla., told The Associated Press that the show business people were some of the "biggest patriots I've ever met."
In some ways, Mr. Bush's strategy also seems to seek to blur the barriers between the government and the Fourth Estate. Bruised in past weeks by criticism for seeking to censor administration critics, Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, was careful yesterday to say that news organizations were being asked, not ordered, to screen taped videos of bin Laden videos before showing them. 
But in today's uneasy climate, where national security, personal safety and the world economy all seem vulnerable, all the major television news organizations quickly agreed to comply.
The degree of deference from news organizations, usually prickly about any infringement of First Amendment freedoms, is unusual, perhaps matching the enormity of the terrorist attack.
But Mr. Bush's use of television, particularly entertainment shows, is also a new step. President Ronald Reagan was a master at using television imagery, but he never commandeered a network show to pursue a national security goal. Neither did President Bill Clinton, despite his cozy relationship with movie stars and Hollywood fund-raisers.
An administration official said yesterday that the White House never debated the merits or questioned the wisdom of enlisting "America's Most Wanted."
As one official put it, "It's a clever idea."'

HEADLINE: Expansive Role for Greenspan Brings Out Critics of Fed's Chief 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan has been everywhere in guiding economic policy in the wake of the terrorist attacks, slashing interest rates, helping to get Wall Street running again, shaping the tax cuts being developed by Congress and evaluating which airlines should receive government loan guarantees.
 But his expansive role has provided his critics on both ends of the ideological spectrum with new ammunition for their argument that Mr. Greenspan is meddling in issues far removed from his responsibilities at the central bank. 
 The critics, including members of Congress and economists and analysts outside of government, said Mr. Greenspan's influence had grown to troubling proportions, given that he does not hold elective office. And they said that by becoming involved in so many issues beyond interest rates and banking regulation, Mr. Greenspan risks undermining the Fed's independence from politics, a status that Mr. Greenspan has worked hard to cement. 
"He's kind of become the jack-of-all- trades in Washington," said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota. "Seems to me the country is best served if he masters monetary policy. The record is quite clear that he leaps at opportunities beyond monetary policy for his own reasons."
Mr. Greenspan still enjoys broad and deep support among both parties in Washington and on Wall Street. There is little evidence that his advice and consent, whether given reluctantly or eagerly, is any less sought after than ever, especially at a time when members of Congress from both parties see the Bush administration's economic team as untested.
Indeed, to his admirers, the Fed chairman's experience and stature have been vital in helping the nation to minimize the economic damage after the attacks and to project stability.
"The face of Alan Greenspan was ever-present and reassuring," said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa.
But his prominence in the last month on so many issues -- and the degree to which both Congress and the administration have relied on him for guidance -- have brought the debate over the proper limits of his influence into sharper focus.
About the only job the Fed chairman has not been given, one economist in Washington said, is selecting military targets in Afghanistan.
The critiques tend to come in two forms. One is that Mr. Greenspan, who was active in Republican politics until his appointment to the Fed in 1987, is too willing to advance his personal views and agenda, or to block initiatives of one party or the other, especially when it comes to budget policy.
Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a political action committee in Washington that promotes tax cuts, said Mr. Greenspan's recent opposition to including a capital gains tax cut in the proposed economic stimulus package had left many of the Fed chairman's fellow conservatives dismayed that he could almost single-handedly kill one of their most cherished policy proposals.
"There's a real sense that the shine is off the star with Greenspan," he said. "He was not elected. He's not accountable to anyone."
One of Mr. Greenspan's most vociferous critics, Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, said half-jokingly that he has been expecting Mr. Greenspan to show up alongside Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York to direct the city's recovery efforts.
"Look from A to Z, and Alan Greenspan's name pops up," Mr. Bunning said. "He's not even doing his own job well."
The other line of criticism is that Mr. Greenspan has allowed himself to be used for political purposes, albeit reluctantly at times, by Congress and successive administrations. By this reasoning, the two parties have each sought to squeeze out of Mr. Greenspan a blessing for their positions, or to lead him into undermining the positions of their political opponents. 
One example was Mr. Greenspan's support during a Congressional hearing early this year for a substantial reduction in taxes, helping President Bush push through his $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax cut.
Another was his statement in a closed session with lawmakers several weeks ago that a permanent cut in the corporate income tax rate -- a proposal the administration wanted included in the stimulus package -- would not provide much of an immediate boost to the economy. Faced with Mr. Greenspan's skepticism, the administration stopped pushing the proposal.
"In the last decade, we've seen the influence and visibility of the Fed soar," said Tom Schlesinger, executive director of the Financial Markets Center, a liberal research organization in Philomont, Va. "But we haven't seen a commensurate rise in public accountability, and I would lay at least half of the accountability deficit at our elected leaders, not Chairman Greenspan."
Mr. Greenspan has long held the view that as an appointed public official -- the Fed chairman is named by the president, subject to confirmation by the Senate -- he has an obligation to respond to requests for information and advice from Congress.
But, as Mr. Schlesinger said, Mr. Greenspan, who has worked in Washington on and off for three decades, "knows his politics as well as he knows his economics."
As a result, Mr. Greenspan, who almost never gives on-the-record interviews to provide his side of the story, is no doubt well aware that he is at times a pawn in partisan battles over policy. And he sometimes seems to make an effort to remove himself from situations that might compromise his independence or that of the Fed.
Last month, for example, Congress and the White House named Mr. Greenspan to the board that will decide which airlines should receive loan guarantees from the government as part of the airline bailout package passed in the wake of the terrorist attack. Mr. Greenspan resisted, saying that he would be perceived as having a hand in picking winners and losers among the airline companies, a role that would put him in conflict with his own belief that business is best left to market forces.
Under pressure from Capitol Hill and the White House, Mr. Greenspan agreed to take on the job, but with the proviso that he could designate someone else to represent him and his views on the board.
"He didn't volunteer to be on the airline board," Mr. Leach said. "I'm quite confident he fought not to be on it."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE PRESIDENT; 
In One Month, A Presidency Is Transformed

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
The night before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, while having dinner with his brother and friends at the Colony resort in Longboat Key, Fla., President Bush heard about a new book: Jay Winik's "April 1865," a day-by-day account of how the closing month of the Civil War transformed the politics of the nation.
 By the time Mr. Bush was seen clutching the thick volume as he walked off Marine One a few weeks later, his own presidency had been transformed. That change, too, came in a single month, and Mr. Bush seems acutely aware that -- much as in the closing days of Civil War -- decisions made now could shape the nation's role in the world for decades to come. He has told his staff that little they did before Sept. 11 matters now; just as he is fighting a new war, he is fighting from the platform of a new presidency. 
 Much of the president's long-term domestic agenda has been set aside -- some of his own cabinet members fear it has been abandoned -- to make way for the fight against terrorism that has become the mission of this presidency. Mr. Bush's legislative goals have largely narrowed to three bills that focus on responding to terrorism. The White House itself has been reorganized to face the new threat. Global alliances have been reassessed: the president who campaigned on taking a tougher line with both Russia and China (and who could not recall the name of the general who runs Pakistan) has been forced to rethink American relations with the rest of the world, a process that will speed up next week when he attends the summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Shanghai.
The president himself has been through a jagged trajectory in the last month. From his shaky start on Sept. 11, when he first learned of the terrorism while talking to elementary school students in Sarasota, Fla., to a speech before Congress on Sept. 20 that left even critics dazzled, to his recent fury with both Congressional leakers and the reporters who feed off them, Mr. Bush is a different man than he was a month ago.
Inside and outside the White House, friends and advisers who once complained that the president had trouble getting his bearings when faced with a panoply of issues now assert that he is focused as never before.
"He appears different up close," said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a Democrat who has found himself in a new, warm relationship with Mr. Bush. "He has a resolve, he has a confidence. He still has the same way of putting people at ease, but you can see that this is somebody who is in the process of rising to the occasion."
Mr. Bush's approval ratings are at historic highs, greater than even those of his father after the Persian Gulf war. But in those high ratings, and in his single-minded focus, many around him see risks that he could focus too little on national and global economic problems, and that he could press the loose coalition of nations he has assembled too far and too fast.
"He's had a very, very good month," one of his foreign policy advisers said a few days ago. "But he knows that all the toughest issues -- especially how quickly to expand the fight beyond Afghanistan -- are ahead of him."
A month ago, Mr. Bush had a very different plan for the fall.
He was eager to press for his education reform bill, and he was fending off questions about whether the shrinking federal surplus meant he might agree to dip into Social Security revenues. He was facing a long, ugly fight with Congress over the budget. 
Few of those issues had much resonance outside Washington. In fact, the night of the dinner at the Colony, one of his senior staff members worried that Americans were interested in very little of what was happening in the capital. Mr. Bush's aides had fretted all summer that his presidency seemed small.
No one says that anymore, and a month later the president's daily schedule reflects the magnitude of the change. There have been only a handful of meetings on domestic policy, and whenever there is one, the issues are seen through a different prism. Running a deficit -- a big one -- is a given, and even issues close to voters' hearts are barely discussed.
"We're not meeting with members of Congress on the patients' bill of rights," said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director. "We're meeting with intelligence committees about the war effort.
"The question in meetings is, 'How is this helping or hurting our effort to fight global terrorism?' " Mr. Bartlett said. "It seems to be one of the threshold questions of any decision that has been made in the last 30 days." 
Visitors to the Oval Office say they have been intrigued by a deeper question: Has pursuing the fight against terrorism changed Mr. Bush's view of the world?
Before Sept. 11, Mr. Bush's critics said the president was too quick to act unilaterally, no matter how high the diplomatic cost. He was headed toward renouncing the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty by November, over the objections of Russia and China. Among the several international treaties the administration was letting languish was one concerning biological weapons. Assembling the coalition of countries in the past month, however, appears to have delayed that agenda, and may ultimately change its direction.
"There seems to be a genuine realization that, at least in dealing with terrorism, we can't do it unilaterally," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who spent an hour with Mr. Bush on Tuesday. "I don't know how much that will carry over to other subjects. But I'd be surprised if he withdraws from the ABM treaty anytime soon, and I'd be surprised if he doesn't have to start talking about the biological weapons treaty." 
Though White House officials are loath to discuss the subject, the attack on Afghanistan may also change Mr. Bush's view of the need for the United States to engage in a major "nation building" project, something he said in the campaign that the United States military should stay away from.
In private, he is already talking about the need for billions in aid to reconstruct Afghanistan -- assuming, of course, that the Taliban is removed from power and Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, Al Qaeda, is disabled. 
But Mr. Biden said "my impression is that the president is extremely wary of leaving American forces on the ground in Afghanistan," presumably seeing the risks of a Vietnam-like conflict of attrition. That may also explain Mr. Bush's hesitance to talk of spreading the war to Iraq, as several conservatives in his administration urged in the days after Sept. 11 -- and still threaten as part of a Phase II of the war.
Physically, Mr. Bush has also changed. Members of Congress who have seen him this week at the White House say that he looks exhausted, a sharp contrast from the tanned, rested chief executive who spent much of August at his Texas ranch.
But advisers say Mr. Bush, who reprimanded Congress on Tuesday over leaked information, is not tired, irritable or losing sleep. He still goes to bed, they say, between 9:30 and 10 p.m. He is still up around 5:30 a.m., when he gets coffee for himself and his wife and reads the newspapers with her in bed.
He is in the Oval Office by 7 a.m., when he makes calls to foreign leaders. His standing 8 o'clock C.I.A. briefing is now followed by an F.B.I. briefing on the status of the terrorist investigation. After that he has daily national security meetings, scheduled for an hour. He exercises, using weight machines and a treadmill in the White House living quarters, either over lunch or at 6 p.m. after he leaves the office. In the evenings Mr. Bush has friends or staff in for dinner; last Thursday he had the Republican leadership in for drinks on the Truman balcony.
Mr. Bush's advisers explain his public testiness as a case of using his temper rather than losing it, particularly in his dressing-down of Congress.
"That was not a shoot-from-the-hip," said Karl Rove, one of the president's senior advisers. "That was a very deliberate, calculated message and tone."

PERSON: Nancy Patricia Pelosi 

HEADLINE: Woman in the News; 
A New Vote Counter -- Nancy Patricia Pelosi

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
When Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro answered the phone as a Baltimore teenager, she often gave directions on "how to get somebody on welfare, into a hospital bed, into a project," she recalled today, even "out of jail."
 Today, as Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the daughter of the late Mayor Thomas J. D'Alesandro Jr. was elected the House Democratic whip, the highest position any woman has held in either house of Congress. As No. 2 to Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, she could become speaker of the House someday if, as she and Mr. Gephardt promised today, Democrats win back the House. 
 Ms. Pelosi had a comfortable majority of House Democrats on her side today as she defeated Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, 118 to 95.
She will take over on Jan. 15, when the current whip, Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, gives the job up to devote his time to running for governor.
Ms. Pelosi had appeared to lead throughout the long campaign, although Mr. Hoyer -- whom she first met when they were interns together for Senator Daniel Brewster, Democrat of Maryland in 1963 -- contended that her claim of 120 commitments was exaggerated. But as she observed today in an interview, a whip has to show "you know how to count," since the basic duty of the job is counting votes.
"My votes were so right on the money," she said.
California Democratic politics these days may be a bit more exotic than the bread-and-butter style of Baltimore in the 50's. But even today, Ms. Pelosi said in the interview, "everything in Congress is about the economy. The decisions we make about education and health care and housing and giving people a stake, that's the work I came here to do. That was when I was growing up the only issue, which side are you on."
She has served in the House since 1987, filling the seat once held by Representative Philip Burton, who lost a race for majority leader by a single vote in 1976.
Ms. Pelosi has been known for her opposition to normal trade relations with China, and for hard service on the ethics committee when it was investigating Speaker Newt Gingrich.
She has been a prominent Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, and said she was proudest of her work there to "increase very dramatically the funding for research, care and prevention for H.I.V. and AIDS, both domestically and internationally."
She also serves on the Intelligence Committee, where she is the ranking Democrat.
President Bush called this afternoon to offer his congratulations on her victory. And while Ms. Pelosi says it is important to work closely with the president on terrorism issues, she argues that the economic stimulus package he proposed depends too heavily on the "trickle-down theory." 
A priority, she told the caucus after her victory this morning, is that "we must assist New York in its recovery effort."
She expanded on that thought in a news conference, saying: "As a person from earthquake country, I know what it means to a people when they know that the federal government is there with you in time of disaster.
"So I think we have to remove all doubt in the minds of anybody in New York or elsewhere that the federal government will be there for New York. It's not only in New York's interest, it's in our country's interest."
Ms. Pelosi lived in New York in the 1960's, while her husband, Paul F. Pelosi, worked there as a banker. Four of her five children -- Nancy Prowada, 37, Christine Pelosi, 35, Jacqueline Kenneally, 34, and Paul Jr., 32 -- were born there. The fifth, Alexandra, 31, was born after the family moved to California in 1969.
Born in Baltimore on March 26, 1940, while her father served in the House, she graduated from a Roman Catholic high school, the Institute of Notre Dame. Then she moved to Washington, 45 miles away, as far as her parents would allow, to attend Trinity College, a Catholic college for women. She graduated in 1962.
Before she ran for Congress, she was active in California politics as a fund-raiser and as state party chairman, and in 1976 she organized a presidential primary victory back in Maryland for Gov. Jerry Brown of California.
Except when her children were very young -- and even then she did some volunteer party work -- her life has been politics.
It started in Baltimore's Little Italy section, where, she said, "our lives were about campaigns." Only at Christmas or Easter, she recalled, was there a time "when you could walk into our home and you were not given a placard or a bumper sticker or a brochure to distribute."

SECTION: Section B; Column 1; National Desk; Pg. 14; A NATION CHALLENGED: PORTRAITS OF GRIEF: THE VICTIMS

LENGTH: 2082 words

HEADLINE: A Fighter Pilot, a Math Wiz, A Boy Who Loved School

BYLINE: The profiles of victims on this page were written by Ray Hernandez, John Files, Alison Jones, Greg C. Bruno and Renwick McLean.

 BODY:
Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the Pentagon:

CHARLES F. BURLINGAME
A Classmate Like a Brother
 To those who knew him, Capt. Charles F. Burlingame's dependability was legend. ''He was kind of a go-to guy,'' said Perry Martini, a former classmate of Captain Burlingame, a Navy fighter pilot many affectionately remember by his nickname, Chic. ''If you needed something done and done right,'' Mr. Martini said, ''you would call on Chic.''
 As a pilot, Mr. Burlingame, 51, captain of American Airlines Flight 77, was a perfectionist, and his attention to safety earned him the respect and admiration of his colleagues. But Captain Burlingame's most valued quality, friends say, was his commitment to people. He personified the word classmate, Mr. Martini said, and as such, ''he became family.''
 A graduate of the Naval Academy and the Navy's Top Gun fighter pilot school in Miramar, Calif., Mr. Burlingame accepted a position 12 years ago with American Airlines, where his wife, Shari, is a flight attendant.
 He was to attend his 30-year college reunion, which he helped organize, the week after the attacks. Instead, former classmates from as far as Hong Kong gathered to honor their fallen brother, take in a Navy football game and reminisce.
 ''If Chic were around this weekend,'' Mr. Martini said, ''he would be doing a lot of high-fives and hugs.''

LT. GEN. TIMOTHY J. MAUDE
'The Army Needed Him'
 After Lt. Gen. Timothy J. Maude ruptured his spleen in an accident at the Pentagon last November, doctors told him to rest for a month and forget about his duties as the Army's deputy chief of staff for personnel. He didn't listen.
 General Maude established Internet and phone lines, and less than 48 hours after his surgery was receiving updates and briefing personnel from the bedroom of his home in Fort Myer, Va. 
 ''It would have been very easy for him to turn it over'' to colleagues, said Col. Sean J. Byrne, the general's executive officer. But ''the Army needed him,'' Colonel Byrne said. ''They wanted his sage wisdom.''
 General Maude, 53, the highest-ranking officer killed in the Sept. 11 attack, was charged last year with bolstering the Army's declining recruitment numbers, and he helped coin the new recruiting slogan, ''An Army of One.''
 But the general's legacy as one of the Army's most qualified personnel officers cannot eclipse his dedication to friends and family or his commitment to his wife, Terri. ''You are never going to find a couple who were more in sync with each other,'' Colonel Byrne said.

GERALD P. FISHER
An Eternal Optimist
 As one of Booz, Allen & Hamilton's most respected consultants, Gerald P. Fisher never saw the need to dress for success.
 ''He was a character,'' said Joyce Doria, a senior vice president who supervised Mr. Fisher at the firm's Mclean, Va., office. ''Geep,'' as friends and co-workers called him, ''would sometimes come in with his tie in disarray, or a shirt that just didn't match,'' Ms. Doria said. ''But he stood his ground. He would say, 'This is me, this is who I am.' He wanted people to know him for his ideas. He had a very winning way.''
 A resident of Potomac, Md., Gerald Paul Fisher, 57, grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from San Francisco College. Bearded and burly, he was a jolly character, with a guttural laugh that turned heads when it rang. ''He was a very open kind of guy,'' Ms. Doria said, ''an eternal optimist.''
 At Booz, Allen for 17 years, Mr. Fisher had worked as a manpower specialist, and on Sept. 11 was meeting with Lt. Gen. Timothy J. Maude at the Pentagon.. 
 Mr. Fisher found time to pursue his passion for social work -- he held a doctorate in social welfare from the University of Pennsylvania. ''People would go to him for counseling,'' Ms. Doria said. ''I guess he never lost the social welfare part of him.''

RHONDA RIDGE RASMUSSEN
Reading Harry Potter Aloud
 Rhonda Ridge Rasmussen read to her husband, Floyd, just about every night before going to bed. His eyes are bad, he says, and she enjoyed reading to him. The couple had just started a new book, one of the Harry Potter series. 
 There were so many other things she was looking forward to when she died, Floyd Rasmussen said of his wife, a former Sunday school teacher. For one thing, Mrs. Rasmussen, 44, who worked in the Army's budget office in the Pentagon, had not developed the photographs the couple took on a trip to Europe a month earlier. 
 And the Rasmussens were planning to move back to California, where they met at a church dance on Dec. 31, 1973. Mr. Rasmussen, who also works at the Pentagon, said he may still head out West without her. ''It's a better place,'' he said. There aren't as many sad memories as there are here.''

CAPT. LAWRENCE D. GETZFRED
A Navy Man, Bottom to Top
 Lawrence D. Getzfred saw a lot of the Navy in his 39 years of service. He saw it from the bottom, when he enlisted out of high school in 1963. And he saw it from the top, as a commander of aircraft squadrons over the Pacific and as an officer in the Navy Command Center at the Pentagon.
 ''He had a tremendous perspective and insight for dealing with people in the Navy because he started out as an enlisted man,'' said Jess Hernandez, a retired rear admiral who knew Captain Getzfred for more than 20 years. ''Larry had a great feeling for those who were junior to him. He had been there, and he knew how important it was to offer his ear.''
 Captain Getzfred followed his older brother, Robert, into the Navy. Three other brothers -- James, William and Ronald -- enlisted after he did. Combined, the five brothers from Elgin, Neb., have more than 100 years of service. A sixth Getzfred brother, Mark, works for The New York Times. 
 ''He loved the Navy,'' said Capt. Richard Tenga, who worked at the command center with Captain Getzfred. ''His goal was to get to 40 years of service.''
 Friends said Mr. Getzfred, 57, cherished his daughters, Larissa, 12, and Kristina, 11, and his wife, Patricia, who live in suburban Maryland. He carried his daughters' pictures on his keychain and spent his free time building doll houses for them.
 And he loved his orange Corvette. He bought the car in the 1970's, friends said. It is still parked in the barn on the family farm in Nebraska.

BRADY KAY HOWELL
Work on 'Amazing Things'
 Friends and family knew that Brady Kay Howell was excited to be a presidential management intern, but he was thrilled when he was assigned to a civilian post for the chief of naval intelligence this year. 
 Mr. Howell, 26, a native of Sugar City, Idaho, went home at night bragging about all the ''amazing things'' he had worked on, his wife of five years, Elizabeth, said. Then he would tease her, saying he couldn't tell her about any of it because it was classified. 
 ''I don't think anyone enjoyed their work -- there were 14 of us -- as much as Brady,'' said Aaron Otto, a friend and fellow intern. 
 Mr. Howell, an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ''was the kind of guy who would go across town to pick up a Star Wars action figure, because he knew that someone in his family collected that sort of thing,'' Mr. Otto said. 
 While planning a trip home to Idaho recently, Mr. Howell joked with friends that upon his return he would provide his Beltway buddies with original Idaho potatoes.

HILDA TAYLOR
Giving Students the World
 As a native of Sierra Leone who came to the United States to further her own education, Hilda Taylor believed in exposing her urban elementary school students to a world beyond Washington.
 Her success in achieving that goal led Mrs. Taylor to accompany one pupil, Bernard Brown II, on Flight 77 on a field trip to California sponsored by the National Geographic Society. While in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, the group of was to hike, kayak and work with marine biologists to study oceanic life.
 Mrs. Taylor, 58, who taught sixth grade at Madeleine V. Leckie Elementary School, was an avid participant in the society's alliance with schools to promote geography.
 ''She was very enthusiastic, very dedicated,'' said Denise Sessoms, the assistant principal. ''She was always seeking new and creative learning experiences for her students. Parents looked forward to having their children in her room.''
 A mother of three, Mrs. Taylor lived in Forestville, Md., and was known for preparing dishes from Sierra Leone for friends.

BERNARD CURTIS BROWN II
Fan of Basketball and School
 Unlike many 11-year-olds, Bernard Curtis Brown II bounded out of his house every school day. ''He lived to go to school,'' said his mother, Sinita. ''If he was sick, he would always say he was feeling better so he could get to school.'' 
 But before Bernard left, a few things had to be in order. His parents did not demand it, but Bernard's bed had to be made, his room straightened, and his clothes ironed before he stepped out into the world. ''Oh yes, he was a neat child,'' his mother said with a laugh.
 He also awoke with a unusual energy. ''He would just pop right up,'' his mother said. So she did not mind letting him stay up late to watch basketball on television.
 An ambitious player, Bernard had just bought a pair of Air Jordan basketball shoes and was wearing them on Sept. 11 on a flight to California as part of a trip sponsored by the National Geographic Society. A Washington resident, he was enlivened by the prospect of Michael Jordan running the court for his hometown Wizards.

CMDR. WILLIAM HOWARD DONOVAN JR.
Always Making Lemonade
 William Howard Donovan Jr. was a rising star in the Navy who had just been promoted to commander. At 37, the Nunda, N.Y., native was in the ''pipeline.'' 
 ''It's not just a loss for his family but for the Navy and the country,'' said Cmdr. Alan Jarusewskin, a Naval Academy classmate and Pentagon colleague. 
 The two friends graduated from the Naval Academy in 1986 and found themselves working in the same office at the Pentagon years later. Commander Donovan flew in the Persian Gulf war and served as a tactical officer on the U.S.S. George Washington for two years in the mid-90's. 
 Commander Jarusewskin said his friend was a fun-loving and athletic family man who adored his wife and three children. Commander Donovan played in the Pentagon's lunch-time soccer league and passed his love of the game on to his children. 
 ''He always had this wry smile, even when things were down,'' Commander Jarusewskin said. ''You know how they say making lemonade out of lemons? He was that guy.''

BRYAN C. JACK
'A Real Intellectual'
 For days, friends thought Bryan C. Jack, a budget analyst for the Defense Department, was missing in the ruins of the Pentagon. By a strange twist of fate, it turned out that he was among the passengers aboard American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed at the place where Mr. Jack, on most days, would have been crunching numbers at his desk. On Sept. 11, he was on his way to California on business. 
 Colleagues said Mr. Jack was a brilliant mathematician. As director of the programming and fiscal economics division, he made sure that defense programs reflected the ideas and policies of the administration. He joined the department in 1978.
 Vance Gordon, a fellow program analyst, said no one at the department could have done the job Mr. Jack did.
 ''He was a mathematician, but also a real intellectual,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''He had an incredible breadth of knowledge -- certainly the best the country had to offer.''
 Mr. Jack, who grew up in the small East Texas town of Tyler, was a National Merit Scholar, a Presidential Scholar and a Henry Luce Scholar in Japan. He had a master's degree in business administration from Stanford University and a doctorate in economics from the University of Maryland. 
 ''Bryan was interested in music, photography and art and many other things you often do not associate with bureaucrats,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''When we cleaned out his office, we found more than 40 classical and modern music CD's.''
 Mr. Jack, 48, and Barbara Rachko, an artist from New York, were recently married, though they had been together for about 15 years. For parties, they took pecan pies -- a piece of Texas and of Mr. Jack's childhood. ''Bryan's pies were highly regarded,'' Ms. Rachko said.
 Every year Mr. Jack and Ms. Rachko got a shipment from the Jack family farm in Paris, Tex., which was dotted with pecan trees. ''I have a freezer full of pecans that will never be made into pies,'' she said. ''I have begun to feed them to the squirrels.''

Museums

* "ALONG THE NILE: EARLY PHOTOGRAPHS OF EGYPT" AND "THE PHARAOH'S PHOTOGRAPHER: HARRY BURTON, TUTANKHAMEN AND THE METROPOLITAN'S EGYPTIAN EXPEDITION," Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Dec. 30). "Along the Nile" is a gem of an exhibition of early, mostly amateur photographs of Egypt, including Maxime Du Camp's famous view of the colossal, half-buried face of Ramses II with an assistant posing on top of the sculpture, the ancestor of all those shots of Mom and Uncle Burt squinting into the camera and smiling next to the Sphinx. The show includes obscure figures like Ernest Benecke, a French wool trader of German descent, whose images are more remarkable for seeming accidental and serendipitous, and Theodule Deveria, whose photograph of the tomb of Ptahmose, the chief steward to Ramses II, is the only evidence of a site since reburied and lost beneath shifting sands. Pioneering works, these photographs have a virgin authenticity conveying the amateur photographer's amazement at seeing places through a device whose uncanny ability to capture those sights doubled the amazement. Half a century later Harry Burton photographed the excavation of Tutankhamen's tomb mixing Hollywood-style shots of Howard Carter uncovering Tut's mummy for the illustrated newspapers with documentary pictures made solely for the archives, which have an unintended modern beauty. The Burton show cleverly gives a fresh twist to the Tut craze, but the older photographs stick longer in the mind because they seem haunted from across a gulf of a century and a half. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* "AMERICAN IDENTITIES: A NEW LOOK," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (permanent). This dynamic, ecumenical reinstallation, drawn from the museum's vast holdings in 19th- and 20th-century American art and design, goes where few museums have successfully gone before and puts art and history on an equal footing. Against walls that at first seem shockingly bright, it displays an amazing, sometimes cluttered range of objects: American Indian pottery and baskets, Colonial paintings and folk art from North and South America, landscape paintings and portraits, all kinds of ceramics and furniture, as well as modernist and postmodernist abstractions. Aspects of life and culture, as well as epochal historical events, move in and out of the picture. Everything here is carefully realized, with a palpable deliberation that balances craft, material and usually creativity. As a result, art speaks for itself in a way that is rare in exhibitions of this kind, and it speaks in many different voices. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Roberta Smith).

* "PIETER BRUEGEL THE ELDER: DRAWINGS AND PRINTS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Dec. 2). We could all do worse right now than to lose ourselves for a while in this show of drawings and prints by Bruegel, who knew a thing or two about vice and virtue. The world is anarchic and cruel and can drive all of us to despair sometimes, but good art is a realm unto itself, he tells us, and thankfully we can escape into it from time to time when we need to regain our senses. Against the narcissism of our fin-de-siecle milieu, the mysterious figure of the elder Bruegel comes as a small and fortuitous counterpoint. To judge from his pictures of the deadly vices, or his Everyman as a greedy, nearsighted merchant, or some of the nimbler drawings like "The Beekeepers," an image of lumbering, faceless figures in woven masks and bulky clothes, Bruegel doesn't come across as a compassionate artist, never mind his beloved pictures of peasants and ice skaters. Instead, his dark-humored viewpoint seems strangely moving and modern. Solace, he implies, comes only from the integrity of the artist's effort, not a bad lesson today. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

* "CASPAR DAVID FRIEDRICH: MOONWATCHERS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Nov. 11). Think of this exquisite, 19-work exhibition as a bit of fanfare played pianissimo. It heralds the arrival of "Two Men Contemplating the Moon," the museum's first painting by the supreme German painter of the Romantic era, who made nature his cathedral and placed figures before it as before an altar. Concentrating on paintings of figures transfixed by the moon, it brings out the more intimate and serene side of Friedrich's temperament. The show also includes a few paintings and drawings by his contemporaries and disciples. One result is a surprisingly vivid sketch of the artist and his circle, which offers the opportunity to get a sharper sense of his extraordinary achievement. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

* "ALFRED JENSEN: CONCORDANCE," Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 16). To bask in the color-drenched puzzle paintings made by Jensen (1903-1981), you don't really need to grasp the arcane constructs he based them on. He made interpretive diagrams that he translated into dense patterns, built up of tiny but thickly impastoed squares and diamonds in tight but sprawling checkerboards and wheels. At their strongest, they have a symphonic effect. But it's the music -- the rough, bright colors and the groovy patterns of their arrangement -- that dazzles, not how the notes were born. The large-scale, multipart canvases here are almost all from the 60's and 70's, the peak years of his production. (A companion exhibit of smaller works from the same time frame is at PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-7000, through tomorrow.) Twenty years after Jensen's death, his art has gained in power. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, children, students and 60+ (Grace Glueck).

* "MEETING GOD: ELEMENTS OF HINDU DEVOTION," American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100 (through Feb. 24). Visitors to this amazing, often moving hodgepodge of a show may or may not encounter the divine presence. But they can easily enter into its mood of euphoric reference and spiritual graciousness while also learning a lot about one of the world's great religions. The displays roam through art, craft and kitsch; they include beautiful facsimiles of household Hindu shrines and lavishly costumed, spice-daubed statues. Connecting links are provided by videotapes, music, text panels and most of all the color photographs of Steven P. Huyler, one of the exhibition's organizers. The centerpiece is a stupendous trompe l'oeil re-creation of a sacred banyan tree bedecked with offerings and surrounded by sculptures produced by the museum's diorama artists. It is rare to see so much information, spiritual feeling and visual beauty brought into such effective alignment. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $7.50, students and 60+; $6, children (Smith).

"SPIRIT CAPTURE: NATIVE AMERICANS AND THE PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE," National Museum of the American Indian, at the United States Custom House, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700 (through July 21). "Spirit Capture" is packed with dream-haunting 19th- and 20th-century pictures, though it isn't a show of photography in the usual sense; most of the historical entries are either copies of original prints or modern prints made from old negatives. The result is a cogent interpretive essay in cultural history, a show about photography and specifically about who has produced it and why. And with extraordinary images at every turn -- from celebrity portraits of Geronimo, to documents of the slaughter at Wounded Knee, to highly polished work by contemporary Indian photographers -- it packs a punch. Hours and admission: Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Free (Holland Cotter).

* "TRADITIONAL JAPANESE DESIGN: FIVE TASTES," Japan Society Gallery, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through Jan. 6). This inspired exhibition parses nearly 150 objects of everyday use according to distinct, if not entirely separate, sensibilities; and in the process it reveals the complex role that aesthetics has always played in Japan's social, economic and intellectual life. Spanning periods from the prehistoric Jomon to the late-19th-century Edo, the beautifully installed show includes tools, clothing, weapons, shop signs, sake bottles, tea bowls, a range of lacquer and much else. The simple household objects of artisans and farmers are contrasted with a more contrived simplicity of the masters of the tea ceremony. The ostentatious kimonos of noble women are followed by the discreetly luxurious robes of Edo merchants' wives, whose extravagances were restricted by sumptuary laws. Despite considerable diversity in craft, material and visual ideals, the exhibition is united by a profound reverence for the beauty of the natural world and the conviction that it should not be marred by manmade objects. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5 (Smith).

Galleries: Uptown

"EXQUISITE MOMENTS: WEST LAKE AND SOUTHERN SONG ART," China Institute, 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181 (through Dec. 9). New York's big fall show of Chinese painting is installed in a very small space: two galleries at the China Institute that together could fit in a coat-check room at the Met. But square footage doesn't matter. Scale and quality do. Most of the 40 or so paintings in the show, on loan from premier American museums, are also small. Created in the form of album pages and fans, they are a one-on-one sort of art, meant to be brought out every now and then and savored, like love letters, in private. And as with love letters, the emotions conveyed are sweet, intense and sometimes deep (Cotter).

THOMAS RUFF, "l.m.v.d.r.," Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677 (through Nov. 3); David Zwirner, 43 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 966-9074 (through tomorrow). Mr. Ruff's photographs of houses in Europe by the great Modernist architect Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe (i.e., "l.m.v.d.r.") are big and beautifully produced, but bland despite various digital manipulations. Don't miss the nifty stereoscopic viewing boxes: put your nose close to the glass and you discover a remarkably vivid three-dimensional image of a Mies interior (Ken Johnson).

ROBERT THERRIEN, Gagosian, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through Oct. 27). In one of two mercurial sculptures, a football-size metal teardrop is poised upright on the corner of an eye-level table top; in the other, two thick red panels jut divergently from the wall like Minimalist planks or the Dutch door of a giant's house. As his playful, archetypal drawings do, Mr. Therrien's sculptures appeal simultaneously to one's Modernist sophistication and to one's inner child. In this they evoke dreams of pure new beginnings (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

LEDA CATUNDA, "Soft Paintings," Ramis Barquet, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-9090 (through Oct. 20). This prominent Brazilian artist is known for making semisculptural paintings using all sorts of fabrics and found materials and various forms of stitching. These new works focus predominantly on abstract constructions in which wide, curvy webs of fabric are interwoven and, in some cases, big tonguelike flaps emerge from slits. There's also a giant stuffed black-velvet fly, one of the artist's signature motifs (Johnson).

GERHARD RICHTER, Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160 (through Oct. 27). Mr. Richter's latest New York gallery exhibition feels like a cross between a new car showroom and a tutorial in postmodern painting. It is full of undeniably handsome new Richters -- 38 in all -- hot off the assembly line. Dominated by a silvery, penitential gray and filling four galleries, they rehearse the artist's famous disdain for distinctions between abstraction and representation, industrial production and artistic touch. While revealing nothing new about his art, they offer assurance that the product is still reliable, especially if one takes quantity as ultimate confirmation of quality (Smith).

* ALMA W. THOMAS, "Phantasmagoria: Major Paintings From the 1970'S," Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082 (through Nov. 3). With each new showing, Thomas's paintings look fresher and livelier, their totally abstract vocabulary of color markings conveying the spirit of a vibrant inner life. After decades of teaching art in the public schools of Washington while doing realist still lifes on her own, she found her voice as an abstract color painter. She pared down her style from tight realist brushwork to geometric, mosaiclike dabs and patches of high-energy hues. Laid down in irregular allover patterns on solid grounds that show through in webs and networks, her late works are sophisticated color structures that still reveal a debt to the natural world. Joy may be in short supply elsewhere, but it resonates in these paintings (Glueck).

JACK YOUNGERMAN, "Wood Relief Paintings and Watercolors," Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780 (through Oct. 20). The zingy high colors and color contrasts of Mr. Youngerman's wood relief paintings make this one of his most sparkling shows. Occurring for the most part in jagged, asymmetrical shapes that are at times stylized and emblematic, at others biomorphic like flowers, the reliefs are quirkily incised. The surfaces are painted in the same, different or slightly variant colors. In "Claustral," a rough diamond shape with four points, the deep, lustrous green of the inset makes a subtle and pleasing play with the bright blue of the raised surface. The hand of the artist is always refreshingly visible (Glueck).

Galleries: SoHo

JENNIFER MONICK, Kent, 67 Prince Street, (212) 966-4500 (through Oct. 24). A conceptualist with a light touch, Ms. Monick traffics in paradox. A photograph shows someone standing in an empty bucket while water flows by on the outside; a cardboard box with corrugated sides, filled to overflowing with plaster, invites us to wonder whether the box is full or empty; "Luminous," in which grease from a sugar donut in a white paper bag has bled through the bag onto a wooden pedestal, has a mysterious spiritual quality (Johnson).

AMY O'NEILL, "LOKN4U," Spencer Brownstone, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455 (through Oct. 27). There is a lot of attention to detail in Ms. O'Neill's elaborate theatrical installations. One simulates an old-fashioned carnival game under a blue- and red-striped tent; with inflatable weapons for prizes, it's an antiwar statement. An old bar with dark wood paneling, tacky lights and artificial smoke seeping out from behind the shot glasses has a nice ambience, but its point remains unclear (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

JEFF BROUWS, "Inside the Live Reptile Tent," Robert Mann Gallery, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 989-7600 (through Nov. 3). Serpentine roller coasters, dazzling neon signs, sideshow freaks, intrepid high divers, hokey games of chance, Ferris wheels and targets that you sock with a ball are grist for the lens of Mr. Brouws, who has been photographing the dying American carnival scene for more than a decade. In this show, the California-born photographer, who has previously focused on derelict gasoline stations and other highway phenomena, offers a fine wallow in carny nostalgia (Glueck).

FRANCIS CAPE, Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372 (through Oct. 27). An expert woodworker, Mr. Cape has transformed an entire wall of the gallery into a faux-antique, Early American-style facade, the intricate frame and panel construction painted a warm off-white. But for all its well-built concreteness, it isn't what it appears to be; it's a simulation like a Warhol Brillo box, a slightly surrealistic representation of a certain sort of domestic kitsch, a meditation on the allure of fake traditionalism (Johnson).

MARK COHEN, "Trespass," Bruce Silverstein Gallery, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-3930 (through Nov. 10). Mr. Cohen zeros in on an arm, a leg, a foot, a shoulder tattoo, even a gum bubble so huge that it replaces the face of the young girl blowing it. Taken out of bodily context, these fragmentary (but uncropped) pictures often make fine street poetry. His use of strobe often lends a surreality to his shots, making light as much a part of the impact as the image itself. The head of a young boy, brightly silhouetted by light against the background of a dark street takes on a visionary aspect. Through the eloquence of Mr. Cohen's laconic lens, a town gradually reveals itself (Glueck).

"EPIC PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE CUBAN REVOLUTION," Cuban Art Space, 124 West 23rd Street, (212) 242-0559 (through Oct. 27). For a brief time before the Cuban Revolution turned catastrophic, it had a kind of Hollywood glamour, with troops in scruffy-chic beards and berets and the baby-faced Fidel Castro and the Byronic Che Guevara as superstar leaders. A handful of Cuban photographers, including Raul Corrales and Osvaldo Salas, were responsible for promoting that image, and some of their signature work is on view. The leading image maker, though, was Alberto Diaz Gutierrez, or Korda, who came to the job through a career in fashion photography and advertising and created the image of Che as "Heroic Guerrilla" (Cotter).

BARBARA GROSSMAN, Bowery, 530 West 25th Street, (646) 230-6655 (through Oct. 27). Ms. Grossman had her first solo exhibition at this gallery in 1973. In this, her ninth since then, she presents medium large, bushy Matisse-style paintings in which two or three blocky women in loose dresses read or sing from sheet music against bright, busily patterned rug and wallpaper backgrounds (Johnson).

"INK STUDS," Ten in One, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 604-9660 (through Oct. 27). At its best, as in the work of Daniel Clowes, creator of "Ghost World," the comic book can seem a form of infinite possibility. This unfortunately titled but engaging exhibition features original inked pages by Mr. Clowes as well as samples of variously funny, bizarre and adolescent frame-by-frame narratives by Charles Burns, Kaz, Gary Panter (set designer for "Pee-Wee's Playhouse") and Chris Ware (Johnson).

ROB KELLER, "Preservation of Species," Thomas Korzelius, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-9723 (through Oct. 19). Mr. Keller has learned mummification according to the painstaking, time-consuming methods of the ancient Egyptians. This exhibition presents a baby hammerhead shark, a small deer and a rabbit, all mummified in tight, aged-looking bandages. The artist also mummifies toy animals, X-rays his mummies and makes collages about his ideas. Nothing is as compelling -- indeed, strangely poignant -- as the real mummified animals, however (Johnson).

AN TE LIU and JOHN deFAZIO, Henry Urbach, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-0974 (through Oct. 20). An oblique comment on consumerism and health, Mr. Liu's two-part exhibition, "Condition," consists of working air purifiers stacked floor-to-ceiling in one room and pink rubberized parts of exercise machines in another. Both, as the punning title hints, have to do with conditioning. In "Starbong," Mr. deFazio offers amusing ceramic bongs based on kitsch souvenirs, including a silvery "JFK Bong," a colorful "Madonna Boy-Toy Bong" and, in honor of the Pope, a "Papal Peace Pipe" (Johnson).

BUZZ SPECTOR, "All the Books in My Library . . . ," Cristinerose, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-0297 (through Oct. 27). An artist known for making art out of and about books presents witty, large-format Polaroid pictures of items from his collection. "Freeze Freud" has the complete works of the psychoanalyst frozen in blocks of ice. "(All the Books in My Library) By or About Christian Boltanksi" is just that -- a picture of 18 volumes with the spines turned away. In "My Fiction," a large six-panel piece, the artist presents himself shirtless surrounded by stacks of modern literature (Johnson).

Other Galleries

ZARINA BHIMJI, Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096 (through Oct. 27). This show brings a double debut: the inauguration of Talwar Gallery and the first New York solo appearance of the African-born, London-based artist Ms. Bhimji, seen here previously in museum group shows. She offers an idea-rich multimedia photographic installation that touches on different kinds of gardens -- English parks, slave plantations, paradise -- and adds enigmatically sensual abstract images that tie their meanings and histories together. As a bonus, the pictures are gorgeous (Cotter).

"SHIFTING TIDES: CUBAN PHOTOGRAPHY AFTER THE REVOLUTION," Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through Oct. 27). This show begins in the 1970's with revolution-era Cuban photography in a documentary mode and then rapidly brings the picture into the present with young artists today. Conceptually grounded, often multimedia in format and obliquely critical, focused on personal perception rather than historical events, their work is too varied to be tagged by a look or a style. It ranges from the elegiac photomontages of Rogelio Lopez Marin, known as Gory, to the ritualistic tableaus of Marta Maria Perez Bravo to a sardonic take on epic photography by Manuel Pina in the series "Manipulation, Truths and Other Illusions." The title could easily be applied to the show as a whole (Cotter).

Last Chance

"ARTIST IN THE MARKETPLACE 21," Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000 (through Sunday). The 12-week Artist in the Marketplace seminar, which provides young and emerging artists with practical career guidance, ends with an exhibition of the graduates' work. The 21st such show, with work by this year's 36 graduates, is an uneven but diverting hodgepodge of painting, sculpture and electronic arts. Most of the work is high concept: Jennifer Zackin's mandala made of little toy cowboys; Carol Shadford's photographs made by a flying camera attached to a Nerf ball; before-and-after photographs of hairy and shaved men's torsos by Franziska Lamprecht. More beguilingly mysterious are Scott Teplin's oddball, finely drawn cartoons and Hiroshi Kimura's simple, tenderly painted pictures of people departing each other. Hours: Wednesdays, noon to 9 p.m.; Thursdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $3; $2, students and 65+ (Johnson).

"MARC CHAGALL: EARLY WORKS FROM RUSSIAN COLLECTIONS," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Sunday). When Chagall returned to Russia in 1914 after four years in Paris, he intended to marry his beloved fiancee, Bella Rosenfeld, and hurry back to the French capital. Instead, World War I and the Russian Revolution kept him in his homeland for eight years, during which he did some of his greatest work. The 60 artworks here, most being exhibited in the West for the first time, form a series of intense Chagallian doses rather than a comprehensive overview. They are accompanied by nine paintings by Chagall's first teacher, the sensitive realist Yehuda Pen. The show culminates in the seven large, deliriously inventive murals Chagall made for the Jewish State Chamber Theater in Moscow during three feverish months in 1920. Hours: Today, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m; Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students and 65+ ($2 surcharge for "Chagall") (Smith).

TONY CRAGG, "Turbo-Ferryman," Doris C. Freedman Plaza, Fifth Avenue and 60th Street, (212) 980-4575 (through Sunday). This year's Public Art Fund installation here consists of two bulbous bronze sculptures by a consistently interesting British sculptor. One is a perforated, biomorphic bottlelike form with wiggly arms going in and out of its body; the other is a big, asymmetrical shape, like a toy top with odd lumpy places (Johnson).

* PHILIP-LORCA DiCORCIA, PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 421-3292 (through tomorrow). Pace's airy new gallery opens with this spectacular show by Mr. DiCorcia, whose strobe lights placed at street corners have made strangers into actors, their mundane gestures given a sudden, Baroque gravity. For these pictures a strobe affixed to scaffolding in Times Square produced stark portraits picked out of murky blackness: just heads on poster-size prints, 48 by 60 inches each, high-resolution digital scans. The strobe functions like the light of revelation, a high-beam from heaven, although the longer we stare at these people the more extraordinarily impenetrable they seem. Enlarged and isolated, their expressions become riddles, intensely melodramatic and strangely touching, reminders that we are each our own little universe of secrets (Kimmelman).

BURGOYNE DILLER, Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105 (through tomorrow). A leader in the American cause for pure abstraction in the 1930's and 40's, Diller continued to pursue the possibilities of Mondrianesque composition into the 1960's. (He died in 1965.) The small drawings and collages from 1960-63 in this modest exhibition -- all variations on arrangements of squares and rectangles in graphite and primary colors -- have a delicacy of touch that brings to life an otherwise arid formalism (Johnson).

"PRECIOUS POSSESSIONS: TREASURES FROM THE LIBRARY OF THE JEWISH THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY," Jewish Theological Seminary, 3080 Broadway, at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 678-8082 (through Thursday). These 90 or so charismatic entries date from the 11th to the 20th centuries and come from all over the world. Almost every item has a story to tell or a name to drop. Want to see Maimonides's signature? Sigmund Freud's bookplate? A handwritten score by Leonard Bernstein? They're here. So are some spectacular illuminated manuscripts, minute and colossal, and objects that carry the warmth of ordinary life: marriage contracts, postcards and a 13th-century letter from a man in India to his wife in Egypt, assuring her of his unbroken devotion. Hours: Today, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Sunday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Cotter).

* CHRISTINA RAMBERG, Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338 (through tomorrow). Influenced by Surrealism, comic books and Japanese printmaking, Ramberg, a Chicago Imagist who died in 1995, painted cartoon icons focusing on fetishistic objects like hair, underwear and red-lacquered fingernails. "Probed Cinch" (1971) shows a woman's back with another woman's hand inserting an index finger under the top edge of a tight black corset. Thirty years later, Ramberg's sinister eroticism is still funny and mysterious (Johnson).

* KARA WALKER, "American Primitive," Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262 (through tomorrow). For the first time, Ms. Walker's black-paper cutout silhouettes play out their searing slapstick of sex and violence in settings of a commensurate, if more purely formal, complexity. In the first gallery simple opaque projectors create hallucinatory landscapes that incorporate the viewer's shadow; in the second, the silhouettes inhabit small paintings-on-paper that evoke Goya and the Grimm Brothers. Their visionary flares and flashes of color reflect a control of materials new to Ms. Walker's work, as are typewritten texts that give her meditations an even sharper, more personal specificity (Smith).

HEADLINE: Bouncing Back Off Broadway 

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
FOR nearly a decade "Blue Man Group" has been regularly selling out the 299-seat Astor Place Theater, exposing hundreds of thousands of audience members to the simple joys of exploding Jell-O, abstract art and fractal geometry. Waiting lines before the show are common, as are fans lingering after for blue kisses from those blue lips.
 All of that changed, however, on Sept. 11, when performers across New York City suddenly found themselves looking at hundreds of empty seats. 
 "It was very eerie," said Michael Cates, who has been a Blue Man for four years. "It wasn't a little undersold. It was empty." 
They were not alone in being alone. Small crowds were the norm for several weeks for three of Off Broadway's longest-running commercial hits, all playing within a few blocks of one another downtown: "Blue Man"; "Stomp," the polyrhythmic ensemble show at the Orpheum on Second Avenue; and "De La Guarda," the Argentine aerial spectacle at the Daryl Roth Theater on Union Square. 
All high-energy, textless performances that require no English -- or any other language for that matter -- to enjoy, these three shows are anomalies in the downtown theater scene, as reliant on tourists as any production on Broadway. And while uptown shows faced their own challenges, including four Broadway closings and continued weak advance sales, these Off Broadway mainstays were also reeling, canceling performances, editing out potentially touchy material and sometimes losing tens of thousands of dollars a day.
At "Blue Man Group" producers canceled three performances -- only the second time the Blue Men didn't go on. (A 1996 blizzard was the first.) The show's creators estimated their losses from New York and their three other national productions to be more than $1 million. 
The producers of "De La Guarda," meanwhile, also lost several shows after the Sept. 11 attack and had to slim their roster of performers under contract to 12 from 14 and their schedule to six shows a week from eight. (In a sign of recovery the show will play seven this week and return to an eight-show week beginning Oct. 23.)
At "Stomp," in which performers bang on floors, trash cans and almost everything else in sight, the cast was faced with a skittish audience and the challenge of banging, well, quietly. 
"You could see it in their eyes," said Taro Alexander, one of the "Stomp" performers, of the audience on Sept. 14, his first night back. "They didn't really want a lot of loud noises. And we really didn't want to make them."
There were also practical problems with less-than-full houses. The "Blue Man" finale, for example, involves hundreds of feet of paper being unrolled and passed from the back of the theater toward the stage.
"The paper all comes down on the back row," said Matt Goldman, one of the show's creators. "So if no one's sitting in those seats, it just piles up." 
The shows do have some advantages over Broadway of course. With nonunion stagehands -- Off Broadway is not covered by Broadway labor agreements -- running costs are significantly lower than at larger uptown theaters. All three of these productions have long ago recouped their initial investment and, especially in the case of "Stomp" and "Blue Man," they have become solid moneymakers both in New York and on the road.
By last weekend producers for all three shows were cautiously predicting a return to some sense of normality. Ticket sales were up, and most weekend performances sold out. Yet all three shows were also taking steps to ensure that their role as the economic engines of Off Broadway -- providing hundreds of steady jobs -- was not in jeopardy.
Perhaps the most aggressive approach is under way at Blue Man Productions, the company that oversees not only the New York show but current runs in Boston, Chicago and Las Vegas. The company employs nearly 500 full- and part-time people nationwide.
The show, which opened in November 1991, has rarely advertised on television in New York, relying instead on word of mouth, print ads and an enormous following in the overseas press, which can't seem to get enough of the three cobalt-blue men and their devotion to the theater of the extremely messy. (One early portion of the show asks audience members to yell as they read fourgiant laminated posters; the posters are in English, Portuguese, Japanese and Hebrew.)
"We're better known in Sao Paulo than in Manhattan," said Chris Wink, a creator and original member of "Blue Man Group." "We go to the local Starbucks down the street, and they don't know who we are."
That's about to change. The producers have bought large chunks of advertising time on local cable channels and plan to concentrate on bringing in so-called "drive audiences," suburbanites who drive to the theater. Inside Manhattan other promotional efforts are under way, including a planned appearance at a Knicks game and student ticket promotions.
There have also been adjustments onstage at the Astor Place Theater. 
During the pre-show, the audience reads a series of wiseacre messages from an LED display. Since the attack, however, two messages have been cut. 
One designated an audience member picked at random as a flight attendant for the audience and asked her to point out the theater's emergency exits. Another asked an audience member to sing "The Star Spangled Banner," then flashed another message reading, "Just kidding," when the person began to sing.
"In light of all that's going on, we didn't want to joke around with that," Mr. Goldman said.
Mr. Goldman, Mr. Wink and their Blue partner, Phil Stanton, said the current turmoil harked back to the show's early days at La Mama E.T.C. in the East Village, where the show had early performances before moving to Off Broadway. 
"We were onstage when the Gulf War started," Mr. Goldman said, "so there's a certain unfortunate deja vu."
Mr. Wink said such an outside crisis adds something to the onstage atmosphere.
"Our show doesn't really live in time and space," he said. "It's a different world. When you come into the Blue Man world, you're leaving the real world behind. And I think right now a lot of people want to do that."
The audience on Sunday afternoon, a sellout, seemed to agree, happily dodging catapulted Jell-O molds and other gooey projectiles. The only time the audience seemed slightly jarred was when a video display showed an image -- two parallel black lines against a yellow backdrop -- that for an instant seemed to suggest the twin towers. (It's not; it's an abstract depiction of an electrical outlet.)
Despite such unintentional reminders, the Blue Man producers said current events had added a new charge to the show's mission. 
"I think we all have an idiotic, naive belief in the transcendent power of theater and community," Mr. Goldman said. "We've always kind of seen the Blue Men as shamanic medicine people. And I think right now we can actually give audiences something that's intrinsic to the community, which we do in part by just letting people know we're still here."
"Our response has been, Don't cut back," he said. "Ring the bell instead."
"De La Guarda," meanwhile, which opened in 1998, had its worst weeks ever after the attack.
"The first week was very sparse," said Jeffrey Seller, one of the show's producers, who said the first week's losses were more than $50,000.
The show's weekly running cost, about $90,000, is high for a nonunion Off Broadway show. (Because the performers aren't technically acting -- they're flying -- they are not represented by Actors' Equity.) Some of that expense was cut by a variety of concessions: the creators waived their royalties, and the landlord slashed the rent. 
Other costs aren't negotiable. Like "Blue Man," "De La Guarda" requires a large behind-the-scenes crew to make the show go, including three Alpine-style climbers who control the ropes and the motors that allow people to fly. There are also lesser costs, like a battalion of part-time balloon blowers, who come to the theater to inflate the show's daily ration of 550 balloons.
In the aftermath, part of the challenge, Mr. Seller said, was the show's location, just across the street from Union Square, which has been a de facto memorial, complete with candles, posters of the missing and streetside debate, since the attacks. 
"The environment was very somber," Mr. Seller said. "And this show has more to do with youth and wanting to get out. And I think it was difficult for a while for people to continue to want to do so."
That sentiment was echoed at "Stomp," which played to about a third of its potential audience in the early days after the attacks. Again, the show's location -- on Second Avenue at Eighth Street -- was a deterrent.
"Nobody wanted to go there for a while," said Richard Frankel, one of the show's producers. "The whole atmosphere down there was intense for a while. There was dust in the air. The smell of smoke was much more intense. And no one could go south of 14th Street without an ID."
While audiences have started to come back -- the show is currently only about 20 percent off its normal sales, Mr. Frankel said -- producers are still planning to start a variety of new promotions, including ads in community newspapers in the city and a ticket contest at 12 shopping malls in suburban New Jersey. 
" 'Stomp' usually does very little advertising," Mr. Frankel said. "This definitely made us start to work harder."
Onstage, too, there were challenges. Mr. Alexander, a "Stomp" cast member for three years, said he had never entered the show's dressing room without wanting to get onstage. His character, Mozzie, is the show's comic relief, a diminutive, slightly clumsy foil to other perfectly rhythmic characters.
On Sept. 14, his first day back, things were different.
"It felt very strange to be at the theater," he said. "There's a lot of comedy in the show, a lot of comic parts, and I didn't want to be humorous at all. I didn't want to be silly or goofy. I just didn't feel it."
The entire cast, he said, felt similarly. Then just moments before the curtain, someone began drumming in the dressing room. And things changed. 
"We're just all sitting around, and we hear this sound," he said. "And someone said, 'Let's go out there and play some music.' "

HEADLINE: Amazon Populist's Killing Exposes Bitter Conflicts 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: ALTAMIRA, Brazil, Oct. 5 

 BODY:
A lot of people here wanted Ademir Federicci dead, and some of them did not hesitate to say so. But up and down the length of the Trans-Amazon Highway, the question being asked is this: who actually killed Mr. Federicci, the region's most outspoken labor, peasant and environmental leader?
 Perhaps not since the murder of Chico Mendes, the rubber tappers' advocate, in 1988, has a single death caused such an uproar in the Amazon. One of seven leaders of regional labor, religious or environmental groups to have been killed since July, Mr. Federicci was the director of the Movement for the Development of the Trans-Amazon and the Xingu when he was shot here in August, in front of his wife and four children. 
 According to his associates, Mr. Federicci, 42, had been in fear of his life ever since a wealthy logger here told him about 18 months ago that it was time for him to "buy some wood" for his own coffin. That threat came after Mr. Federicci reported to the Federal Police that the logger was illegally chopping down trees on an Indian reservation. 
The official version of Mr. Federicci's death is that he was killed during a home invasion, after catching a thief trying to steal his television at 1:30 a.m. But his widow, Maria da Penha Feu Federicci, 34, vehemently disputes that account.
"The killers didn't even touch the television," she said, "but went straight into our bedroom, and when I screamed that someone had come in, Dema awoke, struggled with the intruder and was shot by someone standing outside the window. No, everything leads me to believe this was a contract killing, and I want the real killer to be found."
Mr. Federicci, known here as Dema, had in addition tangled with a gang of hijackers and car thieves operating on the Trans-Amazon Highway and was leading the opposition to a dam project the Brazilian government wants to build here. More recently, he also denounced corruption in the Superintendency for the Development of the Amazon, or Sudam, a government agency set up to channel money to worthy construction projects but which has often favored wealthy ranching, logging and mining interests.
For many years, Sudam was controlled by Jader Barbalho, who was the governor of the state of Para and its senator. The agency was abolished earlier this year; after a wave of news reports indicating that he had built a personal fortune of more than $10 million on fraudulent dealings with Sudam, Mr. Barbalho was forced to resign this month.
At first glance, Mr. Federicci might have seemed an unlikely candidate to challenge the establishment. Born in the southern state of Parana, he moved to the Amazon with his family in the early 1970's, drawn by the government's promise of "land without men for men without land," settling on a farm just off the new highway in Medicilandia, 80 miles west of here.
As an adult, he continued to cling to the land, growing cocoa and coffee on a 125-acre lot on which he had built his own house. But his eloquence and charisma gradually propelled him to the top of the regional peasant movement, and in July, a month before his death, his family moved here to be closer to the center of what he called "the struggle."
Speaking of her husband, Mrs. Federicci said: "I have never known a person with more of a knack for understanding complicated things and explaining them in a simple fashion. He was a fighter for the forest and for the rights of the ordinary people in this region, and God knows there is plenty to fight about."
After a two year respite, largely the result of a national economic crisis, the destruction of the Amazon seems to be heading back toward the record levels of the mid-1990's. The current dry season, which will end in about a month, has been one of the most parched on record. This has made it easier for ranchers and loggers to burn or fell large areas of forest for their businesses.
This ramshackle town of 77,000 people is at the junction of the Xingu River and the Trans-Amazon Highway, an agricultural frontier region in which conflicts over land are common and often violent. "It's the Wild West around here," said Marcio Araujo, an official of the Human Rights Commission of the Brazilian Congress, which sent a delegation here this week.
The main headline in the weekly local paper, for instance, announces that in Itaituba, west of here on the Trans-Amazon Highway, "the mayor has threatened six aldermen with death." Out in the countryside, most settlers are armed with pistols or rifles, and not just to hunt game.
Even those disposed to settling such disputes by legal means find it hard to do so here. Altamira is the seat of the largest municipality in Brazil, but it is currently without judges, who tend to demand transfers just as soon as they receive their first death threat, and it has no permanent resident prosecutor to handle a growing backlog of cases.
After the killing, local authorities, who are allied with Mr. Barbalho and other powerful business interests, quickly arrested a petty thief who had been seen hanging around Mr. Federicci's office the day before his death. That enabled a special investigator sent from the state capital, 460 miles away, to pronounce the case closed and return home.
"Imagine, in less than 48 hours, working without proper forensic equipment and on the basis of just a couple of interviews, they managed to solve this crime," Bruno Kempner, Mr. Federicci's successor as coordinator of the development group, said. "That has got to be some kind of a record for Brazil."
Efforts by Mr. Federicci's associates to get the case reopened and to be allowed to present new evidence have thus far failed. But the case has caught the attention of human rights groups and opposition political parties, who are threatening to make it a cause celebre.
"I have profound doubts that Dema's death occurred the way it is presented in the official documents," Nelson Pellegrino, chairman of the Human Rights Commission of the lower house of the Brazilian Congress, said in a hearing here. He said he would urge the Justice Ministry "to bring in the Federal Police to assure that we can have a satisfactory investigation of this case."
As the uncertainty over his death lingers, Mr. Federicci is quickly becoming a martyr to the environmental cause. A poster circulating in the region shows him, microphone in hand, asking, "Why must capitalist power sink its claws here into this wonder of nature?" and bumper stickers with the phrase "Dema, your life continues in our struggle" are also being distributed.
But a death list with 25 names on it, all of them opponents of local business interests, is also circulating. Jose Geraldo Torres, a member of the Workers Party who represents this area in the Para State Legislature, said he had received several death threats recently, including one relayed from a prominent logger with whom he had been at odds.
"He was traveling on a plane with a friend of mine," Mr. Torres recalled, "and in front of all the passengers, he said, 'You tell Jose Geraldo that if my land title gets canceled, I will cancel him.' "

PERSON: Roberto Campos 

HEADLINE: Roberto Campos, 84, Apostle For the Free Market in Brazil 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Roberto Campos, one of the most prominent figures in Brazilian economic, intellectual and political life, died of a heart attack at his apartment here late Tuesday. He was 84.
 In a long career, Mr. Campos was a diplomat, cabinet minister, senator, congressman and bank president, displaying a combination of wit and erudition that impressed even his many opponents. But for better or worse, he is likely to be most remembered as Brazil's leading "apostle of the free market," as the Jornal do Brasil here described him today. 
 A pragmatist, Mr. Campos worked in governments of every ideological stripe, always fighting for to put his beliefs into practice. He was a principal architect of the "Brazilian Miracle" of the 1970's, which transformed a country dependent on exports of coffee, sugar and cocoa into a rising industrial power with the world's eighth largest economy.
Roberto de Oliveira Campos was born on April 17, 1917, in Mato Grosso, the Amazon state, the son of a teacher and a seamstress. As a teenager, he enrolled in a Roman Catholic seminary, where he excelled in philosophy and theology before leaving to become a teacher in a small town in Sao Paulo State. "All the better," he later said. "I wouldn't have made a good priest because I was too much an intellectual rebel." 
At 22, Mr. Campos joined the diplomatic service and was soon sent to the United States, where he worked for most of the 40's. He studied economics at Columbia and George Washington Universities and was in the Brazilian delegation to the conferences that created the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs.
In the 50's, he was an economic adviser to Presidents Getulio Vargas and Juscelino Kubitschek. He helped organize the state oil company, Petrobras, and the government-run National Bank for Economic Development, which he led in 1958 and 1959.
In 1961, Mr. Campos was named ambassador to the United States, a position he held until 1964, when his lament that he was a "herald without a voice" serving a left-wing government with which he disagreed was finally heeded by President Joao Goulart. Under the right-wing military government that followed, he was envoy to Britain for nearly seven years, beginning in 1975.
In the intervening decade, Mr. Campos held a variety of economic policy-making posts. As minister of planning and economic coordination in the first three years of the dictatorship, he helped create the Central Bank, reform the tax system and organize a workers' benefits system and a national housing bank.
He is survived by his wife, Stella; three children; and five grandchildren. 
Mr. Campos's unwavering commitment to free market principles and his conviction that Brazil's lack of development stemmed not from "imperialism" but its own policy errors made him a favorite target of the left for decades. In a sarcastic reference to his pro-American sympathies, he was often referred to as "Bob Fields," the literal English translation of his name. 
But Mr. Campos always seemed to relish the debate, responding with speeches and newspaper articles full of aphorisms that quickly passed into political folklore. "If God were a socialist, he would have made all men alike," he once said. "But God is not a socialist."
In an article in the 70's, he formulated a fanciful series of "laws" intended to help explain Brazil. "Logic, having been invented by the Greeks in the Northern Hemisphere, does not apply south of the Equator," was a maxim that is still frequently cited, along with, "It is less important to find solutions than scapegoats."
At 63, Mr. Campos embarked belatedly on a political career. He was a senator and more recently a member of the lower house of Congress, .until he was defeated in 1998 in an attempt to return to the Senate. "What a relief," he said then. "I don't have to go to Brasilia anymore."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE EXCHANGE; 
Feeling Vulnerable At Heart of Wall St.

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
The New York Stock Exchange is no stranger to trouble.
 Over its 209-year history, the Big Board has weathered a civil war, two world wars, the Depression, and even a bombing in 1920 to become the world's largest and most prestigious stock market. 
 But after Sept. 11, the exchange confronted a threat unlike any it had faced before. The Big Board's headquarters and computer systems survived the destruction of the World Trade Center unscathed, but the attacks shut the exchange by crippling the financial district's communications network.
The exchange reopened only six days later, thanks to the determined leadership of Richard A. Grasso, its chairman, and a herculean effort to repair the communications grid. But the attacks exposed the Big Board's vulnerability to terrorism. With a single physical floor where traders meet to negotiate stock prices, the exchange can be disrupted more easily than computer-based markets like Nasdaq. And the Big Board's columned facade is one of capitalism's best-known symbols. 
Now Mr. Grasso must figure out how to make the Big Board less vulnerable, even as the exchange faces growing competition from Nasdaq and other new trading systems. Already, the exchange says that it may postpone building a long-planned new trading floor and 900-foot tower across the street from its current headquarters. In addition, the Big Board is considering building a secondary trading site outside Lower Manhattan, a plan that could cost tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars.
The health of the Big Board is crucial not just for its members, but for all of New York, said Charles R. Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan College and author of "Wall Street: A History" (Oxford University Press, 1997). Over the last two centuries, the exchange has become "inextricably intertwined into New York's economy," Mr. Geisst said.
Mr. Grasso, who never wavered in his resolution to reopen the market as quickly as possible after the attacks, said on Wednesday that the exchange planned to remain a vital part of New York, with its primary trading floor in Lower Manhattan. The exchange could even become part of a broad redevelopment plan including the rebuilt Trade Center site.
To limit disruption in case of future attacks, the exchange will rely on a combination of contingency measures, he said. The most important of those will probably be a second trading floor. The backup site would be on a different power and communications grid than the exchange's main floor, although it might still be in New York City. Most trading would remain at the Big Board's headquarters, but some stocks would trade full-time at the backup site.
Contingency plans might also include agreements to move trading in Big Board stocks to exchanges in Toronto or Chicago. Even the trading floors of major securities firms might work as substitute sites, Mr. Grasso said.
"We are absolutely committed to New York," he said.
But some academics and competitors said Mr. Grasso should rethink his plans. Even before Sept. 11, the exchange's physical floor faced criticism within the industry as an anachronism that benefited the Big Board's members at the expense of other traders and investors.
Instead of building a second floor, said Ananth Madhavan, managing director of ITG, which operates a computerized trading system that competes with the Big Board, the stock exchange should follow the lead of foreign competitors and move trading to an electronic network that would be essentially impervious to physical attack.
"If you were going to reinvent the N.Y.S.E. itself, you would not start with a floor," said Mr. Madhavan, who in 1993 served for a year as a visiting economist at the exchange. "You would do it electronically. The floor is sort of a historical accident."
By moving to a fully electronic network, the exchange would increase the speed of trades and give more investors access to information that now belongs to a privileged few, Mr. Madhavan said. On an average day, more shares are traded on the Nasdaq stock market, which exists only on computer systems and the screens of its dealers, than on the Big Board.
David Colker, chief executive of the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, an all-electronic market that competes with the N.Y.S.E., said physical trading floors are inherently slower and more expensive than electronic markets. With faster computers and data transmission, traders no longer have to meet in person to buy and sell shares, he said.
"With or without this event, our belief is that the world is going electronic."
Mr. Grasso strongly disagrees, and in the last year he has quieted other critics of the exchange. The Big Board already uses computers to process smaller orders, which represent about half of all the shares traded on the exchange. But large orders require human intervention to ensure that they do not cause wild swings in prices, Mr. Grasso said.
"A blending of human and technology in terms of providing services to customers, that's what this is about," he said in an interview last month. "Our model works. No alternative model works."
Investors and companies have voted for the Big Board's structure with their dollars, Mr. Grasso argues. Of the 25 most highly valued companies in the United States, 22 are listed on the exchange. Over the last decade, the Big Board has also become the premier address for international companies that want to sell shares directly to American investors. Nine of the 10 most valued European companies are traded on the Big Board in addition to their home exchanges.
Last year, the Big Board faced pressure to make it easier for other electronic networks and markets to trade its stocks. At a February 2000 hearing of the Senate Banking Committee, the chairmen of Goldman, Sachs and other major securities firms argued that the Securities and Exchange Commission should force the Big Board to give competitors a better chance to trade its stocks.
But Mr. Grasso argued that the commission should proceed carefully, and momentum for radical changes ebbed. Only seven months later, Goldman bought Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, which handles more trading on the Big Board than any other firm, for $7.4 billion.
Now Goldman executives say they are happy with the exchange's current structure. Any backup to the Big Board's current trading floor should be a physical site, not a computer simulation, said Andrew Cader, a managing director at Goldman who is co-chief executive of Spear, Leeds.
Joseph Dellarosa, head of equity trading for Goldman, Sachs, said that the increased threat of terrorism had not taken away the basic strengths of the exchange. "You can talk about a perfect marketplace, but it's hard to fashion one in the real world, and the reality is the markets operate quite well," Mr. Dellarosa said.
Traders on the exchange floor have an advantage over those outside the exchange, because they can see more quickly than anyone else whether stocks are under buying or selling pressure, Mr. Madhavan said. That information is valuable, and if the exchange switched to a simulated floor it would face pressure to give all traders the same access.
"Outside the United States, floors are disappearing really quickly, and automated auctions are the wave of the future," Mr. Madhavan said. "The United States is the lone holdout, and it's the holdout because it has a strong group of dealers who are politically connected."
But Mr. Madhavan said the exchange had adapted to challenges before and would remain strong in the future, whether as a traditional exchange or an electronic network. The Big Board "is a pretty robust organization," he said. "It has survived a long time for good reason."

HEADLINE: Unemployment Claims Post a Sharp Increase 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
The average number of workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose over the last four weeks to the highest in almost a decade as job losses increased after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the government reported today.
 Average claims totaled 463,000, the most since December 1991, up from 455,000 at the end of September, the Labor Department said. 
 While figures for last week show claims fell, a department spokeswoman said the decline probably reflected a quirk in seasonal adjustments. Unadjusted claims rose 26,130. 
The four-week moving average includes a surge in claims to a nine-year high of 535,000 in the week ended Sept. 29. Those numbers included almost 11,000 new claims in New York and Virginia related to the destruction of the World Trade Center towers and the shutdown of Ronald Reagan National Airport.
Layoffs as far away as Hawaii were attributed to the disaster.
"The outlook is even uglier given the record amount of layoffs announced at airlines and technology companies," said Tim Rogers, chief economist at Briefing.com in Boston.
A separate Labor Department report showed that prices of imported goods rose unexpectedly in September, but it did not capture a drop in oil costs since the attacks. The 0.3 percent increase last month in the import price index reflects a price survey taken early in the month.
The import price index declined 0.2 percent in August, more than previously estimated. The index excluding petroleum was unchanged last month after a 0.4 percent decrease in August, suggesting little threat from inflation.
Initial jobless claims fell by 67,000, to a level of 468,000, in the week that ended Oct. 7, the numbers showed. The department typically adjusts for a rise in claims with the start of each new quarter, when benefits may increase. This time the weekly rise was smaller than typical, in part because claims had already surged a week earlier.

HEADLINE: Sotheby's And Christie's Plan Layoffs Worldwide 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Bracing for a period of unpredictable sales and revenue, Sotheby's and Christie's announced significant layoffs in their worldwide staffs this week.
 The reason for the cutbacks, officials at the world's largest auction houses said, has more to do with profitability in the current economic downturn, although the cost of the Justice Department investigation into price-fixing between the two companies and the coming antitrust trial for Sotheby's former chairman have clearly hurt their bottom lines. 
 Sotheby's, which began reducing its work force at the end of last year, announced yesterday that it would eliminate about 147 additional positions worldwide. When the cuts, which will total 350 to 400 jobs by the end of the year, are completed its staff will have been reduced by 14 percent. The layoffs will cost the company about $13 million in severance pay and other charges. 
William Ruprecht, Sotheby's chief executive, said the reductions would take place in every part of the business. "There's no area that's not being impacted," he said. "But it's not hurting us competitively in this marketplace." Mr. Ruprecht said the overhaul would reduce costs by about $50 million a year. 
Christie's, which is privately held, had an all-staff meeting on Tuesday to announce the elimination of 21 positions in the United States, which is less than 3 percent of its staff in Christie's Americas. 
Layoffs are also expected at its headquarters on King Street in the St. James area of London and at its lower-priced arm in the South Kensington area of London. No figures have been announced for the London cuts. Christie's has been reducing the size of its staff through attrition for months.
"This was part of a review process that began in the beginning of the year," said Andree Corroon, a spokeswoman for the company. "It's all about increasing efficiency and profitability."
Several employees at Christie's who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they thought this was just the first in what would be a round of layoffs within the company over the next several months. 
Both auction houses are also reducing the size of many of their regional offices. In August, Sotheby's announced that it would no longer hold auctions in Chicago. It is expected that Christie's will shrink many of its worldwide regional offices, too, including Los Angeles, although the company declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Juniper Posts Loss but Exceeds Wall St. Forecast 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
Juniper Networks, the maker of networking equipment, said today that it posted a loss for its fiscal third quarter, but the company exceeded Wall Street's expectations after excluding several extraordinary charges. 
 Shares of Juniper soared after the report, which came out after regular trading. The shares jumped $4.04, to $20.68, after gaining $1.64 before the announcement. 
 Juniper, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said it lost $29.7 million, or 9 cents a share, during the quarter ended Sept. 30. The company, a competitor to Cisco Systems in the Internet router market, earned $58.1 million, or 17 cents a share, during the period last year. 
Revenue for the quarter was $201.7 million, half a million dollars more than the same period last year. Scott Kriens, the chief executive, said he expected about the same revenue for the current quarter. 
After removing $78.9 million for items like investment write-downs and a charge to contract manufacturers, Juniper reported a profit of $32.5 million, or 10 cents a share, a penny more than the company had predicted.
Analysts had expected earnings, excluding the special charges, of 7 cents a share on sales of $188 million, according to a consensus survey by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Networking providers have been hurt badly by the economic downturn, as major customers in the telecommunications business have tightened their purse strings. Qwest Communications, WorldCom and Ericsson each provided more than 10 percent of Juniper's business during the quarter. 
With the market in the United States struggling, Juniper turned overseas for business. Thirty-four percent of its revenue came from international customers, compared with 28 percent during the second quarter. 
"We're large enough to weather the storms, and we're also agile enough to maneuver around the worst of it," Mr. Kriens said. 
Paul Johnson, a senior technology analyst with Robertson Stephens, praised Juniper for its clean balance sheet and said it had fared remarkably well given the economic challenges. He said that Juniper reported a 20 percent operating margin, while Cisco, a larger company with a decade more experience, was struggling to break even.
"This looks a lot like the Cisco of the 90's," Mr. Johnson said of Juniper, "which is why I think so many people are interested in this company."
With its stock trading at a fraction of its 52-week high of $244.50, Juniper said today that its board had approved spending as much as $200 million to buy back shares during the next two years.

HEADLINE: L.I. School Board Is Ordered To Reinstate Superintendent 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The New York State education commissioner yesterday ordered the Board of Education in Roosevelt to reinstate the school district superintendent, hours after the board's president ordered the superintendent to vacate his office. 
 The confrontation was an escalation of an already dire situation in the Roosevelt Union Free School District on Long Island, which has has been under state oversight for six years because it has one of the worst academic records in New York as well as perennial financial problems. 
 By 3:30 p.m. yesterday, the superintendent, Horace Williams, was escorted by state education officials back to the district offices. Upon his return, Mr. Williams was greeted with "hallelujahs and cheers," a Roosevelt staff member said. 
The state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, last week told the State Board of Regents that the district was "very rapidly approaching a financial crisis" that would "make it impossible for Roosevelt to maintain even a minimally acceptable program."
The district is facing a $6 million shortfall in its $39 million budget this year, and a state panel is considering whether to impose cuts in January that could include the elimination of kindergarten classes and as many as 50 teaching jobs.
Two groups of Education Department officials visited the Roosevelt School District earlier this week, one to examine the condition of Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School, which the department had been told was in serious disrepair, and another to review the district's finances.
Though the Roosevelt school board approved a three-year contract for Mr. Williams in June, it has also tangled with him over the state's efforts to bring the district's finances into line. 
Over the summer, Roosevelt residents voted against two proposed school budgets, forcing the district to adopt a contingency budget. To meet the budget, Mr. Williams recommended laying off staff and eliminating the district's athletic programs, but those recommendations were rejected by the school board.
At a closed meeting Sunday night, the Roosevelt board voted to strip the superintendent of his duties. It issued a letter saying Mr. Williams "will be reassigned other tasks and responsibilities directed by the board."
After telling Mr. Williams not to report to work this week -- an order he ignored -- the board's president, Darren Connor, ordered him to leave his office yesterday morning, Education Department officials said.
That resulted in Mr. Mills's order, which said the board's vote violated Mr. Williams's contract and was taken at a meeting that violated state education law because sufficient public notice had not been given.
No one answered the telephone at the school district's headquarters yesterday. A lawyer representing the Roosevelt school board did not return a phone call seeking comment.
Animosity between the Education Department and the Roosevelt school board has festered for six years. In 1995, the Legislature approved a bill authorizing the Education Department to intervene in the district's affairs; the department removed the Board of Education members in place at the time. 
In the spring of 2000, Mr. Mills told the district that it had one more year to clean up its fiscal and academic problems or it would be taken over by the state. Though the district recorded some academic progress last year, its financial problems have continued. 
Mr. Mills told the Board of Regents last week that the district was in grave danger if the Legislature did not address the situation. A bill that could allow the state to take direct control of the district was introduced in the Legislature this spring; it passed in the Senate but was held up in the Assembly.

HEADLINE: NBC Is Paying $1.98 Billion For Telemundo 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
Acknowledging the importance of the fast-growing Spanish-speaking population in the United States, NBC agreed yesterday to buy the Telemundo Communications Group, the nation's second-largest Spanish-language broadcaster, for $1.98 billion.
 The transaction is the largest acquisition of a foreign-language broadcaster in the United States by one of the major television networks, and demonstrates the pressure on the television industry to expand into new areas at a time when the market for network television is rapidly eroding. 
 The deal also represents a major commitment by NBC's parent, General Electric, to staying in the television business, despite years of speculation that G.E. would put NBC up for sale.
Telemundo, which is controlled by Sony and Liberty Media, owns 10 stations in cities like New York, Los Angeles, Miami and Chicago, and has 40 affiliates, serving a total of 86 American markets. Still, Telemundo lags far behind Univision Communications, the country's largest Spanish-language broadcaster, which draws 80 percent of the market, compared with Telemundo's 20 percent share. 
NBC's decision to buy Telemundo comes at a time when advertising is in a severe slump, a decline made worse by the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. However, NBC is betting that the growth of the Hispanic population in the United States, which has increased by more than 50 percent in the last decade, will help propel Telemundo's growth.
"This is the most dynamic market in the United States," said Robert C. Wright, chairman and chief executive of NBC. "Hispanic buying power is going to double in the next decade."
Telemundo may be best known for its daytime soap operas and talk shows and its roaring soccer commentator, Andres Cantor, who is famous for shouting, "Goooooaaal." (Last year, Telemundo stole Mr. Cantor away from Univision.)
NBC is hoping to extend some of its programming, including news, entertainment and even the Olympics to Telemundo's network, dubbing some programs in Spanish and also creating original Spanish versions. Andrew Lack, NBC's president and chief operating officer, said he expected to produce Spanish-language versions of programs like "Dateline," "Weakest Link" and "Access Hollywood."
A fierce bidding war for Telemundo emerged in the last month as NBC competed with Viacom for control of the company. Viacom, which owns CBS, MTV and the Paramount studio, among other properties, decided against a higher bid because it worried that the price was getting too high, an executive close to Viacom said.
Indeed, even Mr. Wright said he considered the price for Telemundo high. "It would have been a lot cheaper three or four years ago," Mr. Wright said. "But it was even higher six months ago." When the auction first began, Telemundo was hoping to fetch as much as $3 billion, but the price came down as the economy weakened. 
Even at $1.98 billion, Telemundo's biggest investors came away major winners. Sony and Liberty, which each owned about a 35 percent of Telemundo, together paid $539 million in 1997 for the stake.
Under the terms of the deal, NBC will pay $1.98 billion, half in cash and half in G.E. stock, and assume about $700 million in debt. Telemundo was advised by Merrill Lynch and Alpine Capital Group.
Analysts generally applauded the deal as a way to bolster profit without having to diversify outside NBC's core television network business. Mr. Wright said he hoped to achieve savings by combining some back-office broadcasting operations in cities where there is overlap. He said he expected the deal to produce about $600 million in revenue within two years. Shares of General Electric rose $1.04, to $38.95, yesterday.
NBC is hoping to persuade advertisers that have traditionally bought commercial time on NBC and its cable channels, CNBC and MSNBC, to buy time on Telemundo. Likewise, NBC expects some Telemundo advertisers that have not bought time on NBC to be persuaded to do so if the network creates packaged advertising programs.
The deal may put pressure on Viacom to try to acquire Univision, analysts said. Shares of Univision have risen 12 percent in the last three days on speculation that it may become a takeover target. Yesterday, the shares rose $2.04, to $28.38. 
Analysts said Univision might be pressed to sell simply because it might not have the resources to compete effectively against an NBC-backed Telemundo.
The deal is expected to be cleared by regulators, but NBC may have to sell properties in certain cities. For example, NBC will need approval from the Federal Communications Commission to own Telemundo's Los Angeles station because of its other holdings there. Nationally, NBC's audience reach will remain under 30 percent, which is under the 35 percent cap currently permitted by the government. 
There is another consideration: NBC's top executive freely admits that his Spanish is limited. "It's bad," Mr. Wright said. "But give me time. I'll get better."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ENVOY; 
Architect To a Nation, Post-Taliban

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
The primary role in shaping a future government out of the squabbling factions of the Afghan resistance has been handed to a veteran mediator and United Nations trouble-shooter, Lakhdar Brahimi, diplomats here say.
 A former Algerian foreign minister, Mr. Brahimi was reappointed by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan last week as his special representative to Afghanistan. Mr. Brahimi had served in that role from 1997 to 1999 and formed extensive contacts with various Afghan groups and also with what diplomats here call the "six plus two" -- the six countries neighboring Afghanistan, plus the United States and Russia. 
 Mr. Annan ended Mr. Brahimi's appointment in 1999, saying that "given the lack of progress achieved so far, the special envoy's activities will be 'frozen' until circumstances change to justify his renewed intervention."
Mr. Brahimi has been holding meetings in recent days in Paris and London, and he will arrive in the United States next week.
Diplomats said Mr. Brahimi has a "very strong reputation" because of various special assignments he has undertaken for the United Nations to Zaire, Yemen, Haiti, South Africa, Angola and Afghanistan. He also led the committee that produced a widely praised report last year on United Nations peacekeeping operations that included a proposal for a new unit to gather information and improve planning for peacekeepers.
Diplomats said Mr. Brahimi's appointment was welcomed by the United States and Britain, which is coordinating Security Council actions in the campaign against terrorism. The diplomats said that it was critical that the efforts to shape a post-Taliban regime in Afghanistan not be perceived as an American or Western endeavor, but as an international one, and that those efforts be led by a high-profile Arab Muslim who is not from the Middle East.
Mr. Brahimi's immediate tasks will include managing the refugee crisis touched off by the American bombing raids. His longer-term tasks will include the political and economic reconstruction of Afghanistan.
Before undertaking work for the United Nations, Mr. Brahimi had a long and varied career in Algeria. During the Algerian struggle for independence, he was the representative in Southeast Asia of the National Liberation Front. In subsequent years, he served as diplomatic adviser to the Algerian president, as ambassador to Britain, Egypt and the Arab League, and as under secretary general of the League of Arab States. In that capacity, he mediated the end of the civil war in Lebanon.
In 1992, Mr. Brahimi was a member of the High Security Council, which canceled elections and seized power in Algeria to prevent Islamic militants from coming to power.

HEADLINE: In Hawaii, Public Schools Feel a Long Way From Paradise 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: HONOLULU 

 BODY:
Kalani High School serves some of the more affluent neighborhoods in the United States, including a long strand of gated homes that open on the Pacific in the majestic shadow of Diamond Head.
 But the school has electrical problems so severe that the power sometimes goes off when the bells ring between periods. Termites have eaten away at the cabinets in the chemistry labs, where faucets are caked with rust. And students in some algebra classes must leave their textbooks behind for the next class because there are not enough to go around. 
 "Sometimes," said Noah Sakimura, a 16-year-old junior who dreams of becoming a chemical engineer, "you pinch yourself and say, 'I wish we had the resources.' "
That Kalani is considered one of the better public schools in Hawaii is just one sign of the grave condition of the system at large, the only one in the nation that is entirely state-run. In recent months, the Hawaii public schools have endured a protracted teachers' strike, a teacher shortage, a threat of federal takeover, cuts on school construction and yet another round of low test scores -- all played out on a chain of islands already predisposed toward private education.
An Associated Press analysis of the latest census data, for example, found that nearly one in five children in Hawaii attends private schools, the highest percentage of any state.
The reasons for this lie partly in Hawaii's history. Several elite academies here were founded more than a century ago by missionaries, as well as by other settlers or Hawaiian royalty. One such school, Kamehameha, is open only to descendants of Hawaiian natives and is supported by a private trust worth billions. It educates 4,000 children, or nearly 1 of every 50 in Hawaii, most for under $1,400 a year.
Hawaii's heavy reliance on private schools only complicates the task of educating those who are left out, many of them impoverished immigrants from Korea, China and the Philippines living here on Oahu, the state's most populous island. Administrators say it is difficult to extract excellence from a system that parents and politicians, to say nothing of some teachers, treat as a repository of last resort.
Over the summer, federal officials reported that 45 percent of Hawaii's publicly educated fourth graders, and 48 percent of eighth graders, had scored below the basic threshold on a math exam given to a broad sampling of students in almost every state. Across the country, by contrast, the average scoring below that level was about 33 percent.
"Folks inside the system will point out the huge proportion of kids who are creamed off the top," said Paul LeMahieu, Hawaii's superintendent of schools. "I'm less concerned about the loss of high scores than I am about the loss of political clout and attention."
As students and teachers settled into a new school year in September, they confronted many of the same problems they faced last spring, when the system was crippled by a three-week teachers' strike.
Though the state's teachers ratified a new four-year contract in April, Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano waited five months to execute it. It gives teachers their first raises in nearly three years.
A federal judge, meanwhile, is threatening to take over parts of the 183,000-student system as soon as November, because it is years behind in meeting federal mandates for special-education students.
Making matters worse, the system began the school year needing 140 special-education teachers, only 10 of whom have been hired. Like so much in the Hawaii schools, the shortage has been exacerbated by the state's distance from the mainland.
"To me, Hawaii is like a small Southern town," said Randi Porras-Tang, the principal at Kalani. "We're high-tech, but we're still so isolated. A lot of the state-of-the-art education reforms that are happening in the other states, we're the last to hear about it."
Dr. LeMahieu, among others, argues that the system has been hurt by its unique political structure. The governor and the Legislature set its budget, leaving the elected board of education and its appointed superintendent with few responsibilities. It is the Legislature, for example, that chooses how many teachers to hire and where to assign them.
"When you've got legislators who send their kids to private school, you lose some vested interest," said Joan Lee Husted, executive director of the state teachers' union. "For many politicians, there's an attitude that whatever they do for the public schools will be accepted."
 Governor Cayetano, a public-school graduate whose grown children attended public schools but whose stepchildren do not, defended his record, saying in a statement that he had raised starting teachers' salaries by $10,000 since 1997 and had built more classrooms than his predecessors. With the islands' tourist-fueled economy reeling after the terrorist attacks, he recently asked the Legislature to create jobs by spending $500 million on school and university construction. 
But teachers here say that perhaps the toughest hurdle is a pervasive attitude among parents of public-school students that higher education is not a priority. Most Hawaii public-school graduates go on to community college, at least initially, if they go to college at all.
Those with college aspirations who can afford a private education will usually try to get one. While the Kamehameha school is a bargain for those who qualify, there is also Damien Memorial High School, a Roman Catholic school in a neighborhood of five public housing projects. Almost all its students go to four-year colleges.
The children of the elite usually attend a 160-year-old academy named Punahou, which costs $10,500 a year and is ranked by top colleges alongside Andover and Phillips Exeter.
Dr. LeMahieu, the superintendent, knows he could never compete with such schools. But he hopes nonetheless that attempts to raise up the system in recent years will eventually win back other parents.
Like most states, Hawaii recently adopted standards for what students should know, and it has expanded its special-education program to address the needs of about 13 percent of its children. 
But the most promising seeds of hope have often been sown at the schools themselves.
In the late 1980's, Farrington High, a public school in the same poor neighborhood as Damien, was jolted by a fatal shooting and several stabbings. As recently as five years ago, more than 300 students -- about an eighth of the student body -- reported late for their first-period classes on any given day. Now, after Farrington started locking out tardy students, almost everyone gets to class early.
And though Farrington's spare buildings resemble a prison, they are flourishing, with mini-academies that prepare students for careers in medicine, the travel industry and the arts. The school newspaper took top state honors this year in a competition that included the private schools.
"You say 'Farrington' to people and they drop their voice down low, like 'Oh, no,' " said Kristie Kuewe, 16, a senior who hopes to attend college on the West Coast. "But it feels good to be here."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: STATE FINANCES; 
First Round of Budget Cuts Aren't Enough, States Find

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
As states start to assess the economic damage in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the outlook is dismal and getting worse. 
 State after state, already reeling from the national economic slowdown, ordered a round of budget cuts in recent weeks, only to find that those cuts will not be enough. Many states, like Ohio, Georgia, Arizona and Kentucky, are now looking at even deeper cuts, hitting programs like mental health, Medicaid, prisons and education. Several states, like Connecticut and Kansas, say they are likely to go a step further: raising taxes or halting plans to cut taxes. 
 "It's not just one state or two states," said Arturo Perez, a budget specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. "People keep asking which states aren't going to be affected by this. There may be a pocket or two, but they're hard to find."
In a sign of further desperation, last week the nation's governors and state legislatures asked Congress and President Bush for increased federal spending on roads, airports and railroads to help create jobs. They want the government to lift requirements for state matching funds on federal programs, and to extend unemployment and health benefits for people who lost jobs or coverage as a direct or indirect result of the attacks. Some governors would like Congress to give the states the authority to collect sales tax on catalog and Internet purchases.
Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors Association, said there was "no precedent, not in recent history," for such requests from the states.
"We don't know how long it's going to take to come out of this," Mr. Scheppach said. "And then the states are going to be on slower growth and going to continue to have Medicaid and education expenses. The short run doesn't look real good and the long run doesn't look real good." 
In many states it is hard to believe that just months ago they were flush with surpluses, planning for stadiums and building up rainy day funds. Now, sales tax revenues are down as consumers stay away from stores. Income tax revenues have fallen with the sluggish stock market, especially in states like California and New Jersey, where many people had reaped the rewards of the 1990's bull market. 
States that depend heavily on travel and tourism, like Florida and Hawaii, are hurting, especially because state taxes on hotels and rental cars tend to be higher than taxes geared mostly toward in-state residents. Some states, like Washington, where the projected shortfall is now about $1 billion, are getting punched with airline industry layoffs. 
In addition, nearly every state is also starting to face unforeseen expenses, from increased demand for unemployment benefits to additional security requirements.
In Ohio, where Gov. Bob Taft announced plans last week to make significant budget cuts to meet a $600 million revenue shortfall, state officials project that at least one prison and one mental hospital will have to close. 
"This is the most difficult time I've ever seen facing this department and the state," said Reginald A. Wilkinson, director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, who added that about 1,000 workers out of 15,000 in the department could lose their jobs if one prison has to close. "We haven't had budget cuts like these outside of a regular budget cycle as long as I can remember. It's unprecedented by all standards."
In Connecticut, Gov. John G. Rowland has proposed $88 million in budget cuts, including freezing new spending for transportation improvements, mental health services and a program called KidCare, which provides mental health care to children. On Tuesday, Governor Rowland, a Republican, warned that the state might have to stall the scheduled elimination of the state's inheritance tax.
Further cuts are expected, said the governor's spokesman, Dean Pagani, who said that on Wednesday the governor told legislative leaders that "everything would have to be on the table, both on the tax side and the spending side."
In Kansas, Gov. Bill Graves, a Republican, said this week that he may propose a tax increase when he submits a budget to the Legislature in January. His spokesman, Don Brown, said the governor is also considering trying to expand the state lottery and to install slot machines at horse and dog racing tracks.
"From increasing state parks' admissions to increasing the cost of birth certificates, you name it, all of those things will be considered," Mr. Brown said. "There's not a real bright spot anywhere across the board."
In Georgia and Colorado and other states, public colleges and universities are facing sizable cuts in many areas, including student aid, staff and new buildings. In Iowa, cuts will not only affect higher education but elementary and secondary education, too. 
In Tennessee, which faces a $300 million budget deficit, the crisis has revived talk of creating a state income tax and some staunch opponents say they are willing to reconsider. 
"I might, I might," said State Senator Douglas Henry, a Democrat and the Senate finance chairman. "We've got to get out of the hole somehow."
In Florida this week, Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, called for a special legislative session to cut the budget by $1.5 million -- he also said he would give up a scheduled $3,000 pay raise. In California, where Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, has ordered state agencies to plan for 10 percent spending cuts, he has also announced a $5 million campaign to promote tourism. 
In Hawaii, where tourism has virtually dried up, Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano, a Democrat, has asked the state Legislature for a $1 million contingency fund and additional emergency powers, including the ability to control health insurance rates. He has also proposed a $1 billion construction package to stimulate jobs and this week, he went to Japan to promote tourism.
But some other states might actually find themselves with an unexpected, even discomfiting, economic silver lining.
In Maine, where the governor, Angus King, an independent, has ordered cuts of $10 million, some officials say that even though tourism suffered immediately after the attacks, it might start to rebound if travelers continue to shun planes. 
"Ninety percent of our tourism industry are people that drive to the state," said Janet Waldron, Maine's finance commissioner. "So we are thinking potentially we could have a real increase in tourism because people will perceive Maine as a safer location to come to."

A Month Later, Warnings and Hope, and Plans for a Long Campaign

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
Yesterday was one month since the terror bombings in New York and Virginia, and with the memorial services came reminders that the crisis was far from over. The F.B.I. warned that terrorists could strike against the United States at home or abroad in the next several days, while President Bush said American forces would fight in Afghanistan "as long as it takes."
 The terse public warning by the F.B.I. gave no information about the scope or nature of the threat, nor where it might occur. The public statement called on all local law enforcement to be on the "highest alert," and urged people to notify officials of "any unusual or suspicious activity." 

THE PRESIDENT: In his first prime-time news conference, Mr. Bush sought to depict the threat as part of a new reality, and urged people to go about their normal lives. The warnings, he said, showed that "the government is on full alert." Instead, he urged people to return to normal lives, to travel and work.
At the news conference, and earlier at a memorial service at the Pentagon, Mr. Bush also stressed that campaign against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks could be a long one. "We have entered a struggle of uncertain duration," he told an emotional gathering in front of the damaged west wall of the Pentagon, but "we can be certain of the outcome."
At what has come to be known as ground zero, the site of the destroyed World Trade Center, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani presided over a memorial ceremony that began at 8:48 a.m., the moment when the first hijacked airliner slammed into one of the twin towers. "Sometimes it feels like yesterday," he said. "Sometimes it feels like a year ago or more."

THE MILITARY OUTLOOK: It was likely to feel a lot longer before it was over. American and British military officials said they were preparing for a military operation stretching at least into next summer, after which there would be the task of building an Afghan government and economy virtually from scratch.
The bombing of Taliban and Al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan continued round-the-clock for the fifth day, confronting Mr. Bush with just the sort of situation he denounced during the campaign -- a military operation likely to keep American forces in Central Asia for months or years, followed by the long, costly and difficult task of building a viable Afghanistan.
Even as bombs continued to fall, including 5,000-pound "bunker busters" designed to destroy underground command posts, more American troops were flying into Uzbekistan and Pakistan. The British were there too: Adm. Sir Michael Boyce, Britain's military chief of staff, said that if ground troops would be needed, a commando brigade of Royal Marines trained for mountain and winter warfare might well be deployed.
From the ground, however, there was no evidence that Taliban forces were disintegrating, at least for now. On the contrary, reports reaching Pakistan said the Taliban were reinforcing their forces along the front 35 miles north of Kabul, the Afghan capital, in part with Arab and Pakistani recruits. The indications were that the Americans were deliberately leaving the Taliban intact on the northern front to keep the opposition Northern Alliance out of Kabul until there was an agreement in place on a new government.
The F.B.I. warning followed a month of intensive investigations by the F.B.I., C.I.A. and foreign security agencies that have persuaded them that Al Qaeda remains a serious and continuing terror threat. Their investigations found that Al Qaeda was not a loose cluster of aggrieved Islamic militants, but a centrally controlled organization in which local operatives receive money, manpower and expertise from the center.

THE ENEMY: Investigators in Europe, who have been announcing arrests almost daily, said they were finding that Al Qaeda had cells throughout Europe similar to the one in Germany that is believed to have played a crucial role in planning the attacks on the United States. The Europeans also found that the plotters come from a broad range of nationalities, united by previous service in Afghanistan and Bosnia, and that they had learned to assume a secular, Western style to avoid detection.
For all the indications that the crisis was far, far from over, there were also signs that people were regaining confidence. Stock prices rose sharply, recovering all the losses suffered in the days after the attacks on the World Trade Center. The rebound reflected a sense that the military action was going well, and offered hope that American business would weather the crisis without severe damage. SERGE SCHMEMANN

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE BUSINESSES; 
Small Shops Feel Lost In Aid Effort

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
It was considered a bargain in the financial district, but even though the little Bangladeshi restaurant called Taste of Tandoor offered most of its lunches for $4 and change, it earned enough from day to day to support five immigrant families across the city.
 In the last month, it earned nothing. And its owners spent the last two weeks throwing away the remnants of a once-thriving business: 70 bags of rotten meat and vegetables, a broken fax machine, and lucky dollars from their first day of business almost seven years ago. The money used to decorate the walls. 
 Like so many other small businesses near the fallen World Trade Center, Taste of Tandoor is barely clinging to life, part of the next wave of likely casualties from the attack. 
But unlike big business concerns from Midtown to Wall Street, the mom-and-pop shops, owners say, are dying a fast death below the radar of public knowledge or official concern.
"I'm so worried," said Mohammed E. Karim, who owns a third of Taste of Tandoor. "It is really, really bad for us. We are trying our hardest to stay open. All I can say is that we're trying our best."
It has been a wrenching few weeks for Mr. Karim and his two partners in their narrow kitchen near the corner of Church and Warren Streets. It is a scene playing out all over the red zone and the neighborhoods beyond it in downtown Manhattan. Hundreds of coffee shops, delis, hardware stores, pizza joints, dry cleaners, jewelry bazaars, diners -- the list could go on -- have been paralyzed since Sept. 11. 
Of course, some suffered more physical damage than others. While the rolling cloud of dust and debris engulfed Taste of Tandoor, other businesses, like the Wall Street Humidor, survived largely unscathed. All, however, have seen their customer flow severely reduced, or even cut off, because of traffic restrictions -- limitations the city has just begun to ease.
"We're thinking in perspective -- everything could be gone," said Jorge Sosa of Sosa Borella, a restaurant on Greenwich Street in TriBeCa. "Nobody's out to make a lot of money. We hope to break even." 
Sosa Borella is doing "all right," Mr. Sosa said, and will surely survive. But many businesses have not yet decided whether to close up shop for good. They are waiting to hear how much relief they can expect from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, insurance companies and other sources of grants and low-interest loans before making that decision. 
The federal Small Business Administration has issued more than 15,000 applications for low-interest loans, but has received back only 1,300 requests, "a very small rate of return," said Cynthia Speed, a spokeswoman for the agency. She said it probably reflected the fact that many small-business owners were already worried about their debt burdens. "They're thinking, 'If I'm about to lose my business, what do I need a loan for?' " 
But Ms. Speed said owners should be aware that the loans being offered, at an interest rate of 4 percent, could be repaid according to terms negotiated case by case. "We're out to put the word out that we're here to help," she said.
Ms. Speed said that since Sept. 11, 260 loans have been approved for $26 million. Nonetheless, many owners seem to want the cash flow that comes from grant money, and are showing signs of pessimism about getting large chunks of it.
Mr. Karim has already pared down his staff to two people, from eight. He said the calls to his employees were the hardest to make: "I said, 'Please feel free to work someplace else,' and that hurt. It's a long time, one month. Nobody waits.
"But we can't stay here if we can't even pay our own salaries," continued Mr. Karim, who is 32 and lives in Queens. "We don't have anything else to survive on."
At Antiqueria Tribeca on Duane Street, business is down 90 percent, said Peter Feig, the owner. In addition, $30,000 worth of inventory was damaged on Sept. 11, he said. At Salaam Bombay on Greenwich Street, also in TriBeCa, business is down 50 percent, despite a 30 percent reduction in the price of lunch and dinner. And Dr. Renee Wild, a pediatric dentist with an office at 67 Hudson Street, said: "There's nobody to take care of. They're displaced or they have moved out."
Although politicians -- including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- have made official visits to raise downtown morale, the small-business owners still say they feel forgotten.
"As of today, no one has said anything to us about assistance," said Vivia Amalfitano, whose family owns three restaurants in the red zone that have been shut down since the attacks. "Why hasn't someone from the city or the state said, 'Look, we'll help you'?"
The Amalfitano businesses include a deli and a pizza parlor on Trinity Street and a larger restaurant on Liberty Street, which took the worst hit. First, there was the dust and flying debris, which caused a mess. Later, the restaurant was looted; the cash register is long gone.
"It's unfortunate and we hate what happened at the towers, but we have to deal with the reality that we're ruined financially," Ms. Amalfitano said. 
Amy Rutkin, chief of staff for Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, who represents the area in Congress, said a coalition of elected officials, the Ground Zero Task Force, is scrambling to find ways to help small businesses. 
"It's something that has become of paramount importance, at the top of our agenda, because we have such a very small window of opportunity to provide assistance -- for many, a month of being closed or having limited customers means it's all over," Ms. Rutkin said. "We've got to get them answers and money."
Among the resources Ms. Rutkin said the task force is turning to are charities, hoping they will do something "outside the scope of their mission." When Ms. Rutkin makes her pitch, she said, she explains: "Not that you aren't already doing God's work, but this would really help save downtown. Life would not be livable down there without these businesses." 
For now, these businesses limp on precariously.
Micah Damato, whose family owns a nut and fruit company at Greenwich and Jay Streets, said he believed that downtown would spring back to life as the cleanup at the disaster site progressed.
"For now, that steaming pile of rubble is too hard for customers to deal with," he said. "The smell, how many people are on the streets, and a lot of other things depend on which way the wind blows."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Britain: Burberry Sales Fall 

BYLINE:  By Suzanne Kapner (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Sales at Burberry retail stores declined 15 percent in the three weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, its parent company, Great Universal Stores, said. 
Before the attacks, sales had been growing, and for the six months to Sept. 30 showed an increase of 31 percent at constant exchange rates, the company said. Great Universal Stores said it still planned to proceed with a partial public offering of Burberry shares before June 2002. Burberry is the latest luxury goods company to warn of shrinking demand, as shoppers, fearful of terrorism and its possible effect on the economy, have refrained from buying expensive handbags and clothes.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Europe: Rates Steady 

BYLINE:  By Edmund L. Andrews (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Turning aside fears that Europe is heading toward a recession, the European Central Bank disappointed at least some investors by refusing to reduce interest rates. The central bank kept its baseline interest rate at 3.75 percent, refusing to add to the emergency rate cut it made nearly two weeks ago. 
In holding rates steady, the European central bankers again diverged from the course of the United States Federal Reserve, which cut rates repeatedly before and after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Analysts said the European bank might be waiting for more signs of the fallout from Sept. 11, and they speculated that the bank had been put off by hints of strengthening growth in the last few days. But most experts still say European rates will be cut at least one more time before the year's end. Edmund L. Andrews (NYT)

HEADLINE: FILM IN REVIEW; 
'Jails, Hospitals And Hip-Hop'

BYLINE:  By DAVE KEHR 

 BODY:
Directed by Danny Hoch and Mark Benjamin
R, 90 minutes
 Adapted from a successful one-man show, "Jails, Hospitals and Hip-Hop," which opens today at the Village East (Second Avenue at 12th Street, East Village), presents the performance artist Danny Hoch as nine characters, counting himself. 
 The tall, pale Mr. Hoch, who bears a haunting resemblance in looks and speech to Huntz Hall of the Bowery Boys, is a gifted performer who uses his mastery of rap rhythms to invest his characters with remarkable energy and definition. The multiethnic, cross-cultural world of hip-hop is Mr. Hoch's home base, and although he is of no identifiable ethnicity, he slips easily into the speech patterns of the black, Latino and white ethnic characters he portrays. 
Among those personas is Bronx, a sidewalk vendor busted for selling O. J. Simpson T-shirts without a license; Flip, a Montana farm boy who angrily identifies with urban rappers (the character has already been the basis for a film, Marc Levin's "Whiteboys"); and Sam, a prison guard who has been sent for anger-management counseling after nearly beating a prisoner to death. 
In different ways each of these men is a prisoner of a hypocritical legal system, of cultural isolation, of emotional and economic stress. (Sam comes from a long line of apple growers, but now the orchards in upstate New York are barren and neglected.) 
By and large Mr. Hoch's portrayals are as harsh and authentic as a police photograph, but an occasional touch of sentimentality creeps in. Playing a young Bronx man who was mentally impaired by his mother's use of cocaine during her pregnancy, Mr. Hoch goes for an easy pathos that seems meant to seduce the audience rather than amplify the character. 
Sharing the direction of the film with the cinematographer Mark Benjamin, Mr. Hoch has incorporated several levels of rhetorical reality. A routine that begins with him performing before an audience of prisoners will suddenly jump, in midsentence, to Mr. Hoch performing the same routine before a college audience, and then jump again to a fully staged version of the incident he is describing. While the technique avoids the visual monotony that is the curse of so many performance films, it tends to diffuse the power of Mr. Hoch's virtuoso monologues. Broken down into visually discordant fragments, the sequences lose their drive and integrity. 
"Jails, Hospitals and Hip-Hop" ends with a two-character piece, presenting Mr. Hoch as a rap star making an uneasy appearance on a talk show hosted by a distinctly David Letterman-like character (Jeff Peters). The scene is a taut, angry and provocative view of a collision between two notions of entertainment, one fierce and engaged, one chilly and ironic. There is little doubt as to which side Mr. Hoch is on.
"Jails, Hospitals and Hip-Hop" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong language and drug content. DAVE KEHR

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Unemployment Assistance 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 More than 3,700 New Yorkers asked for unemployment assistance last week because of the World Trade Center disaster, the New York State Department of Labor said yesterday. 
As of Oct. 10, the number of people who have asked for jobless benefits because of the disaster rose to 20,493, up from 16,747 the previous week. Throughout the state, the number of people applying for first-time unemployment insurance benefits edged down slightly during the first week of October, to 30,073 from 30,464 during the last week of September. But those figures are far higher than they were a year ago, when the economy was humming. Leslie Eaton (NYT)

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
The outlook for campaigns is cloudy as marketers reassess spending and agency rosters.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
EVEN though there is continued uncertainty in the advertising economy after the terrorist attacks, some decisions are moving forward, most notably changes in assignments on accounts with total billings estimated at $300 million. But the outlook remains clouded as marketers reassess spending plans in addition to agency rosters, all of which are being felt in revenue declines at media companies as well as layoffs at agencies.
 Marketers intend to reduce their ad budgets for the fourth quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 by an average of 12 percent as a direct result of the events of Sept. 11 and the aftermath, according to a survey by Jack Myers L.L.C. in New York, which publishes media and research newsletters. 
 Though 49 percent of the respondents said they did not intend to reduce ad budgets for those two quarters because of the events of the last month, 33 percent said they would do so by cutting spending by up to 10 percent. Twelve percent of respondents said they would cut spending by 11 percent to 20 percent, and 4 percent of respondents said they would cut ad budgets in half. 
By comparison, ad spending for the first six months of 2001, the most recent data available, fell 5.9 percent from the corresponding period of 2000, according to CMR in New York, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending.
"There is a recognition that consumer spending has been negatively affected" since the attacks, said Jack Myers, chief economist at Myers, "which will cause a further drain on corporate profits" and in turn "marketing budget cutbacks."
As a result, Mr. Myers said, most of the growth in ad spending expected to begin next year "will materialize in late 2002 and early 2003, rather than in the first half of 2002."
"Any meaningful growth for the media economy is at least 12 months away," he added, "and will follow an upturn in the general economy."
The effects on media companies are already being felt. Yesterday, Ziff Davis Media closed Expedia Travels, its year-old magazine inspired by the Expedia.com travel Web site. The closing, attributed to economic problems exacerbated by the attacks, was reported by the online edition of the trade publication Advertising Age,
Also yesterday, executives at Dow Jones & Company estimated that ad linage for The Wall Street Journal would decline 35 percent to 45 percent in the fourth quarter, after a decline of 46.8 percent on a per-issue basis in September.
In a conference call with analysts, Richard Zannino, chief financial officer, described the current ad market as "abysmal."
Also, Yahoo reported on Wednesday that third-quarter revenue fell 44 percent, to $166.1 million, from $295.6 million. Online advertising accounts for about 80 percent of revenue.
Along Madison Avenue, the cutbacks are leading to additional layoffs. Digitas in Boston, a marketing and technology services agency, dismissed 350 employees this week and closed its Hong Kong office. The Incepta Group in London, which owns marketing services and public relations agencies like Citigate Albert Frank and Citigate Sard Verbinnen, said this week it had laid off 8 percent of its staff, or 160 people.
Also, layoffs are likely as two units of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies -- Draft Worldwide in Chicago and Lowe Lintas & Partners Worldwide in New York -- merge into Draft the American operations of a Lowe Lintas subsidiary known as Lowe Live, which specializes in direct and interactive marketing and customer relationship management.
"We expect that there will be some efficiencies" in determining how many of the 100 Lowe Live employees are brought into Draft, said Howard Draft, chairman and chief executive at Draft. There are also discussions about the future plans of the top executives of Lowe Live, he added, including Floyd Miller, chairman and chief executive, based in the San Francisco office, and the co-managing directors, Dan Goodman and Paul Velardi, in New York.
Turning to the account changes, the California Department of Consumer Affairs named the Los Angeles office of Grey Worldwide, part of the Grey Global Group, to handle its energy conservation account. Billings were estimated at $45 million for a one-year contract with a renewal option.
The decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Grey and four other finalists. Grey had been handling the assignment on a temporary basis since the energy crisis hit California in the winter.
Another Grey Global agency, the Grey Healthcare Group in New York, was selected by the Pfizer Corporation in New York and the Pharmacia Corporation in Peapack, N.J., to handle worldwide professional advertising for Celebrex, their arthritis pain medication. Billings were estimated at $80 million.
The decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Grey Healthcare and four other finalists, including the incumbent, Lyons Lavey Nickel Swift in New York, part of the Omnicom Group. The New York office of J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP Group, handles consumer advertising for Celebrex.
Adobe Systems, the software services company, is parting ways with its agency since 1997 -- the San Francisco office of Young & Rubicam Advertising, part of the Young & Rubicam unit of WPP -- as a review for its United States account, with billings estimated at $20 million, was narrowed.
Peter Isaacson, director for worldwide brand marketing at Adobe in San Jose, Calif., identified the remaining two finalists as the Marina del Rey, Calif., office of Deutsch, part of the Partnership unit of Interpublic, and Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of Omnicom. A decision is expected in early November.
Carpet One, a chain of flooring retailers that is part of CCA Global Partners in Manchester, N.H., named DeVito/Verdi in New York to handle its account, with spending estimated at $60 million. The account had previously been handled in-house. The decision came after a three-month review that had been narrowed to DeVito/Verdi and three other finalists.
Midas in Itasca, Ill., named Cliff Freeman & Partners in New York to handle the strategic and creative parts of its American account. Billings were estimated at $60 million. Midas parted ways in June with its previous agency, Euro RSCG McConnaughy Tatham in Chicago, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising.
The decision came after a three-month review that had been narrowed to Freeman and three other finalists. Carat North America in New York, part of the Aegis Group, continues to handle media buying.
The American Home Products Corporation in Madison, N.J., expanded its relationship with McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising by naming McCann-Erickson New York to handle advertising for two brands that are part of its Whitehall-Robins Healthcare division, Dimetapp cold medicine and Anbesol oral pain relief. Billings were estimated at $15 million to $20 million.
The decision came after a review that began in July. The American Home relationship with McCann-Erickson, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of Interpublic, dates to 1937. Dimetapp had been at the Young & Rubicam New York office, and Anbesol had been at the Grey New York office.
Finally, Household International in Prospect Heights, Ill., which offers consumer loans, credit cards and auto financing through its HFC and Beneficial divisions, selected Gotham in New York, also part of the World Group, to develop a new corporate branding campaign. Billings were estimated at $15 million to $20 million. The decision came after a review that also included five other agencies.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Stocks Surge; Most Indexes Have Recouped September Loss

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK and FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The American stock market rose sharply yesterday, providing more evidence that investors are regaining their confidence after the terrorist attacks. Most major averages in the United States, as well as several other countries, have now recovered all the losses they suffered after Sept. 11. 
 Wall Street was encouraged after several companies, including General Electric, reported financial results that met or exceeded stock analysts' diminished expectations. Those reports provided some hope that American business would weather the economic storm without severe damage. 
 The market also seemed to reflect confidence that the military action in Afghanistan is proceeding successfully.
"Because of the attacks, investors have a renewed enthusiasm that we're going to have a V-shaped recovery," said John Forelli, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Independence Investment L.L.C., referring to the theory that a sharp fall in the economy will be followed by an equally rapid rebound.
He argued that the market might be higher now than it would have been without the attacks, simply because the federal government is preparing an economic stimulus package that would not have been considered.
Others pointed to market reasons for the gains. "Nobody wants to get in the way of the momentum," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. "The economy still is bad, and we haven't seen stabilization. But so far, it hasn't been grotesquely worse than our expectations."
Both the technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed slightly above their final levels on Sept. 10. The Nasdaq surged 75.21 points, or 4.6 percent, to 1,701.47, while the S.& P. 500 jumped 16.44 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,097.43.
The Dow Jones industrial average remains roughly 200 points below its Sept. 10 close, but it gained 169.59 points, or 1.8 percent, to 9,410.45.
The enthusiasm came despite poor sales reports for September from many retailers. The exception was discount stores, which generally saw sales increases. But investors were aware of that trend, and seemed more impressed by the sales laggards. Wal-Mart Stores shares fell 14 cents, to $53.49, after the company reported a 6 percent gain in sales, while Federated Department Stores, the parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, rose $2.12, to $31.60, despite a 13 percent decline in sales.
Immediately after the Sept. 11 attack, world stock markets sagged from fears of world recession and of continued terrorism. Since then, many markets have come back. Major stock averages in London, Frankfurt and Tokyo have all climbed above their pre-attack levels.
All those markets remain down sharply this year. Japan is mired in recession while major European economies continue to slow, with some economists forecasting that all major world economies will be in recession at the same time for the first time since 1973 through 1975, when the first oil shock jolted the entire industrial world.
Because the American economy was the most directly affected by the attacks, the recovery in the domestic stock market is in that sense the most impressive. Trading was halted for the rest of the week after the attacks, and the Dow industrials lost 14.3 percent the next week, for the average's worst week since the Great Depression. Other averages also fell more than 10 percent. But nearly all those losses have now been recouped.
Oil prices, which had fallen when investors expected a severe recession, have begun to recover, with crude oil for November delivery rising 3.6 percent to $23.44 a barrel yesterday. The price had fallen as low as $20.30 on Sept. 26. But oil shares, which had been strong the last two weeks, generally slipped. Exxon Mobil fell 19 cents, to $42.09.
In the technology sector, the gains were led by the stocks of large companies, including those that are typically associated with early gains in a period of economic recovery. But there were also bold gains by stocks that lost almost all of their value when the Internet bubble burst.
"The biggest, most liquid stocks are all moving," said Brett Gallagher, vice president of Julius Baer Investment Management.
At least some of the performance seems to have come from professional money managers who sold stocks after the attacks and now have cash that they do not want to leave out of the market if prices recover. With a widely held stock, "if you don't own it, and it starts to move very quickly, you can lose some relative performance," Mr. Gallagher said.
The stocks posting the greatest losses in the Dow were those of companies whose businesses would be most stable in a recession, and therefore would gain less when a downturn ends. Johnson & Johnson was down $1.10, to $54.94; Procter & Gamble fell 75 cents, to $72.59.
In the technology sector, E*Trade reported profits that exceeded Wall Street's estimates and rose $1.19, or 29 percent, to $7.85. The company raised its earnings forecast for the fourth quarter.
The gains in E-Trade and Yahoo, which reported a day earlier, helped lift TheStreet.com's Internet index by 14.48 points, or 10.37 percent, to 154.16. That index is still down 88 percent from its peak in March 2000.

 BODY:
Merchants Posted No Gain In Overall September Sales
Over all, sales at the nation's merchants did not increase at all in September, according to the first industrywide figures since the Sept. 11 attacks. It was the worst month since Goldman, Sachs started keeping its retail index in 1988 and the worst September performance comparison since Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi began keeping its index in 1970.
 But the numbers underscored that retail is a tale of two types of stores: the discounters and everyone else. Sales at specialty apparel stores declined by 8.5 percent, but discounters' sales increased 4.4 percent. Page C13. 

Computer Associates to Cut Jobs
Computer Associates International, the software giant, said that it would lay off 900 employees, or 5 percent of its work force, in the face of slowing corporate spending on technology. The layoffs are necessary because of "the reality of business today," said Sanjay Kumar, president of the company, which is based in Islandia, N.Y. About 700 of the laid-off employees work in the United States and Canada, with many of the rest in Latin America. C13.

G.E. Reports 3% Rise in Earnings
General Electric said that its third-quarter earnings rose 3 percent despite huge insurance losses related to the terrorist attacks. Excluding those losses, the increase would have been 16 percent. Revenue fell 8 percent. G.E. also vowed to generate double-digit earnings growth this year and next. C2.

Juniper Beats Wall Street Forecast
Juniper Networks, the maker of networking equipment, posted a loss for its third quarter, but the company exceeded expectations after excluding several charges. C13.

Wireless Company May Shut Down
MobileStar Network, a driving force in offering wireless Internet access in public places, said that it had laid off its entire work force and would sell its assets if it could not find a buyer to continue its service. C13.

Rift Emerges Over Government Aid
As leading insurers have coalesced around an aid package to protect them against losses from future terrorist attacks, an ideological rift has developed both within the administration and in Congress about the government role in protecting industries in distress. C4.

Verizon Restrictions Anger Rivals
Verizon Communications is raising the ire of competitors by seeking to increase security at work sites after one of its main technology hubs in Lower Manhattan suffered substantial damage on Sept. 11. Many companies that lease access to Verizon's network to provide local telephone service or fast Internet access have already complained that Verizon has sought to restrict their access to work sites. Shares of Verizon fell $1.25, to $52.85. C5.

Private Aviation Under Scrutiny
Federal officials are keeping a tight rein on private aviation, re-examining the ease with which aircraft can be bought and flown. C4.

Auction Houses Trim Work Forces
Sotheby's and Christie's, the auction houses, are cutting their worldwide work forces to maintain their profitability. C2.

Average Jobless Claims Climb
The average number of workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose over the last four weeks to the highest in almost a decade, the Labor Department said. C5.

HEADLINE: Clouds Seen for Emerging Markets 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The last thing that financial markets need now is another shock. But the world's emerging markets could provide one.
 "Investors should not ignore the possibility of a future crisis in emerging markets," said William R. Rhodes, vice chairman of Citigroup and a veteran of debt crises in developing countries since the 1980's. 
 While stock markets in major industrial countries have, as a whole, recovered most of their losses since the terrorist attacks, emerging stock markets have come back only slightly. The flow of foreign capital, the lifeblood of many of these economies, is expected to slow sharply this year and rebound only a bit next year. Two countries in trouble, Argentina and Turkey, are expected to have $23 billion more withdrawn than invested this year. 
If a new crisis does develop, however, the United States and the International Monetary Fund are likely to react more quickly -- particularly in predominantly Muslim countries -- as the pressing need to fight terrorists sweeps aside objections by Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill to the firefighter rescues of the past.
"The money will be a lot more forthcoming, especially to front-line states, especially Turkey but also Indonesia and Pakistan," said Desmond Lachman, director of emerging-markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney.
Horst Kohler, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, made clear in a statement last Friday that the I.M.F. knows how difficult times could be for emerging-market countries and is ready to help. "The I.M.F.," he said, "is prepared to play its role of providing advice and additional financial support, where necessary, to those members that have (or adopt) suitable policies, as part of a joint international effort to strengthen confidence in the global economy."
Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Columbia University who specializes in emerging-markets financing, said, "Washington is looking for the quickest solution to anything."
Something bad may not happen immediately. Because investors have been fleeing emerging markets for most of the year, there is no threat of a sudden, destabilizing exit. And some measures of emerging-market stress are not as high as they have been in the past.
But America's battle against terrorism has added more uncertainty to the outlook. Many analysts agree that 2002 will be a difficult year for emerging markets.
"I think emerging markets remain vulnerable," said Joyce Chang, global head of fixed-income research at J. P. Morgan. And although there is no imminent threat of default in Argentina or Turkey, she said, "There are medium-term concerns going into 2002."
The outlook for the economies and the stock and bond markets in Argentina, Turkey and other emerging-market countries -- from South Korea and Thailand to Brazil and Mexico -- was worsening before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. It has deteriorated since. From broad barometers to very specific local ones, the signs are not good.
"For all emerging markets, the situation will be harder because of the consequences on trade and tourism and on the level of economic activity worldwide," said Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister of Argentina.
The prospect of a global slowdown and, possibly, a recession in the United States, has quickly shifted to the likelihood of a global recession for the first time since the 1970's.
Interest rates in emerging markets, which were already high, have shot higher, although the fall in rates in the United States has provided some relief. Still, the difference between yields on emerging-market debt worldwide and that of comparable United States Treasury securities is 10 percentage points, the highest in two years.
Commodity prices are falling, which could help some countries, like Brazil, by lowering energy costs. But many countries depend on revenues from the sale of copper and other commodities to cover government spending, and could be hurt. Venezuela and Mexico are major oil producers, and Argentina grows wheat.
Mr. Kohler of the I.M.F. described the impacts on emerging-market countries this way: "A further softening in the U.S. will significantly affect nearby Latin American and Caribbean countries, and tourism centers will be hard hit. Emerging-market debtor countries around the world will be affected by the longer period of global risk aversion.
"Emerging Asian countries will feel the impact of lower demand in the industrial countries, adding to the already ailing high-tech sector and weakness in Japanese demand. Lower demand and commodity prices further cloud the outlook for primary producers, although lower oil prices would be an offset to net fuel importers, which include many of the poorest countries."
In the three emerging-market countries that were in the most trouble before the attack -- Argentina, Brazil and Turkey -- the recent signs point to the possibility of deeper problems to come. All three needed assistance from the I.M.F. before Sept. 11.
If one of them has a serious problem, the contagion in the post-attack environment could spread more quickly than in recent episodes.
Argentina is in the most precarious position, even though it is getting $5 billion in new aid from the I.M.F. Although Argentina is not that dependent on the American consumer, with about 15 percent of its exports going to the United States, the terrorist attacks have made a global recession more likely. That would hurt Argentina because much of its trade is with Europe and Brazil.
There are parliamentary elections Sunday, and it is not clear if there will be changes in policies afterward. There has been talk that President Fernando de la Rua may replace Mr. Cavallo, the economy minister. But in an interview, Mr. Cavallo said, "My impression is that President de la Rua has no intention to ask for my resignation."
Tax revenue for September fell 14 percent from the month a year earlier, far more than expected. The decline could jeopardize Argentina's effort to cut its federal government deficit to zero by the end of the year. Ernest W. Brown, head of fixed-income and economics research at Santander Central Hispano Investment Securities, said that Argentina, given the current global slowdown, is likely to get a pass if it misses the zero goal by just a little.
Still, the decline in tax revenue also suggests that the economy, which has already been in a recession for more than three years, is slowing further. Santander Central Hispano, which had been forecasting that the economy would grow 0.5 percent this year, now says it expects Argentina's output will shrink 2.4 percent.
Such declines in revenue and growth forecasts are worrisome because Mr. Cavallo's strategy has been to try to hold things together until economic growth could solve most of the problems. But growth is much farther away now.
Argentina has also been unable to avail itself of the additional $3 billion included in the I.M.F. program to help promote a swap of some of Argentina's existing $132 billion in debt for new debt, a process that would reduce the country's debt burden. There were no details for this part of the program when it was announced in August and Mr. Cavallo said Wednesday that it remained "undefined."
All this means, many analysts say, that Argentina may now be forced to default on its debt or devalue its currency, which is pegged to the dollar, or do both.
"In an ironic way, Argentina is more protected from the problems in the United States than other emerging-market countries," said Rafael de la Fuente, head of sovereign strategy for Latin America at BNP Paribas. "Still, the likelihood is that their problems lead them into some forced debt restructuring." 
Mr. Cavallo said, "There will be no devaluation and no compulsory restructuring of our debt."
Brazil's problem is that it has been hurt by the fallout from Argentina. The Brazilian currency, the real, has plunged to record lows: down 30 percent for the year and off 6 percent since Sept. 11.
At the same time, interest rates have skyrocketed, rising to an overall average of 16.3 percent, making interest payments on the country's debt even more difficult to meet. It will take a reversal of these two trends, says J. P. Morgan's recent analysis of Brazil, "to put debt dynamics back on a sustainable footing."
In addition, foreign capital flows into Brazil are expected to fall sharply, to less than $20 billion this year from $30 billion in 2000. Over all, the Institute of International Finance projects that capital flows into Latin America will fall to $45 billion this year from $61 billion in 2000. They are likely to fall again next year, to $43 billion.
Turkey also suffers from capital outflows and needs a large aid package to cover the government budget deficit in 2002, analysts say. Its currency, the lira, has plummeted 57 percent this year. Calls for early elections indicate that political risks are increasing.
Turkey's role in the fight against terrorism has shielded it from some of the fallout since Sept. 11 because investors expect the country to get the international help it will need.
Problems in other countries show that even issues unconnected to the attack and the response that is following have been making the outlook for emerging markets worse.
Mexico is struggling with approval of tax reform and if it is put off until a vote in December, Standard & Poor's is expected to delay a decision on whether to raise Mexico's credit rating to investment grade. Mexico is also vulnerable to the United States recession.
J. P. Morgan notes that "reforms appear to have taken a back seat" in South Korea, where, as elsewhere, growth forecasts are being cut.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Rejects Idea of Inflation Targets 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
Choosing a specific inflation target for the Federal Reserve to meet would not help the central bank set interest rates, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said today.
 Some analysts, including Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, have advocated setting such targets as a way to restrain inflation expectations and promote open decision making at the Fed. 
 Mr. Greenspan said that would not work because it is becoming ever more difficult to measure inflation in an age of rapid improvement in medical care, software and other products that depend on innovations in technology. 
"A specific numerical inflation target would represent an unhelpful and false precision," Mr. Greenspan said at a monetary policy conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
Mr. Greenspan did not discuss current economic conditions or Fed interest rate policy in his remarks.
In a speech in July, Mr. Meyer, whose term expires on Jan. 31, called for a 2 percent inflation target. That would help frame monetary policy discussions among Fed officials and help investors anticipate when interest rates would be changed. Those conditions would make it easier to hold down market interest rates, he said in his speech.
Mr. Greenspan disagreed, offering his own long-held view that "price stability is best thought of as an environment in which inflation is so low and stable over time that it does not materially enter in the decisions of households and firms."
Investors do have far more information on Fed policy making than in years past, Mr. Greenspan said. The Federal Open Market Committee discloses its decisions immediately after making them and offers its view of the risks to the economy. Minutes of F.O.M.C. meetings are released after each succeeding meeting, and transcripts of meetings are released every five years.
In addition, Fed officials regularly make speeches and testify before Congress. "We endeavor to keep the public well informed," Mr. Greenspan said.
Answering critics who have called for further openness on the part of the Fed -- up to and including open, on-the-record meetings -- Mr. Greenspan said "in principle, there is no reason this couldn't be done."
Most participants in such discussions, however, would probably be intimidated, he said, and therefore less candid in offering opinions and assessments.

HEADLINE: China Seeks World Support in Fight With Its Muslim Separatists 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
The Chinese government made its most explicit call yet for international support to fight Muslim separatists in its far West, saying it had evidence of their ties with terrorist groups abroad.
 Bolstering its fight against a small separatist movement in the western region of Xinjiang, which is dominated by the Muslim Uighurs, has been an implicit goal of the government since the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington. China quickly declared its support for a global antiterrorist campaign and has not objected to a limited American-led military campaign in Afghanistan, with which it shares a short border. 
 The Uighurs speak a Turkic language and have more cultural affinity with Central Asia than with the rest of China. Internal and exiled groups have called for an independent or autonomous state of "East Turkistan," the name taken by a self-declared republic that existed briefly in the 1940's. There have occasionally been shootings of Chinese officials and bombings in the region, and the local press in Xinjiang frequently reports the arrest or execution of violent separatists.
Most Uighurs are not involved with any violent insurrection, but economic and cultural resentment of the majority Chinese is widespread. Western governments and human rights advocates charge that Chinese authorities, in their zeal to prevent any moves toward secession, have also suppressed basic legal rights, repressing even peaceful expressions of Uighur nationalism.
Rights monitors abroad have expressed concern that China will exploit the new international antiterror campaign to fend off criticism of its poor human rights record. 
At a regularly scheduled press briefing today, Sun Yuxi, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that the Uighur separatists were clearly in the terrorist camp.
"We have conclusive evidence that the East Turkistan elements have participated in terrorist activities," he said.
"It's openly stated in their guidelines that they will engage in violence against China," he said. "We also have evidence that they have colluded with international terrorist groups."
Mr. Sun said that Uighur separatists have engaged in "bombings, assassinations, poisoning, abductions and robbery," threatening the stability not only of China but also of the surrounding region.
"We hope that our fight against the East Turkistan forces will become a part of the international effort against terrorism, and it should also win support and understanding," he said. 
Western experts say that small numbers of Chinese Uighurs have trained or fought with the Taliban in Afghanistan and that arms have sometimes been smuggled from Central Asia into Xinjiang. However, there is no evidence that the Taliban or Osama bin Laden have seriously targeted China for subversion.
Islamic fundamentalism is rare in Xinjiang and experts say the low-level conflict there has been driven more by the Uighurs' ethnic and cultural differences than by religion.
Mr. Sun said that because of their record of violent tactics, Xinjiang separatists are "terrorists" and not "freedom fighters." He said that the international community "should not have a double standard" when it comes to fighting terrorism. 
In response to Mr. Sun's statement, Amnesty International expressed concern that repression of Muslim groups would increase in Xinjiang, citing reports of a new campaign to suppress terrorist and separatist activities in the region.

HEADLINE: Bush Promotes Energy Bill as Security Issue 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
President Bush urged the Senate today to pass an energy bill that would allow drilling for oil in an Alaskan wildlife refuge, casting the issue as a matter of national security.
 The Bush administration has maintained that drilling in Alaska would help the nation reduce its reliance on foreign oil, and Republicans in Congress have supported him. Democrats have opposed drilling as a sop to the oil industry and the Teamsters, who see it as a jobs program, at the expense of the environment. 
 Though the Democrats control the Senate, they are worried that they do not have the votes to prevent the drilling, and they suspended action yesterday on the energy bill. Mr. Bush's comments today, as the nation continued to bomb Afghanistan, were a clear effort to revive it. 
"I urge the Senate to listen to the will of the senators and move a bill," the president told reporters after a cabinet meeting in the White House. "The less dependent we are on foreign sources of crude oil, the more secure we are at home."
Congress has been at pains to show its support for the president since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but the energy bill is a reminder of the deep partisan divisions below the surface.
Senator Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said on Tuesday night that the Democrats were suspending discussion of the bill because they wanted to "avoid quarrelsome, divisive votes in committee." Mr. Bingaman also said that energy matters were beginning to spill over into other committees and that he was trying to prevent a jurisdictional dispute.
Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said on Wednesday that Democrats did not want to bring up the bill because they knew they would lose and were trying to deprive Mr. Bush of a victory.
Two Democrats on the committee -- Senators Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Daniel K. Akaka of Hawaii -- have signaled their support for drilling, and drilling opponents acknowledged that a vote now could be risky. Ms. Landrieu, who is up for re-election next year, is from an oil-producing state. Mr. Akaka has aligned himself with native tribes in Alaska who support the drilling as a boost to their economy.
Mr. Bingaman's move essentially gives Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, the power to bypass committees and shape the bill on his own. Democratic advisers said he was working to produce an energy bill before Congress adjourns later this month or early next but that it would almost certainly not authorize drilling in the Alaska refuge.
The House passed the energy bill this summer, with the encouragement of the Teamsters union, which is looking at the thousands of jobs drilling would create. Republicans deployed Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, to try to muster public support for the drilling, and the president seemed eager to join in.
After hearing progress reports from his cabinet on the war on terrorism, Mr. Bush said, unprompted, that he wanted Congress to grant him the authority to act quickly on trade matters and to pass an energy bill.
"There was a good energy bill passed out of the House of Representatives," he said in a rare detour from war-related matters since Sept. 11. "And the reason it passed is because members of both parties understand an energy bill is not only good for jobs, it's important for our national security to have a good energy policy."
He added: "And I urge the Senate to listen to the will of the senators and move a bill, move a bill that will help Americans find work and also make it easier for all of us around this table to protect the security of the country."
The United States imports half the oil it uses. Critics of drilling in Alaska argue that, by the government's own estimate, opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would not yield oil for at least seven years and then would yield enough for only 140 days. Republicans argue that the drilling would take place in only 1.5 million acres of the 19 million-acre refuge and would provide thousands of jobs at a time when unemployment is rising.
Phil Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, which opposes drilling in the Alaskan refuge, said Mr. Bush's policy made little sense in light of the conflict.
"Even if you drill in Alaska," Mr. Clapp said, "the Department of Energy projects a 25 percent to 30 percent increase in U.S. oil imports from the Middle East and the Caspian Sea over the next 20 years. His energy policy would make us more dependent on the countries that are likely to be the most unstable as a result of the military action in Afghanistan."

HEADLINE: Warmth, but No Aid Commitment, for Pataki in Washington 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 11 

 BODY:
A month after a terrorist attack destroyed the World Trade Center, Gov. George E. Pataki made the rounds in the capital today to drum up support for a $54 billion plan not only to resurrect the destroyed buildings, but to buttress the state's battered economy as well.
 Congressional leaders received the governor with polite warmth and made vague promises to help New York weather the crisis, but Mr. Pataki did not come away from the meetings with any firm commitments beyond a promise to study his proposals. 
 And some influential lawmakers in both houses cautioned the governor that such a large request would face tough going at a time when Congress is wrestling with an expensive raft of measures to stimulate the national economy and is expecting large requests for money from the military for the war in Central Asia.
"We can only say that we will do the best we can with the limited resources that the federal government has and the restrictions from the standpoint of the budget," said Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. "There are many problems facing this nation along with those that confront that state."
Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, said after meeting with the governor and the Senate minority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, that he had questions about the size of Mr. Pataki's request. He also asked why the federal government should be appropriating more money to cope with the disaster in Manhattan before private insurance companies pay up. 
"I don't think anybody gives a blank check," he said. "We are not unlimited pockets." 
Mr. Pataki is seeking about $34 billion for clearing the devastated zone and rebuilding public infrastructure, about twice what Congress appropriated three weeks ago for those purposes. He is also seeking about $20 billion to stimulate the economy, including $3 billion for transportation projects around the state and $12 billion in additional federal aid to make up for lost tax revenues. 
Also included is a request for $2 billion in tax-exempt bonds, grants and other incentives to encourage businesses to stay and rebuild in Manhattan.
The governor met with senior White House aides for more than a hour in the morning, then arrived at the Capitol for a 35-minute session with Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican, other senior Republican leaders, among them the majority leader, Dick Armey, and the majority whip, Tom DeLay, both of Texas. Most of the New York delegation also attended.
After the meeting, Representative John Sweeney of New York said that Mr. Hastert had not blanched at the size of the request. "We got a commitment to keep working," he said. "They want to see all the details finalized. There was no sticker shock."
After meeting with Mr. Hastert, Mr. Pataki held a news conference outside the gleaming Capitol, flanked by New York's senators and representatives, and sounded the same themes he has repeated in recent days: that the disaster had hurt New York State in unique ways; that the attack was really aimed at the entire nation; and that saving New York State's economy was the key to saving the nation's economy. 
"New York's recovery is America's recovery," he said.
A half-hour later, the governor spoke along with Senator Lott and the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, at a ceremony to announce a Senate resolution marking Sept. 11 as a national day of recognition, like Pearl Harbor Day. All three delivered soaring rhetorical flourishes about a new spirit of patriotism that transcends partisan politics as well as the nation's determination to defeat Islamic fundamentalist terrorists.
The public spirit of unity cooled somewhat in closed-door meetings between the governor and Senate leaders in the afternoon. Senator Lott expressed sympathy for New York's plight during a 15-minute meeting just after the ceremony, but then asked the governor to provide a more detailed analysis justifying his need for $17 billion more to deal with the disaster, an aide to the senator said.
In later meetings with Senator Daschle and Senator Byrd, the governor faced questions about why the federal government should reimburse the state for tax revenues lost as a result of the disaster, people with knowledge of the talks said. As a general rule, Congress has never made local governments whole for lost revenues after natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes.
Governor Pataki, a Republican, also ran into some resistance to his proposal to have the federal government pay for $3 billion worth of transportation projects, including road, bridge and rail projects in upstate New York. Privately, some lawmakers here have said that those requests smack of pork-barrel projects, an assertion the governor vehemently denies.
"I believe investing in infrastructure is one of the best ways of investing in the economy," Mr. Pataki said at his news conference.
By the end of the day, the governor acknowledged that it would be very difficult to get everything he had asked for, though he added that "the impression I came away with was one of encouragement."
"We don't expect everyone to stand up tomorrow and say, This is great, and pass it," the governor said as he left Washington. "The whole package requires work."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE INSURERS; 
Government Role at Issue In Proposal to Help Industry

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON with JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
As the nation's leading insurers have coalesced around an aid package to protect them against losses from future terrorist attacks, an ideological rift has developed both within the administration and in Congress about the government role in protecting industries in distress.
 The conflicting advice being presented to President Bush remains a big obstacle to the passage of a bill that several lawmakers are preparing to introduce shortly, in the hopes of getting final passage before Congress goes into recess in a few weeks. While leading senators are leaning toward setting up a government-backed insurer like the one that exists in Britain, officials said that deep divisions within the administration in recent days have delayed the White House from issuing its own proposal. 
 Industry executives say it is essential that Congress adopt an aid package because many policies expire at the end of the year, and reinsurers, who insure the insurers, have already announced their intention to pull out of the business of offering terrorist coverage. 
The insurance industry -- supported by other industries that rely on insurance like lenders, manufacturers and real estate companies -- has proposed setting up a reinsurance company financed initially by the industry and backed by the Treasury. This company would soak up much of the costs associated with any large terrorist attacks.
Within the administration, the camp supporting forceful government intervention is being led by Peter R. Fisher, under secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Fisher, who has had more experience on Wall Street and in managing financial crises than any other senior Bush adviser, is said to be sympathetic to fears that the drying up of insurance could harm the economy by discouraging lending for real estate, construction and manufacturing.
But other top officials, most notably Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's senior economic adviser, are described as being cool to the creation of a new government-backed company involved in setting premiums, and about the establishment of an open-ended liability that could cost taxpayers many billions of dollars. Concerned about the establishment of a new government bureaucracy, Mr. Lindsey wants to rely on a more market-based solution, according to people who have talked to him. 
Administration officials have recently been discussing a proposal that would not set up a reinsurance company but would simply set a cap on all terrorism liability and then have the government pay the rest. Some Republicans have also been floating a tax break for insurers to encourage them to cover claims from future terrorist attacks.
In Congress, the ideological rift is accompanied by a geographic divide. Lawmakers in the Northeast, hit hardest by the attack and home to many insurers and other affected financial institutions, are more sympathetic to an aid package than those elsewhere. 
Senator Chris Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, is preparing to introduce legislation shortly that would establish a government-backed reinsurance company to issue terrorism coverage similar to the one in place in Britain since shortly after terrorist attacks by the Irish Republican Army in the early 1990's. In the House, Representative Mike Oxley, an Ohio Republican who heads the financial services committee and is more skeptical of government aid, is preparing to hold hearings next week.
This week senior executives from leading insurance companies blanketed Capitol Hill and top White House offices, making the case for the government-backed reinsurance company. The industry also circulated legislation that would sharply limit its losses in future terrorist attacks and make the government responsible for any additional costs. 
The legislation would require each insurer to pay 5 percent of the cost of an attack. For a future attack with losses of $40 billion, about the size of the losses from Sept. 11, the insurers would have to pay $2 billion each, significantly more than most are now facing. 
Under the proposed legislation, a company called the Homeland Security Reinsurance Company would be set up. Its capital would be created through premiums. 
In the event of an attack in the first year of the company's existence, all but 5 percent of any claims would be paid by the government. Then the new company would be liable for additional claims of up to $8 billion. The government would pay for claims exceeding that limit.
Since the establishment of the insurance plan in Britain, the pool has paid claims from several attacks and the government so far has paid nothing. 
But the mere commitment of the government to take on the worst cases has helped calm the British insurance market and restrain prices. American insurers say their propoposal would have the same effect. "If legislation is passed that provides for sufficient predictability, it will stabilize the market," said Joel Freedman, the director of government affairs for the Hartford Financial Services Group.
In the insurers' proposal, they would sell the terrorist coverage, keep 5 percent of the premium to match their risk and pass along the rest to the Homeland company. Once the new company had $10 billion on hand, any other premiums would be forwarded to the government. The program would be voluntary for both insurers and their customers.
The insurers say the proposal represents their best thinking on the subject, but they are prepared to compromise. "The details, to the industry, are somewhat unimportant," said Julie Rochman, the spokeswoman for the American Insurance Association, "provided that the mechanism creates the ability for insurers and businesses to get their arms around the terrorist risk. The terrorists present the industry now with potentially infinite losses. This proposal provides some predictability and limits to losses."

HEADLINE: Into the Homestretch 

 BODY:
Now that the Democratic Party has finally selected Mark Green as its nominee, the final campaign for mayor of New York City can begin in earnest. There are three and a half weeks to go before the general election on Nov. 6. That should be plenty of time for a serious discussion of the issues, as long as both Mr. Green and his Republican opponent, Michael Bloomberg, are willing to engage in a frank and open debate over who can best revive the city. 
 The tragedy at the World Trade Center that has dominated this election and skewed its calendar gave voters only a brief time to hear from the last two standing Democrats, Mr. Green and Fernando Ferrer, about their plans for rebuilding the city. Nevertheless, they were questioned and prodded in the final days of their campaign by a city increasingly desperate to figure out who was better equipped to lead at a time of crisis. Meanwhile, Mr. Bloomberg presented voters only his best side, courtesy of more than $1 million a week in political commercials. That easy ride is over. 
 Mr. Bloomberg will now be the focus of the electorate's more critical attentions. Voters need to learn more about the skills and weaknesses of this political newcomer, a billionaire businessman who has never been a candidate for office before. Mr. Bloomberg has released some general ideas about the need to rebuild Lower Manhattan, promising specifics soon. As of today, the time for promising is over. He needs to flesh out his vision of how to restore the city's financial district.
Mr. Bloomberg, in his TV commercials, has portrayed himself as a proven administrator, thanks to his experience as owner of Bloomberg L.P., his financial news services company. But New York's mayor is not simply a glorified city manager. The job is one of the toughest political positions in the world. Whoever succeeds Rudolph Giuliani will have to be able to think clearly while under assault from a dozen different directions. The heat of the next 26 days of campaigning should give Mr. Bloomberg ample opportunity to prove how well he can take the pressure.
From now on, the mayoral candidates will dominate the city's political stage. The voters have already determined that William Thompson will be the next comptroller and Betsy Gotbaum the public advocate, since there are no Republican candidates for these citywide positions. There are still a few local contests to be decided in competitive Council districts. But in most of the city, the Democratic primary has answered all questions except the one of overriding importance: Who will become mayor at the time when New York is in the most desperate need of strong, inclusive leadership?
Mr. Green will have some new challenges of his own. During the runoff, he found himself in the novel position of being the candidate of conservative white voters, while Mr. Ferrer won the vast majority of minority voters. Now, as the Democratic nominee, Mr. Green will need to reunite his party.
Both candidates have an obligation to be frank about their plans for the budget. The next mayor will have to cut in places where most people would rather see additional spending and disappoint city workers who have good reason to feel they deserve substantial raises. No candidate willingly reveals what popular services he intends to eliminate. But the city deserves to be able to compare the mayoral candidates' priorities before it goes to the polls again.

Maybe Now, Some Talk Of Issues

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
HISTORY is against him. So are the polls and the political realities of New York. Though he's spent $29 million of his own money so far, Michael R. Bloomberg, the Republican candidate for mayor, has to be considered very much the long shot in his race against Mark Green.
 But though the nomination of a Democrat usually signals the end of a mayoral campaign in this overwhelmingly Democratic town, Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman, is still running, and running hard, on the serious issues confronting New York in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attack. 
 And no longer the student-pol he was when he entered the race in June, Mr. Bloomberg, though still a bit distant and formal, has learned how to deliver his message.
That message is a sobering one. He and his cadre of handsomely compensated advisers have clearly thought about the task of rebuilding the financial center and the economy. He is focusing on it now as he ratchets up his campaign -- and that means he will force a candid discussion of issues that Mr. Green and Fernando Ferrer debated for real only in the last days of the Democratic runoff. Mr. Green did raise some of them early on and ultimately said that nothing was more important to the city's immediate future than recovering from the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. But he could never quite engage Mr. Ferrer, who long avoided specifics.
Now, with Mr. Green and Mr. Bloomberg talking a similar language, New Yorkers will finally be prepared for the hard times ahead and begin to understand and accept the implications for everything from housing and education to the quality of life that had so improved with the booming economy of the past eight years.
Mr. Bloomberg, perhaps freed to speak out by the long odds against him, is now raising these issues frequently -- though so far without details or proposed solutions. 
Speaking to the Associated Builders and Owners of Greater New York yesterday, he said, for instance, that the city needed 100,000 new units to deal with its housing shortage and more schools in crowded neighborhoods. Describing the sprawling Co-Op City development in the Bronx, he said that 100,000 units translated into seven Co-Op cities, and told the admiring lunch audience in a private club on Gramercy Park that Queens didn't have adequate school space for 27,000 students.
He also said that the city would probably have to reduce services other than police and fire protection and cut some of the city work force -- but not wages. He said that raising taxes was "just not an option" because it would hurt business, rejected the idea of rebuilding some financial businesses outside Manhattan, and said that the city's gravest problem was not rebuilding buildings but restoring its image.
"What has really changed, what is much more damaging for us, New York represented a safe place to come," he said. "All of a sudden that is being questioned."
Mr. Bloomberg was also upbeat at points, saying, "The best is yet to come for New York City." 
HE later told reporters that when the city's greatest problem was crime, it elected a prosecutor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and now that it is in economic trouble and has to rebuild, it needs a business mind and manager -- him.
The analogy is far from perfect. While Mr. Giuliani had never run anything the size of New York City, he had worked in public life for years when he ran for mayor for the first time, and lost to David N. Dinkins in 1989.
Mr. Bloomberg not only has no experience as a candidate, but also none in government. He has never had to negotiate the shoals of New York's complicated ethnic, immigrant and religious politics, has never had to negotiate a contract with a contentious public labor union or a bill with the City Council. He founded and runs a successful company, but it has only 8,000 employees and no stockholders.
Mr. Green already has criticized his opponent's lack of experience and free-spending issues in his victory speech last night, and will no doubt be echoed by prominent Democrats, including Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton and her husband, the former president.
As a newcomer and a lifelong Democrat-turned-Republican in a city that elects a Republican mayor once in a generation, Mr. Bloomberg has to know how unlikely it is that he will find himself in City Hall come January, even if he gets Mr. Giuliani's endorsement.
But as a supporter of Mr. Green put it last night, "He'll make it interesting. Mark cannot coast."

HEADLINE: THE NEW YORK RUNOFF: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
A Battle of the Resumes

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
In a city hammered by crisis, the mayoral contest between Michael R. Bloomberg and Mark Green that begins today is shaping up as a fight over qualifications rather than issues: which of two men who have spent their lives in very different ways is better suited to lead New York through the difficult years ahead.
 Despite their party differences -- Mr. Bloomberg is a Republican, if only recently, while Mr. Green is a Democrat -- the two men hold similar views on issues varying from abortion to the death penalty to opposing tax increases. And in an environment where both candidates have made clear that the World Trade Center is the pre-eminent issue facing New York's next mayor, strategists for both men last night were describing the contest ahead in strikingly similar terms. 
 On one side is Mr. Green, the public advocate, a man who has made a career working in government or running for office, and who is familiar with almost every face and hallway in City Hall. "This is about understanding city government and how it works, and understanding the city," said Joe DePlasco, Mr. Green's spokesman, in describing how Mr. Green would press the argument now. 
On the other is Mr. Bloomberg, who founded Bloomberg LP, a giant business media company, who is spending millions of dollars of his own fortune on his first campaign for office, and who presents himself as independent of the encumbrances that obligate career politicians. "A leader -- not a politician," says the tag line in his latest advertisement.
To some extent, this contrast would most likely have provided the contours for any general election campaign that featured Mr. Bloomberg and any of the Democrats, even before the Sept. 11 attack. But if Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Green agree on anything, it is that the crisis has placed a premium on the qualifications and experience of anyone who wants to lead New York now. 
What they disagree on is whether New York would be better served by someone who knows government, or someone who is able to defy some of its traditional forces and demands.
In this regard, Mr. Bloomberg's advisers are moving to turn what Mr. Green views as his advantage going into this race, his years in public life, into a deficit. And they are trying to do it with the same issue that Mr. Green used to great effect against Mr. Ferrer: the challenge posed by the destruction of the World Trade Center.
"We have a huge issue facing this city: How do you stabilize the city's economy and rebuild Lower Manhattan?" said William Cunningham, one of Mr. Bloomberg's senior advisers. "The question to Mark is, what experience does he have in management of anything?"
Mr. Cunningham added: "In this matchup, with the set of challenges facing the city, it is Mike's resume that matches the job. And it is not anyone who simply knows how to write press releases. And it is not somebody who has spent his lifetime running campaigns for office, never having to be accountable or justify himself or his budget to anyone."
Mr. DePlasco, offering a taste of what he promised last night would be a "very aggressive" campaign, suggested that Mr. Green would argue that Mr. Bloomberg was unqualified not only because he is so unfamiliar with government but because the billionaire entrepreneur has had little exposure to different social and economic parts of New York.
And Mr. Green gave a hint of what is ahead in his victory speech last night. "For me, public service has never been a sport, and has never been a hobby," he said, in an allusion to Mr. Bloomberg that drew hoots of delight from his partisan crowd. "Service to others is my life's work, from when I was a young public interest lawyer in Washington, and now after over a decade in public life."
For Mr. Bloomberg, more than for Mr. Green, this attempt to turn the election on the candidates' resumes may be the way to go. For all his money, New York remains an overwhelmingly Democratic city.
In describing his own prospects, Mr. Bloomberg likes to compare himself with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican who was first elected in 1993, and who remains highly popular. (Nearly 70 percent of Democrats who voted yesterday said they approved of his performance.)
But the fact remains that in the history of New York City, no two Republicans have ever served back-to-back terms in City Hall.
A New York Times/CBS News Poll taken from Oct. 6 to Oct. 9 suggests that that pattern is not about to change. Among those respondents who said they would definitely vote, 50 percent said they supported Mr. Green, compared with 26 percent who named Mr. Bloomberg.
The poll suggested that Mr. Bloomberg's aides were correct in saying before the primary that they hoped Mr. Ferrer would win: Mr. Bloomberg would draw 35 percent to 48 percent for Mr. Ferrer, giving Mr. Bloomberg less of a deficit to make up. The poll of 726 registered voters had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
And Mr. Green comes into this campaign with a number of institutional and political strengths. 
He emerged from the runoff relatively unscathed, barely attacked by Mr. Ferrer and endorsed by The Daily News, The New York Post and The New York Times, an improbable lineup of editorial pages. (Newsday endorsed Mr. Ferrer.)
Mr. Green clearly angered some of Mr. Ferrer's supporters with his tough campaign tactics in the final days. "Some of us are incredibly unhappy and angry about the way Mr. Green ran this race," Dennis Rivera, the head of the health care workers union, said on NY1 News last night, shortly before Mr. Ferrer conceded. "He has a lot to do to heal the wounds."
But in the end, officials like Mr. Rivera are likely to find that they have no place to go in a race between Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Bloomberg, particularly with Mr. Green beginning last night to begin to make amends to Ferrer supporters who felt that he had gone too far with his attacks.
Thus, Mr. Green will almost certainly be able to corral the support of the city's major unions and Democratic leaders. And something that seemed to be a big disadvantage for Mr. Green over the past two weeks -- his failure to win the support of the teachers union, municipal workers union or health care union -- will complicate any attempt by Mr. Bloomberg to present Mr. Green as indebted to labor.
Josh Isay, a Democratic consultant who worked for Alan G. Hevesi, one of Mr. Green's rivals in the primary, said: "Mark could not have hoped for a better runoff. He comes out of this as moderate and responsible and independent."
Mr. Bloomberg's supporters argued yesterday that voters would want the clean and independent thinking of a business leader when it comes to directing the rebuilding of Manhattan and keeping corporations in New York City. But even some Republicans were suggesting that the last thing voters would want now is anything approaching instability.
"You really can't point to business figures winning elections in New York," said Joseph Mercurio, a Republican consultant who worked for the campaign of Mr. Bloomberg's opponent in the Republican primary, Herman Badillo. "People are going to want mature, experienced Democratic officials to be re-elected -- not new people coming in who are business leaders."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: AIRLINE SAFETY; 
Senate Votes to Federalize Job of Airport Screening

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
With sponsors calling air travel a national security matter, the Senate unanimously passed legislation today intended to make flying safer by federalizing the job of passenger and baggage screening at major airports and requiring that all suitcases and bags be examined.
 The legislation, which passed on a vote of 100 to 0 but faces resistance in the House, would create a new Justice Department work force of 28,000 people to screen passengers, checked luggage and carry-on bags at 142 major airports. 
 At smaller airports, the government could use either the new workers or, at federal expense, state and local law enforcement officers, who would undergo the same training as the federal screeners.
The airlines now contract screening to low-bidding security companies, which pay many screeners the minimum wage. The airlines support the bill, which calls for a $2.50 surcharge on each ticket to cover the cost of the security overhaul. The bill does not specify how much the federal screeners would be paid. 
"This is a function of government," said one author of the legislation, Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who heads the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. "No one is putting in measures to privatize the Capitol police or the Secret Service. We are going to give some protection to the traveling public."
Mr. Hollings's co-author was Senator John McCain of Arizona, the committee's senior Republican, who said of the move to create a new federal work force: "I do not advocate this move lightly. But the attack last month was an act of war, and we must respond accordingly."
The Bush administration had earlier indicated that it could support the bill despite preferring legislation that would limit the government's new role at airports to oversight rather than hands-on screening.
While commending the Senate for acting, the White House said in a statement tonight that President Bush "has serious concerns that full federalization of the screener work force" could cause significant problems. Mr. Bush's transportation secretary, Norman Y. Mineta, told lawmakers last week that the transition could prove chaotic.
Most Republican senators fought for the White House position for more than a week, then voted for the bipartisan Senate bill anyway.
But the legislation's prospects appear uncertain in the House, where Republicans led by Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, vehemently oppose any effort to turn screeners into federal employees. Mr. DeLay lacks the votes to pass the White House version of the bill, so legislation is stalled.
"We know that the Europeans and Israelis both attempted to provide airline security through complete government control," Mr. DeLay said. "They all walked away from that flawed approach in the 1980's, when airline security failed to improve."
Still, the Senate is hoping that the unanimous approval of its bill, and Democratic pressure, will spur the House to pass a similar measure.
The legislation is intended to renew consumer confidence in air travel by requiring steps to prevent hijackers from boarding and taking control of planes as on Sept. 11.
Chief among the requirements is the federalized work force. Under the legislation, its members could be fired or suspended by the Justice Department and, regardless of Civil Service laws, would not be permitted to strike.
Another change that the bill would mandate is the X-raying of all baggage before it gets on the plane. Before last month, only some bags were X-rayed.
The Senate's adoption of this provision came against the backdrop of an unsettling finding by the Transportation Department's inspector general. Although the Federal Aviation Administration recently placed new bomb detection machines inside 50 airports, inspections in the last week at 7 of the nation's 20 highest-risk airports found that most airlines were not complying with new federal orders to scan all checked baggage for explosives, the inspector general said today. The inspector general did not identify the airports.
Another provision of the bill would require airport workers with access to restricted areas to undergo criminal background checks. And armed law enforcement officers would supervise the screening and monitor planes on the tarmac.
The bill initially placed the baggage screening process in the hands of the Transportation Department, but it was amended today to give the Justice Department instead the responsibility for hiring, training, supervising and employing the screeners. The cost, $1.2 billion to $2 billion a year, would be covered by the passenger surcharge. It could take at least six months to hire and train the new workers.
Airplanes would be fitted with reinforced cockpit doors accessible only to pilots, and any attempt to enter the cockpit would require the pilot to radio in and land the plane at the nearest airport. The bill would also expand a program that places armed federal marshals on planes. And it would authorize the F.A.A. to allow pilots to carry guns.
Earlier in the day, the Senate defeated an amendment that would have expanded unemployment benefits and provided 12 months of health insurance premiums for workers laid off by the airlines, airports, aircraft manufacturers and airline suppliers.
Because of a Republican filibuster against it, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass. It drew 56, enough to prompt its supporters to say they would revive its provisions later.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Australia: Australia: Murdoch Expects Flat Year 

BYLINE:  By Becky Gaylord (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, said the immediate effects of the Sept. 11 attacks cost the company at least $100 million. 
In the two weeks after the tragedy, advertising bookings were virtually nonexistent, Mr. Murdoch told the annual general meeting in Adelaide. However, despite the global economic downturn and an uncertain advertising market, results this fiscal year will be flat against the prior year, he predicted. But promising signs have emerged, he said. Television revenue bookings are higher than in recent months. Also, the company is in talks with the Hughes Electronics Corporation over its satellite unit, DirecTV. There is a 50-50 chance a deal will be struck, Mr. Murdoch said. Becky Gaylord (NYT)

HEADLINE: THE NEW YORK RUNOFF: THE DEMOCRATS; 
Green Beats Ferrer in Democratic Mayoral Runoff

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Against a backdrop of civic trauma and deep anxiety about the future of New York City, Mark Green won the Democratic nomination for mayor last night. He defeated Fernando Ferrer in a racially divided contest in which voters embraced Mr. Green's declaration that recovering from the World Trade Center attack should be the central focus of New York's next mayor.
 The victory by Mr. Green, the city's public advocate, derailed the second attempt in four years by Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, to become New York's first Puerto Rican mayor. But Mr. Ferrer came close to assembling a winning coalition of Hispanic and black voters, in a way that suggested that this election marked a new chapter in the continuing ethnic and political realignment in New York. One-quarter of the primary electorate was Hispanic, and the turnout of more than 800,000 was even higher than it was in the first round of Democratic voting on Sept. 25. 
 Mr. Ferrer called Mr. Green to concede at 10:40 p.m., before heading down to address supporters at the headquarters of 1199/S.E.I.U., New York's Health and Human Service Union, on West 43rd Street. 
"Losing is never easy," a subdued Mr. Ferrer said, after shushing some in the crowd who booed upon hearing that he had called to congratulate Mr. Green. "But on Sept. 11, something happened here in the city of New York that very quickly put the concept of loss in perspective."
Speaking into a microphone adorned with a tiny American flag, he said, "I want you to hear this clearly: You opened a door that will never be closed again."
Mr. Green declared victory at 11:15 p.m, bounding onto the stage at the Sheraton New York in Midtown with his wife, Deni Frand, and two children, Jonah and Jenya. He immediately attended to two political imperatives: addressing the concerns of Ferrer supporters who were upset about the hard-hitting campaign Mr. Green directed at Mr. Ferrer in the final hours of the contest, and setting out the themes that he would use in the general election against Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire communications entrepreneur and Republican nominee for mayor.
Mr. Green praised Mr. Ferrer as "an extraordinary leader of idealism and vision and eloquence." He added, "We need you, we need your ideas and I can't wait to speak to you and your supporters to unite with us and win in November."
And alluding to Mr. Bloomberg, he said, "Now more than ever, New York needs experience that money can't buy, because mayor is not an entry-level position."
He then chanted: "Message beats money! Message beats money!"
With 100 percent of the returns tallied, Mr. Green led Mr. Ferrer by 52 percent to 48 percent, according to unofficial returns provided by The Associated Press.
With his victory last night, Mr. Green heads into an abbreviated 26-day general election campaign with Mr. Bloomberg, who is financing his own campaign for mayor at a multimillion-dollar-a-week clip. Mr. Green's advisers said that he had $4 million on hand to finance the race but that one of his first tasks now was a quick burst of fund-raising to counter Mr. Bloomberg's financial advantage.
And they began laying out what they said would be Mr. Green's central argument: that New Yorkers could not, in this crisis, afford to elect someone for mayor who had never before held public office.
Mr. Green, 56, who began his career at the side of Ralph Nader, won his party's nomination at the end of a primary conducted during what may have been the most traumatic stretch in the history of this city. The terrorist attack on the trade center occurred three hours after voting had began on what was supposed to have been Primary Day. From that day on, it shaped how much politicking the candidates believed they could appropriately do, what they talked about, their struggle to win the attention of voters, and even the date of the election itself.
The victory by Mr. Green came after two weeks in which a characteristically confident candidate, who for most of the year had presented himself as the favorite to win the nomination, made what his own aides described as a series of mistakes. That included running an overly cautious campaign, in contrast to Mr. Ferrer's harder-edged promise to represent "the other New York," to agreeing to a request by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to extend his term by up to three months. That decision was sharply attacked by Mr. Ferrer.
By last Friday, when Mr. Green's internal polls showed his candidacy in danger of collapse, the public advocate commenced a series of attacks on Mr. Ferrer, questioning his ability to lead New York through this era, arguing that he did not appreciate the magnitude of the trade center crisis, and had shifted his positions on issues of concern to Democratic primary voters, in particular the death penalty and abortion.
Mr. Green's campaign broadcast a last-minute television advertisement that ended by demanding, "Can we take a chance" on Mr. Ferrer? Mr. Green's campaign kept up the barrage with automated telephone calls and mailings throughout the last day of the contest.
Accordingly, Mr. Green's campaign advisers displayed a wave of relief upon learning of the first round of surveys of voters leaving the polls that suggested he was heading for a victory. "I hate losing," one of his advisers said sarcastically, shortly after learning the numbers. Mr. Green's press office sent out a victory-lap schedule for Friday at 5:08 p.m. yesterday, though taking care to mark it as "of course, a tentative schedule."
Mr. Green's victory ended an elongated primary campaign that, in the end, served to reinforce the central theme of Mr. Ferrer's campaign: that New York is two cities, which, based on ethnicity, race and economic status, held very different views about who should succeed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
According to a survey of voters leaving the polls, Mr. Ferrer, 51, defeated Mr. Green by huge margins among Latino and black voters, as well as among those earning under $30,000 a year. By contrast, Mr. Green received more than 80 percent of the white vote, who made up almost 50 percent of the turnout. He had overwhelming support among those Democrats who said they made over $100,000 a year.
Mr. Green was clearly helped by Mr. Ferrer's decision to align himself with the Rev. Al Sharpton, who stood right behind Mr. Ferrer as he conceded last night. While Mr. Sharpton helped Mr. Ferrer win enough black support to come in first in the multicandidate Democratic field in the first round of the primary, it appeared to contribute to his failure to attract the white voters that his advisers had always believed were crucial to his chances of defeating Mr. Green. Nearly two-thirds of white voters said that Mr. Sharpton's endorsement made them less likely to vote for Mr. Ferrer.
Mr. Ferrer's advisers said that Mr. Green's supporters had been distributing copies of cartoons from The New York Post that portrayed, in various manifestations, Mr. Ferrer as the diminutive puppet to a balloon-bellied Mr. Sharpton, as part of their last-minute campaign efforts. Mr. Green's aides denied that they had circulated the cartoons. 
Mr. Sharpton, in an interview, said he did not believe that he had hurt Mr. Ferrer's campaign, and said that Mr. Ferrer's advisers had erred in not putting him out more prominently in the final days of the campaign.
Mr. Sharpton said the results, by their closeness, had shown "the strength of our coalition."
"Clearly, he said, "the Democratic Party can't function without us. That's clear, no matter what happens."
In contrast to Mr. Ferrer's decision to align himself with Mr. Sharpton, Mr. Green's decision to make the World Trade Center attack central to his campaign rebounded to his benefit. 
The public advocate issued a series of speeches about what he would do to deal with reconstruction and security in the wake of the attack, and regularly described it as the most important issue facing New York. By contrast, Mr. Ferrer repeatedly said that the crisis in Lower Manhattan should not overshadow New York City's effort to deal with existing problems, and he proposed dispersing some of the reconstruction in the financial center to other parts of New York City.
Mr. Green did markedly better with voters who said that preventing future terrorist attacks and rebuilding the financial district should be the top concerns of the next mayor. Mr. Green also did overwhelmingly better among voters who said that being a strong leader or having experience in government was the top consideration for the job. 
That said, Mr. Ferrer's supporters clearly liked their candidate more than Mr. Green's liked theirs. Among Mr. Ferrer's supporters, about two-thirds said they were voting for him because they strongly favored him. By contrast, just 4 in 10 said they were voting for Mr. Green because they strongly supported him.
Mr. Green does, though, appear to be an inheritor of Mr. Giuliani's voters. Mr. Green won the support of nearly two-thirds of the Democrats who said they approved of Mr. Giuliani's job performance.

The Polling Method
The Election Day poll was based on questionnaires completed by voters as they left voting stations throughout New York City yesterday. Questionnaires were available in English or Spanish. It was conducted by Edison Media Research of Somerville, N.J.
The results are based on 1,380 Democratic primary runoff voters in 40 randomly selected voting districts.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by no more than plus or minus 4 percentage points from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all Democratic voters who turned out.
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day, such as the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out the questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Projects' Sponsors Worry About City Cutbacks 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

 BODY:
The developers of two high-profile cultural projects proposed for Downtown Brooklyn are worried that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's call to trim $1 billion in city spending will stall their plans, which depend partly on millions of dollars in city funding.
 Harvey Lichtenstein, chairman of the Brooklyn Academy of Music Local Development Corporation, the group behind a 10-year, $633 million plan to build arts spaces and low-income loft housing in Fort Greene, said he supported the mayor's efforts to guide the city out of the economic downfall caused by the World Trade Center attack. He also said he was concerned that promises of help from the city for projects far away from the site of the attack might be overlooked as efforts are focused on Lower Manhattan. 
 "We're caught between a rock and a hard place," Mr. Lichtenstein said. "We totally understand what happened in this city on Sept. 11. How could anyone not be in favor of rebuilding Lower Manhattan? But at the same time we really feel that what we've started here in Brooklyn is still very important to this city's well-being." 
Mr. Lichtenstein had planned to begin collecting on a $50 million pledge made earlier this year by Mayor Giuliani. The money was to go toward restoring and redesigning a long-empty eight-story building at 80 Hanson Place, which would become home to small arts groups unable to afford office space in Manhattan. 
Mr. Lichtenstein acknowledges that the city's pledge is a small fraction of the project's overall cost. But he considers the city financing crucial because of what it will mean to prospective investors for the next phase of development -- subsidized and market-rate housing. 
"It's critical in terms of leveraging the private dollars," he said. "Support from the city absolutely encourages companies. If we lose that support now, God knows when a project like this can ever get going again."
Equally concerned is Joanne Witty, president of the Brooklyn Bridge Park Development Corporation, which is leading the efforts to build a $150 million park at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge.
On the day of the terrorist attack, the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission was to complete hearings on a request from Mayor Giuliani to demolish a city-owned warehouse beneath the bridge to make room for the 71-acre park. The mayor announced the plan in June, when he pledged to spend $10 million by the end of the year for the demolition and the design of several historic streets along the park.
The demolition of the building is considered pivotal because it bisects the land to be used for the park, and removing it will allow planners to prepare a design for it. 
"We really don't have much of a reading as to where things stand," said Ms. Witty, "other than the fact that we know both the mayor and the governor were strongly committed to the park before Sept. 11."
Each year, the city allocates funds for a wide array of social and cultural development projects similar to the Brooklyn Academy cultural district and the Brooklyn Bridge park. City Hall has not yet released information on which capital projects might be delayed by the attack.
Some state projects could also be in jeopardy. Most of the expense of building the park, $87 million, was to be paid for by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a bistate agency. "It's something the governor continues to support," said Suzanne Morris, a spokeswoman for Gov. George E. Pataki. "But obviously in light of what's happened we're taking a look at everything, re-evaluating the entire budget."
Ms. Witty, while concerned about the city's and state's future involvement, said she had been trying to balance her concern for the project with her own grief. Several Port Authority employees with whom she had worked in developing the project were killed in the attack, including Neil D. Levin, the agency's executive director.
"I watched the entire thing from my stoop," said Ms. Witty, who lives in Brooklyn Heights. "Immediately, I started calling the Port Authority, leaving hysterical messages. These were people I worked with."
In the weeks since, she has reconnected with Port Authority partners of the project. But for now the conversations have steered clear of any talk about the park. "Right now, it doesn't feel right to even ask," she said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE WHITE HOUSE; 
BUSH OFFERS TALIBAN '2ND CHANCE' TO YIELD; SAYS HE'D WELCOME U.N. IN NATION-BUILDING; F.B.I. ISSUES ALERT ON SIGNS OF NEW TERROR

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER and ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that United States forces would attack Afghanistan for "as long as it takes" to destroy the Qaeda terrorist network of Osama bin Laden, but he offered to reconsider the military assault on Afghanistan if that country's ruling Taliban would surrender Mr. bin Laden.
 At a news conference in the White House, Mr. Bush also embraced for the first time the idea that the United Nations could play a central role in the rebuilding of Afghanistan after an eventual ousting of the radical Islamic Taliban government. 
 Mr. Bush tonight gave the Taliban another chance to halt America's military action by handing over Mr. bin Laden. 
"If you cough him up and his people today, then we'll reconsider what we are doing to your country," he said. "You still have a second chance." Excerpts, Page B4. 
"Just bring him in," he added. "And bring his leaders and lieutenants and other thugs and criminals with him."
Addressing how long American forces would be in Afghanistan, Mr. Bush said: "This particular battle front will last as long as it takes to bring Al Qaeda to justice. It may happen tomorrow, it may happen a month from now, it may take a year or two, but we will prevail."
Mr. Bush made a confident entrance to the formal setting of the East Room down a long red carpet, mounted his podium and delivered his opening statement in the somber tones of a leader in the midst of war. During 45 minutes of questioning, he made no verbal slip of any significance, resorted to humor at times, and otherwise conveyed the seriousness of the moment through a new gravitas -- seeming grayer, graver and more comfortable in the role.
He said Americans would have to get used to living with the kind of F.B.I. warning that was issued today about the threat of possible terrorist attacks in the United States in the next few days.
"This is not the first time the Justice Department has acted like this," the president said. "I hope it is the last. But given the attitude of the evil doers, it may not be."
It was one of many occasions on which he used the word "evil" to describe the terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. The effect was to cast the battle against terrorism on which the country has embarked in almost biblical terms.
On the fifth day of United States bombing raids against targets in Afghanistan, Mr. Bush described what he said would be a robust American commitment -- even asking every American child to send a dollar to the White House -- to rebuild Afghanistan, a nation destroyed by two decades of civil war and invasion.
"It would be a useful function for the United Nations to take over the 'nation building,' " he said. "I would call it the stabilization of a future government after our military mission is complete." 
That amounted to a substantial policy shift. It was the first time that the president had made an explicit commitment to involvement in Afghanistan beyond an ousting of the Taliban. He has previously been dismissive of "nation building" in devastated or failed states.
Mr. Bush's news conference was the first he had held in the formal setting of the East Room, and the first in prime time. His advisers said a president who until now rarely veered from a script had grown far more comfortable since Sept. 11 with the give-and-take from reporters. His answers were forthright and forthcoming, an evolution from the guarded tone of the first months of his presidency.
When asked if the F.B.I.'s general warning today accomplished little more than scaring people from resuming their daily lives, the president said the public should expect such alerts when the government receives threats, vague or specific. 
"On our TV screens the other day, we saw the evil one threatening, calling for more destruction and death in America," Mr. Bush said, referring to Mr. bin Laden. "I think the American people should be -- take comfort in the fact that their government is doing everything we possibly can do to run down every possible lead and take threats -- and we take threats seriously."
At the same time, he sought to reassure the country, saying many Americans were returning to regular routines, as much as they could after the Sept. 11 attacks. He said, for instance, that air travel and hotel bookings were picking up. "We are getting back to normal," he said. "We're doing so with a new sense of awareness."
In general, the president sought to tread a fine line between reassuring Americans and telling them to be on their guard against possible future attack. He urged them to go on with their lives because to do otherwise would be to give a victory to terrorism; at the same time, he called for vigilance.
Behind his appeal lurked at least this pressing consideration: The American economy is faltering, and if Americans do not return to something close to business as usual, the impact is likely to be severe.
The president said there were logical steps Americans could take to forestall another attack, but when asked to give some practical advice about what Americans should be on guard against, he resorted to humor. "If you find a person that you've never seen before getting in a crop duster that doesn't belong to you, report it," he said to laughter.
Vice President Dick Cheney has been kept sequestered in an unspecified "secure location" for much of the last two weeks. The president said that Mr. Cheney was in the Oval Office this afternoon, but that they had an obligation to insure that one of them would be available to lead if the other was killed.
"We take very seriously the notion of the continuity of government," he said. "It's a responsibility we share, to make sure that under situations such as this, when there are possible threats facing our government, that we separate ourselves for the sake of continuity of our government." 
He added that he had "welcomed" Mr. Cheney "out of his secure location," as if the vice president were back from confinement, and reported that "he's looking swell."
The president closed his news conference with an appeal to the nation's children to help the children of Afghanistan. He urged each American child to send a dollar to the White House for a new fund to be run by the American Red Cross, to provide relief aid for Afghan children.
"One in three Afghan children is an orphan," Mr. Bush said. "Almost half suffer chronic malnutrition. And we can and must help them."
On the subject of security, Mr. Bush said that if federal officials received "specific intelligence," a credible threat against a specific building or city, "I can assure you our government will do everything" it can to protect citizens there.
That, he said, is what his administration did after receiving information that an operative from Al Qaeda might spread toxic chemicals from a crop duster plane.
Mr. Bush said the primary lesson he had learned from Vietnam was that it is impossible to fight a guerrilla war with only conventional forces. The United States and its allies now, he continued, were not only using military force but also cutting off the money that allows the terrorists to operate and rounding up suspected members of terrorist groups at home and abroad. 
"Slowly but surely we're smoking Al Qaeda out of their caves so we can bring them to justice," he said. "This particular battlefront will last as long as it takes to bring Al Qaeda to justice."
"I am determined to stay the course," the president added. "We must rid the world of terrorists so our children and grandchildren can grow up in freedom."
Can you rid the world of terrorism if you cannot find Osama bin Laden to kill him, Mr. Bush was asked. He answered: "I don't know if he's dead or alive. I want him brought to justice, however."
He said the United States was following every possible lead to make sure that every member of Al Qaeda who might be in the United States is brought to justice. "We're chasing down the leads," he said.
He said that while the administration's focus was on Afghanistan, it was also monitoring President Saddam Hussein of Iraq closely. "There's no question that the leader of Iraq is an evil man," he said. "We're watching him very carefully." 
When asked if he would meet Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, Mr. Bush said he supported the aborted peace effort in the Middle East, but would leave that task to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, unless promising developments emerged. 
"My calendar's a little crowded right now," he said. "But if I'm convinced that a meeting with a particular party will further the process, I will do so." 
The president warned Americans against singling out people by race or religion. "Don't use this as an opportunity to pick on someone who doesn't look like you or who doesn't share your religion," he said. "If you see something suspicious or abnormal, report it to local law enforcement." 
Would he ask the American people to make sacrifices? The president said people already were sacrificing in ways both practical, like longer lines at airports, and spiritual.
"There's a certain sacrifice when you lose a piece of your soul," Mr. Bush said.
He went on to say that positive things have come from the attacks by bringing Americans together and putting on display the nation's tolerance for Islam and all religions.
"I believe many people are reassessing what's important in life," Mr. Bush said. "Moms and dads are not only reassessing their marriage and the importance of marriage, but the necessity of loving their children like never before."
The level of compassion in the United States is "overflowing," he said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED; 
Excerpts From the President's Remarks on the War on Terrorism

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference last night, as recorded by The New York Times:

Opening Statement
 I would like to report to the American people on the state of our war against terror. And then I'll be happy to take questions from the White House press corps. 
 One month ago today innocent citizens from more than 80 nations were attacked and killed without warning or provocation in an act that horrified not only every American but every person of every faith and every nation who values human life. 
The attack took place on American soil but it was an attack on the heart and soul of the civilized world. And the world has come together to fight a new and different war -- the first, and we hope, the only one of the 21st century. A war against all those who seek to export terror and a war against those governments that support or shelter them. We've accomplished a great deal in one month.
Our staunch friends, Great Britain, our neighbors, Canada and Mexico, our NATO allies, our allies in Asia, Russia and nations from every continent on the earth, have offered help of one kind or of another from military assistance to intelligence information to crack down on terrorists' financial networks.
This week 56 Islamic nations issued a statement strongly condemning the savage acts of terror and emphasizing that those acts contradict the peaceful teachings of Islam. All is strong and united on the diplomatic front.
The men and women of the United States military are doing their duty with skill and success. We have ruined terrorist training camps, disrupted their communications, weakened the Taliban military and destroyed most of their air defenses. We're mounting a sustained campaign to drive the terrorists out of their hidden caves and to bring them to justice. All missions are being executed according to plan on the military front.
At the same time we are showing the compassion of America by delivering food and medicine to the Afghan people, who are themselves the victims of a repressive regime.
On the law enforcement front terrorists are being swept up in an international dragnet. Several hundred have been arrested. Thousands of F.B.I. agents are on the trail of other suspects here and abroad.
Working with countries around the world we have frozen more than $24 million in Al Qaeda or Taliban assets.
We are aggressively pursuing the agents of terror around the world. And we are aggressively strengthening our protections here at home.
This week we established America's new Office of Homeland Security directed by former Gov. Tom Ridge. Americans tonight can know that while the threat is ongoing, we are taking every possible step to protect our country from danger.
Your government is doing everything we can to recover from these attacks and to try to prevent others. We're acting to make planes and airports safer, rebuild New York and the Pentagon. We must act to stimulate a slow economy and help laid off workers. And we must fund our military.
This is a time of testing -- this time of testing has revealed the true character of the American people. We're angry at the evil that was done to us, yet patient and just in our response.
Before Sept. 11 my administration was planning an initiative called "Communities of Character." It was designed to help parents develop good character in our children and to strengthen the spirit of citizenship and service in our communities. The acts of Sept. 11 have prompted that initiative to occur on its own, in ways far greater than I could have ever imagined. We have shown great love for our country and great tolerance and respect for all our countrymen.
I was struck by this, that in many cities when Christian and Jewish women learned that Muslim women, women of cover were afraid of going out of their homes alone, that they went shopping with them, that they showed true friendship and support, an act that shows the world the true nature of America.
Our war on terrorism has nothing to do with differences in faith. It has everything to do with people of all faiths coming together to condemn hate and evil and murder and prejudice.
One month after great suffering and sorrow, America's strong and determined and generous. I'm honored to lead such a country, and I know we are ready for the challenges ahead.

Questions and Answers

Q. You said that the threat is ongoing and indeed the deadly virus of anthrax was found in three Florida people this week. Osama bin Laden's spokesman said storms of planes are yet to be hijacked. The -- your F.B.I. warned just today that terrorist attacks could be happening again in the next couple days. If the F.B.I. knows of a credible threat, can you assure the public that you would take the precaution of locking down any system involved, whether it's buildings, airports, water systems, to prevent more deaths? And most importantly, is there anything you can say to Americans who feel helpless to protect themselves and their families from the next wave of attacks, if there are more to come? What can people do to protect themselves?

A. Sure. Today the Justice Department did issue a blanket alert. It was in recognition of a general threat we received. This is not the first time the Justice Department has acted like this. I hope it's the last. But given the attitude of the evildoers, it may not be. I have urged my -- our fellow Americans to go about their lives, to fly on airplanes, to travel, to go to work. But I also want to encourage them by telling them that our government's on full alert and that the alert put out today from the Justice Department was such an action.
Now, if we receive specific intelligence, where we -- a credible threat that targets a specific building or city or facility, I can assure you our government will do everything possible to protect the citizens around and in or near that facility. 
And let me give you one example of a specific threat we received. You may remember recently there was a lot of discussion about crop-dusters. We received knowledge that perhaps an Al Qaeda operative was prepared to use a crop-duster to spray a biological weapon or a chemical weapon on American people. And so we responded. We contacted every crop-dust location, airports from which crop-dusters leave. We notified crop-duster manufacturers to a potential threat. We knew full well that in order for a crop-duster to become a weapon of mass destruction require a retrofitting and so we talked to machine shops around where crop dusters are located. We took strong and appropriate action. And we will do so any time we receive a credible threat. 
Now, the American people have got to go about their business. We cannot let the terrorists achieve the objective of frightening our nation to the point where we don't conduct business, where people don't shop. That's their intention. Their intention was not only to kill and maim and destroy; their intention was to frighten to the point where our nation would not act. Their intention was to so frighten our government that we wouldn't seek justice, that somehow we would cower in the face of their threats and not respond, abroad or at home. 
We're both responding abroad and at home. The American people, obviously, if they see something that is suspicious, something out of the norm that looks suspicious, they ought to notify local law authorities. But in the meantime they ought to take comfort in knowing our government is doing everything we possibly can. 
We've got a Homeland Security Office now running, as I mentioned, headed by Tom Ridge. We're sharing intelligence with our friends and countries from overseas. We follow every lead. And information sharing between the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. is seamless so that the reaction to any threat is real-time. 
And -- but the truth of the matter is in order to fully defend America, we must defeat the evildoers where they hide. We must round them up. And we must bring them to justice. And that's exactly what we're doing in Afghanistan. The first battle in the war of the 21st century.

Q. You've been careful to avoid saying how long the military strikes in Afghanistan might take place. But can you promise to say how long American forces -- can you avoid being drawn into a Vietnam-like quagmire in Afghanistan?

A. We learned some very important lessons in Vietnam. Perhaps the most important lesson that I learned is that you cannot fight a guerrilla war with conventional forces. That's why I've explained to the American people that we're engaged in a different type of war. One obviously that we use conventional forces, but one in which we've got to fight on all fronts.
I remember saying to you all that the first shot in the war was when we started cutting off their money. Because an Al Qaeda organization can't function without money. And we're continuing our efforts to reach out to willing nations to disrupt and seize assets of the Al Qaeda organization. We are in the process of rounding up Al Qaeda members around the world. There are Al Qaeda organizations in roughly 68 countries. And over 200 have now been apprehended. And every time I talk to a world leader, I urge them to continue finding the Al Qaeda representatives and bring them to justice.
As far as the use of conventional forces, we've got a clear plan. And it's to say to the host government that you have been given your chance -- and by the way, I gave them ample opportunity to turn over Al Qaeda. I made it very clear to them, in no uncertain terms, that in order to avoid punishment they should turn over the parasites that hide in their country. They obviously refused to do so. And now they're paying a price. We are dismantling their military, disrupting their communications, severing their ability to defend themselves, and slowly but surely we're smoking Al Qaeda out of their caves so we can bring them to justice.
People often ask me: How long will this last? This particular battlefront will last as long as it takes to bring Al Qaeda to justice. It may happen tomorrow, it may happen a month from now, it may take a year or two. But we will prevail. And what the American people need to know is what our allies know: I am determined to stay the course. And we must do so, we must do so. We must rid the world of terror so our children and grandchildren can grow up in freedom. It is essential. It is now our time to act. And I'm proud to lead a country that understands that.

Q. Mr. President, today Defense Secretary Rumsfeld said that Osama bin Laden was probably still in Afghanistan. How can the U.S. get him dead or alive, to use words that you've used recently, if we're not entirely sure whether he's in the country? And can we win the war on terrorism if bin Laden is not found?

A. Ours is a war against terrorism in general. Mr. bin Laden is a -- is one of the worst. But as you may remember we published the 22 most wanted. He's one of 22 we're after.
In terms of Mr. bin Laden himself, we'll get him running, we'll smoke him out of his cave and we'll get him eventually.
But success or failure depends not on bin Laden, success or failure depends upon routing out terrorism where it may exist all around the world. He's just one person, a part of a network. And we're slowly but surely, with determined fashion, routing that network out and bringing them to justice.
We've been active for a month. I intend to be giving you a briefing for as long as I'm the president. I understand this is a unconventional war. It's a different kind of war. It's not the kind of war that we're used to in America. The greatest generation was used to storming beachheads. Baby boomers such as myself was used to getting caught in a quagmire of Vietnam where politics made decisions more than the military sometimes. Generation X was able to watch technology right in front of their TV screens, you know, burrow into concrete bunkers in Iraq. 
This is a different kind of war. It requires a different type of approach and a different type of mentality. And so we're going to slowly but surely tighten the net on terrorists wherever they live. And it's essential to do so now. It's essential to do so now. The actions my government takes in concert with other countries, the actions we take at home to defend ourselves, will serve as a go-by for future presidents or future prime ministers, in Britain, for example, or future F.B.I. directors. It is important that we stay the course, bring these people to justice and show others how to fight the new wars of the 21st century. Helen.

Q. Mr. President, on that note, we understand you have advisers who are urging you to go after Iraq, take out Iraq, Syria and so forth. Do you really think that the American people will tolerate you widening the war beyond Afghanistan? And I have a follow-up.

A. Thank you for warning me. Our focus is on Afghanistan and the terrorist network hiding in Afghanistan. Right now. But as well, we're looking for Al Qaeda cells around the world. If we find an Al Qaeda cell operating, we will urge the host country to bring them to justice. And we're having some progress, we're making progress. . . .
You mentioned Iraq. Now, there's no question that the leader of Iraq is an evil man. After all, he gassed his own people. We know he's been developing weapons of mass destruction. And I think it's in his advantage to allow inspectors back in his country to make sure that he's conforming to the agreement he made after he was soundly trounced in the Gulf war. And so we're watching him very carefully. We're watching him carefully. Your follow-up please. . . .

Q. You've met twice in the White House since you've been in office with Prime Minister Sharon. But you have refused to meet with Yasir Arafat. Now that you envision a Palestinian state, will you see and will you meet with Arafat? And if so, when?

A. I want to assure the American people, and particularly our allies who are interested in our position in the Middle East that we're spending a lot of time dealing with the Middle East. I know there was some concern amongst our allies when the Sept. 11, right after the Sept. 11 attack that we would forego any responsibility we have in the Middle East. Secretary of State Powell is doing a great job of staying in contact with both Mr. Arafat and Prime Minister Sharon.
I have met with Prime Minister Sharon and I assured him every time we met that he has no better friend than the United States of America.
I also stated the other day that if we ever get into the Mitchell process, where we can start discussing a political solution in the Middle East, that I believe there ought to be a Palestinian state, the boundaries of which will be negotiated by the parties, so long as the Palestinian state recognizes the right of Israel to exist and will treat Israel with respect and will be peaceful on her borders.
Obviously the events of Sept. 11 have prevented overt diplomacy in the Middle East. Not prevented it, it has made it -- my calendar's a little crowded.
On the other hand I am very much engaged. I have spoken to Prime Minister Sharon, again. And if I am convinced that a meeting with a particular party at this point in time will further the process, I will do so. If it turns out to be an empty photo opportunity that creates expectations that will become dashed, I won't meet.
I hope progress is being made. I was pleased to see that Mr. Arafat is trying to control the radical elements within the Palestinian Authority. And I think the world ought to applaud him for that. I hope he's taking measures necessary to reduce the violence in the Middle East so that we can get into the Mitchell process.
We're working hard on the topic. It's a very important part of our foreign policy.

Q. I'd like to ask you for a more complete portrait of your progress so far. Can you tell the American people specifically what is the state of Osama bin Laden? What is the state of the Al Qaeda network? Are they on the run? To what extent have you been able to disrupt their activities? Do you believe there are members of those cells still in the United States capable of carrying out terrorist acts? And again, do you know whether Osama bin Laden is dead or alive?

A. Yeah. Let me start backwards. I don't know if he's dead or alive. I want him brought to justice, however.
We are following every possible lead to make sure that any Al Qaeda member that could be in the United States is brought to justice. The F.B.I. has got thousands of agents who are following every hint of a possibility of an Al Qaeda member in our country. We're chasing down the leads that have been given to us as a result of the bombing. And we're following other leads. . . .
The F.B.I. must think differently and Director Mueller is causing them to do so. The F.B.I., as you know, spent a lot of manpower and time chasing spies in a post-cold-war era. They were still chasing spies. Nothing wrong with that, except we have a new enemy. And now the F.B.I. is rightly directing resources toward homeland security. It's been an adjustment, and I'm proud to report that Director Mueller has adjusted quickly. 
I am confident that the Al Qaeda organization is moving around Afghanistan. They think they might find safe haven. Not if we think they're there. And we've got them on the run. The other day we brought to justice a person that killed an American citizen in 1986. He was charged with murder. And I made a point of talking about that in a press conference because I wanted not only terrorists to understand but the Americans to understand that we'll be patient if need be, to bring them to justice. We'll find them. . . .

Q. Mr. President, you've tried very hard to assure Americans that the country is safe and yet your own vice president has spent most of this week in a secure location. Can you explain why that is and also how long that will last?

A. Sure. I shook hands with the vice president today in the Oval Office. I welcomed him out of his secure location. There are some times when the vice president and I will be together and some times we won't be. We take very seriously the notion of the continuity of government. It's a responsibility we share, to make sure that under situations such as this, when there are possible threats facing our government, that we separate ourselves for the sake of continuity of our government. And I was pleased to see him. He's looking swell.

Q. Some critics have expressed doubts about trying to get nations that once sponsored terrorism to now cooperate in the effort against terrorism. . . .Is it your view that every sinner should get a chance to redeem himself -- that there is in effect an amnesty for nations that once sponsored terrorism if they will now stop and cooperate with us?

A. Of course. But our ability to affect host nations harboring terrorists will depend upon our determination, our will, our patience. We are sending a signal to the world as we speak that if you harbor a terrorist, there will be a price to pay. And there are nations in the world that have expressed a desire to help. Helen mentioned Syria. The Syrians have talked to us about how they can help in the war against terrorism. We take that seriously. And we'll give them an opportunity to do so. . . .
I appreciate diplomatic talk. But I'm more interested in action and results. I am absolutely determined, absolutely determined, to rout terrorism out where it exists and bring them to justice. We learned a good lesson on Sept. 11: that there is evil in this world. . . .
And it's my duty as the president of the United States to use the resources of this great nation, a freedom-loving nation, a compassionate nation, a nation that understands values of life and rout terrorism out where it exists. And we're going to get plenty of nations a chance to do so.

Q. Back to the F.B.I. warning of today, which was based, it said, on certain information that there would be retaliatory attacks over the next several days. Given the complete generality of that warning, what does it really accomplish aside from scaring people into not doing what you've urged them to do -- getting back to their normal lives. What should they do with it? And did you personally approve the issuance of that warning?

A. I'm aware of the intelligence that caused the warning to be issued. And it was a general threat on America. And as I mentioned earlier, had it been a specific threat, we would've contacted those to whom the threat was directed. But, I think it is important for the American people to know their government is on full alert. And that's what that warning showed. We take every threat seriously. And the American people shouldn't be surprised that we're issuing alerts. After all, on our TV screens the other day we saw the evil one threatening, calling for more destruction and death in America. . . .
And we had another threat, a general threat. Had it been specific we would have dealt with the specifics of the threat.
I think the American people should take comfort in the fact that their government is doing everything we possibly can do to run down every possible lead. And take threats -- and we take threats seriously.
I think the American people do understand that after Sept. 11 that we're facing a different world. And they accept that responsibility. They accept that responsibility.
There is, I think, some positive news about the American people reacting to what we're doing. The load factors on airplanes are increasing. Now I recognize certain routes have been reduced but, nevertheless, people are getting back on airplanes. That's important that that be the case. Hotels are getting more customers. That's important for the working people of the country.
We are getting back to normal but we're doing so with a new sense of awareness. And the warning that went out today helped heighten that sense of awareness.

Q. Mr. President, you've said on repeated occasions that you're not into nation-building. Yet it appears in this case given the politics of the region it may play a crucial role in resolving this crisis. Prime Minister Blair of Britain has said that the coalition, if the Taliban falls, will work to create a broadly based government. I'm wondering, sir, has that become a priority of your administration now, to devise a plan for a new government in Afghanistan? And what part might King Zahir Shah play in that?

A. Well. first let me reiterate, my focus is bringing Al Qaeda to justice. And saying to the host government, you had your chance to deliver.
Actually, I will say it again: If you cough him up, and his people, today, that we'll reconsider what we're doing to your country. You still have a second chance. Just bring him in. And bring his leaders and lieutenants and other thugs and criminals with him.
I think we did learn a lesson, however, and should learn a lesson from the previous engagement in the Afghan area, that we should not just simply leave after a military objective has been achieved.
That's why -- and I sent that signal by announcing that we're going to spend $320 million of aid to the Afghan people. That's up from roughly $170 million this year.
I personally think and I appreciate Tony Blair's, and I've discussed this with him, his vision about, about Afghanistan after we're successful. One of the things we've got to make sure of is that all parties, all interested parties, have an opportunity to be a part of a new government. We shouldn't play favorites between one group or another within Afghanistan. Secondly, we've got to work for a stable Afghanistan so that her neighbors don't fear terrorist activity again coming out of that country. . . .
I believe that the United Nations could provide the framework necessary to help meet those conditions. It would be a useful function for the United Nations to take over the so-called nation-building.

Q. Mr. President, I'm sure many Americans are wondering where all this will lead. And you've called upon the country to go back to business and to go back to normal. But you haven't called for any sacrifices from the American people. And I wonder, do you feel that any will be needed? Are you planning to call for any? And do you think that American life will really go back to the way it was on Sept. 10?

A. Well, you know, I think the American people are sacrificing now. I think they're waiting in airport lines longer than they've ever had before. I think there's a certain sacrifice when you lose a piece of your soul. And Americans -- listen, I was standing up there at the Pentagon today and I saw the tears of the families whose lives were lost in the Pentagon. And I said in my talk there that America prays with you. I think there's a sacrifice, there's a certain sense of giving themselves, to share their grief with people they'll never, maybe, ever see in their lives. So America is sacrificing. . . .
This is so sad an incident, but there are some positive things that are developing. One is I believe that many people are reassessing what's important in life. Moms and dads are not only reassessing their marriage and the importance of their marriage, but of the necessity of loving their children like never before. I think that's one of the positives that have come from the evildoers. The evil ones have sparked an interesting change in America, I think. A compassion in our country that is overflowing. I know their intended act was to destroy us and make us cowards and make us not want to respond. But quite the opposite has happened. Our nation is united. We are strong. We're compassionate. Neighbors care about neighbors. The story I've talked about earlier was one that really touched my heart, about women of cover fearing to leave their homes. And there was such an outpouring of compassion for people within our own country -- a recognition that the Islamic faith should stand side by side, hand to hand with the Jewish faith and the Christian faith in our great land. It is such a wonderful example.
You know, I'm asked all the time -- I ask myself a question: How do I respond -- it's an old trick -- how do I respond when I see that in some Islamic countries there is vitriolic hatred for America?
I'll tell you how I respond: I'm amazed. I'm amazed that there's such misunderstanding of what our country is about that people would hate us. I am, like most Americans, I just can't believe. Because I know how good we are. 
And we've got to do a better job of making our case. We've got to do a better job of explaining to the people in the Middle East, for example, that we don't fight a war against Islam or Muslims. We don't hold any religion accountable. We're fighting evil. And these murderers have hijacked a great religion in order to justify their evil deeds and we cannot let it stand.

Q. Mr. President, you have spoken with great pride of this international coalition. I want to ask you, before the events of Sept. 11 one of the big questions you faced this fall was would you violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and go ahead with a missile defense plan if Russia did not strike a deal. Will you do that now because Russia's cooperation is so important? And separately but related, are you disappointed that while there have been some statements of support from the Muslim world that there have not -- and the Arab world -- that there have not been more vocal and repeated statements agreeing with you that this is a war against terrorism, not Islam?

A. Let me start with the latter part. I was heartened by the Organization of Islamic Conference's statement of support for our war against terror. I think that that statement spoke volumes about the attitude of Muslim nations and I was pleased to see that support.
Some coalition members will feel more comfortable doing certain things than other coalition members will. And my attitude is and the attitude of my administration is we'll accept any help that a government is comfortable in giving. . . .
Somebody asked me the other day was I please with the actions of Saudi Arabia? I am. I appreciate the actions of that government.
In terms of missile defense, I can't wait to visit with my friend Vladimir Putin in Shanghai, to reiterate once again that the cold war is over. It's done with. And that there are new threats that we face. And no better example of that new threat than the attack on America on Sept. 11. And I'm going to ask my friend to envision a world in which a terrorist thug and/or a host nation might have the ability to develop -- to deliver a weapon of mass destruction via rocket. And wouldn't it be in our nation's advantage to be able to shoot it down? At the very least it should be in our nation's advantage to determine whether we can shoot it down. And we're restricted from doing that because of an ABM treaty that was signed during a totally different era. . . .

Q. If he does not agree with you, would you withdraw from the ABM treaty this year?

A. I have told Mr. Putin that the ABM treaty is outdated, antiquated and useless. And I hope that he will join us in a new strategic relationship. One more question please. Thank you.

Q. You talk about the general threat toward Americans. You know, the Internet is crowded with all sorts of rumor and gossip and kind of urban myths. And people ask us what is it they're supposed to be on the lookout for? Other than the 22 most wanted terrorists, what are Americans supposed to look for and report to the police or to the F.B.I.?

A. Well, Ann, you know if you're a -- if you find a person that you've never seen before getting in a crop-duster that doesn't belong to you, report it. If you see suspicious people lurking around petrochemical plants, report it to law enforcement. I mean, people need to be logical. And listen, I want to urge my fellow Americans not to use this as an opportunity to pick on somebody that doesn't look like you or doesn't share your religion. The thing that makes our nation so strong and that will ultimately defeat terrorist activity is our willingness to tolerate people of different faiths, different opinions, different colors within the fabric of our society. . . .
Before we leave I want to make a special request to the children of America. I ask you to join in a special effort to help the children of Afghanistan. Their country has been through a great deal of war and suffering. Many children there are starving and are severely malnourished. One in three Afghan children is an orphan, almost half suffer chronic malnutrition. And we can and must help them.
We've created a special relief effort that will be supervised by the Red Cross. We are asking every child in America to earn or give a dollar that will be used to provide food and medical help for the children of Afghanistan. You can send your dollar in an envelope marked America's Fund for Afghan Children, right here to the White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C. 
This is an opportunity to help others while teaching our own children a valuable lesson about service and character. I hope school classes or Boy and Girl Scout troops, other youth organizations will participate in any way to raise the money to send to the children. Wash your car, do a yard for a neighbor. And I hope the adults will help them as well. 
Ultimately, one of the best weapons, one of the truest weapons that we have against terrorism is to show the world the true strength of character and kindness of the American people. Americans are united in this fight against terrorism. We're also united in our concern for the innocent people of Afghanistan. Winter is coming and by acting today we can help the children survive. 
Thank you for your questions. May God bless America.

HEADLINE: Earnings Increase 3% at General Electric 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The General Electric Company said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose 3 percent over the same period last year, despite huge insurance losses related to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Without those losses, which carved 4 cents a share off earnings, the increase would have been 16 percent. G.E. also vowed to generate double-digit earnings growth this year and next. 
 Investors were pleased with the results and with G.E.'s announcement that its NBC unit would buy Telemundo Communications Group. G.E. shares rose $1.04, to $38.95. 
 "In this environment, no one would have thought it horrible if G.E. stepped away from its promises of double-digit earnings growth," said Jeanne G. Terrile of Merrill Lynch. Other analysts noted that G.E. had effectively used layoffs and Internet technologies to bring costs down. "The whole company is well ahead on the cost curve," said Michael T. Regan, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. 
Still, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chairman since Sept. 7, faces huge challenges. The terrorist attacks have increased NBC's costs for news coverage, even as the network ran many commercial-free hours. The attacks will result in at least $400 million in insurance payouts. They will weaken sales of aircraft engines, already hurt by an airline industry slowdown. In addition, they have probably accelerated and deepened a broad economic downturn that was already hurting G.E.'s economically sensitive businesses.
G.E. earned $3.28 billion, or 33 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $3.18 billion, or 32 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. But G.E.'s revenues for the quarter were $29.4 billion, down 8 percent from last year's $32 billion. 
The comparison is a bit skewed -- G.E. still owned Montgomery Ward in last year's third quarter, and NBC was reaping huge revenues from the Olympics -- but analysts warn that the prospect of slower growth is real. 
"If G.E. is to keep posting double-digit earnings growth, it will have to match reductions in costs to reductions in revenues," warned Robert Friedman of S&P Equity Research, one of the few analysts who says he thinks G.E. stock is overpriced. 
Some G.E. businesses -- GE Medical Systems, Mr. Immelt's alma mater, is a notable example -- continue to predict heady growth. But GE Aircraft Engines will probably see a big downturn in orders soon. And, as global power generating capacity catches up to demand, GE Power Systems is unlikely to maintain the nearly 40 percent annual growth it has shown in the last two years.
Mr. Immelt is also battling the Environmental Protection Agency, which has ordered G.E. to spend $500 million to dredge the Hudson River of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, that G.E. legally released into the river decades ago. 
Mr. Immelt discussed the subject in an interview last month and, through a spokesman, said his views remained unchanged.
"This isn't about spending $500 million on some magic bullet," Mr. Immelt said, noting that G.E. has already spent $200 million on removing the PCB's. "I'm in the business of gathering facts and acting on them, and dredging remains a debatable technical solution." 
Many analysts noted that G.E.'s materials business was weaker than they had expected this quarter. And several suggested that G.E. would be better off without its lighting and appliance units. "Such businesses give them a good presence with the consumer, but they don't really fit in with G.E.'s services-oriented, high technology business model," said James P. Ruskin, an analyst at the Dreyfus Corporation, whose portfolios include G.E. stock. 
Still, few analysts voiced severe criticisms or concerns. Mr. Immelt apparently won them over three weeks ago when, in his first meeting with analysts as chairman, he said G.E. could weather the economy in the aftermath of the attacks. 
In a presentation peppered with football metaphors -- "I'll play a little offense here," "We didn't dust off the playbook and start practicing on Sept. 11" -- Mr. Immelt stressed that G.E. had been trimming costs for more than a year, and that its diversified portfolio would enable it to offset losses in insurance and aircraft engines. He also said the company would probably start making acquisitions soon.
Apparently, Mr. Immelt also dispelled any doubts that he could measure up to his predecessor, John F. Welch Jr. While stocks in general have risen about 11 percent over the last three weeks, G.E.'s share price has risen about 29 percent. 
"Jeff showed presence, a mastery of detail and a feeling for the big picture," said James N. Kelleher of Argus Research.
Mr. Regan put it more succinctly: "With all due respect, Jack who?"
All told, Wall Street remains gung-ho about G.E.'s prospects.
"The economy won't be anyone's friend next year," said Nicholas P. Heymann of Prudential Securities. "But they've still got the ability to contend with any economic environment.

HEADLINE: Samarkand Journal; 
Tamerlane's Capital Suffers From Lack of Tourists

BYLINE:  By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: SAMARKAND, Uzbekistan. Oct. 11 

 BODY:
The beggar waved a pot of smoldering steppe grass and whisked its smoke across a visitor's face. It smelled of charcoal and burning thyme. Her message was succinct: "Many bad men on the street."
 Her luck was bad. She had staked out the entrance to the Registan, the most majestic monument in a city regarded as the jewel of Central Asia's Islamic world, and yet there was hardly anyone in sight to panhandle. It was just like the day before, and the day before that, and the rest of a long and luckless string of days that reached back for a month. 
 Her routine complete, she accepted a crumpled bill and then ambled off dejectedly to begin another wait. How much time must pass before the next visitor arrived? One hour? Two? Usually there were new groups every few minutes, but not anymore.
Throughout Samarkand, with its spectacular monuments to Islamic splendor and Central Asian barbarism, the merchants, the hoteliers and the beggars are speaking variations of the same theme. "Tourists?" Rofe Rumonov said after luring a visitor through a tiny door into a shop crammed with silk goods. "Tourists kaput."
He laughed until he frowned.
The only people coming into Uzbekistan these days are American soldiers, who have poured into the country in preparation for possible action in neighboring Afghanistan. But they are hidden from view at the Khanabad air base, offering little succor to sagging Samarkand.
The city sits squarely astride a crossroads on the ancient Silk Road, the trekker's highway that crossed deserts and mountains, allowing caravans of camels to fuel the exchange of goods and ideas among China, India, Persia and Rome.
Alexander the Great passed through here, as did Genghis Khan. Tamerlane, the Uzbek national hero, was born south of the city, and on his rise to emperor in the 14th century he made Samarkand his capital and began building it to an imperial city.
For 300 years he and the kings and governors who followed him used their deep reserves of vanity and plunder to erect mosques and mausoleums that they vowed to be without equal in the Muslim world. Most still stand. This was supposed to be a grand season for showing them off.
Uzbekistan, after all, celebrated its 10th year of independence from the Soviet Union last month, just before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
Back then, Samarkand's hotels were overbooked into November. The city -- which saw its number of visitors rise to 50,000 last year from 20,000 in 1996 -- expected its best run of tourism ever.
"This was the high season," said Giovanni Cardini, general manager of the Hotel Afrosiyab Palace. "Five weeks ago I had more reservations than I had rooms. Now my occupancy rate is 35 percent."
He sipped from his espresso in the cool of the hotel's bar. "Yesterday we had no arrivals," he said. "Can you imagine? This is a hotel with 278 rooms, and no one checked in."
Throughout Samarkand the feeling is the same. Yes, the Taliban declared a jihad, or holy war, against Uzbekistan this week, but the Uzbeks, with their robust military and fortified border, are continuing their lives almost as if there were no war to the south.
The streets are crowded with jostling Lada autos and dented bicycles. The teahouses are packed with local people. The only problem is that few outsiders are joining them.
Mile upon mile of cotton fields along the roads into the ancient city offer a picture of Uzbekistan's enduring poverty. Here women in bright robes hunch over thigh-high plants, snatching cotton by hand and filling burlap sacks one tiny bit at a time.
Now and then the highway is clogged with herds of scrawny sheep and cows, all driven along by bright-eyed dogs and boys with sticks.
Some Uzbeks lament the fact that attacks launched in the name of Allah were undermining one part of a Muslim city's economy -- tourism -- that had unquestionably been growing. What could be done? Nothing, it seemed, but wait. "I think after the war is over it will take two or three years before we have bookings like before," Mr. Cardini said. For the near future there is only the ritual of work, even if there are no high-spending takers.
In the Bibi Khanum bazaar, Uzbek merchants stand proudly behind their goods. There are baskets of hot peppers and bowls of spice, sacks of nuts and stacks of rock candy. On other tables are sprawling displays of nan, the local bread, and dried fruits of every variety.
Fresh melons are stacked like cannonballs. The smell of roasting mutton drifts on the air. Abdu Hakim presents his stand with a sweeping flourish and a slight bow.
He offers dried apricot pits and raisins, samples free of charge. Loudspeakers nearby thump with Uzbek disco. "Where are the tourists?" he asks the lone visitor. "Maybe you call your countrymen and tell them to come?"
At the Bibi Khanum mosque, according to legend built by Tamerlane's favorite wife while he was away sacking northern India, the sweeping ceramic mosaics are going all but unseen.
Nargeiza Samcidinova, who sells tickets, opened her window and looked curiously into the light. Before her the courtyard was utterly empty. Wind moaned through the minarets. She quickly issued a ticket.
"Too many governments say to their people, 'Don't travel to Central Asia,' " she said. She put her forearm on the windowsill. "So far today, there is only you."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Vendors at the Registan now have no customers. "Where are the tourists?" a vendor at a bazaar not far away inquired of a lone visitor.; The courtyard in front of the Registan, the most majestic monument in Samarkand, was deserted on Thursday, as it has been for a month. The only people traveling to Uzbekistan lately are soldiers.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Decline 2.4%, Biggest Drop In a Decade 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Retail sales fell 2.4 percent in September, the government said today, the largest decline in nearly 10 years of record-keeping and a clear sign that the Sept. 11 attacks kept shoppers away from stores. 
 "Today's decline in sales confirms that we are in recession," Joseph E. Stiglitz, one of the three American economists awarded the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science on Wednesday, said today. 
 The drop in spending, led by fewer purchases of automobiles, clothing and restaurant meals, brought sales to $286.5 billion, the lowest since December 2000. Sales had risen 0.4 percent in August. Excluding automobiles, sales fell 1.6 percent in September after rising 0.6 percent in August. 
Only the categories of food and beverage stores, health and personal-care stores and gasoline stations showed gains in September 
The slump in sales was reported as other data pointed to possible inflationary pressures. The price paid to manufacturers, farmers and other producers rose 0.4 percent in September, more than expected. 
While the gain was chiefly a result of a 0.9 percent gain in energy prices, the core Producer Price Index -- which excludes energy costs -- also rose. The core index gained 0.3 percent, the biggest gain in five months.
There were, however, some positive signs today. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment rose to 83.4 in October, the first increase since June, after dropping to 81.8 in September. The university's index of current economic conditions was 92.1, down from 94.6 in September. The numbers are preliminary.
"It will take more gains to revive spending," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York.
While some analysts expect zero-interest financing by automakers and discounting at retailers to increase sales this month, some retailers say the military action that started this week against Afghanistan may also distract shoppers.
"If it's anything like the gulf war, if people react the same way, it's going to affect sales because people will stay home and watch the war on TV, as they did back in 1991," said Ira Kaplan, chief financial officer of the fashion retailer Claire's Stores,
When the gulf war began in January 1991, retail sales fell 2.2 percent during the month. That was the largest decline since January 1987.
Commerce Department statisticians said the report included changes to its usual process of making seasonal adjustments so that the numbers would reflect the effect of Sept. 11.
Sales that took place before 1992 cannot be verified. The Commerce Department switched to a new method for computing retail sales figures this year and revised the data back to February 1992.
Sales at restaurants and bars decreased 5.1 percent last month after rising 1.2 percent in August, today's report showed.

Trade Officials Hope to Clear Air Before Big Meeting

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON

DATELINE: GENEVA, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Top trade officials are heading for Singapore this weekend for a meeting aimed at breaking a logjam of issues standing in the way of a new global trade liberalization round.
 Next month, trade ministers from the 142 member countries of the World Trade Organization are due to meet in Qatar's capital, Doha, to rekindle efforts to open global markets to competition. Much is riding on that gathering, including the future effectiveness of the W.T.O., which sets trade rules and arbitrates disputes. 
 Hanging over the preparations in Singapore is whether the Doha meeting will take place. Trade organization officials, including the director, Mike Moore, have said that the meeting will go ahead despite security worries. 
In Singapore, officials from about two dozen countries hope to settle some of the lesser trade divisions so that they can concentrate on the two or three thorniest issues at Doja. To help, they will have in hand a preliminary paper setting out the issues most member countries want to be included in any formal round of negotiations.
The eight-page outline, drafted by the chairman of the W.T.O.'s governing general council, Stuart Harbinson, moves away from the cumbersome text that trade ministers grappled with in Seattle two years ago. While police battled violent protesters outside, trade ministers failed to agree on much inside.
Many envoys concede that little progress in harmonizing views has been made since then. The United States and the European Union, setting aside their trade battles, have joined publicly to argue that a new round is vital to perk up the global economy. Still, major differences remain, among them agriculture, which is so divisive that specific negotiating topics were listed in a separate draft paper.
The European Union has the most at stake because its 15 member nations heavily subsidize farming. Free trade supporters like Australia, Canada and Argentina are pushing for major changes, including the lifting of subsidies. The Europeans are instead seeking to negotiate a broad range of agricultural issues, including food safety, animal welfare and environmental concerns.
Environment, in the parlance of the European Union, includes whether to curb trade in products where a health risk is suspected, but not necessarily scientifically proved, like American hormone-treated beef. The issue highlights a fundamental cultural difference.
"The Americans say that until the product is proved hazardous, it has to be treated as safe; Europeans say that until the product is proved safe, it's presumed risky," one diplomat noted.
Outbreaks of foot and mouth disease and mad cow disease have made Europeans keenly aware of the issue.
Mr. Harbinson did not include environmental issues in his draft.
Japan, South Korea, Switzerland and Norway, all of which strongly support their farmers, back the European Union. But even some other European countries are cool to the idea, fearing that it will lead to trading chaos by allowing a country to ban articles on the flimsiest of threats. 
European Union officials note that it has been European exports that have been blocked in recent cases. "We have been on the receiving end, so we are alert to this danger," one trade expert said.
Underlining the sensitivities, Peter Carl, who heads the European Union's trade division in Brussels, suggested that agriculture and environment could be "deal breakers" that might torpedo the future trade talks.
United States officials are sensitive about measures that protect American industries against a surfeit of low-priced foreign products. Such measures are cited now in the draft, drawing the ire of three Democratic senators who said they would not permit a "weakening of the agreements on antidumping and subsidies rules." The senators made the comment in a letter to the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick.
Developing countries, which make up the bulk of W.T.O. membership, are also dissatisfied about the failure of industrialized countries to roll back agreements worked out during the 1986-1993 Uruguay Round. They say the accords are too complex and costly from them to adhere to on the same schedule as richer nations.

HEADLINE: Deep in Debt Since 1988, Polaroid Files for Bankruptcy 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
The Polaroid Corporation, once one of American industry's technological lights, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection yesterday. Most experts predict that Polaroid will never emerge, but will use the court's protection to set up a sale of its assets.
 The news did not shock Wall Street, where analysts have watched the company's stock sink and debts soar as digital cameras hurt Polaroid's core instant photography business. But it elicited a wave of sadness nonetheless. 
 "It just didn't have to come to this," said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Buckman, Buckman & Reid who was once one of Polaroid's biggest Wall Street fans. 
When Edwin H. Land and George Wheelwright formed Polaroid in 1937, its future seemed ensured. Mr. Land was a scientist whose ideas for a lens that could polarize light -- that is, make light rays move in parallel -- formed the technological underpinnings not only of instant photography, but of glare-free sunglasses and goggles that World War II pilots used to spot submerged submarines. Mr. Wheelwright was a consummate salesman who built the business around the products.
Scientists respected the company for its devotion to research; investors respected it for the popularity of its products. Indeed, Polaroid was one of the Nifty 50, the big companies that in the 1960's were seen as the bellwethers of the American economy. 
But at its heart, Polaroid was always a scientific house. And appropriately, it was brought down by the cold light of numbers. 
By yesterday, Polaroid was backed against a financial wall. Its stock, which approached $50 in early 1998, was selling for 28 cents when the New York Stock Exchange halted trading Wednesday. In its filing, the company listed $1.81 billion in assets and $948.4 million in debts. It has $360 million in bank debt falling due on Nov. 15, and owes its bondholders about $575 million. 
"I never thought I could lose as much on a bond of a well-known company as people lost on Internet start-ups," said Don Gonsalves, a bondholder who said he had lost 81.5 percent of his investment in two years. "The alternative that would result in the biggest payoff for all creditors would be for Polaroid to be completely liquidated."
Gary T. DiCamillo, Polaroid's chief executive since 1995, declined to be interviewed, but the company issued a statement saying that it had lined up $50 million in financing, and intended to cut more jobs and accelerate efforts to sell assets. The company, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., has also eliminated insurance benefits for retirees, and has stopped severance payments to employees who recently left. Polaroid subsidiaries outside the United States are not part of the bankruptcy filing. 
How did things go wrong so fast?
They didn't. Polaroid has been deep in debt since 1988, when it bought back shares, created an employee stock ownership plan and issued preferred stock, all to fight off a takeover by Shamrock Holdings, an investor group led by Walt Disney's nephew, Roy E. Disney.
"They issued a lot of bonds and borrowed a lot of money, and that's put them in the hole they're in today," said Edward Y. Lee, a photography analyst at Lyra Research.
Polaroid made strategic mistakes in the early 90's, too. Analysts say the company never responded properly after digital technologies began eating into every photography company's film sales. It did not go into the booming home printer business. Instead it invested heavily in Helios, a so-called dry film technology used for medical imaging that had myriad problems. By the time Polaroid got the kinks and costs out of Helios, Kodak had cornered the market with Imation, a dry-film technology it had bought from 3M. Polaroid has abandoned that business.
"They should have gotten into batteries or other cash-flow-predictable products that are sold in the distribution channels they already used," suggested Vincent Muscolino, a manager of the David L. Babson Company's DLB Technology Fund, which is bullish on Eastman Kodak but has avoided Polaroid stock.
Polaroid also banked heavily on developing nations, deciding -- correctly at first -- that they lacked an infrastructure for processing film and would favor instant photography. Once Kodak, Fuji and others started developing film there, Polaroid lost the edge. Moreover, Polaroid was soon trounced by currency translation and slowing economies overseas.
On the home front, mass-market retailers like Wal-Mart Stores cut back on inventories, including purchases of Polaroid films. Polaroid's once-thriving commercial market faltered as insurance adjusters and others defected to digital cameras.
Unit sales have been high for Polaroid's newer consumer products, like the I-Zone, a cheap camera that produces sticker-sized pictures, and the JoyCam, a less expensive version of Polaroid's older Captiva camera. But those gains have largely been a result of huge rebates. And research shows that JoyCam and I-Zone owners use far fewer rolls of film each year than do users of older instant cameras.
Polaroid's costs, meanwhile, were huge. Mr. Yannas of Buckman noted that while Polaroid's sales tripled to $2.1 billion in 1998 from $750 million in 1972, its sales staff grew more than fivefold, to 800 people from 140. The back office workers outnumbered the sales representatives two to one. And unproductive people in sales were paid as much as stellar ones.
"The whole system was bloated with hangers-on," Mr. Yannas said.
Many fault Judith G. Boynton, who was Polaroid's chief financial officer until January, when she resigned.
Ms. Boynton, now chief financial officer for Royal Dutch/Shell in London, declined to be interviewed.
Ms. Boynton's performance clearly pleased the board, though. They promoted her to executive vice president two years ago, and made her the boss of many seasoned operating people. Quite a few, including Brian D. Poggi, senior vice president for North America, and Clifford Hall, director of new product development and the mastermind behind the I-Zone, soon left.
Belatedly, Polaroid has tried to bring costs down and cash flow up. It has already cut its work force by about a quarter this year and has more cuts planned. It also has sold some real estate, though a huge tax bite on depreciated property ate up much of the proceeds.
Polaroid's parts are now clearly worth more than the whole. There are millions of Polaroid cameras in use, which means a continuing demand for instant film. The worldwide emphasis on security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks could make Polaroid's picture ID unit a tasty morsel to snap up. Other camera companies -- Olympus Optical and Canon are often mentioned -- might covet Polaroid's distribution network.
Telecommunications and printer companies may be lured by two new Polaroid technologies: Onyx, which captures wireless transmissions of images and converts them into black and white prints, and Opal, a new color printing method. Both use processes that dispense with toners and inks, and analysts give both products high marks for cost and quality of prints.
Still, analysts say that Polaroid banked too much on them, as it did on Helios, I-Zone and JoyCam.
"There was always this next great product that will save the company," said Gibboney Huske of Credit Suisse First Boston. "It was a vicious cycle of constantly putting all the eggs in one basket."

HEADLINE: Focus Broadens to Relief for Trade Center Jobless 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Last week, Edwin Rosa was as down as could be. His job as a security guard at the World Trade Center had disappeared. He did not know how he would pay next month's rent. He did not even have enough money to take his 12-year-old son bowling.
 As for job prospects, Mr. Rosa said, do not even talk about them. "I'm still waking up in the middle of the night having cold sweats about what I saw that day," he said, referring to the Sept. 11 attack on the trade center. "It's hard to think about looking for a job." 
 But this week, after visiting a disaster assistance center in downtown Manhattan, Mr. Rosa says he no longer feels at the end of his rope. At the center, officials from the city's Human Resources Administration agreed to pay $300 toward the $850 monthly rent for his apartment in Far Rockaway, Queens, and gave him $250 in food stamps. The Salvation Army gave him $600 toward rent and utilities.
"You could see that they felt what we were feeling," Mr. Rosa said shortly after visiting the center. "It made me feel real good that there are people out there who care."
In the immediate aftermath of the attack, government agencies and relief funds focused mostly on helping the families of the dead and the missing. But in the last week, as it has become clear that more than 20,000 workers in New York lost their jobs in the wake of the attack, the government and charities have tried to reinforce the message that they also have help for the unemployed.
"We're trying to meet the needs of the unemployed, and our emphasis is on providing one-stop service," said Ben Hendrickson, the coordinator of the combined federal, state and city disaster assistance center, which fills the cavernous State Department of Motor Vehicles office in downtown Manhattan. "We are encouraging people to visit the center as often as they need to until their disaster needs are met."
With its dozens of different booths, the disaster assistance center resembles a bazaar. Each day about 500 people -- usually people who have lost their jobs or businesses -- visit the center, where they are first screened by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and then directed to various booths.
The Human Resources Administration has booths for food stamps, Medicaid and emergency cash. The Salvation Army, the Red Cross and Safe Horizons, another emergency aid group, also have booths. Others handle workers' compensation, unemployment insurance, legal help, crisis counseling, child care, job leads and other needs. "They even feed you," Mr. Rosa said.
Annette Turney, who was a housekeeper at the Millenium Hilton Hotel for seven years, was another happy customer, delighted that the Salvation Army and the Red Cross each agreed to pay half of her $650 rent. In addition, the Human Resources Administration is giving Medicaid coverage and $340 in food stamps to her and her two teenage children.
"I'm not sure what's coming for November, but I feel happy for October," she said.
FEMA officials said those seeking help from the center, which is at 141 Worth Street, should call (800) 462-9029. Those seeking aid are often asked to present papers, like layoff notices, showing that they worked in areas directly affected by the trade center attack. Many visitors seeking aid are also asked to present their rent and utility bills.
In the days after Sept. 11, hundreds of people who lost their jobs because of the attack got emergency aid for rent and food when they went to the initial disaster relief center on Pier 94. But many of those recipients thought that that was one-time assistance and that, except for unemployment insurance, they would have to fend for themselves in future months.
Now many of the unemployed complain that government agencies and relief funds have been slow to get out the message that emergency aid like that received by Mr. Rosa and Ms. Turney is available to the unemployed for up to six months.
Melvin Middleton, who worked at a parking garage, now closed, next to the trade center, was pleased that right after the attack, Red Cross officials at Pier 94 helped pay his $2,000 mortgage payment while other groups gave him $800 for child care and food. But he complained this week that no one had told him that aid might be available for future months.
Ricardo Ramos, who worked as a waiter at Windows on the World, said, "Most people think the aid is just one-time."
Mr. Ramos, who has two young boys, said that he was happy about the continuing aid but that he worried about getting along on less than the $600 he had been earning each week. "I'm happy that there's all this money there," he said. "But it's just a maybe -- that's the big problem. You're never sure how much you're going to get. I can't count on a maybe to feed my kids."
Many of the unemployed, of course, say they hope to land a job soon. But that may not be easy.
In a novel effort, the city's labor unions and business figures have formed a partnership to ask businesses to find jobs for workers at the World Trade Center who are now unemployed. So far, businesses have promised them more than 2,000 jobs.
"There were 50,000 jobs in the World Trade Center and 100,000 in the immediate area, and a lot of them have been lost," said Barry Feinstein, a former Teamsters union official who is chairman of the Consortium for Worker Education, which is helping train and place these laid-off workers.
Mr. Ramos, the waiter, said he faced two hurdles in finding a job. One, with his wife starting to look for a job, is getting child care for their 3-year-old, and the other, he admits, is the deep funk he is in.
"It's hard to look for a job right now," he said. "It's hard to smile. I'm in the service industry, and you need to be able to smile. Your job depends on it."

Next Stop for Giambi Might Be the Bronx

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 12 

 BODY:
No one, on either side, will acknowledge it, but Jason Giambi is as good as gone from the Oakland Athletics once their playoff run expires. The further they go in the postseason, the longer he will remain the heart of the Athletics. When he becomes a free agent, Giambi might leave his heart in Oakland, but he will take his bat elsewhere.
 Its destination? Yankee Stadium would not be an unlikely site. 
 Giambi could become the latest in a series of players who have opposed the Yankees in postseason games, then joined them as free agents only weeks later.
Don Gullett was the first, pitching against the Yankees for the Cincinnati Reds in the 1976 World Series, then signing with them on Nov. 18 as a member of the first class of free agents. Two years later, Tommy John pitched for the Los Angeles Dodgers in their World Series loss to the Yankees, then defected to the other side on Nov. 22.
More recently, Mike Stanton relieved for the Texas Rangers in the 1996 American League division series against the Yankees and signed with them on Dec. 11, and David Wells started for the Baltimore Orioles against the Yankees in the '96 A.L. Championship Series and signed with them eight days after Stanton did.
Then there was Luis Tiant, who played for the Boston Red Sox in 1978 but did not pitch against the Yankees in the memorable playoff game for the division championship. The Yankees lured Tiant away from the Red Sox on Nov. 13, only six weeks later, adding insult to injury.
Giambi is in position to do more damage to the Yankees than those players because Yankees pitchers have to face him in every game. He drove in two runs, for example, in the Athletics' series-opening 5-3 victory, demonstrating his awesome power by crashing a home run against the facade of the third tier in right field.
The Yankees could feel that power, easily imagining Giambi unleashing it for them.
But why would Giambi want to leave the growing monster he has helped to create? 
"We'd love to have Jason here," General Manager Billy Beane said. "Jason enjoys playing here. We have a great relationship, Jason and I. Both sides have seen the value each brings to the other."
But the Athletics did not see the value of giving Giambi the no-trade clause he wanted in a six-year, $91 million contract they were negotiating with his agent, Arn Tellem, last spring. Differences over that clause and deferred money ended the talks. Another M.V.P.-like season later, the price can only go up.
Tellem declined to discuss Giambi's future status in Oakland, saying: "We'll make our decision once the season is over. We tabled discussions on future plans until after his last game." But in a more revealing remark a couple of months ago, Tellem was quoted as saying there would be "no more hometown discount."
That does not bode well for a team whose payroll this year is among the five lowest. Nor does Tellem's negotiating history.
Tellem has always tried to negotiate a new contract with a client's team unless the player has had no interest in remaining with the team. But once those attempts have failed and the player has become a free agent, he has generally signed with a new team and for more money than he would have received from his former team. Mark Langston, Albert Belle and, most recently, Mike Mussina are examples of that scenario.
Tellem does not dally either. Mussina signed with the Yankees on Nov. 30, only three weeks into the free-agent signing period. Belle signed even more quickly with the Chicago White Sox. After the 1996 season, he was the first free agent to sign, only nine days after clubs were allowed to begin signing free agents. 
If Giambi were to leave Oakland and play in New York, proponents of a new economic system would point to the development as Exhibit A. The Athletics, however, had their chance to sign their star and stubbornly clung to their no no-trade policy. They did not realize that like records, policies were meant to be broken.
Giambi's departure would not break up the Athletics because they have an abundance of talented young players, many of them signed through their arbitration years. But his absence would hurt both in the lineup and in the clubhouse.
It would be reminiscent, though on a smaller scale, of the breakup of the greatest Oakland team, the one that won three consecutive World Series. After the 1976 season, the Athletics lost Joe Rudi, Sal Bando, Bert Campaneris, Gene Tenace and Rollie Fingers to free agency. They had traded Reggie Jackson before the season for Don Baylor, who also left as a free agent.
Because Tellem successfully negotiated for Mussina and had a good working relationship with the Yankees, he could repeat the process on Giambi's behalf. The Yankees, however, placed a limit on the price they would pay for Mussina. It was enough for Mussina because he had decided he wanted to play for the Yankees.
If Tellem perceives that the market would support a Manny Ramirez-type contract, eight years for $160 million, though deferred payments bring the value closer to $140 million, and the Yankees balk at the price, Giambi might have to look elsewhere. 
The Yankees, on the other hand, know they need to replenish their lost offense, and signing Giambi would go a long way toward meeting that goal. From Tellem's viewpoint, Giambi's signing with the Yankees would improve the team's run support for Mussina, which was woefully lacking this season.

HEADLINE: The Sometimes Dismal Nobel Prize 

BYLINE:  By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
On Dec. 10, the Nobel Prize will turn 100, and to celebrate, the Nobel Foundation is planning a sumptuous weeklong party in Stockholm. Virtually every living Nobel Prize winner will be there. Along with laureates in physics, biology, chemistry, medicine and literature, naturally, will be the two dozen or so laureates in economics.
 The economics prize has occupied a slightly anomalous, occasionally precarious position in the glittering pantheon of Nobel Prizes. The prize was tacked on to the original awards in 1969 as a marketing ploy on behalf of Sweden's central bank. It is the only Nobel that was not stipulated in the will of the dynamite magnate Alfred Nobel, which created the prizes after his death in 1895. 
 True, economics laureates receive the same $1 million honorarium as laureates in other fields, and they are selected by the same secretive, byzantine process. But the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which administers the economics prize, insists on subtle distinctions. The name of the economics laureate, for example, is engraved on the edge of the golden medal instead of on the front as is done with those of the other laureates.
In addition, the prize in economics -- officially the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel -- has long been disdained by other laureates. Murray Gell-Mann, who won his Nobel in physics the year that economists were first honored, said he shocked a colleague when he mentioned the two winners of the economics prize while describing the awards ceremony. "You mean," the colleague said, aghast, "they sat on the platform with you?"
Of course, economics as a distinct discipline is a creation of the 20th century. Economists have little patience with scientists who fret that economics is not a "hard" science. "Whether economics is a science or not is irrelevant," said David Romer, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley. "It's serious scholarship, and it's great to have that recognized."
In recent years, administrators of the economics prize have taken to joking that "all the mighty firs have fallen; now there are only bushes left" -- implying that economics is so shallow a subject that every truly deserving candidate has already won the prize and only second-rate contenders remain. But no one would call this year's three winners the B team -- George A. Akerlof, A. Michael Spence and Joseph E. Stiglitz, all Americans, shared the prize announced on Wednesday for their insights into information economics.
A quick calculation shows that only a few economists have won the prize by themselves in the last decade. As shared prizes have become the norm, "there's a sense each one is worth only a third as much," said Prof. Orley Ashenfelter at Princeton University, a former editor of The American Economic Review. The same thing has happened, though, in the "hard" sciences. In physics, three-way prizes have dominated for decades.
Still, from the perspective of those in the discipline, the economics prize remains tantalizingly scarce. "We only give the prize once a year, so a lot of great economists won't get it," Lars E. O. Svensson, chairman of the Academy's Prize Committee for Economic Sciences since 1999, said soon after his appointment.
Alfred Nobel's intention in creating and endowing the prizes was not merely to reward great achievements, but to stimulate further work. Paul Krugman, an economist and New York Times Op-Ed page columnist, complains that the economics prize "ends up going to people who are not only long past their productive research years but even past the mentoring stage."
Indeed, the average age of economics winners is 67, compared with 52 for physics honorees. Some economists say that the prestigious John Bates Clark medal, which is given every other year to an honoree deemed the best researcher under 40, does a better job of identifying the best economists at a stage in their careers when recognition can still affect research. But as Robert Solow, who has won both awards, said: "Nobody knows what a Clark medal is. But everyone knows what a Nobel is."
Even in the early years, when acknowledged giants like Paul A. Samuelson, Milton Friedman and Kenneth Arrow were being honored with economics Nobels, Swedes as prominent as Gunnar Myrdal issued calls to abolish the prize. Even grateful recipients have sometime expressed reservations. Friedrich Hayek, whose reputation for Viennese courtesy rivaled that for his libertarian views, toasted the King and Queen of Sweden during the Nobel banquet by saying that, had he been consulted, he would have "decidedly advised" against creating the prize in the first place. 
The prize's arriviste status has probably influenced the timing and choice of recipients. The prize committee -- made up of five Academy members, all Swedes -- has gone to great lengths to skirt scandal of any sort. The committee avoided giving Mr. Friedman the prize in the early 1970's, when his conservative views were less popular than today.
Nervousness about potential public relations disasters torpedoed the chances of Joan Robinson, the only woman ever to achieve real eminence in economics, to get the gold before she died in 1983. Assar Lindbeck, who dominated the prize committee until recently, told a laureate that Ms. Robinson, a disciple of John Maynard Keynes and later an admirer of Mao, did not win the prize because he feared that she would either refuse it or, worse, use the Nobel limelight to attack mainstream economics.
Controversy returned in 1994, when the economics prize to John Forbes Nash Jr., John C. Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten was nearly voted down by the full Academy because of concerns over Mr. Nash's history of mental illness. 
Upset by all the uproar, the Academy swept out the committee's longtime leadership, including Mr. Lindbeck, and opened up the body -- and potential recipients -- to other social scientists whose work has had an effect on economics. Adding to the tensions within the Academy was a string of years in which free-market champions, including several from the University of Chicago, seemed to have had a lock on the prize. But in 1998, the prize went to Amartya Sen, helping to calm the troubled waters. Mr. Sen was honored in part for his emphasis on the ethical dimension of economic decisions involving poverty, inequality and human rights.
In an era when the hunger for celebrities seems insatiable, and when many people believe that economics holds the key to the way the modern world works, charges that the economics prize runs counter to Alfred Nobel's intentions, and that economics isn't a science at all, do not have much effect.
Today, the economics prize is more coveted and important than ever. "The media make heroes every day of pop artists, politicians, sports figures," Mr. Lindbeck is fond of saying. "I think it's important that one day every year the mass media celebrates someone who has been awarded a prize for intellectual achievement."
Robert Mundell, who won the economics prize two years ago, agrees. "The fact is," he said, "that it helps sell ideas and keep people interested."

HEADLINE: Dwindling Numbers, Constant Faith; 
Mostly Black Order of Nuns in Harlem Celebrates 85 Years

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY

 BODY:
Sister Mary Magdalen, 91, spends her days in the parlor of the convent of the Franciscan Handmaids of Mary in Harlem, watching "Mother Angelica Live," a television program on the Eternal Word Television Network, and crocheting blankets and dresses for dolls that are sold at the convent's yearly bazaar.
 For 60 years, Sister Magdalen was an elementary school teacher and librarian at Roman Catholic schools in New York and the Carolinas. She says she misses the old days when stricter rules were in place in the convent: when the sisters dressed uniformly in starched coifs, headbands and guimpes; when Catholic schools were totally staffed by nuns, and when more young women came into the motherhouse seeking a vocation. 
 "The people today, they have such an education," Sister Magdalen said. "It seems like they want something else. A lot of girls don't want to teach anymore. The children need us now more than ever." 
She has been a member of the Franciscan Handmaids of the Most Pure Heart of Mary -- one of three predominantly black orders of nuns in the country -- for the last 71 years. On Monday, the order, which is based in central Harlem on West 124th Street between Lenox and Fifth Avenues, will celebrate its 85th anniversary. This afternoon, they are sponsoring a gospel concert at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Tomorrow, the nuns will participate in a Mass of thanksgiving at St. Aloysius Church in West Harlem.
"They certainly witness to the faith and the struggle of African-Americans to be Catholic in a church that did not welcome us," said Sister Anita Baird, president of the National Black Sisters Conference. "They survived against the odds, certainly on faith, with very little resources and very little support."
There are about 500 black nuns in the United States, according to the conference. Of those, more than 300 are a part of the country's three predominantly black orders. The orders -- the Oblate Sisters of Providence in Baltimore, the Sisters of the Holy Family in New Orleans and the Handmaids of Mary in New York City -- were founded because black and American Indian women were not allowed to train and study in white convents in the 19th and early 20th centuries. 
Although integration in the orders began in the 1950's and accelerated in the late 1960's, around the time of the civil rights movement, many black nuns said cultural differences among sisters of different races make predominantly black convents more appealing. 
The Franciscan Handmaids of Mary were founded in 1916 in Savannah, Ga. In 1915, Georgia lawmakers proposed a bill that would prevent whites from teaching black children in parochial and public schools. The Rev. Ignatius Lissner, who had spent many years on a mission in Africa and was sent to Georgia to work with blacks, opposed the law. But he recruited Sister Mary Theodore Williams, an African American nun, to help him start an order of nuns who could teach black children should the bill become law. 
The proposal never passed, and black and white nuns taught side by side in Georgia's schools. Still, they lived according to the South's social order in which blacks and whites -- even those in communities of shared faith -- lived apart. The nuns worshiped separately, and black nuns often endured ridicule from white Catholics who did not think them worthy of wearing habits. 
"Some people actually said that you can dress them up like nuns, but you can't stop them from stealing chickens," said Sister Loretta Theresa, 72, the assistant congregation minister for the Handmaids. "Some people welcomed us, and others said it was Father Lissner's folly."
The Handmaids moved to Harlem in 1924 at the invitation of Cardinal Patrick Hayes. At that time, blacks were moving into Harlem and the cardinal wanted to open a day nursery for the children of working parents. The St. Benedict Day Nursery remains the order's primary charity, with 77 children. The Handmaids also run a summer sleep-away camp in Staten Island.
In the order's heyday, there were more than 80 Handmaids of Mary. Today there are only 23. More than half of the order's members are retired; their average age is 72. The oldest member, Sister Mary Joseph, is 101.
As in Catholic orders around the country, the number of novices entering the Harlem convent each year has dwindled significantly. Once, three or four women a year joined; today, the number is about one every other year. The ratio of nuns who work in the community to retired nuns leads some to believe that the order is facing extinction. 
"I don't think that we're dying because we're still reaching out and doing whatever work we can," said Sister Maria Goretti, 69, the order's congregation minister. "To many people, numbers mean a lot. But I don't look at numbers. I look at quality."
The nuns are able to maintain their charitable works in the community largely because associates, or lay people, volunteer to help with chores and activities at the convent. On a typical day, the nuns begin their morning with prayer at 6:10. After morning Mass, Sister Jacqueline Banks takes a bus to St. Joseph of the Holy Family School, where she is the librarian. Sister Patricia Marie shuttles children to school and takes communion to the sick and the elderly. Sister Leonie Therese, 39, who took her first vows last Sunday, welcomes her prekindergarten students at the convent's nursery next door. Like many of the elderly sisters, Sister Miriam Cecilia, 89, a former music and Latin teacher, begins her shift in the convent's reception area, where she answers the telephones. 
And of course, the nuns pray. Lately, their prayers include terrorists. 
"We don't leave anyone out," said Sister Mary Angela, 86. "You don't pray for people because of the evil they do; you pray that they won't do any more evil."
For the 77 years the order has been in Harlem, the Handmaids of Mary have witnessed the neighborhood change and grow. Some of them remember the Great Depression, the high days of the Harlem Renaissance, the Harlem riots of the 1940's, the fiery speeches of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Malcolm X and the ravaging effects of the illegal drug trade in the 1980's. 
Now, as they walk through the neighborhood, they see signs of its economic rebirth. The nuns worry that the neighborhood's newfound panache may be troublesome for Harlem's longtime residents. 
"The renaissance in Harlem is fine," Sister Loretta Theresa said. "You just wonder where the poor people are going because the rents are so high." Harlem's changing demographics are slowly being reflected in the convent's nursery, where the children of black, white, African and Asian professionals sit beside children of the working poor and families on welfare. Even the Handmaids have a white and a Filipino nun in their ranks.
Whatever happens to the neighborhood, the Handmaids of Mary are determined to stay in Harlem and continue their ministry. When times were tough, they said, they did not desert central Harlem, and they have promised to share their faith as long as there are people who are willing to listen.
"Harlem is home for us," Sister Maria Goretti said. "We will minister to anyone."

HEADLINE: Disaster Relief for the Schools 

 BODY:
Count the New York City school system among the victims of Sept. 11. Already struggling before the terrorist attack, the schools have been rocked by disaster-related expenses that have further undermined the system's ability to provide the basic education that the city's children are entitled to under the law. 
 The New York City Board of Education began this school year under a "bare bones" state budget that provided less than a third of the assistance that the State Board of Regents said was necessary to provide students around New York with the books, teachers and buildings they need to meet the new standards and requirements laid out in state law. Schools Chancellor Harold Levy responded to the dismal situation by drawing up plans to cut music and art classes, after-school programs and guidance counselors. The prospect of cutting guidance counselors seems unacceptable now that traumatized school children need them more than ever. 
 The collapse of the World Trade Center forced the Board of Education to close seven buildings and shift nearly 6,000 students to other schools around the city that were already overcrowded and understaffed. Some schools in lower Manhattan are expected to remain closed for a month or longer, while the children attend class in split sessions elsewhere around the city. Attendance plummeted just after the disaster, causing students to lose valuable instructional time and endangering state school aid that is based in part on attendance figures. 
The dislocation and tumult has extended well beyond a few schools in Lower Manhattan. Chancellor Levy estimates that children throughout the system have lost a minimum of two weeks of instructional time because of the trauma associated with the terror attacks. The lost time looms especially large for fourth and eighth graders, who must take state English and math tests in December. While the school system's financial resources are shrinking, no one has suggested reducing the increasingly high standards its students must meet to pass from grade to grade and graduate from high school.
Mr. Levy has applied for federal disaster aid to pay for the cleanup, lost equipment, relocation costs, lost instructional time and counseling that many children and teachers will need. It is unclear whether the federal government will cover these costs. The costs connected with this disaster could eventually exceed $200 million -- a great deal of money for a gravely underfinanced system. 
The Legislature rationalized the inadequate budget it passed this summer by suggesting that it would revisit the school funding issue when it reconvened this fall. The prospect of more state aid for education seems remote given the economic climate at the moment. However, the Legislature could temporarily revise the education aid formula that it passed this summer, when it dramatically increased statewide school building funds and directed the money disproportionately to affluent communities. Whatever the route, the Legislature's response to the terrorist attack must begin with helping the city schools recover.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Broad Market Falls but Nasdaq Rises a Bit

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell yesterday for the first time in three days as a drop in profits at Providian Financial, a credit card company, heightened concern more consumers will default on loans.
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc. declined after retail sales tumbled last month, fueling worries that a rebound in corporate profits could be delayed longer than expected. The Nasdaq composite index erased a 3 percent loss caused by a report of anthrax in New York. 
 "You don't see panic selling, but people are pulling their buy orders and waiting to see what happens," said Leo Smith, head of trading at Putnam Investments. "Any second incident would undermine the confidence of the individuals participating in the marketplace."
The S. & P. 500 dropped 5.78 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,091.65, with declines in 8 of its 11 industry groups. For the week, the index rose 1.9 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average shed 66.29 points, or 0.7 percent, to 9,344.16. It gained 2.5 percent this week.
The Nasdaq advanced 1.93 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,703.40, bringing its gain this week to 6 percent.
Each of the benchmark indexes has risen in the last three weeks, the first time that has happened in more than a year. With the gains, the Nasdaq is 0.5 percent above its level prior to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The S. & P. 500 is 0.1 percent below its pre-attack close, and the Dow is 2.7 percent lower than it was on Sept. 10.
More than 1.3 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, 4 percent above the three-month average. More than three stocks fell for every two that advanced on the Big Board. Six stocks declined for every five that advanced on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Bonds were mixed. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 10221/32 . Its yield was 4.66 percent. The 30-year bond fell 7/32 to a price of 9910/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.42 percent from 5.41 on Thursday.
Retail stocks dropped after the Commerce Department said sales to consumers slumped 2.4 percent in September, their biggest drop in almost 10 years. Home Depot, the largest home improvement chain, fell $1.42, to $41.68. Wal-Mart, the largest retailer, fell 59 cents, to $52.90, and Target slipped $1.38, to $31.67.
Investors and economists said they were eager for additional reports that would better reveal how the attacks are affecting retailers.
"The September numbers are so heavily distorted by the attack and its aftermath, it's going to be another month at least before we can see the real situation," said Jay Mueller, an economist at Strong Capital Management Inc.
Financial stocks tumbled on concern consumers would have trouble paying their bills.
Providian plunged $6.90, or 34 percent, to $13.45, its lowest price in almost four years. The company set aside $186 million in its third quarter for potential loan losses and took a charge of about $85 million in anticipation of interest charges and fees it will not be able to collect. It also had higher-than-expected credit losses last month.

HEADLINE: Some Views on How to Steer the Economy Toward Recovery 

 BODY:
 The White House and Congress are engaged in a debate over the best way for the government to respond to the economic downturn now clearly under way. To help clarify the issues, Business Day asked the four experts who write the weekly Economic Scene -- Alan B. Krueger, Jeff Madrick, Virginia Postrel and Hal Varian -- to present brief viewpoints. Here are their comments.

TEMPORARY STIMULUS NEEDED -- A stimulus package is desirable because economic growth had ground to a halt even before the attacks of Sept. 11 and our military response raised the possibility that consumers and investors will panic, causing a sharp and sudden contraction in economic activity.
 The challenge for government policy is to temporarily stimulate the economy without jeopardizing the long-term budget outlook.
The Federal Reserve can control short-term interest rates, but long-term rates, which determine mortgage costs, depend largely on bond traders' expectations of the government's future borrowing needs. For the last year, long-term interest rates remained stubbornly high because of fears that this year's big tax cut package went too far and that budget deficits would reappear. A stimulus package that worsens the government's budget position after economic growth resumes will hurt because long-term rates will rise, choking off investment.
To maintain long-term budget discipline the stimulus package should be temporary. Further, a temporary sales tax cut or investment tax credit will deliver more bang for the buck than a permanent one because consumers and businesses will rush to take advantage of the tax incentives while they last.
President Bush is seeking to speed up tax cuts that he previously won largely for wealthy families. That was the wrong medicine before Sept. 11 -- and it is worse medicine now. Because low-income families have a higher propensity to spend additional income, even brief windfalls, aiming at low-income workers, would stimulate the economy more.
Traditionally, unemployment insurance is the first line of defense in a recession -- and for good reason because it expands only temporarily and aims at those most in need. Mr. Bush proposed extending benefits for an extra 13 weeks to people who lost their jobs after Sept. 11.
But the greater need is to expand eligibility, especially for workers who left welfare for work and are ineligible for support because they seek part-time work. And don't forget that people who lost a job before Sept. 11 are affected by the fallout from the attacks. They deserve government help as much as those who lost their jobs after the attacks.
Sacrifices during a recession are not evenly shared: they fall mainly on disadvantaged workers. This asymmetry makes it even more critical to shore up the safety net.
---- Alan B. Krueger

A RECESSION COULD DEEPEN -- If left unattended, a recession can get far worse than need be. This is particularly the case now. The economy was dangerously weakened by imbalances created in the late 1990's, long before the tragic events of Sept. 11. Americans borrowed too much, stock prices were historically high, the dollar was too strong, and business over-invested in technology.
Sept. 11, in turn, greatly raised the danger of a deep and prolonged recession as consumers and business, plagued by unprecedented uncertainties, cut back on spending.
For these reasons, significant economic stimulus is necessary. But tax cuts -- any tax cuts -- are the wrong way to go. Worse than a mere policy mistake, they are irresponsible now that the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon have made it impossible to know the minimal financial needs of a nation whose options had already been sharply narrowed because of deep cuts in future federal revenues.
Moreover, tax cuts won't work. Reductions in taxes, especially for the wealthy, will mostly be saved rather than spent. Capital gains tax cuts should be viewed with particular skepticism. Claims that such a cut produced the stock market boom of the late 1990's are obviously misleading. We all know what caused the boom. A dramatic drop in the cost of computer power, exciting new opportunities like the Internet, and a more expansive Federal Reserve policy were the main factors.
What is needed now is $100 billion to $150 billion of additional federal spending. After rebuilding New York City and buttressing the nation's security, expanded and more generous unemployment insurance should be the first priority. The newly unemployed are on the front line of suffering, especially when corporations are so quick to fire these days. These Americans will also spend the money quickly. The second priority should be additional revenue sharing with state and local governments, which are now reducing their social programs for lack of money.
If we are to entertain ideas about contributing to the long-term health of the American economy, public investment rather than more permanent tax cuts for business and the wealthy should have the priority. The nation has crying needs -- for school buildings, quality child care, greater computer access, and more -- that have been neglected for too long.
Tax cuts are designed not to stimulate the economy, but to reduce government in the long run. That's the wrong policy at a time when the need for government has never been made more clear.
----Jeff Madrick

DISCOURAGE UNCERTAINTY -- The greatest threat facing the economy is what Esther Dyson, a prominent technology analyst, recently called the "retreat to the present" -- the shortening of time horizons and the inability or unwillingness to plan or invest for the future. Any government response to the current slowdown should discourage that retreat.
The worst approach is a combination of dithering and one-shot stimulus attempts. The dithering fosters uncertainty, and one-shot rebates won't work. Both historical evidence and economic theory suggest people make their spending decisions based on long-term earnings expectations and save unexpected windfalls. In today's anxious environment, saving is all the more likely.
One way to remove uncertainty is to accelerate the Bush tax cuts, possibly reducing their total size. No one can trust a 10-year tax bill. A stretched-out schedule of tax cuts invites continuous tinkering. A bill with cuts focused over two or three years would be more trustworthy.
To stimulate employment and spending, especially by low-income Americans, the best policy would be a permanent cut in the payroll tax rate, not a quickie rebate. A payroll tax cut would make hiring less expensive and raise long-term take-home pay for all wage earners.
The retreat to the present cannot be addressed only through fiscal policy. Regulations create just as great a burden and just as much uncertainty. Congress may have handed the airlines $15 billion, but new security policies of dubious value will cost far more by deterring travel through frustrations and delays.
Meanwhile, the antitrust suit against Microsoft continues to roil the technology industry, and telecommunications regulations hamper the rollout of broadband capacity. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is about to decree that every bottle of sunscreen and baby oil must be redesigned. Complying with new mandates means not planning for productive investment.
The boldest move Congress could make would be to end the Postal Service's monopoly. On Sept. 11, it requested a 9 percent rate increase -- an extraordinary rise in the midst of a recession -- that acts as a new tax on every business and individual who must use the mail. Only a monopoly could get away with such an increase. Allowing competition would provide relief, and it would spur a new wave of innovation.
----Virginia Postrel

TAX CREDITS WOULD HELP -- Business investment plummeted during the first quarter of 2001 but consumers continued to spend throughout the summer. The decrease in investment spending slowed the economy, but the strength of consumer spending had, until recently, kept us from slipping into an outright recession.
After Sept. 11 both consumer and business spending came to an abrupt halt. Though this halt is likely to be temporary, there are fears that reduced spending will lead to more layoffs, which reduce income, causing further reductions in spending.
The priority should be to prevent this downward spiral into a deep recession from gaining momentum.
Monetary policy can be adjusted more rapidly than fiscal policy, but it has its limits. Short-term interest rates are now about as low as they can go. Further attempts to cut rates by pumping money into the economy risk unnecessary future inflation.
This leaves us with fiscal policy. There are two basic tools: cut taxes so as to increase spending by consumers and companies, and increase government expenditures. Though there are certainly worthwhile government projects to pursue, the debate about which to pay for will be lengthy and contentious. And even after such decisions, it takes many months for government spending to work its way through the system.
Consequently, the best fiscal policies now are an investment tax credit and a personal tax rebate. Both the credit and the rebate should be temporary.
A temporary investment tax credit gives businesses a strong incentive to invest now, rather than wait until later. It would make sense to base the personal tax rebate on last year's Social Security payroll tax since it would then reach low-income workers who didn't quality for the earlier income tax rebates. Tax rebates to low-income families and unemployment payments to laid-off workers will be spent quickly, not saved, helping to short-circuit the recessionary spiral.
Permanent tax cuts, cuts in capital gains taxes, reductions in the corporate income tax, direct industry subsidies, and pork barrel public spending are bad ideas. They are economically dubious, indirect, prone to abuse, and slow acting. Our focus should be on policies that are temporary, direct, simple, and can be carried out quickly.

HEADLINE: Package of G.O.P. Tax Cuts Is Approved by House Panel 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
In the first Congressional action on legislation to stimulate the economy in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, the House Ways and Means Committee today approved tax cuts that would put an extra $100 billion into corporate treasuries and people's pockets over the next 12 months.
 Most of the tax savings in this Republican package, about $70 billion, would go to businesses. But $13 billion would be used to give tax rebates to 30 million workers whose incomes were too low to entitle them to the rebates that other taxpayers received this year. 
 The bill is almost certain to be approved by the House, possibly next week, and be the basis for negotiations with the White House and Democratic-controlled Senate. 
The committee approved the measure on a party-line vote, 23 to 14, after a rancorous debate.
Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the top Democrat on the panel, accused Republicans of abandoning the spirit of bipartisanship and of "looking for a confrontation." Another senior Democrat, Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, said the committee was "shooting at the wrong target" and should be focusing on improving security and restoring consumer confidence rather than on tax cuts.
But the legislation's author, Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who heads the committee, said the bill "carefully balances the need for an immediate and vigorous jump-start with recognition of the long-term repercussions on the federal budget."
"Spending that creates economic growth years from now misses the point altogether," Mr. Thomas said.
Talk of the terrorist threat and the faltering economy pervaded the debate today. But lobbyists filled all the seats in the hearing room and stood two-deep along the walls. Business groups like the Chamber of Commerce were represented, and so were labor unions. There were lobbyists for the home builders, the insurance industry, and oil and gas interests, among others. And companies like American Express, General Motors and International Business Machines had representatives there.
The bill's cost -- about $100 billion in the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1, and $150 billion over 10 years -- is well above the $60 billion to $75 billion that President Bush recommended. Mark Weinberger, the assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax policy, said the president was pleased that Congress was moving forward with economic stimulus legislation but did not endorse this specific measure.
Under the bill, companies would be allowed to accelerate write-offs they can take for investments in plants and equipment. In addition, the corporate minimum tax would be repealed, and companies would be allowed a refund for all the minimum tax they have ever been assessed.
The minimum tax was enacted in 1986 to prevent companies from taking so many credits and deductions that they owed little if any taxes.
The bill would also give a special tax break, expanding markedly over the next decade, to some financial services companies with operations abroad. One company that lobbied hardest for this, lawmakers said, was General Electric, which has subsidiaries that would benefit from it.
Lower-paid workers who filed income tax returns this year but did not earn enough to have received a full rebate would now be entitled to $300 apiece, or $600 for a couple. If they have received a partial rebate, the amount would be subtracted from the $300 or $600.
In addition, middle- and high-income taxpayers would get a tax cut, because the 27 percent rate, scheduled to be lowered to 26 percent in 2004 and 25 percent in 2006, would be reduced to 25 percent immediately. That would benefit single people this year with taxable incomes above $27,000 and couples with taxable incomes above $45,000.
The bill did not include two Republican favorites: across-the-board lowering of the corporate income tax rate and the capital gains rate. But it would reduce to 18 percent from 20 percent the capital gains rate on investments bought this year or afterward and held from one to five years. At present, the 18 percent rate applies only to investments held for more than five years.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DAMAGES; 
White House Said to Have Relief Plan For Insurers

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON with JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
The White House plans to propose that the federal government relieve insurance companies of 80 percent or more of the cost of damages from any terrorist attacks over the next year, administration officials and Congressional officials said today.
 The proposal would leave the government vulnerable to huge losses if there were large-scale attacks, but administration officials said they thought it was the most workable plan at a time when the industry and others that depend on insurance need a quick fix. The proposal rejects measures drafted this week by the major insurance carriers and some top lawmakers to create a federally backed company to help provide insurance for future terrorist attacks. 
 The administration's proposal is expected to be formally announced next week. 
Experts estimate that about 70 percent of the insurance contracts covering terrorist attacks will expire by the end of the year, and reinsurers, who essentially offer insurance to the insurers, have said they plan to drop such coverage. That has led to concerns of a spiraling economic crisis at the end of the year. 
Lenders require insurance to provide financing for real estate, equipment and construction projects. In the absence of such insurance, the fear among manufacturers and real estate developers and bankers is that credit will shrivel up. 
"There is considerable concern about access to terrorism insurance," a senior administration official said today. "Our purpose is to make sure it is both affordable and accessible and enable the industry to price it at a reasonable rate."
If the proposal is adopted, the insurance industry would become the second to be provided federal assistance after the terrorist attacks last month. President Bush has already signed a $15 billion bailout package of assistance and loan guarantees for the airline industry.
But unlike that measure, the insurance legislation would not cost taxpayers anything unless there were more attacks. The industry has said it will be able to absorb the $40 billion or more in costs associated with losses from the September attacks. By contrast, the airline industry has been in considerably greater financial difficulty. A number of major airlines faced the prospect of bankruptcy even before Sept. 11.
Under the industry plan, a federally backed insurance company would pay the first $10 billion in claims before the government stepped in to pick up the rest. But administration officials, fearful of an unwieldy new government bureaucracy that would set premiums, rejected that plan in favor of one in which the government would pay some costs from the first dollar in claims.
Under the administration's proposal, the government would pay 80 percent of the first $20 billion of claims, with the industry paying the remaining 20 percent during the first year of the plan. 
After the first $20 billion in claims, the industry's contribution would drop to 10 percent. So, for instance, if there were $20 billion in claims, the government would pay $16 billion, and if the claims rose as high as $100 billion, the government would pay $88 billion.
The administration also considered and ultimately rejected a proposal to set a cap on the industry's liability.
Officials said that the administration's proposal would offer a tight definition of terrorism damage covered by government money and would not be a permanent program. Rather, they said it would be offered for only three years. And in the second and third years, they said, insurers would pay more of the costs.
Industry executives and lobbyists reacted cautiously to the plan today, saying that they could not assess it without seeing all of the details.
Julie A. Rochman, a senior vice president of the American Insurance Association, said that insurers were open to any plan that calmed the insurance markets. "The main concern," she said, "is to have some predictability and reliability."
Joel Freedman, the director of government affairs for the Hartford Financial Services Group, said the plan reflected the recognition by the administration of "the need for immediate action concerning a pending economic crisis."
Some insurers said they hoped that the White House's proposal that they pay 20 percent of the claims in a terrorism attack was an opening bid that would be negotiated downward as legislation moved through Congress.
"Twenty percent of a problem is better than 100 percent of a problem," one insurance executive said, "but 5 percent is even better. I think you're going to see some compromising as the legislation moves along."

PERSON: John Wilhelm 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
A Labor Leader on the Rise as His Workers Are Down

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
FOR the last two years John Wilhelm, president of the nation's largest hotel workers' union, has been considered the man to watch in the labor movement.
 He is the favorite, many union leaders say, to succeed John J. Sweeney as president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Succeeding at a tough task that Mr. Sweeney assigned him, Mr. Wilhelm engineered a surprising about-face by the nation's labor unions, getting them to drop a longstanding hostility toward immigrant labor and embrace the cause of low-wage immigrant workers. And Mr. Wilhelm, a graduate of Yale, has developed a reputation as labor's leading strategist in an area that many union leaders deem vitally important: persuading nonunion workers to join unions. 
 Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, however, Mr. Wilhelm has confronted a challenge that is testing his mettle like nothing before. As a result of the sharp drop in travel and tourism, one-third of his union's 265,000 members have been laid off.
"The situation is catastrophic," said Mr. Wilhelm, whose title is general president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union. 
The layoffs have been so sudden that at one resort, dismissal notices were written on workers' time cards. In Las Vegas, 15,000 of the 50,000 unionized hotel workers have been laid off, and the union local there has transformed its headquarters into an emergency center where the Red Cross and other social service agencies are helping thousands of beleaguered union members. Because of a plunge in dues payments, Mr. Wilhelm himself has laid off 20 percent of his union's national staff and has taken a 20 percent pay cut along with the rest of the union's leaders.
Suddenly Mr. Wilhelm is spending his time hopscotching from city to city, trying to figure out how to help laid-off hotel workers pay their rent and keep their health insurance. And that comes after he spent much of September in New York, providing comfort to the families of the 73 workers at the Windows on the World restaurant, most of them union members, who died in the attacks on the World Trade Center.
"The layoffs are a disaster not only for our members and their families, but for the country," Mr. Wilhelm said. "The implications for society are really terrible. In the name of welfare reform, we told everyone to go to work, and many of these former welfare recipients found jobs in our industry. But now suddenly there is no work for a lot of them, and the safety net is pretty much gone."
This past week Mr. Wilhelm joined hands with leading executives in the hotel industry to seek to persuade Congress and the White House to help laid-off workers by having the government provide a year of unemployment insurance and health coverage. The industry and the union are also calling for tax breaks to encourage Americans to travel and patronize hotels and restaurants.
"The travel and tourism industry is facing the most challenging times in its history," said Jonathan Tisch, chief executive of Loews Hotels. "It's very helpful when you walk into the offices of elected officials showing that management and labor are working together."
Mr. Wilhelm more often wrestles with industry executives than works arm-in-arm with them, although he said the newfound cooperation could ultimately build a stronger industry. He has frequently been arrested in sit-ins at hotels that refuse to grant union recognition. In an organizing drive at the Venetian casino in Las Vegas, its owner, Sheldon Adelson, became so angry that he sought to pressure a hospital not to honor Mr. Wilhelm in a charity event.
One reason many union leaders see Mr. Wilhelm as the obvious choice to succeed Mr. Sweeney is his success at organizing. In Las Vegas, he oversaw efforts to unionize nearly 30,000 casino and hotel workers, helping many gain middle-class wages. In San Francisco, thanks in part to his efforts, the union obtained legislation that requires new hotels built with tax breaks not to oppose unionization efforts. 
Even in the shortest conversation with Mr. Wilhelm, his fierce dedication to unions comes through. He became a union activist soon after graduating from Yale; he responded to a job advertisement seeking someone willing to work long hours for low pay. In that first job, he helped lead a historic organizing drive that unionized Yale's clerical workers.
"Today if you work hard and play by the rules, but you work nonunion in our industry, you are consigned to a dead-end, lousy job with no benefits, no dignity, no respect, and you need to work two or three jobs just to make ends meet," he said.
MR. WILHELM denies any interest in succeeding Mr. Sweeney, although he said that if other union leaders got together and told him that they needed him to carry labor forward, he might reconsider.
He is dismayed that the terrorist attacks could derail efforts to gain better benefits for legal immigrants and win amnesty for illegal ones. But he continues to battle for immigrants, who make up much of his union's membership. 
"Many Americans fail to realize that for the economy to rebound and grow, immigrants are necessary to the work force," he said. "And people too often forget that many of the victims in New York and many of the heroes were immigrants."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: SURVEY; 
New Yorkers Are Shaken, but Resolute, After Attack

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY and MARJORIE CONNELLY

 BODY:
A month after the terrorist attack that killed 5,000 people, destroyed the World Trade Center and shook New York to its core, many city residents say that they feel great pride and faith in their wounded metropolis. But they also say that their civic allegiance is tempered -- though far from crushed -- by haunting memories and by concerns about future attacks, according to a new poll conducted by The New York Times and CBS News.
 The city's already jittery residents could only have been further rattled by events that occurred since the poll's completion on Tuesday. Reports of a case of anthrax at NBC News in Rockefeller Center surfaced yesterday, just a day after the F.B.I. issued a warning about the possibility of more terrorist attacks. 
 Even before these incidents, three of four residents participating in the poll said they were very concerned about another terrorist attack in New York. Despite those fears, most residents said they have no intention of hiding in their homes or moving away. Instead, nearly all of the poll's respondents -- 93 percent -- said that they harbor a good image of the city, and two-thirds said that they plan to be living in the city four years from now. 
Over all, the poll seems to indicate that residents have adopted a reflexive, almost defiant position on their city's resilience. In a New York Times poll conducted a few weeks before the Sept. 11 attack, 59 percent said that life in the city had improved in the last four years. Now, after the disaster, those who saw an improvement in city life jumped to 69 percent -- the highest percentage in at least 10 years.
But these results do not suggest a cavalier approach to the dangers of the day; far from it. A month later, the attack's reverberations continue to be felt by nearly half of those polled in a telephone survey that was conducted Oct. 6 to Oct. 9, in which 983 adult residents were interviewed and for which the margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
Some of those questioned cited aftereffects that range from the mundane to the profound, from the loss of television service to the loss of peace of mind. Thirteen percent cited problems with transportation and traffic; an equal number cited depression and other forms of anxiety. 
The poll also demonstrates how the collapse of the twin towers created a dust that covered not just Lower Manhattan but an entire city in a blanket of grief. One in every five residents contacted in the poll said that a relative or close friend is missing or was hurt or killed in the attack. And three in five said that someone in their circle of friends and relatives knew someone who was missing, hurt or killed.
Many of these jumbled emotions -- of resolve and despair, of civic pride and wrenching grief -- are harbored by the likes of Norman Steinmetz, of Staten Island. A retired New York police officer, he expressed great affection for his native city and deep pride in how New Yorkers shook off the paralysis of shock to begin rebuilding. He is resisting his daughter's pleas that he move to Florida because, he said, "I was born and raised here."
But in the same conversation, the enormity of the loss overcame the former officer, and he began to sob. "Look at what happened to my beautiful city!" whispered Mr. Steinmetz, who is 70. "I can't take it."
The attack has subtly changed some of his habits, he said. For example, he said that when he takes the bus over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which provides a majestic view of Lower Manhattan, he now sits on the side facing the ocean, away from the city.
"I sit so I don't have to see the emptiness," he said.
A security guard named Shirley White used to work in one of the buildings that once stood in that emptiness. She too said that she admired how New Yorkers rallied around one another -- "We have finally come together," she said -- and she too said that she had no intention of moving from her home in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. 
But as she carries on with her life, Ms. White said, the attack continues to disrupt her days and nights. The building she now guards is much shorter than the twin towers, which is fine by her. ("I'm trying not to get into any skyscraping buildings," she said.) But that building is in Midtown, which means that her round-trip commute by a slowed subway system is at least two hours longer. 
More important, she said, are the memories of all those people she used to see, passing by her as she stood sentry in the south tower of the World Trade Center. "Every day I think about them," she said. "And every night I think about them.
"I'm afraid, but I can't let that stop me from doing my work," she continued. "I might as well lie down and say, 'Get me too.' I have to do what I have to do."
That last statement by Ms. White, who is 55 years old and the mother of six, might as well be inscribed on the city seal. At a time when there are security checkpoints at various tunnels and bridges, 9 of 10 city residents said they endorsed having more checkpoints and metal detectors at public events and public buildings -- even if it meant waiting on line for an hour or more.
In addition, three-quarters of the respondents said that they would be willing to arrive at the airport three hours early for any domestic flight. And two-thirds said that they would support a requirement that people in the United States carry a national electronic identification card, or "smart card."
The poll also seems to suggest a growing tolerance for racial profiling -- for law officers' stopping people of a specific race or ethnicity because they believe these groups are more likely to commit certain types of crimes. 
In a poll conducted in April 2000, after the acquittal of four New York police officers charged with the shooting death of an unarmed African immigrant, Amadou Diallo, in the Bronx, 84 percent of the city's residents said that profiling was never justified.
But in the recent poll, only half the respondents said there was never justification, with 24 percent of the black respondents and 31 percent of the Hispanic respondents finding the practice acceptable. At the same time, 85 percent of all city residents who were questioned said that Arab-Americans, Muslims and immigrants from the Middle East were at least somewhat likely to be singled out unfairly as a result of last month's terrorist attack.
"During these times of heightened security, when you never know when they're going to strike or what's going to happen in the city," said Richard Collado, 36, "you more or less say, 'Fine, you can stop me; I'm Hispanic, but you can stop me if you need to.' But two years down the road, with the war over, and nothing going on anymore, then I don't approve."
Mr. Collado, a stockbroker who lives in Bay Ridge, added: "If Hispanics or any group are all of a sudden creating havoc like this, then I don't mind being stopped. If it's for the greater good of everyone else that I have to be stopped, then that's fine."
There were other indications that the city is trying to find its footing on unsettled ground, as personified by Sharifah Taylor, 24, an unemployed sales representative from Crown Heights. "I always had trouble with crime here, but just seeing everyone pull together after what's happened makes me feel real good about the city," she said. But she also said that she avoids the subways and has not been to Manhattan since the attack.
"If I had a choice, I would probably leave the city, but terrorism can happen anywhere," Ms. Taylor said. "I'm just watching what's going on, and staying where I am."
One in five city residents said that they are less likely to frequent restaurants. Two in five residents who described themselves as occasional or frequent air travelers said that they were now less likely to fly. Nearly 30 percent said that they are more likely to attend religious services. And more than half -- including John Ferruzzi of Forest Hills, Queens -- say that they find themselves spending more time with their family and close friends. 
In the last month, Mr. Ferruzzi has gone through the experiences of a lifetime, and he is only 20 years old. He said he has seen a city of millions set aside cultural differences to come together in true "New York spirit." But a good friend of his lost a friend in the World Trade Center collapse, while the neighbor of another good friend lost a son.
"Everywhere I went there was another story," he said, his voice shaking. "Just talking about it -- forget about it."

Polling Method
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews with 983 adults, conducted Oct. 6 to 9 in all parts of New York City. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. 
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of city exchanges. The exchanges were chosen so as to ensure that each area in the city was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to account for household size and number of telephone lines into the home, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to borough, race, sex, age, education and Hispanic descent.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: Budget Woes Of the M.T.A. Grow Worse 

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Anyone who has glanced at a subway map printed after Sept. 11 can understand the immense physical damage wrought to the system by the World Trade Center attack: an eerie, empty space where a subway line once ran, its tunnels now collapsed and three of its stations closed.
 But those blows and the cost of fixing them were only the most visible aspects of the damage. As transit budget analysts in the city and Albany examine their balance sheets, it is becoming clear that the subway and bus system -- already in troubled financial territory because of the weakening economy -- is facing the kind of money problems it has not seen in years. 
 And, short of extraordinary help from the federal government, the state or the city, transit officials might have to consider two options they have not considered in years to fix those problems: service cuts or a fare increase. 
Nobody, in so many words, is talking about either option as imminent. Both seem unthinkable after so many years in which subway and bus service improved markedly, ridership rose to historic highs and the economy pumped more than anyone expected into the system's coffers.
But warning signs were already beginning to appear long before Sept. 11, as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority projected operating deficits that would grow to $406 million by 2004.
The authority, even in good years, projects running annual deficits and then always finds ways to patch them -- which it must, because it is required under law to balance its budget.
The most recent deficit projections, however, were more serious because portions of corporate taxes and other taxes that go to support the transit system's operations were expected to fall as the economy worsened. And income from fares, which also pays for operations and had risen rapidly for years, was beginning to level off.
In a transit analysis issued last April, the city's Independent Budget Office wrote: "In recent years, the agency has been able to eliminate its anticipated shortfalls without fare increases. This may become more difficult if an economic downturn depresses ridership and dedicated tax revenue."
The events of Sept. 11 have now made those concerns seem like only small precursors of what was to come.
In the week after the World Trade Center collapse, transit officials estimated that the system -- which has a total annual budget of about $4.6 billion -- would lose as much as $326 million by the end of next year as a result of the attack. These losses result partly from lower fares, as fewer people ride subways and buses. It is also because of further drops in the tax subsidies in the wake of the attack. And finally, spending to manage the emergency -- like overtime and repairs -- will run into the tens of millions of dollars.
None of these costs include the hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild the 1 and 9 line in Lower Manhattan -- additional money that transit officials hope to receive from the federal government.
Marc V. Shaw, executive director of the authority, said that negotiations will soon begin with the subway's insurers and with federal and state officials. The M.T.A. will haggle over how much assistance can be expected not just to rebuild the system but also to help it recover from the direct and indirect economic impact of the attacks.
"At the end of the day, it's going to be hard to tell how much of it is going to be attributable to the economy and how much is attributable to Sept. 11," he said.
Depending on what happens with those negotiations, Mr. Shaw said, the authority could be faced with very tough choices. "This is something that's going to cause problems," he said. "We're going to have to have many debates about how to fix the holes in our operating budget."
The last time the fare was raised was in 1995, to $1.50 from $1.25, though discounts and free transfers built into the MetroCard system have actually reduced the average fare to around $1.07.
Raising the fare has been considered politically unpalatable by Gov. George E. Pataki, who faces re-election next year.
But it is now an even more difficult option to consider, because it would be seen essentially as a tax increase at a time when the economy was suffering. And it could further discourage ridership at a time when the city is urging people to rely on mass transit as never before -- and when the system needs high ridership for financial reasons.
"Nobody likes to touch the topic of fare hikes," said one city official who monitors the transit budget. "It's such a taboo thing."
Service cuts, the other choice, have also not been made since 1995, when the agency closed one subway station in Brooklyn, eliminated three local bus routes, and provided less frequent service on 11 subway lines and 60 bus lines to bridge a nearly $400 million budget deficit for the 1996 fiscal year.
That gap is comparable to what transit officials were expecting by 2004 even before the trade center attack happened.
But at a time when service has already not kept pace with the increases in ridership over the last few years, leaving many trains and buses overpacked, cuts are a topic that has become almost as taboo as higher fares.
Transit officials say they think there is more fat to trim around the edges, making cuts that would not be noticed by much of the riding public. But other analysts say that is probably unlikely because so many savings have already been squeezed out of the system.
And labor costs are also likely to rise because the authority's contract with its main union expires next year and will need to be renegotiated.
The only way to avoid the hard choices, officials say, would be significant amounts of money from the federal government to help the system operate.
"Like the M.T.A. and the governor, I look to Washington," said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, the watchdog group. "I've been through 20 years of following their finances, and this is a very unusual situation. I think they have a real case to make."
But he and others acknowledge that the competing demands for that money will be fierce.

BYLINE:  Reuters

 BODY:
 Cap Gemini Ernst & Young warned yesterday that its third-quarter earnings would fall far short of expectations and declined to provide new forecasts for 2001 and 2002, citing economic weakness and the terrorist attacks in the United States. The warning sent shares in the company, one of Europe's largest computer services firms, down more than 7 percent. "In an economy that had already experienced a heavy slowdown over the last few months, the shock caused by the Sept. 11 attacks -- which cost the group significant losses in revenue and bookings -- has pushed back by at least one or two quarters the hope of a recovery in growth," the company said.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER SETS CUTBACKS AT FREIGHTLINER

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 DaimlerChrysler A.G., the largest truckmaker, said it would cut 2,700 jobs, close as many as three plants and take a $330 million charge in the fourth quarter to try to return its Freightliner truck unit to profitability. The unit -- the maker of Freightliner, Western Star and Sterling trucks -- will eliminate 1,600 union workers and 1,100 salaried positions, bringing the work force down to 11,700, a reduction of more than half since 1999. Freightliner, based in Portland, Ore., expects to cut about $850 million in costs annually by 2004. The truck unit has been hurt by a drop in demand as the economy slowed. DaimlerChrysler, based in Stuttgart, Germany, has also been hurt by a contractual obligation to repurchase trucks from customers for fixed prices.

HEADLINE: The Return of Partisanship 

 BODY:
The brief era of cooperation on the economy, fraying around the edges for days, all but fell apart in Washington yesterday. Almost as soon as President Bush finished hugging the high ground Thursday night in his news conference, House Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee spent all day Friday ramming through a $100 billion tax-cut package filled with bonuses for corporations, wealthy Americans and others least in need of help. Republicans waited until 10:30 p.m. the night before to spring the bill on Democrats, reverting to the poisonous old practices of steamrolling legislation through and, this time, exploiting a tragic national emergency in the process.
 Mr. Bush is not without some responsibility for ruining the bipartisan atmosphere. On Thursday he stunned Democrats by saying that energy legislation should be part of an immediate economic stimulus package. It was an invitation to exploit the economic crisis to ram through drilling in the Alaskan wilderness and tax breaks for big energy companies. 
 Democrats have not been immune to partisan skirmishing, especially in trying to add pork-barrel spending to their own proposals for economic stimulus. But the Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee have recently done the most to betray the agreement operating since Sept. 11 that effectively said that no one would try to piggyback pet ideological measures on top of legislation to carry out the country's most urgent priorities.
Until a week ago, Republicans in Congress were following the lead of both Mr. Bush and House Speaker Dennis Hastert in preaching cooperation. Mr. Hastert counseled party faithful in the House to wait and hammer out a stimulus package with Democrats, who favor spending over tax cuts and favor tax cuts for the working class rather than the wealthy. Conservatives like Representatives Tom DeLay and Dick Armey of Texas have gone along, but grumpily. Behind the scenes they have been begging the White House to let Mr. Bush show what they believe to be his true colors as a tax-cutting conservative.
The president took a first step toward complying a week ago, saying that he too favored a barrage of tax cuts as the main way to stimulate the economy from now on. His remarks had the immediate effect of undercutting Mr. Hastert's attempts to get his hard-right colleagues to hold off on a tax-cut package. As a result, tax-cut ideologues worked all day yesterday, in the shadow of anthrax scares at home and warfare in Afghanistan, to get as much of their agenda as possible approved by the Ways and Means Committee and sent to the House for a vote next week. Republicans may be counting on Mr. Bush's overwhelming popularity to compel wavering lawmakers to go along with what they know is an unsound economic approach. It is up to the Democrats and moderate Republicans to insist that any tax cut finally enacted meet the test of actually helping the economy and providing the most aid to those most vulnerable to hard times.
Mr. Bush will also be making a major mistake if he joins with his party's ideologues to try to take advantage of the war and push through an energy package that was crafted by energy lobbyists meeting in secret with Vice President Dick Cheney earlier this year. Pushing that sort of measure now is an invitation to filibusters and other disruptive tactics by opponents, exactly the wrong note to strike when everyone is trying to preserve national unity in the face of terrorist threats. Mr. Bush may be feeling the heat from his conservative colleagues. But if he cheapens the trust that he has won because of his handling of the war, he may find it hard to win back.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Doesn't See 'Carlos' as a Terrorist 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
The government of President Hugo Chavez, who has a reputation of not shying from incendiary comment, touched off a controversy this week by saying that it did not consider a Venezuelan-born assassin a terrorist. Government ministers also cast doubt on Washington's antiterrorism effort.
 The dispute began on Tuesday, when Mr. Chavez, on a European tour, said Venezuela had to ensure that the rights of the assassin, Illich Ramirez Sanchez, who is jailed for life in France for killing two French secret agents, were respected. Mr. Ramirez, well known as Carlos the Jackal, has been linked to assassinations, bombings and the kidnappings of 11 oil ministers at a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1975 in Vienna. 
 Pressed by reporters in Caracas to clarify Mr. Chavez's comments, Defense Minister Jose Vicente Rangel and Deputy Foreign Minister Arevalo Mendez said on Wednesday that the government did not see Mr. Ramirez as a terrorist because he had committed no crimes in Venezuela and had not been convicted here.
"I, Arevalo Mendez, am not going to be judging anyone called Carlos Illich Ramirez as a terrorist, a nonterrorist or even as a pickpocket," Mr. Mendez told reporters. 
Ministers have also questioned American evidence whether Osama bin Laden is responsible for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the use of force against Afghanistan, where Mr. bin Laden is in hiding.
Interior and Justice Minister Luis Miquilena asked today whether firing missiles "indiscriminately against defenseless people" was the best way to capture Mr. bin Laden.
The comments, political experts said, could prod the United States into toughening its line with a government that American officials have tolerated. Even if Mr. Chavez has annoyed Washington with his leftist pronouncements and reservations about American military aid to fight the war against drugs in Colombia, Venezuela is one of the United States' biggest suppliers of oil.
The uproar may further damage bilateral ties. "This is not the right time to play word games," said Michael Shifter, who follows Venezuela for the Inter-American Dialogue, an organization in Washington. "It doesn't seem very serious, given the current climate, and it seems to test the limits of U.S. tolerance."
Although the comments are clearly at odds with marshaling support for the Afghanistan campaign, a State Department official in Washington said, "Carlos is where he belongs -- in jail."
In Caracas, though, the declarations have given fresh ammunition to Mr. Chavez's critics, who see offhand comments by him and his ministers as damaging to the country.
"These positions of the highest Venezuelan government officials can bring no benefit to the nation," El Universal, the newspaper, said today in an editorial. "But it can put the country's fundamental economic interests in danger."

No News Is Good News

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
We learned this week that if we can't bring Osama bin Laden to justice dead or alive, the White House can still slap him with that most American form of capital punishment -- kicking him off network television. 
 In her conference call to TV news executives, Condoleezza Rice asked them to think twice before letting Mr. bin Laden appear unexpurgated in video again, arguing that Americans must be shielded from both his propaganda and any coded messages he might be sending to his operatives. Thus did Ms. Rice send the world three not too effectively coded messages of her own: 1) that the administration entertains at least a passing fantasy that Al Qaeda, despite its access to both the Internet and the Arabic superstation Al Jazeera (35 million viewers worldwide, 150,000 by dish and cable in the U.S.), can be disrupted by keeping it off the likes of Fox; 2) that the administration's ambitions to manage the news know no bounds; and 3) that the White House was as spooked by Mr. bin Laden's almost instant rebuttal to George W. Bush last Sunday as the rest of us were. 
 The last message, at least, is understandable. This may be a war "pitting the world's mightiest industrial nation against a cave dweller," as George Will has put it, but the cave dweller, we keep being rudely reminded, is no caveman. Through McLuhanesque savvy, brazen timing and a cunning message, he upstaged the president of the United States on the day he sent American troops into battle. "Bin Laden Is Winning the Propaganda War," read the subsequent headline in The Guardian in London, referring to the insidious slickness with which Mr. bin Laden's address broadened his inflammatory rhetoric to embrace the Palestinian cause, in which he had previously shown little interest. 
Instead of fighting Mr. bin Laden's hate speech with speech of his own, Mr. Bush's first countermove was to downplay his importance by dropping his name altogether from public statements -- a strategy upended by Ms. Rice's act of three days later. By Thursday, the president's nemesis was back in full force. Fear is Mr. bin Laden's weapon of choice, and only hours before Mr. Bush's commanding prime-time press conference, the fear Al Qaeda brought to America was surging again, courtesy of a stark, unspecific and therefore terrorizing F.B.I. alert of new attacks that the president could neither illuminate nor defuse. 
A month after Sept. 11, a week into war, the fear engendered by Mr. bin Laden and his troops takes forms both obvious (Cipro now rivals Viagra in sales on the Internet) and not. Among the more subtle displacements of our anxiety has been the desperate but human effort, by the administration and everyone else, to tame an uncharted future into predictability by jamming it into a familiar historical paradigm. Even as Mr. Bush repeatedly -- very repeatedly -- tells us that we are fighting "a different kind of war," his defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, tries to sand down those differences by saying that the fight against terrorism resembles the cold war.
This may be plausible in terms of duration and some tactics, but there are, sadly, some riveting distinctions. The Soviet Union, unlike Al Qaeda and its fraternal networks, was identifiable on the map, not in hiding in 60-plus countries. It never sent four bombs to wreak mass destruction on New York and Washington. It didn't have a corps of kamikaze operatives. It was possessed by a godless ideology, not the blind faith that it was acting righteously with God's blessing. What in part made Mr. bin Laden's TV appearance last Sunday unnerving was that it reminded us how little he resembles Khrushchev and Castro. We didn't even know for sure where or when he recorded his video, let alone where he is now. Whatever message he sent to the Islamic world, the unencoded one he delivered to Americans is that the war on terrorism is not the cold war but, what everyone most fears, a leap into the unknown.
Even so, America's New War, as CNN has branded it, is already whipping up one of the cold war's most self-destructive national maladies -- a will to stifle dissent. Such has been the disproportionate avalanche of invective about Susan Sontag, Bill Maher and Noam Chomsky that you'd hardly guess they were a writer, a late-late-night comic and a linguistics professor -- Americans with less clout and popular standing than a substitute weatherman on the "Today" show. Listening to all the similar overheated rage about pacifists on and off college campuses, you'd think as well that there was a large and serious antiwar movement afoot to rival that of the Vietnam 60's. Reality check: polls show that 94 percent of Americans support the war effort, with even a supposed bastion of leftism like the Harvard student body proving pro-war by more than two to one. 
That the right can whip itself into a rage about an American left so small and marginalized suggests that it, too, is unhinged by fear, and can only displace it by a knee-jerk refighting of yesterday's cold war culture wars. Some conservatives are so eager to manufacture traitors that they have yet to recognize that, post-Sept. 11, the leaders of the Democratic Party, Tom Daschle and Richard Gephardt (not to mention Al Gore), have been more fiercely loyal to the administration's war policy than the Republicans busy accusing Colin Powell of appeasement of Saddam.
The truth is that the country is as united as it ever could be, and willing to follow the president wherever he leads. So far Mr. Bush has done much to earn that unity by prosecuting the war in its early stages with patient, nuanced policies that have defied the hawks in his own party (and which they would have pilloried as dawdling and feckless flip-flopping if carried out by a Democratic president). On Thursday Mr. Bush again demonstrated his new-found ability to jettison past axioms for new realities when he acknowledged that U.N-sponsored nation building, not the Northern Alliance, is the key to Afghanistan's future. But there is much we don't know about what his administration is up to, and its determination to keep us in the dark and to stifle any criticism makes the minimal amount of dissent more alarming than reassuring.
Ms. Rice's effort to browbeat the networks is doomed in any event -- as is Ari Fleischer's attempt to expand it to newspapers -- because no competitive news organization will cede its editorial process to the government. Yet it is but one example of what looks like a major effort by the administration to manage news that in no way threatens the security of military operations. Recent days have also brought an unorthodox cancellation of a daily Pentagon press briefing, a move to replace honest journalism with propaganda at the Voice of America, a short-lived effort to cut Congressmen out of the military and intelligence loop, and the revelation that Karl Rove, the president's political guru, went so far as to call a historian he'd never met, Robert Dallek, to lean on him after Mr. Dallek criticized the president in USA Today for delaying his return to Washington on Sept. 11. Mr. Rove tried to sell Mr. Dallek the false story, later retailed by too many gullible journalists, that Mr. Bush had been scarce because Air Force One had been under threat.
That's not the only misleading information put out by the Bush White House in a single month. Paul O'Neill, the treasury secretary, tried to cheerlead the stock market by purporting that "our economy was beginning to rebound before Sept. 11 " -- soon to be flatly contradicted by such indicators as the pre-Sept. 11 rise in unemployment. When the first anthrax case was reported in Florida, Tommy Thompson, the health secretary, prematurely announced that that there was "no other indications anybody else has got anthrax" and floated the clinically useless factoid that the victim had been drinking water "out of a stream while traveling through North Carolina." The credibility of official pronouncements about subsequent anthrax cases has been under a cloud ever since.
The point of much of this dissembling, like the attempt to banish Mr. bin Laden from TV, is simple enough: what we don't know won't hurt us. At his press conference, Mr. Bush gave a progress report on the war to date -- and found solid advances on every single front, without a single setback, not even a minor one, of any kind. Asked if the American people had to make any sacrifices for the war effort, the only one he could come up with was longer lines at the airport. In other words, all the news is good news. Decide for yourself if that makes you feel safe.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: PROTESTS; 
Thousands of Pakistanis Demonstrate but Police Hold Down the Violence

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ

DATELINE: QUETTA, Pakistan, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets across Pakistan today to protest American attacks on Afghanistan and their country's support for the American-led alliance.
 But a bristling display of troops and weaponry kept violence to a minimum in what appeared to be a victory for President Pervez Musharraf's get-tough policy with protesters. 
 Chants of "Death to America!" and "Osama, nuclear power of the Muslim world!" and demands for the removal of General Musharraf were heard at demonstrations from the northern village of Sakha Kot near the Afghan border to the southern port of Karachi. There were scattered reports of vehicles burned, of offices ransacked and of a policeman shot dead. 
In anticipation of large crowds at the first Friday Prayers after the bombing began, General Musharraf had ordered the police and paramilitary agencies to "move firmly, swiftly and efficiently against law breakers" and not to allow clerics to use mosques to incite protests.
The confrontations occurred on the second anniversary of the military coup that installed General Musharraf as president. The level of protests and violence in the coming weeks may very well decide whether the 58-year-old career soldier remains in office or is forced out as a result of his high-risk decision to help the Americans destroy an Afghan government that Pakistan formerly supported.
The biggest demonstration today occurred in Karachi, with 12 million people Pakistan's largest city, where protesters set fire to a KFC restaurant and several vehicles. The police fired tear gas to break up protests, and huge barricades were erected on roads leading to the United States Consulate.
Protesters ordered passengers off a bus and set it on fire. Hospitals reported treating several people for injuries, but there were no reports of fatalities there.
The only reported death was of a policeman who was killed in a clash with protesters in Sakha Kot, a volatile area near the Afghan border in northern Pakistan. The authorities said protesters set fire to a customs checkpoint and a police station when the police fired into the air to stop them. The policeman was shot dead, but it was unclear who fired the shot.
Protests were also held near Pasni, an Arabian Sea port, where American troops are stationed at the local airport. Clerics threatened to send protesters to overwhelm the airport in the coming days.
In Quetta, the authorities were determined to avoid a repetition of violent protests here and in nearby Kushlak that left five people dead earlier this week. The streets were lined with what the police said were 2,000 policemen and soldiers. 
Several people said word had also been sent to camps and neighborhoods where Afghan refugees live warning that they faced deportation if they took part in the protests.
Army trucks were posted near United Nations offices, which were attacked on Monday, and armored vehicles and trucks loaded with riot policemen patrolled the streets.
"We want the potential trouble makers to know that we are ready," Shoaib Suddel, the head of the provincial police, said as he stood in front of half a dozen armored vehicles with mounted 50-caliber machine guns outside a mosque in the heart of Quetta.
Mr. Suddel refused to comment on rumors that his forces had been given orders to shoot to kill protesters who became violent. "We have a legitimate right to defend ourselves," he said.
Muhammad Saleem, who had been kneeling to pray in the street outside the mosque not far from where Mr. Suddel talked to reporters, said he was not intimidated by the show of force.
"If they want to kill us, they will kill us," Mr. Saleem, 23, a slightly built, unemployed car mechanic, said with a grim face. "It is an honor for a Muslim to die in a jihad."
A brief skirmish broke out when Mr. Saleem's group stood and shouted, "Allah Akbar!" or "God Is Great." Policemen armed with long bamboo staves swung hard at several young men, sending them running for safety.
But no one was killed in Quetta today. About 8,000 men and boys marched from mosques across the city to a giant cricket field, where they listened to impassioned speeches from religious leaders and responded with cries of revenge against the United States.
Despite the angry words, the mullahs from the Jamiat Ulema Islam Party who organized the rally told the crowd to go home in peace as hundreds of helmeted policemen and soldiers in riot gear watched from the periphery of the stadium.
They did, leaving behind posters threatening to "Crush America" and a smoldering effigy of President Bush.

 BODY:
Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.

DANIEL BERGSTEIN
Consummate Movie Fan
 It hardly made sense to enter the office Oscar pool if Daniel Bergstein was in it. He was unbeatable. Year after year, he took the money. 
 Mr. Bergstein, 38, the corporate secretary at the Port Authority, was not just an avid movie fan. He knew just about everything there was to know about movies. Everything. ''He was always interested in how the movies were directed, the angles, what kind of close-ups,'' said his wife, Alicia Bergstein. 
 Not only did he watch countless movies, buy countless movies, devour countless movie reviews, but he read everything that told him anything about movies. 
 And he had this uncanny knack for predicting Oscar winners. Not that he got every category correct. Last year, he missed the best picture award, which went to ''Gladiator.'' He picked ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'' ''He thought that was the perfect movie,'' his wife said.
 Among his all-time favorite films were the Godfather movies. (He felt that ''Godfather II'' was the best of the lot.) His birthday was coming up. He had sent his wife an e-mail message with an unsubtle hint: ''The Godfather DVD set is coming out. That would be a good birthday gift.''

MICHAEL A. BOCCARDI
A Loyal Scout
 Taking more than a dozen 15-year-old Boy Scouts to the wilds of New Mexico for a 10-day trip on horseback might not sound like the ideal trip for some people, but it was for Michael A. Boccardi. ''It was a once in a lifetime thing,'' said his friend Ed Maselli, an assistant scoutmaster of Troop 40 in Mount Vernon, N.Y., which Mr. Boccardi led as scoutmaster. ''Snakes, bears, the whole nine yards. He loved it.''
 Mr. Boccardi, 30, worked as a senior vice president of institutional relations at Fred Alger Management. 
 Scouting captured Mr. Boccardi's imagination from the age of 10; he had been an Eagle Scout himself. A typical month might include 20 nights devoted to various activities and events, according to the Westchester-Putnam Council of the Boy Scouts of America.
 Scouting was on his mind on the morning of Sept. 11. From his office, he sent an e-mail message to a mother of one of the boys just before 9 a.m. It was the troop's revised newsletter.

COURTNEY WALCOTT
Uncovering a Busy Life
 After the attack, Delano Walcott learned two things about his quiet, unassuming eldest brother, Courtney, a manager at IQ Financial Systems in 2 World Trade Center.
 First: Courtney, 37, was the most organized man in the solar system. In his Hackensack, N.J., apartment, the bills were in sequence and organized by category; his shirts were separated into short-sleeve, long-sleeve and dress; the khakis sorted by shade, the shoes by season, the sneakers by sport and the sock drawers by type and color.
 Second: Courtney Walcott had good reason to keep his life uncluttered. He was too busy to waste time hunting for socks that matched.
 Delano Walcott knew about the regular visits his brother made to their parents in Queens and their grandmother in Hempstead. He also knew about the peewee football camp he helped coach at his alma mater, Hofstra, every summer, where he supervised one godson; and the basketball team he coached in Hackensack, where he watched over another.
 But as he sat at the memorial service at the Allen A.M.E. Church in Jamaica, Queens, Mr. Walcott learned that every Monday and Friday after work, his brother would drive to the church to be a mentor to teenage boys, counseling them, getting them jobs at Shea Stadium. Then he would drive home to New Jersey. At least 30 boys told the Walcotts how Courtney Walcott, who was divorced and longed for children of his own, had graced their lives. The family had had no idea.

W. DAVID BAUER
Sports and Learning
 W. David Bauer took part in a triathlon the weekend before the World Trade Center was attacked. At 45, he did better in the bicycling, running and swimming competition than he had expected to, said his wife, Ginny. He went to his sons' football scrimmage. He grilled steaks and drank cabernet wine with friends they entertained at their Rumson, N.J., home.
 ''It was a perfect weekend,'' Mrs. Bauer said. It was also the sum of what he loved best: sports, family, friends and competition.
 Mr. Bauer was head of global sales for eSpeed, a division of Cantor Fitzgerald. The job came a year ago after a series of promotions at Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse. 
 Mrs. Bauer said sports was a big part of their family life. But her husband was constantly telling his children that lifelong learning was important, too. To one son who loved playing basketball, he would say: ''Just be the smartest basketball player.''

JOE RYAN ALLEN
A Knack for Connecting
 Joe Ryan Allen was one of those guys who still had his friends from first grade. His brother-in-law described him as ''the family ambassador'' because of his knack for connecting with people.
 Mr. Allen, 39, had done well in his career as a bond broker at Cantor Fitzgerald. But the centerpiece of his life was his many friends and his family -- a younger sister, three older brothers, six nieces and nephews.
 His sister, Jennifer D'Auria, said Mr. Allen was single and thinking about settling down after seven years in Los Angeles trying to be an actor, and many more years of being an inveterate world traveler. ''He did everything he wanted to do,'' Ms. D'Auria said. ''He was always out with friends, he was always getting together with the family.''
 He was her rock, she said, when their mother died of cancer last year.
 ''He would be depressed because other people around him had problems; they weren't his problems,'' said Robert Diodato, his best friend. They grew up in Bronxville together and met in fourth grade. ''He was one of those friends you speak to four or five times a day. He left a tremendous void in a lot of people's lives.''

CINDY DEUEL
Tracing the Line
 For more than two years, Cindy Deuel had been trying to map the Deuel family line back to 16th-century England. Using the New York Public Library, the National Archives, the Internet and her brother Richard's similar passion for genealogy, she had made a few important discoveries, including great-great grandfather Henry Deuel's unmarked grave at Cedar Lawn Cemetery in Paterson, N.J.
 ''It is in this location that we have chosen to erect a headstone for Cindy, whether or not we find the body,'' said Richard Deuel, 31. ''On the headstone we are going to depict Cindy's family tree, much of it information that Cindy learned through her research.''
 Ms. Deuel, 28, who lived in Brooklyn with her husband, Tomas Pons, worked as an executive assistant at Carr Futures on the 92nd floor of 1 World Trade Center. But Mr. Deuel, who has another brother, Joseph, 37, said his sister dreamed of starting a genealogy business to help people with their own family research. It was fitting of someone who, he said, helped friends with everything, including their taxes. ''I don't know anyone who knows Cindy that hasn't consulted her,'' Mr. Deuel said.

KERMIT C. ANDERSON
Walking Together
 Kermit C. Anderson made the most of his lunch hour. Almost every day, for half an hour or so, he would descend from his 93rd floor office at the World Trade Center and walk, usually along the Hudson in Battery Park City, gazing out toward New Jersey. He loved places where the boundaries come together: city and river, humanity's creation and nature's.
 Mr. Anderson, 57, a systems analyst at Marsh Inc., was a math major at Pennsylvania State University who married another Penn State math major, the former Jill Grashof. Together, the Andersons, who lived in Green Brook, N.J., walked for 36 years of married life.
 Last year, for their 35th anniversary, they walked the mountains of British Columbia. Deposited every morning by helicopter with a guide, they would hike all day and arrive in the evening at a lodge in time for dinner and a soft bed.
 ''He probably would have camped, but for me he would stay in lodges with running water and lights,'' Mrs. Anderson said.

ANETTE DATARAM
A Passion for Food
 Anette Dataram worked in accounting for Windows on the World at 1 World Trade Center and planned to pursue a bachelor's degree to further her career as an accountant. But the 25-year-old's real passion seemed to be food -- not that served at the famous restaurant where she worked, but her own.
 ''Get me a big fish, I'm going to bake it,'' she would tell her mother after watching one of the cooking television shows she loved. Then she would cook the new recipe for her parents, her sister and her two brothers, with whom she lived in Queens. ''Yes, it was very good,'' Chandra Dataram said of her oldest daughter's culinary abilities.
 Mrs. Dataram said her daughter, who was engaged to be married next year, was quiet and simple, not ''a dressed-up type,'' but was also driven and ambitious. In New York City for the last nine years, the family had come to this country from Guyana to take advantage of its opportunities, she said, and her daughter was certainly making it.

RICHARD GABRIELLE
Taking Baby for a Drive
 He called it his ''Baby P,'' a 1999 black Volkswagen Passat. It was kept in a garage in West Haven, Conn., and brought out only when the weather was fine -- or when it was time for Richard Gabrielle's racing lessons.
 Mr. Gabrielle's wife, Monica, who was not allowed to drive the Passat, said she had little doubt that her husband's fairly recent passion for driving a souped-up little car around a racetrack at Lime Rock Park in Lakeville, Conn., was the result of a midlife crisis. 
 Mr. Gabrielle, a 50-year-old insurance broker at the Aon Corporation, was an extraordinarily gentle man in most ways. Even moths, when they got in the house, would be carefully ushered out, uninjured. But he would also never tell his wife how fast he went during his driving lessons, and he recently bought a radar detector, so that he could, as he put it, ''practice'' on the highways.
 ''He'd tell me, 'Better that than women, don't you think?' '' she said.

SALVATORE ZISA
The Top Priority
 When traveling on business, as he often did, Salvatore Zisa, 45, would almost invariably take the red-eye flight home from the West Coast. From the airport, he would then typically proceed directly into the office at Marsh Inc., where he was a senior vice president, arriving at his desk as though he had slept in a bed like everyone else. This pattern repeated itself again and again over the years.
 Workaholic? Maybe. Or maybe just a father who wanted to make sure he could get home to Hawthorne, N.J., in time for a soccer game where his daughter Christina, 16, or his son Joseph, 12, would expect to look up and see him cheering.
 ''His priority was making sure he got to his kids' games on time, that he didn't miss anything,'' said his brother, Tony Zisa. ''He traveled a lot, but he would work his schedule around making sure he was home for the important things. He was always there for our parents, and for his kids, and for his wife.''

YANG DER LEE
Family, Charity and Temple
 Sixty-three-year-old Yang Der Lee was easy to miss on the coursing sidewalks of Wall Street and along the shiny gum-slicked subway platform, where he took the train each morning from his house in Richmond Hill, Queens, to Lower Manhattan.
 The small-built man often wore a baseball cap and a fraying suede jacket that he brought from Taiwan when he emigrated to New York City with his wife and three children 16 years ago. ''It's good quality,'' Mr. Lee would tell his family, when pressured to buy new clothes, said his son, Philip. ''It doesn't wear out.''
 The $10 an hour that he earned as a delivery clerk at Windows on the World was for family, charities and the Buddhist temple where he worshiped, Philip Lee said. Mr. Lee worked the day shift, hauling deliveries of fresh meats, fish and vegetables.
 His children, who have successful careers and contribute to the household, cajoled him into agreeing to retire when he reached 65. ''My father never wanted to be a burden on us,'' Philip Lee said. ''He would have liked to come up with down payments for our houses. That's how great he was. We finally got him to agree to quit working at 65. Now, it's too late.''

CATHERINE FAIRFAX MacRAE
Capturing Cat in Words
 The question, at last, is put to Andrew Caspersen: Did your girlfriend have any flaws? 
 Long pause. 
 Catherine Fairfax MacRae, granddaughter of a founding partner of the law firm LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, won the math prize at the Brearley School, was editor of its newspaper, and was a ferocious field hockey player. At Princeton she made varsity squash and graduated magna cum laude in economics, with concentrations in math and finance. She never pulled an all-nighter and usually finished her work a week ahead, said Channing Barnett, a friend.
 Cat was never late and expected the same when you met her for dinner. She was inexhaustibly thoughtful, always checking in, sending small gifts, and fretting that she was not being a good enough friend, seemingly to hundreds. She was beautiful and funny and charmingly self-deprecating and talked on the phone to her mother at least three times a day. 
 People always wanted her at their parties.
 She was 23, and a stock analyst at Fred Alger Management on the 93rd floor of 1 World Trade Center.
 Mr. Caspersen? 
 ''She was not great with driving directions and we'd get lost quite often,'' conceded Mr. Caspersen, a Harvard law student. ''But that was a bonus. It allowed us to spend more time together.''

LAURA ROCKEFELLER
Her World a Stage
 Laura Rockefeller's parents in White Plains got sympathy letters from people who knew her only as J. T.'s mom, one of the regulars at the dog run in Riverside Park, where a bench will be dedicated in her name.
 Ms. Rockefeller's animal-loving friends were the first to figure out that she might be among the missing at the World Trade Center, although she did not work there. If she was even 15 minutes late to walk J. T., a shepherd mix named for James Taylor, or feed her two cats, Uff and Parker, something was surely wrong.
 Ms. Rockefeller, who would have turned 42 yesterday, was an aspiring actress, singer and director who paid the rent on her one-bedroom apartment on West 85th Street with freelance work for Risk Waters, a London-based company that produces seminars for financial managers. On Sept. 11, she was stage-managing one at Windows on the World. 
 But Ms. Rockefeller's passion, in addition to her animals, was musical theater. She fell in love with the stage as a child when her mother ran a children's theater and her father was a television director. In New York, she went to plays as often as she could afford and often broke into spontaneous song.
 Because she was not an employee at the World Trade Center, it took a full day for Ms. Rockefeller's sister Terry and her parents to figure out she had been there and was surely dead. But J. T. continues to resist the finality, running to the door in White Plains, ears perked, each time a car approaches.

RUBEN ESQUILIN Jr.
Living for Sports
 You wanted to talk sports? Ruben Esquilin Jr. was your man. He lived sports, he breathed sports, he ate sports for dinner.
 That's right, he worked as a maintenance worker for Fiduciary Trust. Once the workday ended, however, he was off to play softball or basketball or football. He belonged to so many different teams around the city that his relatives could not keep them straight. Mr. Esquilin, 35, lived with his mother and one of his sisters and her son in Lower Manhattan. His room was stuffed with sports equipment and trophies certifying his abilities. 
 ''I know the Angels was the last softball team he was on,'' said his sister, Priscilla, ''but don't ask me to name any others. He was on so many, forget about it.
 ''He watched sports constantly,'' she went on. ''If he was playing a game, he'd call the house and ask me or my mother to videotape a game that was on TV. Of course, we'd do it. We spoiled him.''
 He was a big Michael Jordan fan. His sister said he would have been ecstatic to hear that his beloved basketball star was returning to the game.

ROBERT VICARIO
Instant Friends
 Robert Vicario saved everything. He saved souvenirs from the vacations that he would take with his wife, Jill, to Jamaica. He saved a lock of her hair from the first time they met 10 years ago. He saved matchbooks and Playbills. He even saved the umbilical cord stump from her daughter, Savannah Rose, who was born four months ago.
 Mr. Vicario, 40, made people laugh; he never had a bad word to say. Everyone he met became an instant friend. The toll taker. The grocery clerk. The homeless man. The gas station attendant. The fellow contractors with whom he had just started a new job in early September at Cantor Fitzgerald. He liked them all, and he wanted to invite them all to his wedding or to his house in Weehawken, N.J.
 He was particularly friendly with those he met in Jamaica. In fact, he liked to take photos with these new friends, then mail copies of the photos along with a note. Thus another friendship was notched, forever.
 ''It was like, 'Rob, you know the entire world,' '' Mrs. Vicario used to tell her husband (who was actually called Bobby by everyone else). '' 'Is there anybody you don't know?' ''

HEADLINE: LOVE IN THE 21ST CENTURY; 
Against Love

BYLINE:  By Laura Kipnis; Laura Kipnis is a professor at Northwestern University. Her book about love will be published next year.

 BODY:
Love is, as we know, a mysterious and controlling force. It has vast power over our thoughts and life decisions. It demands our loyalty, and we, in turn, freely comply. Saying no to love isn't simply heresy; it is tragedy -- the failure to achieve what is most essentially human. So deeply internalized is our obedience to this most capricious despot that artists create passionate odes to its cruelty, and audiences seem never to tire of the most deeply unoriginal mass spectacles devoted to rehearsing the litany of its torments, fixating their very beings on the narrowest glimmer of its fleeting satisfactions. 
 Yet despite near total compliance, a buzz of social nervousness attends the subject. If a society's lexicon of romantic pathologies reveals its particular anxieties, high on our own list would be diagnoses like "inability to settle down" or "immaturity," leveled at those who stray from the norms of domestic coupledom either by refusing entry in the first place or, once installed, pursuing various escape routes: excess independence, ambivalence, "straying," divorce. For the modern lover, "maturity" isn't a depressing signal of impending decrepitude but a sterling achievement, the sine qua non of a lover's qualifications to love and be loved. 
 This injunction to achieve maturity -- synonymous in contemporary usage with 30-year mortgages, spreading waistlines and monogamy -- obviously finds its raison d'etre in modern love's central anxiety, that structuring social contradiction the size of the San Andreas Fault: namely, the expectation that romance and sexual attraction can last a lifetime of coupled togetherness despite much hard evidence to the contrary. 
Ever optimistic, heady with love's utopianism, most of us eventually pledge ourselves to unions that will, if successful, far outlast the desire that impelled them into being. The prevailing cultural wisdom is that even if sexual desire tends to be a short-lived phenomenon, "mature love" will kick in to save the day when desire flags. The issue that remains unaddressed is whether cutting off other possibilities of romance and sexual attraction for the more muted pleasures of mature love isn't similar to voluntarily amputating a healthy limb: a lot of anesthesia is required and the phantom pain never entirely abates. But if it behooves a society to convince its citizenry that wanting change means personal failure or wanting to start over is shameful or simply wanting more satisfaction than what you have is an illicit thing, clearly grisly acts of self-mutilation will be required. 
There hasn't always been quite such optimism about love's longevity. For the Greeks, inventors of democracy and a people not amenable to being pushed around by despots, love was a disordering and thus preferably brief experience. During the reign of courtly love, love was illicit and usually fatal. Passion meant suffering: the happy ending didn't yet exist in the cultural imagination. As far as togetherness as an eternal ideal, the 12th-century advice manual "De Amore et Amor is Remedio" ("On Love and the Remedies of Love") warned that too many opportunities to see or chat with the beloved would certainly decrease love. 
The innovation of happy love didn't even enter the vocabulary of romance until the 17th century. Before the 18th century -- when the family was primarily an economic unit of production rather than a hothouse of Oedipal tensions -- marriages were business arrangements between families; participants had little to say on the matter. Some historians consider romantic love a learned behavior that really only took off in the late 18th century along with the new fashion for reading novels, though even then affection between a husband and wife was considered to be in questionable taste.
Historians disagree, of course. Some tell the story of love as an eternal and unchanging essence; others, as a progress narrative over stifling social conventions. (Sometimes both stories are told at once; consistency isn't required.) But has modern love really set us free? Fond as we are of projecting our own emotional quandaries back through history, construing vivid costume dramas featuring medieval peasants or biblical courtesans sharing their feelings with the post-Freudian savvy of lifelong analysands, our amatory predecessors clearly didn't share all our particular aspirations about their romantic lives. 
We, by contrast, feel like failures when love dies. We believe it could be otherwise. Since the cultural expectation is that a state of coupled permanence is achievable, uncoupling is experienced as crisis and inadequacy -- even though such failures are more the norm than the exception.
As love has increasingly become the center of all emotional expression in the popular imagination, anxiety about obtaining it in sufficient quantities -- and for sufficient duration -- suffuses the population. Everyone knows that as the demands and expectations on couples escalated, so did divorce rates. And given the current divorce statistics (roughly 50 percent of all marriages end in divorce), all indications are that whomever you love today -- your beacon of hope, the center of all your optimism -- has a good chance of becoming your worst nightmare tomorrow. (Of course, that 50 percent are those who actually leave their unhappy marriages and not a particularly good indication of the happiness level or nightmare potential of those who remain.) Lawrence Stone, a historian of marriage, suggests -- rather jocularly, you can't help thinking -- that today's rising divorce rates are just a modern technique for achieving what was once taken care of far more efficiently by early mortality. 
Love may or may not be a universal emotion, but clearly the social forms it takes are infinitely malleable. It is our culture alone that has dedicated itself to allying the turbulence of romance and the rationality of the long-term couple, convinced that both love and sex are obtainable from one person over the course of decades, that desire will manage to sustain itself for 30 or 40 or 50 years and that the supposed fate of social stability is tied to sustaining a fleeting experience beyond its given life span. 
Of course, the parties involved must "work" at keeping passion alive (and we all know how much fun that is), the presumption being that even after living in close proximity to someone for a historically unprecedented length of time, you will still muster the requisite desire to achieve sexual congress on a regular basis. (Should passion fizzle out, just give up sex. Lack of desire for a mate is never an adequate rationale for "looking elsewhere.") And it is true, many couples do manage to perform enough psychic retooling to reshape the anarchy of desire to the confines of the marriage bed, plugging away at the task year after year (once a week, same time, same position) like diligent assembly-line workers, aided by the occasional fantasy or two to help get the old motor to turn over, or keep running, or complete the trip. And so we have the erotic life of a nation of workaholics: if sex seems like work, clearly you're not working hard enough at it.
But passion must not be allowed to die! The fear -- or knowledge -- that it does shapes us into particularly conflicted psychological beings, perpetually in search of prescriptions and professional interventions, regardless of cost or consequence. Which does have its economic upside, at least. Whole new sectors of the economy have been spawned, with massive social investment in new technologies from Viagra to couples' porn: capitalism's Lourdes for dying marriages.
There are assorted low-tech solutions to desire's dilemmas too. Take advice. In fact, take more and more advice. Between print, airwaves and the therapy industry, if there were any way to quantify the G.N.P. in romantic counsel, it would be a staggering number. Desperate to be cured of love's temporality, a love-struck populace has molded itself into an advanced race of advice receptacles, like some new form of miracle sponge that can instantly absorb many times its own body weight in wetness. 
Iinexplicably, however, a rebellious breakaway faction keeps trying to leap over the wall and emancipate themselves, not from love itself -- unthinkable! -- but from love's domestic confinements. The escape routes are well trodden -- love affairs, midlife crises -- though strewn with the left-behind luggage of those who encountered unforeseen obstacles along the way (panic, guilt, self-engineered exposures) and beat self-abashed retreats to their domestic gulags, even after pledging body and soul to newfound loves in the balmy utopias of nondomesticated romances. Will all the adulterers in the audience please stand up? You know who you are. Don't be embarrassed! Adulterers aren't just "playing around." These are our home-grown closet social theorists, because adultery is not just a referendum on the sustainability of monogamy; it is a veiled philosophical discussion about the social contract itself. The question on the table is this: "How much renunciation of desire does society demand of us, versus the degree of gratification it provides?" Clearly, the adulterer's answer, following a long line of venerable social critics, would be, "Too much." 
But what exactly is it about the actual lived experience of modern domestic love that would make flight such a compelling option for so many? Let us briefly examine those material daily life conditions. 
Fundamentally, to achieve love and qualify for entry into that realm of salvation and transcendence known as the couple (the secular equivalent of entering a state of divine grace), you must be a lovable person. And what precisely does being lovable entail? According to the tenets of modern love, it requires an advanced working knowledge of the intricacies of mutuality. 
Mutuality means recognizing that your partner has needs and being prepared to meet them. This presumes, of course, that the majority of those needs can and should be met by one person. (Question this, and you question the very foundations of the institution. So don't.) These needs of ours run deep, a tangled underground morass of ancient, gnarled roots, looking to ensnarl any hapless soul who might accidentally trod upon their outer radices. 
Still, meeting those needs is the most effective way to become the object of another's desire, thus attaining intimacy, which is required to achieve the state known as psychological maturity. (Despite how closely it reproduces the affective conditions of our childhoods, since trading compliance for love is the earliest social lesson learned; we learn it in our cribs.) 
You, in return, will have your own needs met by your partner in matters large and small. In practice, many of these matters turn out to be quite small. Frequently, it is the tensions and disagreements over the minutiae of daily living that stand between couples and their requisite intimacy. Taking out the garbage, tone of voice, a forgotten errand -- these are the rocky shoals upon which intimacy so often founders. 
Mutuality requires communication, since in order to be met, these needs must be expressed. (No one's a mind reader, which is not to say that many of us don't expect this quality in a mate. Who wants to keep having to tell someone what you need?) What you need is for your mate to understand you -- your desires, your contradictions, your unique sensitivities, what irks you. (In practice, that means what about your mate irks you.) You, in turn, must learn to understand the mate's needs. This means being willing to hear what about yourself irks your mate. Hearing is not a simple physiological act performed with the ears, as you will learn. You may think you know how to hear, but that doesn't mean that you know how to listen. 
With two individuals required to coexist in enclosed spaces for extended periods of time, domesticity requires substantial quantities of compromise and adaptation simply to avoid mayhem. Yet with the post-Romantic ideal of unconstrained individuality informing our most fundamental ideas of the self, this can prove a perilous process. Both parties must be willing to jettison whatever aspects of individuality might prove irritating while being simultaneously allowed to retain enough individuality to feel their autonomy is not being sacrificed, even as it is being surgically excised.
Having mastered mutuality, you may now proceed to advanced intimacy. Advanced intimacy involves inviting your partner "in" to your most interior self. Whatever and wherever our "inside" is, the widespread -- if somewhat metaphysical -- belief in its existence (and the related belief that whatever is in there is dying to get out) has assumed a quasi-medical status. Leeches once served a similar purpose. Now we "express our feelings" in lieu of our fluids because everyone knows that those who don't are far more prone to cancer, ulcers or various dire ailments. 
With love as our culture's patent medicine, prescribed for every ill (now even touted as a necessary precondition for that other great American obsession, longevity), we willingly subject ourselves to any number of arcane procedures in its quest. "Opening up" is required for relationship health, so lovers fashion themselves after doctors wielding long probes to penetrate the tender regions. Try to think of yourself as one big orifice: now stop clenching and relax. If the procedure proves uncomfortable, it just shows you're not open enough. Psychotherapy may be required before sufficient dilation can be achieved: the world's most expensive lubricant. 
Needless to say, this opening-up can leave you feeling quite vulnerable, lying there psychically spread-eagled and shivering on the examining table of your relationship. (A favored suspicion is that your partner, knowing exactly where your vulnerabilities are, deliberately kicks you there -- one reason this opening-up business may not always feel as pleasant as advertised.) And as anyone who has spent much time in -- or just in earshot of -- a typical couple knows, the "expression of needs" is often the Trojan horse of intimate warfare, since expressing needs means, by definition, that one's partner has thus far failed to meet them. 
In any long-term couple, this lexicon of needs becomes codified over time into a highly evolved private language with its own rules. Let's call this couple grammar. Close observation reveals this as a language composed of one recurring unit of speech: the interdiction -- highly nuanced, mutually imposed commands and strictures extending into the most minute areas of household affairs, social life, finances, speech, hygiene, allowable idiosyncrasies and so on. From bathroom to bedroom, car to kitchen, no aspect of coupled life is not subject to scrutiny, negotiation and codes of conduct. 
A sample from an inexhaustible list, culled from interviews with numerous members of couples of various ages, races and sexual orientations: 
You can't leave the house without saying where you're going. You can't not say what time you'll return. You can't go out when the other person feels like staying at home. You can't be a slob. You can't do less than 50 percent of the work around the house, even if the other person wants to do 100 percent more cleaning than you find necessary or even reasonable. You can't leave the dishes for later, load them the way that seems best to you, drink straight from the carton or make crumbs. You can't leave the bathroom door open -- it's offensive. You can't leave the bathroom door closed -- your partner needs to get in. You can't not shave your underarms or legs. You can't gain weight. You can't watch soap operas. You can't watch infomercials or the pregame show or Martha Stewart. You can't eat what you want -- goodbye Marshmallow Fluff; hello tofu meatballs. You can't spend too much time on the computer. And stay out of those chat rooms. You can't take risks, unless they are agreed-upon risks, which somewhat limits the concept of "risk." You can't make major purchases alone, or spend money on things the other person considers excesses. You can't blow money just because you're in a bad mood, and you can't be in a bad mood without being required to explain it. You can't begin a sentence with "You always. . . . " You can't begin a sentence with "I never. . . . " You can't be simplistic, even when things are simple. You can't say what you really think of that outfit or color combination or cowboy hat. You can't be cynical about things the other person is sincere about. You can't drink without the other person counting your drinks. You can't have the wrong laugh. You can't bum cigarettes when you're out because it embarrasses your mate, even though you've explained the unspoken fraternity between smokers. You can't tailgate, honk or listen to talk radio in the car. And so on. The specifics don't matter. What matters is that the operative word is "can't." 
Thus is love obtained.
Certainly, domesticity offers innumerable rewards: companionship, child-rearing convenience, reassuring predictability and many other benefits too varied to list. But if love has power over us, domesticity is its enforcement wing: the iron dust mop in the velvet glove. The historian Michel Foucault has argued that modern power made its mark on the world by inventing new types of enclosures and institutions, places like factories, schools, barracks, prisons and asylums, where individuals could be located, supervised, processed and subjected to inspection, order and the clock. What current social institution is more enclosed than modern intimacy? What offers greater regulation of movement and time, or more precise surveillance of body and thought, to a greater number of individuals?
Of course, it is your choice -- as if any of us could really choose not to desire love or not to feel like hopeless losers should we fail at it. We moderns are beings yearning to be filled, yearning to be overtaken by love's mysterious power. We prostrate ourselves at love's portals, like social strivers waiting at the rope line outside some exclusive club hoping to gain admission and thereby confirm our essential worth. A life without love lacks an organizing narrative. A life without love seems so barren, and it might almost make you consider how empty the rest of the world is, as if love were vital plasma and everything else just tap water. 
Exchanging obedience for love comes naturally -- after all, we all were once children whose survival depended on the caprices of love. And there you have the template for future intimacies. If you love me, you'll do what I want -- or need, or demand -- and I'll love you in return. We all become household dictators, petty tyrants of the private sphere, who are, in our turn, dictated to.
And why has modern love developed in such a way as to maximize submission and minimize freedom, with so little argument about it? No doubt a citizenry schooled in renouncing desire instead of imagining there could be something more would be, in many respects, advantageous. After all, wanting more is the basis for utopian thinking, a path toward dangerous social demands, even toward imagining the possibilities for altogether different social arrangements. But if the most elegant forms of social control are those that came packaged in the guise of individual needs and satisfactions, so wedded to the individual psyche that any opposing impulse registers as the anxiety of unlovability, who needs a soldier on every corner? We are more than happy to police ourselves and those we love and call it living happily ever after. Perhaps a secular society needed another metaphysical entity to subjugate itself to after the death of God, and love was available for the job. But isn't it a little depressing to think we are somehow incapable of inventing forms of emotional life based on anything other than subjugation? 

Steve (top): "When we got together, we immediately merged our finances. Chuck owned a lovely home in Sausalito, and to my total astonishment, he made me joint tenant with him. We have always maintained one checking account, and all of our investments and everything are in both our names. That is about as formal as a gay couple can get. And I think, like a lot of couples, it has helped us get through rough spots in life. When your lives are totally intertwined, it makes more sense to resolve issues than to start cutting things apart most of the time.
"At this point, after 30 years, Chuck and I have very few rules in our relationship. We don't have a rule, for instance, that you can never go out on the other one. We realized from time to time the opportunity would present itself, and we also realized that if we turned down every opportunity that presented itself to us, eventually we might begin to resent each other. So we said, O.K., you can go ahead and do it, but never make a date that leaves me sitting at home while you are out with someone else. And we have never done that. From time to time we have had affairs with other people, or moments of sexual release, but they were recreational." 

Chuck: "Jealousy probably breaks up more gay people than anything in the world. I guess that goes for all couples. And jealousy is caused by a lack of trust. The one who lacks trust the most and is accusing the other of cheating, he's usually the one who is cheating. Jealousy is based on guilt, an awful lot. But if you are absolutely convinced that the person you are with is totally open to you, that nothing is hidden, there won't be problems, ever. I know that Brad Pitt could not walk in this house and take Steve away from me. I am absolutely convinced of that.
I have total confidence in that. In my case, it is Michael York, but I go way back. And when you know that, sex is really an unimportant aspect, in terms of the deep emotions of your relationship. There is a movie called 'Relax . . . It's Just Sex' -- I love that title. It is only sex; it has no deep-seated meaning. It may seem to be a part of romance -- certainly it jump-starts it -- but as the years go by, it becomes more of a bonus to the relationship. There are no earthquakes that can happen as a result of sex."

HEADLINE: LOVE IN THE 21ST CENTURY; 
Polymorphous Normal

BYLINE:  By Stacey D'Erasmo; Stacey D'Erasmo is the author of "Tea," a novel.

 BODY:
Gabriel and I are sitting in her Harlem apartment, which smells faintly of incense. The cat is lurking behind the sofa. I am asking her about a woman she used to date, and whether it bothered Gabriel that the woman thought of herself, then and still, as straight. "I'm not a future tripper," Gabriel says. "I can't look beyond what happens at the moment. At the moment, we were in it. Then we weren't." She is relaxed, thoughtful -- flirty or inwardly amused, I'm not sure which. Once an avid raver, Gabriel, a small African-American woman who still wears an open loop of gold through her nasal septum, now works in public-health research at a major university. She's light on her feet, like a dancer. I ask her if she sees herself as falling at some particular point on a continuum of sexual identity, and she smiles.
 "When I'm on the street, it's whatever turns my head," she replies. "I'm a big flirt. Continuum? I don't have one. And when I'm getting down, I'm at the extreme end." She laughs. She tries to explain. "All of the experiences I've had are part of my identity -- if you took a part of those experiences away, you'd take away a part of my identity." 
 Notice how many more words there are in that last sentence than there are in any of the following descriptions: heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual. In fact, to even partly define how Gabriel sees herself, I would have to construct some sort of pictographic, Germanic supercompound verb/noun DVD that encompasses her entire life, her lovers, what they said to one another, what they didn't say, their kisses, the things they ate, how it began, how it ended, who was in office and the weather. The closest we get to some sort of description of her romantic/sexual foundation is the energy of the rave, "an open place," she recalls, where many different kinds of music crossed, and there was "almost no room" for any identity "except for people's costuming."
Binyamin Biber, a 40-year-old Maryland resident who has just finished his coursework for rabbinical ordination, uses a different idiom to describe that indeterminacy. "I say 'bisexuality,' " he explains, "but I don't believe it's two of anything -- or that it's all about sexuality. My experience is continuous. It's not compartmentalized into poetry and sexuality and rational thought. We confuse the map with the territory." A former "advocate for holistic liberation" who, at 14, wrote "David Bowie" on his notebook and befriended the classmate in shop who'd written "Elton John" on his, a man who is currently engaged to a woman named Alex, he eschews identity categories, envisioning a world in which the ecosystem of desire would be like "a jungle that has bajillions of species."
While it would be going too far to say that we have reached the end of sexual identity -- reports of the ends of anything, like history or money or Cher, tend to be highly exaggerated -- it seems that something different is emerging on the street these days, a new music coming out of the cultural radio. It is composed of, and heard by, ordinary women and men of all varieties who sleep with, fall in love with, live with and break up with both women and men over the courses of their lives, the current of desire flowing easily over the gender divide and leading them where it may. At the moment, these people tend to be artists, students and other cultural explorers, but they probably won't be lonely for long. 
This is not a movement, certainly not an identity; it is unnamed, unbannered -- more like a space without a sign, filled with little lights. If pushed, some of these people, sighing, will call themselves bisexual or queer, but only as a political convenience, shorthand for "not straight." (As a young bartender at a lesbian nightspot who is currently dating a guy from her junior-high-school class tells me, "I don't like the word 'bisexual' -- it connotes wanton, lustful activity in the straight world, and in the queer world it means you haven't figured your stuff out yet.") They would much rather not call themselves, or their futures, anything at all, preferring to see themselves as adults, free to do as they choose. "When you're seeking truth," says a graduate student, "you can't already know what truth will look like when you find it."
A gay-liberation movement that began with a riot, followed by ferocious battles over what one may or may not do in one's bedroom, AIDS, a young man beaten and left for dead against a fence, lesbian mothers losing custody of their children, the relentless policing of every gradation of sexual difference -- over the past 20 or 30 years, sexual identity has often seemed like both a war zone and a weapon. Amid this sometimes deadly balkanization, it's as though some citizens have begun slipping away from the fray to meet in the side streets, out of uniform. 
In their refusal to take up the cause, they can sometimes seem callow -- like the 20-something New Yorker who told the older woman with whom both he and his girlfriend were sleeping: "Your generation did all the work, so we can have all the pleasure. We're hedonists." But he is, after all, talking about sex, which, like art, is not necessarily a civic virtue. If there is an ideal in this ostensibly ideal-less stance, it is the virtue of sexual amorality, or perhaps sexual free will. Where one generation longed for sex without reproductive consequences, or without zippers, this generation of freethinkers seems to desire sex without the friction of politics. More of them, apparently, are young women -- perhaps because women have historically been less well served by the standard sexual taxonomies. Overall, they have not abandoned the idea of sex as a form of knowledge; they just don't think the knowledge is of identity. It's something else. "I do read a lot about love," says Gabriel.
Matthew Stadler, a 42-year-old novelist, lives with a woman named Linea, a middle-school teacher of English as a second language, and their 2-year-old son, Mikko, in Portland, Ore. Stadler is gay; Linea is fluid; they met through a mutual friend and discovered that they shared a desire to have a kid. Once having made said kid the old-fashioned way, the relationship grew into what Stadler calls "a sloppy friendship," and he found himself moving from Seattle to be with Linea and Mikko in Portland. Now the three of them, he says, "live in a little house and have a dog, and when we walk out with the stroller and the dog, I love it that people might look at us and say, 'That's a normal family.' 
"People don't pry into the secrets of the apparently normal," he adds.
Stadler is out as a gay man and finds it imperative, politically, to say so; he wouldn't even refer to himself as bisexual. His "secrets" aren't to be found in the closet. But having publicly voted for what he sees as his side, he pursues a private life that is far less easily defined, one in which the surface is never transparent to the depths. His apparently ultramodern, postidentity life produces something rather quaint: sexual privacy. When I ask what would happen to their arrangement should he or Linea fall in love with someone and want to live with him or her, his anxiety is only spatial. "That would be a tough one -- it's not a big enough house." But, he says, "We're going to move to a bigger house soon."
Is love's mansion that big? For you, me, him, her, the kid, the dog and everyone's secrets? What neighborhood is it in? Do they enforce the sodomy laws there? Carlos, a square-bodied 34-year-old artist and set designer, originally from Argentina, has an earring in his left ear, a bisexual performance artist wife he adores and a penchant for having sex with men, about which he is exuberantly open. "My 84-year-old grandmother says, 'You do with yourself whatever you want,' " exclaims Carlos, who has generally taken her advice. He says his only regret is that he has never fallen in love with a man. 
Recently, he confessed to his wife that he had somehow found himself in a "communal sexual situation" with some gay male friends of hers. She told him the same thing had just happened to her in a dressing room with a group of women. "I know how that is," he comments darkly, "once you start, you don't stop." 
He points to the wall of his studio. "Right now I'm painting sex," he says, indicating a series of images of ecstatic figures -- men and women, men and men -- joined only at the crotch.
These -- what shall we call them? lovers without portfolio? -- are not an entirely new breed. Jan Clausen, a longtime lesbian activist and writer, caused a minor scandal in lesbian circles when she published an article in 1990 about falling for a man. The break with her longtime female lover, her community and her sense of self was wrenching. In 1999, when she published a book about her experience of sexual complexity called "Apples and Oranges," she found that she couldn't even get past the subtitle without addressing issues of category. She wanted "An Intellectual Sex Life"; the publisher wanted "A Woman's Journey to Sexual Identity," as if all roads lead to heterosexuality. (They compromised on "My Journey Through Sexual Identity.") At the same time, she discovered that she'd lost her professional identity as a "lesbian writer" as well as her primary audience. Suddenly, she says, she wondered: Who am I? Why am I writing? 
She found herself unmoored, in a space for which she had no name -- a "floating woman," as she wrote. And while the freedom of movement is welcome, it also clearly has a cost attached to it. Today, she says she still feels some sense of exile. 
For the 20-year-olds and 30-year-olds who have come after her, however, that exile is apparently home. They like the hinterlands; they plan to stay there.
The question, perhaps, is how long the world will leave their colorful tents alone. One serious 30-year-old New Yorker, once a Doc Martens-wearing member of Act Up, is now a polished, very pretty urbanite of flowing sexuality whose conversation is filled with stories of liaisons with men and women and painful splits with men and women. I meet her in a park; we sit on little iron chairs, both ladylike in skirts, deep in conversation about sex. Of her past life, committed though she was to gay politics, she says: "I didn't like the branding, it felt invasive. I hated the queer royal We." But when she looks toward the future, she also sounds wary. "I feel like I'll have to choose," she says, "I'd choose a man if I needed to economically, but if I could afford it, I'd be a lesbian."
Biber says simply, "Most dominant cultures want these categories." And when no category is stipulated, the default assumption is always, still, of heterosexuality. The rave, the art on the wall, the jungle: they fade into the past, the stuff of youthful escapades - or they become emblems of some future utopia where all the species run free. Once you're on the weddings page, a world of possibility is often reduced to an interesting tattoo.
But what if the jungle could be now? As the people in the park flow all around us -- men and women in business clothes, tourists with cameras, kids on the loose -- I remark to the serious young woman that it seems to me that every sexual identity has its dream: heterosexuality, the dream of the union of complementary halves; homosexuality, the dream of complete recognition (I am what I am); bisexuality, the dream of intergender harmony. What, I ask her, is this dream, this sexuality without identity? She thinks a minute, concentrating. "Pleasure?" she says. "Happiness?" 

Susanne: "Dunyako is very romantic, but there have definitely been some flops in his attempts to give me things. For example, he went to Vietnam one year, and he came back with this dress that was five sizes too small for me. It was something I would never wear. There have been a couple of those. He always says, 'You never like what I give you.' The best thing he ever gave me was pajamas. I loved them, and I was really impressed.
"We do have more serious problems, though. His family is from Sierra Leone, and he is the eldest son. In his culture, the eldest son does not get married -- he's there to keep the family together and help the mother. The mother is almost his wife. So it was difficult when we had our daughter, Siyanna. He wanted to please his mother, and he was hurting me in the process. It is their custom that the mother-in-law takes over care of the baby, and I didn't want that. I wanted to take care of my own baby or put her in a day care that I thought was appropriate. And they perceived it as an insult, as if I didn't like them. It was a constant struggle. It brought up a lot of things, and it put me in my place a little bit."

Dunyako: "When I met Susanne, the first thing I said to her was, 'I would love to take you shopping to buy a hat.' She had the kind of head that you would like to see a hat on. Once I went to Vietnam and I came back with a silk dress that didn't fit her. The dress was cut low. It was above her knees. I thought it was really cute, but I had remembered how things fit her a couple of years back. She told me, 'We are no longer in our 20's.' That was not good. That didn't go over too well.
"The saying, 'It takes a village' -- well, where I come from, that is real. My grandmother is the first of my grandfather's nine wives. And she had 11 kids. In my tradition, all of my mother's sisters are my mothers. In terms of our relationship, that has been a challenge. Susanne can sometimes be overwhelmed by that kind of involvement. I am the firstborn son in my family, and I am the first generation born here in the U.S., so when I had a child it was like the community was ready to claim the child. Susanne was like, 'Wait a minute, what about just us enjoying this pregnancy and enjoying the baby?' Meanwhile, my mother wanted to give a baby shower in the African style and invited all my aunts. In the midst of a beautiful moment, the bearing of a child, there was a lot of cultural conflict. I was ready to pull my hair out, Susanne was ready to pull her hair out, all in the name of love."

TERRORISM, ASYMMETRIC WARFARE, AND WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
Defending the U.S. Homeland.
By Anthony H. Cordesman.
456 pp. Westport, Conn.:
Praeger. $49.95.
 Terrorism is a disease variant of modern, total war that had its debut in 1864 and 1865 when President Abraham Lincoln and his generals reluctantly targeted the farms, homes and factories of Southern civilians in an effort to bring a swift end to the Civil War. Whereas the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 was an aristocratic duel between two armies that affected few civilians, the wars on European soil in the 20th century devastated large numbers of noncombatants. Modernity means killing civilians, because unlike swords or axes, which are extensions of the human arm, machines of mass death -- whether passenger planes, chemical weapons or even assault rifles -- sever the emotional link between a violent act and its perpetrator. For modern mass killers, human beings are abstractions that can be wiped away like figures on a blackboard. 
Terrorism, in particular, "tends to have greater psychological impact relative to the physical harm it causes than do other lethal activities," writes Paul R. Pillar, former deputy chief of the Counterterrorist Center at the Central Intelligence Agency, in his book "Terrorism and U.S. Foreign Policy." Fighting terrorism may be a hot war in terms of the casualties we have, and will have, to sustain, but as Pillar shows in this sober, workmanlike book, it requires the "long, patient, persistent effort" of the cold war. The struggle against it may also be likened to that of controlling disease pandemics: the threat can be managed and reduced to acceptable proportions, according to the author, but it may never be permanently eradicated. 
Terrorism thrives in an age of weakened states that have been undermined by population growth, resource scarcity and mass movements of people to the cities, producing hordes of angry, unemployed young men whose attraction to radical causes increasingly cows relatively moderate governments in countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia. In places where regimes are both strapped for cash and lack control of their own hinterlands, terrorists with fat wallets -- as well as Mafiosi and drug lords -- easily set up shop. Pillar writes about Afghanistan and Pakistan in this regard, but also mentions Greece -- a stable, modern state and member of NATO -- which for two decades has had a well-documented record of cooperation with Arab and other terrorists. When the Kurdish terrorist Abdullah Ocalan was captured in 1999 in Nairobi, Kenya, he had been staying at the home of the Greek ambassador. (The fact that the Olympic Games are scheduled to take place in Athens in 2004 gives Greece an incentive to cooperate completely with the United States-led coalition, or risk having the Games abruptly moved.) 
In light of the events of Sept. 11, Pillar gets some things wrong, is prophetic on other things and provides hard realizations about the moral compromises that will be required in this new struggle. He assumes that our success in tracking down members of Osama bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda, following the bombing of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, constituted a decisive victory of sorts, and he errs in declaring the absence of an international terrorist network, which Al Qaeda seems to be. But he appears to be prophetic in his insistence that we still have more to fear from conventional methods of terror like hijackings than from exotic forms like biological and chemical strikes. "Terrorists have generally been tactically conservative and have favored proven methods," he says. Indeed, commandeering three passenger jets and flying them into the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon has more in common with the brazen, low-tech, deadly assault of the kind that the Israelis employed when they dropped an old-fashioned conventional bomb from a low-flying plane into the dome of Saddam Hussein's nuclear plant in 1981. Pillar also warns that the "increased geographic reach of terrorists" and their "emphasis on inflicting pain," arising from sheer hatred, make the United States homeland more vulnerable than has been supposed. 
Pillar is most useful when he shows that the disunity within the Muslim world indicates that any successful struggle against terrorism must include all kinds of deal-making in order to play off groups and states against one another. For example, Iran helps Shiite radicals in Lebanon, it assassinates political opponents abroad and its nuclear program threatens Israel, yet Iran is also hostile to the Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan. Moreover, there has simply been too much liberalizing political change in Iran to be discounted. Thus, this new war against terrorism may eventually bring an improvement of ties between the United States and Iran -- among the most populous and developed nations in the Middle East -- that will not necessarily mean Iran will adopt a "zero tolerance" attitude toward all terrorists. 
Libya, too, perhaps should be engaged, given that there is little alternative to Muammar el-Qaddafi's rule and that his support for terrorism has dwindled in recent years. "Given the enormous variety of terrorist groups and objectives," Pillar writes, there may even be some cases, in a long cold-war-type struggle, in which "agreements with terrorists might reduce terrorism." While this may sound like heresy now, if the war on terrorism goes on for many years, all kinds of back-room maneuvering will be required, as was the case during the cold war. Americans, because they have been protected by great oceans, oscillate between moral campaigns abroad and withdrawal from the outside world altogether: what they have difficulty with is a protracted, limited struggle now that technology has erased oceanic distance. The subtlety necessary for waging the cold war -- in which we supported odious regimes on one hand and made deals with the Soviet Union and China on the other -- made it far less popular among many Americans than it now appears. Likewise, pundits and intellectuals who are more comfortable with campaigning for universal justice than with using deception for the sake of national security may yet tire of this new war if they believe it is not being fought in clear-cut terms. 
As with the cold war, defeating the enemy will prove impossible without the help of governments that do not necessarily reflect our values: Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has done much more for us than either of his weak and embattled democratically elected predecessors in Pakistan probably would have. Precisely because our military is superior to that of any other military in the world, any competent adversary will come at us at our weakest point, strategically exploiting the very freedoms that define what we are in the first place. And if we are hamstrung by absolutist definitions of friend and foe, and democracy and dictatorship, our chance of victory will be diminished. 
In his forthcoming book "Terrorism, Asymmetric Warfare, and Weapons of Mass Destruction: Defending the U.S. Homeland," Anthony H. Cordesman, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, provides a comprehensive and prescient guide to all of these issues. He reviews the previous commissions on terrorism, the details of homeland defense, the risk of chemical and biological attacks, the responsibilities of individual federal agencies, the experience of other nations and so on. Homeland defense, he notes sagely, is not an exercise in isolationism, because if we suffer grave blows, our allies in the Middle East and elsewhere are also weakened. 
Realism thrives during times when people feel insecure, just as idealism does during times when security is taken for granted. The post-cold-war era, a 12-year hiatus from the collapse of the Berlin Wall to the collapse of the World Trade Center, saw a burgeoning humanitarianism toward the Balkans and Africa. But that age is now over, and these two important works herald an era when pragmatic concentration on our own security is not neo-isolationism, but the foundation of a more realistic internationalism.

 SELLING BEN CHEEVER
Back to Square One in a Service Economy.
By Benjamin Cheever.
286 pp. New York: Bloomsbury. $25.95.
 IN the preface to "Selling Ben Cheever," the author briefly imagines his funeral. He's already mentioned that his father (John), sister (Susan) and wife (Janet Maslin) achieved as writers a success he feels eludes him. "I'm haunted by the image of a knot of bored and restless people standing near a berm of freshly turned earth and beside an open grave. Head bowed, one mourner turns to another and whispers, 'Ben's life does seem to have been designed to excite unflattering comparisons.' " 
This plays as a self-deprecating joke, more gray-humored than black. Yet even as those words were set into galley type, Barbara Ehrenreich's book "Nickel and Dimed" was showing up on best-seller lists, making comparisons, some surely unflattering to Cheever, inevitable. Each volume is a nonfiction account of a writer's experience working a series of low-glamour jobs. Ehrenreich scrubbed floors, waited tables and policed ladies' wear at a Wal-Mart. Cheever sold cars, made sandwiches and put in time at Nobody Beats the Wiz.
But while "Nickel and Dimed" is basically a serious argument, Cheever's book is more of a comedy and, as its title suggests, more of a sales job. That is, he's a bit more circumspect about what it is he wants us to buy into, mixing amusingly gonzo-ish accounts of working as a sidewalk Santa or in a haunted house with grim and sweeping assertions about corporate downsizing.
Cheever got started on his adventures on the front lines of the service economy in 1995. In the six years since, the American economy soared and then sputtered, and Cheever passed from his late 40's to early 50's. He held a lot of jobs (many more than Ehrenreich), and at times he put the whole enterprise on hold; as he freely acknowledges, he doesn't actually need to work at all. 
Because he did so many different kinds of work over such a long span, the book is more episodic than narrative. This gives it a choppy feeling, but some of the episodes are quite funny, or heartbreaking, or both. One of the best sections recounts his stint behind the counter at Cosi Sandwich Bar, the fancy lunch chain. He likes his co-workers and his manager. He is paid $6.25 an hour, and he does his best: a 51-year-old man with a positive attitude, trying to master the sandwich production line well enough to keep his young colleagues from resenting him. When he picks up the nickname Slow G (as in Grandpa), it's funny. But ultimately his rendering of how his struggle to avoid failure plays out is vivid and honest, sometimes painfully so.
Most of the work he tells about is sales work, and the basic leitmotif is failure. Stores fail to be honest with consumers, shoppers fail to treat retail workers like human beings, bosses fail to help employees, some (not all) employees fail to help one another, and most of all Cheever fails to find a way to fit in, make the sale, satisfy his bosses or his customers. Or himself. Maybe this is why the other highlight is a chapter on his stint as a car salesman. Even though the jacket copy tells us this is the one area where he found success, it's still startling when it happens. What he liked most about his suburban dealership was the chummy camaraderie among the salespeople, who seemed to spend more time telling bawdy jokes than working. He even got into a shouting match with one of his bosses. But he also sold some cars, and after he has come up short for so many pages, you practically want to cheer.
An interesting wrinkle is that Cheever's last steady gig, before he quit to write novels, was as an editor at Reader's Digest, which for much of its existence was a near parody of the genteel Organization Man sensibility. He describes it as a clubby place where the editors had many clever names for the martini and where the understanding between company and employee was roughly, "Stay here, stay loyal, work hard and you'll always have a job." Though Cheever was gone by the time the company joined the mid-1990's downsizing frenzy, this betrayal of that imaginary ideal seems to be a source of lasting bitterness and hurt.
One of the questions Cheever never quite answers is whether this is also the source of his discontent with the current state of work in America. What is the idea, exactly, that he's trying to sell us? Sometimes it seems that the mission of "Selling Ben Cheever" is simply to make us feel sorry for the author. That pitiful funeral scene is one of many in which he reminds his readers that John Cheever was a renowned author, while Ben Cheever got started on this project and its "humiliating" series of jobs because he couldn't sell his third novel. "I've often confused losing with being a good sport," he moans.
On the other hand, he strongly implies that in writing about "the heroism of the hourly worker" he's making a kind of political critique of the American economy's human toll. "Taking the jobs I held for this book," he declares, "has strengthened my own conviction that we live in a society increasingly segregated . . . by class and income." Was he giving that conviction a lot of thought over martinis at the Digest? Or has he been radicalized by the post-Organization world? If in some circles a conservative is a liberal who's been mugged, maybe a liberal is a conservative who's been downsized.
Either answer would be interesting, since there's not much question which class produced the author: he's a well-read prep school grad whose real life is full of dinner parties and panel discussions, who wonders if one co-worker's cornrows are "an expression of hostility" and guesses at the educational pedigree of another who happens to "look Ivy." He was raised, he says, to believe that if things didn't go well he could always sell suits at Brooks Brothers (one of the jobs for which he was rejected, it turns out). "The basic rules are the same on the Upper East Side as they are on a car lot," he says by way of defending car salesmen, meaning that they are "a lot like the people we know." We?
I suspect that Cheever wants these apparently disparate ideas (the book is about him; the book is about America) to work in concert. It's the spectacle of someone with this background robbed of a chance to belong somewhere, and reduced to a state of perpetual self-salesmanship, that Cheever figures the reader will ultimately find humorous and terrifying. "Work," he writes, "is about identity almost as much as it's about cash." That's a popular idea these days, but maybe not a pleasant one if you're confronted with meaningless employment. If this is Cheever's soft sell, I'm not sure he quite closes the deal. But he does make a pretty entertaining pitch.

HEADLINE: Touring a Land Filled With Emptiness 

BYLINE:  By LAURA SHAINE CUNNINGHAM; LAURA SHAINE CUNNINGHAM is a novelist, playwright and essayist.

 BODY:
THE DEAD SEA is the lowest place on earth, and on this August day, in the late summer sun, even as the date palms rattle in the desert wind, it is easy to suffer an emotional descent to match. 
 "This may be my last week," the tour guide, Yossi Gelem, announces. As he drives, he recites the facts: "The Dead Sea is the saltiest on the earth, 40 percent saltier than the Great Salt Lake in Utah." 
 But braggadocio has turned bitter. Tourism has been "dead" for the past 11 months, he tells the six passengers in the cushioned seats of the half-empty van that has replaced the large luxury bus that he once drove. The economic effect on Israel of the intifada has been deadly: $3.1 billion lost in tourist revenue. 
We are heading for Masada, the cliff fortress built by King Herod to withstand an ultimate enemy assault and where, in A.D. 73, 960 Jewish zealots died by their own hand, rather than surrender to the Romans, whose battle camps remain outlined in the sand, next to the now empty parking lot. The guide says that they have cut back on the sound and light shows.
Yet this tour may be my most memorable: for this emptiness, for the fear that seems to alter subtly every desert and street scene, as if all safety may be a mirage. The air shifts with an invisible menace, like radioactivity. I move around, always in running shoes, and am left with these images in a mental album.
Every August, I have visited my uncle (who raised me). Now, he lives in the Old Katamon section of Jerusalem, a bleached stone enclave of former Arab mansions and apartments, balconies spilling bougainvillea. Old Katamon appears to nap: the faded Motta ice cream awnings on the delis sag under the sun; the skinny Jerusalem cats doze on stone-warmed verandas. Tension here is expressed by absence: in '47, Arabs fled this place; few people walk the street. 
I ask my uncle if he will consider returning to the United States. "Please," he says, "I've been through six wars here; this is my home." 
Wherever I go, I hear debates: secular versus religious Jew; "the settlements" versus "the divine promise." There seem to be about two degrees of separation. Most people knew someone who died: a neighbor, a daughter's schoolmate. Everyone in Jerusalem, it seems, felt the blast at the Sbarro pizza place. Their windows shook, and now they offer their own views; many favor "a wall, like the Berlin Wall."
It is our family tradition to visit the Kotel (the Western, or Wailing Wall). In past years, I had to jockey to insert my scribbled personal prayer, as is the custom. The visitors would be lined up 4 to 12 deep. This year, I count 35 people. 
I walk up to the wall, touch the sun-warmed wall, offer my prayer. Peace. The woman beside me weeps. At the entrance to the archaeological tunnel, when I say how empty the Kotel looks, a rebbe says: "You should see it at 7 in the morning, and sunset! So much is happening, because this is the Last Year. But not to worry -- the Messiah is coming!"
I enter the Hasmonean darkness of the Western Wall tunnel. There had always been a three-month waiting list to enter. Now, there is no wait and only 24 European visitors. 
Like spiritual spelunkers, we walk through the tunnel into the past, which, in the description of our guide, Basha Zussman, sounds as antagonistic as the present. After several minutes, we come upon a subterranean shul: sex-segregated groups, praying. In another chamber, Basha operates a computerized model of the Temple Mount. For the first time, I see the impossible proximity of the holy sites: the Jewish and Muslim shrines were not merely near one another, they are actually sandwiched: the Muslim above the Jewish. 
I emerge, blinking, into the glare of the Via Dolorosa, where Jesus walked to his Crucifixion. Despite the warning not to venture into the Muslim Quarter, I take a wrong turn and find myself in an Arab bazaar. For the first time, I see an Arab market filled only with Arabs. 
I hear soft whispers of solicitation: 
"Let me show you. . . ." "I have Roman glass, fine silver jewelry. . . ." "Please, please, don't go, I will show you. A good price. There is no tourist here to buy. . . ." 
As among the Jewish Israelis, wherever I go, I receive something I never expected, gratitude: "Thank you, thank you for coming." 
At a spa on the Dead Sea, I wait, under an awning, with an elderly woman. We are caked in the primordial black mud, hardening like statues of ourselves. We watch the road, once so well traveled: Now, we can count the cars. We don't share a language but she offers me a grape, and eyes me with what seems like an ancient knowledge. 
On the road back, a lone Bedouin, with goats, watches us pass. "This road is O.K.," the driver says of Route 1, "There have been only two shootings. One, a Greek Orthodox priest."
At Mount Zion, I leave the bright courtyard and pass into the shadow of the church. I make a hurried circuit of Christian shrines: I find them silent, unattended in marble quiet. The Room of the Last Supper looms larger, with more ceramic inlay, than I could have envisioned. For a moment or two I am alone, then I am joined by a group of Italian nuns, wearing modified white habits, who flutter in, like doves, and beam at me, as if we share a secret. 
I detour downstairs and am alone again, in the Tomb of David -- the Christian and Jewish shrines, also stacked one upon another -- then wander next door to the abbey with its cryptlike exhibit of the sleeping Virgin Mary. I close my eyes for a moment, imagine her dream. The city, the shrines, seem under a spell.

A N equivalent phenomenon is in evidence at the most regal and historic of Jerusalem's hotels, the King David. There, only last summer, one had to wait for a room, beg for the Old City side, and pay top shekel -- $450, $550 a night. Now, that room rents for $210.
"We are operating below cost," confides the hotel's manager, Gideon Avrami. He surveys the nearly deserted lobby. The hotel has 20 to 30 percent occupancy. 
He gestures toward an antique round table, set into the Reading Room. "It was here, in 1967, that Arab leaders sat and agreed on a peace," he says. "I hope some day others will come again, and sign." The empty table, the empty lobby, do not lend much sense of expectation.
I depart for home. I have not been assaulted, yet I have picked up the tragic premonition. I have not seen any fighting, although one night, my hosts remark that if they concentrate, they can hear shooting from Gilo, a nearby neighborhood. 
My closest call comes on the return from Masada, when as the guide intoned, "We do not glorify the suicide at Masada," our bus passes an exploded white Subaru, a car bomb that has misfired.
Do I regret this walk between light and shadow, with its element of fear wherever one set down a sandaled step? Not at all -- this trip to Israel has been the most significant. "In times of trouble," advised the tour guide, "Go."
I think he meant for the bargains, but the Holy Land can also illuminate the soul. For nothing, to me, can compare with standing in so many sacred places. The power of the holy places is palpable, especially where I stood alone. I have been assaulted, not by terror, but by wonder.
It is the irony of modern times that soon after I returned home, the terror that seemed to blow at my back in the desert wind blasted New York, my home city. The expectation of explosion was fulfilled.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 10-14-01: Aftermath; 
Getting Serious

BYLINE:  By Virginia Heffernan; Virginia Heffernan is a writer and editor who lives in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
The twin towers ruled over Lower Manhattan as more than just symbols of economic power; standing side by side for almost 30 years, they could also seem romantic, the architecture of companionship. And when one fell, the other fell soon thereafter, in the manner of long-married couples. 
 The first wave of response, of course, was alarm, panic, anguish. Some found they had lost more than they could have imagined; others found that they had lost less than they feared. And yet everyone grieved, and grieves still. 
 For those who were lucky enough to be spared physical impact, and whose family and friends were spared, the aftershocks of the attack came in unexpected ways. I started to hear stories of unmarried New Yorkers -- people like me, ordinarily given to preoccupation, dreaminess or equivocation in matters of the heart -- who out of nowhere began to exhibit near martial decisiveness. Amid all the horror and suffering, it seemed the attacks had left New Yorkers with an element not otherwise found in this region: romantic certainty. 
Even in my first phone conversations after the disaster, the change was evident. People who had once been afraid even to mention marriage were proposing. People who had long since parted were getting back together. People who'd been dating halfheartedly were breaking up. 
Casey's ex-boyfriend e-mailed her, that first day, to tell her he loved her. They hadn't spoken in six months, but suddenly her wish to go home -- and home to him -- came into clear focus. She was filled with a desire to move into his apartment, if chiefly to have a place to cry. He told her that if she came over, she'd never have to leave. Neither knew exactly what that meant: it was a fantasy, and it was real. A few days later, over dinner at Picholine, they were suddenly planning their marriage. Casey savored the moment's luxury. She could live safely, even lavishly, in the time warp of an intimate connection to the era before.
Around noon on that same day, a friend of a friend left work in Midtown and went straight to her boyfriend's place in Murray Hill. The television was on when she walked in, and she and her boyfriend watched the bad news unfold together. He seemed unaccountably detached. Not just upset by the news; it was something else, and his reticence made her nervous. She asked him to come with her to her apartment in the East Village, below the checkpoints and closer to the destruction. He said no. The attack, he said, had magnified his doubts about their relationship. She told him she needed someone she could count on. They broke up two days later. 
Until a few weeks ago, these bold acts -- choosing love despite the odds, or walking away from a relationship that offered no comfort -- would have seemed out of reach to those of us who are perpetually indecisive, who choose to date within a free-agent system where no contract exists. Now that entire realm of anxiety seems to belong to a more sanguine time. 
Of course, any disaster reminds us of life's fragility, of the capriciousness of fate, so perhaps the change that swept over my friends is just a natural reaction to fear. But I think there's more to it than that. As the national rhetoric borrows from Henry V rather than Hamlet, as giving blood seems like far too petty a sacrifice and as printouts of Old Glory appear in shop windows from sea to shining sea, the old indecisiveness comes to seem out of sync with the country's renewed sense of purpose. It seems small-minded. It seems somehow unpatriotic.
Liza and her boyfriend, Doug, had been considering marriage and children, but on the day of the attack, all their doubts evaporated. "Would I want to spend the apocalypse with this person?" Liza asked herself. The answer came up yes. And it immediately became a priority. 
"Until recently I found marriage creepy and cultish, domesticating, anti-romantic, not for me," says Liza. "Now it seems more enviable. It's optimistic, passionate." 
After these kinds of disasters, people often seem to rearrange their personal stories to jibe somehow with the public ones -- to accommodate, or to resist, events beyond anyone's control. Apocalyptic questions drove another acquaintance I know in the direction of instability: shortly after the attacks, Todd resolved to leave his wife and new baby in Indiana for a woman he had met in New York. He just knew, all of a sudden, that he had to be with her, as his decisions about his life clicked up several notches of urgency. If peace and prosperity are the enemies of certainty -- too many choices, too much freedom -- the country's current perils brought to Todd a do-or-die bravado, even impetuousness. He wanted risks with long odds. "If life isn't about taking chances, what's the point?" he now says. 
Danger generates these ad hoc camaraderies. Suzanne, a friend of mine who recently moved to Tucson, had been dating, but sporadically. Mostly she was homesick for New York. In early September, she had met someone she liked, a graduate student and writer of detective novels. Because of age and religious differences, she considered him "way off my radar screen." But after the attacks, when she couldn't reach old friends for days, she reached out to him, and they've spent few hours apart ever since. In a way, he was just in the right place at the right time -- a foxhole boyfriend -- but she feels deeply committed to him. "After Tuesday, loneliness and alienation were challenges for which I had, perhaps permanently, lost patience," she says.
As for me, my boyfriend and I haven't made any rash choices, but we do feel closer, more like family -- maybe it's all that time we've spent watching television. Sometimes I wonder if anything we think about each other in this tense time will even make sense to us a year from now. I wonder about the consequences of romance under pressure. What seems like lucid thinking now may be the effect of anxiety, adrenaline and sleeplessness. And when that effect wears off, what's left? Tired couples, ones who need to deal with pettiness as much as grandiosity.
We keep hearing reports of relationship shifts, leavening bits of gossip that would once have been huge news but now seem like reassuring reminders of the old New York. Like the story of a writer I know, whose ex-boyfriend called, sobbing, to say he loved her. Or another friend, Susan, who picked up the phone to find a former lover on the other end, one she hadn't heard from in five years. He's married now, but he was offering to leave his wife and rejoin Susan in New York. 
Dramatic times produce dramatic emotions, but as the dust settles, some of these acts of intense clarity and passion are already blurring, or cooling. Two weeks later, Susan's suitor was still in London; as she says, "It hasn't played out." As for the writer, who thought she'd get "a proposal by Friday" from her sobbing ex-boyfriend, she says, "Alas, I have not." If couples are still struggling, still fine-tuning their love lives -- in that determined, achingly self-aware way -- that may be one sign that the city is beginning to return to normalcy. With the TV intoning darkly that the world will never be the same, there exists strange comfort in New York's more commonplace story lines. For New York's relationship sector, which bears ongoing responsibility for the city's reservoirs of ambivalence, this may be what Giuliani means by getting back to business.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
A Rush to Complete Plans for Downtown

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
FOR nearly a month, a wide cross-section of New York has been toiling to produce a plan for the redevelopment of the financial district. The American Institute of Architects, the New York City Partnership, and the Real Estate Board of New York have formed a coalition, the NYC Rebuild Task Force, with the mission of completing a plan within the next few weeks. (Details can be found at www.nycrebuild.org.)
 The coalition's goals include: send a message to Washington that New York is up to the task of providing a unified, patriotic response to the World Trade Center attack; take advantage of current low interest rates; and announce to the world that New York's financial center can hold. While other groups may be formulating plans of their own, this seems to be the main event for now. 
 NYC Rebuild's executive committee includes representatives from prominent architecture firms, including Skidmore Owings & Merrill, Fox & Fowle, HOK, and Kohn Pederson Fox. And indeed the entire operation appears driven by what in architecture is called "the charrette" -- the extreme 24/7 panic condition that descends upon architects' offices as deadlines approach.
The term originated in the 19th century at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. At the end of thesis term, a cart (charrette) would pass through the streets of the Latin Quarter to pick up thesis projects. Architecture students, apprentices in professional ateliers lodged in the top floors of Left Bank buildings, would toss their drawings into the cart from the windows above. All were eager to win the Prix de Rome.
Many New Yorkers have probably experienced charrette syndrome in their lives. Ad campaigns, fashion collections, magazine closings, legal briefs are typically prepared under charrette conditions. And it is widely understood that the material produced en charrette -- the drawings, articles, ad campaigns -- is often secondary to the experience of producing something quickly under extreme pressure.
At a moment like this, when people are struggling to reckon with a future that lies beyond their control, the charrette holds therapeutic value. It is a source of distraction and even pleasure. Anxiety is alleviated as adrenalin and endorphins engulf the brain. For those racing against time, the clock stops. Given the uncertain political and economic prospect, it is safe to assume that the plan produced by NYC Rebuild will not materialize as envisioned. As an exercise in solidarity, and as a way of coping with trauma, however, it is worthwhile.
Architecture critics have been traumatized also. We've just witnessed the great American skyscraper turned into a weapon of mass destruction. My therapeutic program includes projecting my own fantasy version of the design now taking shape under the auspices of NYC Rebuild. This fantasy was partly inspired by the news that Larry Silverstein, a private developer who holds a 99-year lease on the demolished World Trade buildings, had hired David Childs of Skidmore Owings & Merrill and Alex Cooper of Cooper Robertson to help him plan the redevelopment of the 16-acre site.
All people with bow ties agree that the modern "blank slate" (towers in a park) approach to city planning was wrong. Therefore, the architects will first want to replace the World Trade Center's "bleak," "sterile" plaza with a more "contextual" approach.
Toward that end, they immediately began by researching old maps of Lower Manhattan, depicting the streets that were there before the Trade Center was built. In their quest for "authenticity," they looked at maps from this period and that period and eventually drew up a composite of several. Curiously, the composite bore an astonishing resemblance to -- the Nolli Plan of Rome!
For architects of a certain age and artistic temperament, the Nolli plan is architecture's holy grail. Created in 1748 by Giovanni Battista Nolli, it depicts the Roman network of medieval and baroque streets along with views of great monuments, drawn by Piranesi. Initially prepared for purposes of tax assessment, it is a potentially useful document for studying how the relationship between public and private spheres is inscribed in urban space. Even in the 18th century, for example, city property owners were keen to exaggerate how much "public," that is, nontaxable, space encroached on their sites.
Unfortunately, the Nolli plan is seldom used by contemporary architects and planners for serious purposes. Typically, it is intended as a symbol of pedigree. For one group of American architects, it represents the "classical" tradition connected with the Rome Prize, the City Beautiful movement and the connotations of social entitlement attached to the firm McKim, Meade, & White. For another faction, it signifies the more recent lineage of figure-ground abstraction associated with Colin Rowe and his students at Cornell University's architecture school. In both cases, the plan is used a-historically: a piece of Roman history is meant to lend authority to work that bears little relationship to the history of our own time and place.
The Nolli plan is invaluable at charrette time. Since most architects are already familiar with it, no serious thought or research is required before beginning. Just whip out the plan and go to work. Call it a street map of lower Manhattan, or call it the Schmolli Plan. Developers are easily impressed by pedigree. From the horizontal Schmolli matrix, we then extrude some vertical Schmolli -- so many towers, at such and such a height -- whatever is considered "appropriate." Next, we commission urban designers and other consultants to create contextual paving, street lights, signage, bollards designed as flower pots, barricades concealed behind fluttering banners in coordinated colors, and other street level Schmolli.
We invite the retail-entertainment complex to provide cafes, shops, a multiplex, and a museum. Put out some public art. Or invite a group of young, "avant-garde" architects to be the new Schmolli art. Stage an international competition for an artist-architect team to design a "world-class" memorial for victims and heroes. Time's up. We made it!
I took a break from my own version of charrette syndrome to look at some images in "Cities of Artificial Excavation: The Work of Peter Eisenman, 1978-1988." Eisenman represents the Colin Rowe-Cornell faction of mapping, though in lieu of the Nolli plan he sometimes works from Piranesi's visionary scheme for the Campo Marzio. Eisenman's "artificial excavations" represent an alternative way of using historical information. They use urban palimpsests -- street maps, vanished landmarks -- not to assert claims of historical authenticity but rather to expose the extreme artificiality, the arbitrary dimension, of building on the past.
Now I'm not suggesting that an Eisenman building would be better than a Schmolli building. In fact, one of the key points of interest in the artificial excavations is that none of the projects were built. They represent an approach to architecture in which thought precedes building, and even replaces it at times. This may be the only solid approach New York architecture can take in response to the current global crisis. Whether Eisenman's own concepts are solid ideas, or merely figments of ideas, he has nonetheless opened the door for those who believe that architecture should be recalled to a standard of intellectual rigor.
If nothing else, the terrorist attack demanded that New York architects bring themselves up to speed on issues of critical importance to any serious discussion of the city's future. The international flow of currency and information. Access to public, private, and cyber space. Architecture's roots in military fortifications. The convergence of our own technology -- tall buildings and airplanes -- in terrorist warfare. The nature of risk. 
Ideas on these issues have been developed by many of the thinkers and teachers I have reported on since 1992, including Saskia Sassen, Manuel Castels, Ulrich Beck, Gregory Bateson, William Morrish, Jean Gardner, J. B. Jackson, Carl Schorske, Jurgen Habermas, Mike Davis, Jeremy Rifkin and Richard Rorty. There is nothing for us now but to be students of their ideas.
A charrette may not be the ideal time for learning. On the contrary, its function is to emphasize action to the exclusion of reflection, thought and reason. It's not a time to say "Whoa!" In any case, no one acquires information just by skimming a couple of books. We absorb it, in the traditional way, over many years of debate, reflection, story-telling and experiments in application. With effort, information can be rendered into knowledge. With luck, dots get connected. Clarity may emerge. And it is worth recalling that the charrette originated as an educational process.
Now, if I had a big charrette, I would pass through the streets of Manhattan and invite everyone to throw down their Schmolli Plans. I'd donate the lot to Yale, and I'd say: This is New York, 2001. Keep your Schmolli to yourself. Truly, New York does not need your services right now. The healthiest action we could take at this point is to relax this rage to control. Let's rebuild ourselves first, in other words, and contemplate New York's future from a more educated frame of mind.

Salve for a Wounded People

BYLINE:  By KARAL ANN MARLING; Karal Ann Marling teaches art history and popular culture at the University of Minnesota. Her books include "Iwo Jima: Monuments, Memories and the American Hero (with John Wetenhall) and "Norman Rockwell."

 BODY:
ON a recent morning, because I had once written a book on images of the battle of Iwo Jima, I got a desperate call from a Swedish journalist. It seemed that some wire service photos of firemen at the World Trade Center closely resembled Joe Rosenthal's Pulitzer Prize-winning shot of five American marines and a combat medic raising the flag atop Mount Suribachi in 1945. What the reporter wanted to know was whether the Rosenthal picture was a fake: a posed propaganda piece intended to stir up patriotic fervor at home. By implication, I suppose, that would have made the World Trade Center image of a flag going up amid the rubble another specimen of American braggadocio. 
 The Rosenthal picture, as I told the journalist, was not a fake, although its supposed falsity is a widely accepted legend on both sides of the Atlantic. There were two flag-raisings on Iwo Jima on Feb. 23, 1945. A smaller flag went up first and was duly photographed by a combat cameraman. Because it was hard to see from the beaches, where the marines were still taking heavy fire, a call went out to hoist up a bigger version of the Stars and Stripes. Joe Rosenthal of The Associated Press got there in time to catch the second raising on film. For any number of reasons including the crisp, iconic quality of the image, with the flag unfurled against an angry sky, and the heroic efforts of six anonymous figures straining to raise the pole together 
it became one of America's best-known pictorial representations of World War II.
 Engravers turned the Rosenthal flag-raising into postage stamps. Painters made designs for war bond posters by copying the photo in full color. The sculptor Felix de Weldon used the picture as the basis for a monstrously large statue, the Marine Corps War Memorial, situated just across the Potomac from the other national monuments on
the Mall in Washington. It was dedicated in 1954, and its brutal size made it a cold-war assertion of American armed might and determination.
But what is most interesting about the flag-raising image is that it was a specimen of popular art, that it was not a painting or a statue. It appeared on the front pages of newspapers from The Fleming Gazette (in Flemingsburg, Ky.) to The New York Times. The most dramatic image of war and togetherness and hope for victory ever to emerge from World War II -- a reminder of the continuing carnage in the Pacific -- became art only after the fact.
Although the artistic fruits of the recent national crisis and the current war have only begun to appear, the fine arts have not been particularly responsive to the major crises of American history. The greatest painting of World War II, Picasso's "Guernica," was conceived in a white heat of sorrow and anger after the Fascist slaughter of innocents in a Spanish market town in 1937. Although the canvas spent the war years as a guest of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, it is not an American painting by a notable American artist. Europe had Picasso. We had Joe Rosenthal and Norman Rockwell.
Rockwell loved to tell his war story. In 1942, in the darkest days of World War II, he proposed a series of inspirational posters illustrating the Four Freedoms spelled out the year before by Franklin D. Roosevelt. In essence, the posters would show Americans what they were fighting for: freedom of speech and worship, freedom from want and fear. As a patriotic gesture -- as his unique contribution to the war effort -- he took a train to Washington to offer the work to the government, free of charge. After bouncing from bureaucrat to bureaucrat, he found himself late in the day at the Office of War Information. He pulled out his designs, but the fellow in charge didn't want to see them. In World War I, "you illustrators did the posters," the man explained. "This war we're going to use fine arts men, real artists."
What happened next suggests how the failure of "real" artists to rally round in times of strife left that task to others. Rockwell fled Washington and took his work straight to The Saturday Evening Post. The editors, knowing a good thing when they saw it, ran the posters as full-page illustrations. Only then, after dogeared pages from the magazine began to appear in store windows everywhere, did the Office of War Information come, hat in hand, begging to reprint the work of a mere illustrator. Two and a half million sets of "The Four Freedoms" blanketed the nation in 1943, and the original paintings were sent on tour in a successful effort to sell bonds.
In the United States, the feelings unleashed in the aftermath of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor were most directly and swiftly addressed by popular artists and the mass media. And their preferred imagery emphasized the collective experience of the majority.
Rockwell's pictorial explanations of why we were at war always came down to the family, the community and the need to keep them safe. In the pages of The Saturday Evening Post, "Freedom From Want" was moms and dads, children and grandpas, gathered around the Thanksgiving turkey; the home front was Rosie the Riveter, everybody's saucy sister, with a lace hankie tucked into a pocket of her dungarees; and the typical G.I. was Willie Gillis, a sweet, wide-eyed Everyboy, bound securely to the affections of his hometown by a lifeline of letters, food packages and back issues of the local newspaper. Using the pictorial idiom of his apple-pie America of the 1940's, Rockwell got at the emotional fundamentals of war as surely as Picasso did. Rockwell's were simply different.
An American need for community in times of crisis has produced some of the most moving reflections on the tragedy of Sept. 11. These are the shrines to the dead and missing: the collections of candles in paper cups, teddy bears, store-bought greeting cards and photos of relatives or friends lovingly preserved from the elements in plastic wrap.
These impromptu shrines are nothing new. They were among the first responses to the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado and the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City. They sprout at the sites of drive-by shootings and traffic accidents. When the black granite slash of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial opened in 1982 in Washington, the base of the wall was littered with cans of K-rations, army boots and snapshots of long-ago buddies, smiling hopefully alongside their helicopters; the monument, with its chilling register of names, somehow excluded the kinds of memories and emotions that resided in those personal items, carefully placed to comment on the humanity of the dead. Arranged with a touching aesthetic decorum, votive shrines implore the passerby to remember, to see the families and the faces and the love behind words like "tragedy." They argue for the common humanity of us all.
American art -- fine art, that is -- takes too long to serve us well in times of crisis. Fine art appears later, when the culture has achieved a consensus on the meaning of an event, sorted out its conclusions and, often, buried its dead. The definitive painting of the Revolutionary era came afterward, in the 1780's and 90's, when veterans like John Trumbull could see the eternal fame and the heroism hidden beneath the smoke of battle. The greatest artwork of the Civil War -- Augustus Saint-Gaudens's relief sculpture of Robert Gould Shaw leading his black troops -- was finished in 1896, a full generation after the war had ended.
In the 1860's, Matthew Brady and his teams of photographers reached the battlefield first, recording the terrible sights that would haunt the veterans and their families: the bloated corpses, the burning cities of the South, the trees of great forests mowed down like matchsticks under withering fire. The dead were pitifully dead in the Brady pictures; in the Saint-Gaudens sculpture in Boston, they were alive again, and wreathed in glory, the sadness and the terror drained away into the bronze itself. What is so moving about the shrines of the dead and missing of the World Trade Center is that their photos, unmediated by time and reflection, fairly quiver with the overpowering hurt of Sept. 11.
National crises often arise from acts of violence; the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. prompted a whole class of machine-woven tapestries showing the three men joined in some heavenly realm beyond the reach of mortal foes. Popular art forms can stun and wound, but they can also soothe hurts and resolve crises. Romanticism? Sure: art as social therapy. Propaganda? Probably: all is well again in the United States. The greater the shock to the body politic, the greater the need for triage, for some immediate remedy. During the Great Depression of the 1930's, for example, both the fine arts and the dime-store variety enlisted in a lengthy campaign to restore the national equilibrium.
When Roosevelt was first elected President, in 1932, the inauguration was still held in March of the next year. So, for months, as banks failed and bread lines lengthened, Americans waited anxiously for their chosen deliverer to set things right again. In the meantime, they played punch-card games at the corner store. For a nickel or a dime, you could push a metal key through a thick cardboard slab, removing a coiled roll of paper. The paper named your prize: a dime, a quarter or 50 cents. With the economy in ruins, the odds of seeing a little money were better there than at the bank. The grand prize might be an electric iron or a carton of cigarettes -- or a Roosevelt windup clock.
The standard clock was a crude statue of the president-elect, dressed in the oilskins of a Gloucester fisherman, standing and staring into uncharted waters with steely determination while steering the ship of state. The clock face formed the center of the captain's wheel. Other versions had Roosevelt in a business suit, or flanked by smaller images of Washington and Lincoln. Whatever the variations, the meaning was clear: with Roosevelt at the helm, the nation would weather the storm.
The new Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, designed by Lawrence Halprin, includes moving sculptures by George Segal, Robert Graham and others. It invites reflection on Roosevelt's character and his contributions to national unity. But it was dedicated two-thirds of a century after the crisis of the early 1930's. When reassurance and comfort were needed, the tall figure standing steadfast at the helm was clearly what the situation demanded.
Roosevelt, for his part, believed in the power of art. He was determined that artistic skills should not wither through disuse: despite frequent Congressional griping, the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration paid painters and sculptors, actors and writers modest wages to keep doing what they did best. But the president and his advisers also believed in the work of art and, seizing on a provision of law that reserved a percentage of the cost of new public buildings for embellishment, set up a program to enrich America's artistic heritage.
Called the Section of Fine Arts, this was the program that created the famous post-office murals still visible in many communities where the downtown has yet to be modernized. These murals were not as a rule abstract or terribly controversial in theme: this was, after all, public art paid for with taxpayers' money. But the iconography that was embraced by artist and public alike is fascinating.
The Depression was nowhere to be seen. Life was good. In historical scenes, the good guys won. Crops were lush. Factories hummed. Families came together in mutual affection. One reason "WPA art" was looked down on for generations after the 1930's was that it behaved more like popular art. It was Norman Rockwell and the punch-card clocks and the New York shrines and the American-flag lapel pins and a star in the window for every son in the service. It was the latent feelings that would surely emerge again with the end of the Depression. It was hope.
I suspect that for many Americans of my generation the national crises of our lifetimes exist in memory as flickering pictures on a television set: Walter Cronkite crying as he reported the news of John F. Kennedy's assassination; Peter Jennings or Dan Rather clinging to a microphone in a rice paddy somewhere in Vietnam; the vapor trail behind the Challenger space shuttle canting slowly to the right and blossoming into flame. Or Rodney King pleading for everyone to "get along." History and crises can't wait for artists to happen on the scene and mull it over. Crises call for psychic bandages, right now.
Many commentators have observed, with some surprise, that the terrorist crisis of Sept. 11 produced huge audiences for plays, concerts and sporting events. Public spaces have been packed with spectators less interested, perhaps, in Mahler's Symphony No. 2 or Barry Bonds's home run count than in being with people experiencing the same feelings of loss, fear, dislocation and confusion.
There is great comfort in that momentary closeness -- which is what the flag ribbons in America's collective lapel are all about, too. So when the 800-number commercials feature flags equipped with plastic clamps to dangle out the car window -- and as an added bonus, two giant flag stickers that "stick to any surface" -- I'm in no mood to rail against sleazy marketers cashing in on disaster, at $14.95 a head (plus $4.99 for shipping and handling). I want those flags and stickers now. I need those bits of red, white and blue to cope with how I feel, to elicit a thumbs-up from some stranger with a flag of his or her own. I need flags and shrines -- and look forward to great art at some later date.

An article in Arts & Leisure last Sunday about the American arts world's response in previous times of national crisis misstated the source of a photograph of firefighters raising the American flag at the ruins of the World Trade Center. The picture reminiscent of the famous Iwo Jima scene, was by Thomas E. Franklin of The Record of Hackensack, N.J., not from a news agency.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
Down in the Gutter With Jack the Ripper

BYLINE:  By BILL DESOWITZ; Bill Desowitz's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo.

 BODY:
AMERICA has its J. F. K. conspiracy theorists; Britain has its Ripperologists. Jack the Ripper, who murdered and mutilated his way through East London in the bloody autumn of 1888, becoming the prototypical tabloid star and the father of the modern serial killer, holds his enthusiasts in a never-ending existential grip: to this day, no one knows who he was or why he ritualistically slaughtered at least five prostitutes.
 That's why Jack is continually reinvented, particularly in the movies, where the scanty facts fuse with fiction to create at least the pretense of closure. It's a game fueled by the endless stream of suspects and motives provided by the Ripperologists. 
 Yet the movies have never come close to capturing the nightmarish terror of the Ripper. The films about him have not only lacked the requisite gore, which far exceeds even the standards of the modern slasher genre, but his grotesque theatrics as well -- the butchery accomplished with surgical precision. It's as if filmmakers have been afraid to get too close to him -- to get down in the gutter with him. So instead we are distracted by the fog and the gaslights, and dazzled by the reasoning of Sherlock Holmes or some extraordinary inspector from Scotland Yard. 
It's been left up to Jack's fictional descendants -- the Normans and Jasons, the Freddys and Hannibals -- to show us the gruesome will and skill of serial murder, and to make a visceral connection between past and present.
Until now. Finally, with "From Hell" (opening Friday), we get much closer to this top-hatted phantom, and enter the bowels of a 19th-century London, where class tensions ran high and evil seemed to know no bounds.
Based on the graphic novel (the term has never seemed more apt) by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, which dissects the Victorian milieu as well as the rampage itself, "From Hell" gives Jack his due while trying to explain our continued fascination with him.
"One day men will look back and say I gave birth to the 20th century," Jack says, rejoicing, when confronted by his nemesis, Inspector Fred Abberline (played by Johnny Depp more as Edgar Allan Poe than as Sherlock Holmes). Although the two have become secret sharers, with the opium-addicted Abberline psychically witnessing the brutal crimes, Jack (the movie withholds his identity until the end) is really reaching across time to taunt us. Thus we get two movies in one: a period piece with all the proper Victorian trappings and a contemporary Goth fable with all the right MTV-inspired creepiness. Abberline's initial hallucination even plays like a lurid music video: the squalor of the streets; a red glob of blood becoming a sprig of red grapes; a mutilated, lifeless body; a long knife flashing toward a breast.
In the graphic novel "From Hell" (the title refers to the most infamous of the Ripper letters sent to Scotland Yard), Mr. Moore and Mr. Campbell expose the ugliness and hypocrisy beneath the Victorian ethos of refinement and restraint. The brothers Allen and Albert Hughes, co-directors of the film (it was written by Rafael Yglesias and Terry Hayes), know their way around inner cities (their previous films include "Dead Presidents" and "Menace II Society"), and have refocused their attention on the underbelly of an earlier ghetto. Because that's what Whitechapel was in the 1880's: the epitome of urban poverty, crime, violence, prostitution, drug abuse, unemployment and anti-Semitism. Nearly 40 percent of this extremely overcrowded district was below the poverty line; the resulting demonstrations caused fear in the more affluent West End.
So to the Hughes twins, who have been fascinated by the East End crimes since adolescence, as well as to many historians, the period represented a culmination of the strife between the haves and have-nots of London, and the Ripper was no aberration. 
"We think this is the first movie that really shows what he did," says Allen Hughes, who directs the actors and leaves the camerawork to Albert. "It follows the frenzy like 'J. F. K.' It gets at the underclass, the criminal class; it's a different 'hood for us and allows us to get out of what we're known for."
Albert Hughes said that the Crown conspiracy theory of the Ripper (which involves Prince Albert Victor, the Duke of Clarence and the secret order of Freemasons) was the best one to pursue for a mainstream movie. "It's the most popular on both sides of the Atlantic, except for the Ripperologists, who keep pushing their own theories," he said. "It's got sex, scandal, corruption and politics."
It's been done before on screen, most notably in Bob Clark's "Murder by Decree" (1979), the underrated Sherlock Holmes movie with Christopher Plummer as the legendary sleuth and James Mason as a compassionate Dr. Watson. "Murder by Decree," coming on the heels of Stephen Knight's book "Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution," which inspired the "From Hell" graphic novel, was a breath of fresh air. For once, it seemed like we saw, in the Crown theory, a motive equal to Jack's vicious misogyny; in previous films, he had come off more like an inconvenient disruption of polite society. Still, we were in the presence of Holmes, a deceit so fanciful that it took some of the edge off the Crown conspiracy theory.
"From Hell" explores the wild permutations of the Crown theory -- which involves nearly every facet of the political system, united in protecting the monarchy at all costs -- even more intimately, while focusing attention on the tragic plight of the London prostitutes (especially the one played by Heather Graham) and giving us more grisly details of the crimes. After all these years, we're entitled. But here, as always, Jack's motives turn out to be more personal than political.
In John Brahm's 1944 version of "The Lodger," the Ripper is a typical noir psychopath: educated, urbane, sensitive. Laird Cregar plays a mysterious doctor who rents a room from a middle-class couple forced to take in lodgers. He soon becomes infatuated with their beautiful daughter, a showgirl played by Merle Oberon, and exhibits odd behavior. For instance, he's always talking about soothing his hands in the Thames to lift his troubled spirits.
Is he or isn't he the Ripper? There's really no doubt, even though the killer in this adaptation of the popular novel by Marie Belloc Lowndes murders women of the stage rather than of the street. He kills to avenge the death of his angelic-looking brother, who was "destroyed" by a showgirl.
Alfred Hitchcock was better off making his suspect (played by the matinee idol Ivor Novello) innocent in his legendary silent version of "The Lodger" (1926). The film was not only more suspenseful but also more interesting in its focus on the hysteria associated with the crimes.
A different kind of hysteria, one aimed at the medical profession, permeates "Jack the Ripper" (1959), in which a New York cop is brought in to help Scotland Yard. When a doctor is suspected of the crimes, anyone carrying a black bag in Whitechapel is accosted, causing a near riot. The Ripper in fact turns out to be a prominent surgeon, who performs the post-mortems on his own victims. Apparently his son's promising career as a doctor was ruined when he fell for a prostitute.
Upholding class as well as family honor are at the heart of "A Study in Terror" (1965), which also features Sherlock Holmes (John Neville, playing a more stereotypical version than the one in "Murder by Decree") investigating the Ripper. In this case, Jack is an aristocrat avenging the ruin of his brother -- a doctor, of course -- at the hands of a prostitute. At least the plight of the poor makes for an interesting subplot and red herring.
A devilishly charming doctor (played by David Warner) is the culprit -- without apparent motive -- in Nicholas Meyer's "Time After Time" (1979), a whimsical movie that pokes fun at the whole Ripper phenomenon. "Before I was a freak; now I'm an amateur," Jack declares after escaping in H. G. Wells's time machine and ending up in 1970's San Francisco, where he feels more at home as a typical serial killer.
But among all the Ripper movies, the scariest Jack can be found in a cameo at the climax of G. W. Pabst's silent classic "Pandora's Box" (1929), a film that is best known for making Louise Brooks a jazz-age icon. She plays Lulu, the hedonistic dancer and prostitute who ruins men with ease. After escaping Germany as a murder suspect and landing in the East End, she picks up a handsome vagrant on Christmas and takes pity on him. What at first seems almost redemptive turns chilling when this seemingly sweet, harmless man of the street turns out to be Saucy Jack.
It's one of the more ingenious twists in the ghoulish game of Ripperology. Now as "From Hell" arrives, with the most menacing Jack yet, there's one thing we know for certain: the Ripper will continue to rise and fall onscreen. Like Dracula, he never dies. We won't let him.

HEADLINE: A Market Equation Full of Unknowns 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
THOUGH having long withstood the national economic doldrums, the real estate market in the New York metropolitan region was already slipping toward a slowdown by Sept. 11, housing economists and specialists say. Now the economists are wondering whether there will be a sharp V-shaped dip and rebound or a prolonged U-shaped slump.
 Within that broad-brush economic calligraphy, however, the housing specialists say, a closer examination is likely to reveal a subtle play of pressures affecting different communities differently. Depending on location, the makeup of their households and income levels, some communities could weather a downturn well, some could even be strengthened by it, and others may suffer sooner, longer and harder. 
 Single-family suburban communities are likely to be less affected by a slowdown, largely because the baby boom generation will still need to move up to larger homes. Wealthier areas with many empty-nesters and those suburbs near suddenly precious office space may benefit. But neighborhoods with larger contingents of single people in closer proximity to downtown Manhattan or across the Hudson River, including those dependent on the damaged PATH commuter line, could suffer. And poorer neighborhoods, home to the service workers from downtown, will be hardest hit as those people lose their ability to make their mortgage or rent payments. 
"Those would be the people that every evening cleaned the offices or staffed the kitchens in the restaurants," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "That's 120,000 lunches not eaten each day, at least in lower Manhattan."
Among the factors in the equation, the observers say, will be a search by home buyers for a sense of security, both physical and fiscal; some anxious to settle well away from Manhattan's scarred skyline, some seeking assurance in the long-term value of owning real estate rather than investing in a volatile stock market.
Conceding that their predictions are just that -- that there is insufficient data available so soon after the calamitous events -- several housing economists did, however, point to the potentially ameliorative effects of Federal and state aid, of nine straight interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve just this year and of economic activity that would be spurred by the reconstruction of downtown Manhattan itself.
At the same time, in a region that had resisted an economic downturn because it was less dependent on manufacturing jobs than much of the country and in which home prices continued to rise for years, some economists contended that an easing of price pressure might not be such a bad thing, might eventually spur sales volume.
Asked about the impact of the terrorist attacks, Rae Rosen, the senior regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was reluctant to predict. "What we do know is that the market for existing homes was already weakening in New Jersey," she said, and that "late mortgage payments have increased" in the region. "So this weakening could continue to develop for some time."
"Prices seem to have been off their peak in New York, but we haven't seen a significant deterioration," Ms. Rosen continued. "What we've read about anecdotally is people taking more time to consummate a deal."
Still, she said, "The reality is we haven't gotten the numbers to say something reliably."
George McCarthy, a housing economist at the Ford Foundation, cited numbers from just before the World Trade Center attack to indicate that the national and regional real estate markets were already slowing -- or, at least, that suppliers were becoming increasingly wary.
Nationally, housing starts in August fell 6.9 percent from the month before, according to Department of Commerce statistics. "It's the steepest drop since March of 2000," Dr. McCarthy said. In the Northeast region -- New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware -- housing starts were down 7.7 percent in August.
According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, applications for building permits for single-family homes during the first six months of the year slipped by 3 percent in New York State, 13 percent in New Jersey and 12 percent in Connecticut. "So suppliers were already pessimistic about the housing market before Sept. 11," Dr. McCarthy said.
On the demand side, however, the rate of sales of existing homes nationally during August was equivalent to 5.5 million annually -- potentially a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors.
"That's good," Dr. McCarthy said, "except that the National Association of Realtors, in a report on Sept. 25, projected that the national rate will fall below the 5-million mark since the Sept. 11 catastrophe."
The association report says, "After setting a new record for existing home sales in August, our internal tracking shows a downturn following the attack on America, and there will be some natural pullback from big-ticket purchases in the months ahead."
Sales of existing homes in the Northeast, meanwhile, were up 6.2 percent in August, and 5 percent in New York State. "So the demand, at least, was still there in August," Dr. McCarthy said. "But, again, the suppliers were pessimistic. So I guess you could say the housing market was already in transition."
But transition from what?
Kevin Thorpe, an economist at the National Association of Realtors, pointed out that 1996 through last year were the five best years ever for sales of existing homes in the nation -- with 1999, at 5,205,000 sales, the highest on record, and 2000, at 5,113,000 sales, the second highest.
And in the tristate region, last year's 194,700 sales in New York stand as the state's all-time high; the 53,200 sales in Connecticut last year set the record for the state, and in New Jersey, the 134,000 sales in 2000 were the second highest ever, close to the 1999 record of 141,900.
Still, despite the vibrant sales activity, there is no denying that unemployment was rising in recent months, and could take a toll on the housing market. John L. Weiting, the regional commissioner for the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the tristate region lost 11,000 private-sector jobs in August (data for September was not available), with the unemployment rate inching up to 4.5 percent from 4.2 percent in July.
And as a direct result of the Trade Center disaster, a minimum of 120,000 jobs have been affected -- either lost or relocating, at least for the time being.
"That puts a damper on all housing activity," Dr. Hughes at Rutgers said. "The question now is, what will be the shape of its decline?"
Dr. Hughes sees submarkets in the region affected differently, reflecting housing's primary functions -- shelter and investment. 
"Demographically, those housing markets catering to baby boomers -- and these are largely single-family, family-raising communities -- are probably most immune to the downturn," he said. "The great bulk of the region's baby boomers are located in single-family suburbia, and so they are relatively set in place."
At the same time, housing is often viewed as a safe port in an economic storm -- a perception that bolstered the real estate market over the last year while the economy slackened. "That force is still going to be operating, regionwide, because the stock market is viewed as risky," Dr. Hughes said. "So we may see an increased tendency for the affluent to crowd into the winner's circle; that is, the investment security of the Scarsdales, the Short Hillses, the Princetons, the Lawrences. Those are the ones that would have the most resiliency in a downturn."
Communities and neighborhoods not too distant from downtown Manhattan could experience tighter housing markets as businesses relocate and families seek to distance themselves from ground zero.
Michael Schill, director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law, said, "Businesses will, at least in the short run, disperse to locations outside the core of Manhattan, such as Long Island City and downtown Brooklyn" -- as well as the commercial districts dotting the suburban ring.
"The housing markets in adjacent neighborhoods," Professor Schill said, "could be strengthened by the increased demand."
Approximately 30 million square feet of office space was either permanently or temporarily taken out of action by the terrorist attack -- eroding the economic rationale for a significant portion of downtown Manhattan's housing stock. "If you worked in the World Trade Center and lived in Battery Park City because you could walk to work, you no longer can walk to work," Dr. Hughes said. "You may not want to move and could conceivably commute to a new job location, but it certainly lessens the value of that property."
"Some people will move out, some will not want to move in," he said. "So if you want to sell a condominium, most likely it will be at a bargain price."
Connecticut and Westchester are less dependent on downtown Manhattan because of the more difficult commute, several observers said, and those housing markets are more likely to escape most of the negative effects of Sept. 11. But the loss of close proximity to the workplace -- and, to a degree, the fear factor -- could distress communities that have views of the Trade Center site.
The PATH commuter railway station at the World Trade Center will be out of service for some time. So housing on the New Jersey side of the river that depended on PATH will be less desirable, Dr. Hughes said. However, locations in New Jersey with access to Midtown through Penn Station may become more desirable. "We saw that impact in the mid-90's in Summit, when Midtown Direct service was initiated and values soared long before the regional housing boom," he said.
Among the potential beneficiaries in the housing market -- or, at least, those less impacted by a downturn -- are communities easily accessible to the relocating lower Manhattan jobs. "We don't know the scale of these shifts," Dr. Hughes said. "Some will be permanent, some temporary. But even if they are temporary, it certainly will be reflected in the rental market in those communities."
Hit hardest, the economists say, will be lower-income people whose jobs disappeared.
Dr. McCarthy at the Ford Foundation said: "The impact will be felt most profoundly in the service sector -- hotels, restaurants, the tourist industry. If lots of people lose their jobs, their ability to pay their mortgages is really threatened."
Mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures were already rising well before Sept. 11. "There's been a steady increase right through the economic expansion of the 1990's," Dr. McCarthy said.
According to a report by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, released on Sept. 4, the delinquency rate for all mortgage loans in the country was 4.63 percent in the second quarter of the year, up from 4.37 percent in the first quarter. The percentage of mortgages already in the foreclosure process rose from 0.9 to 0.91 percent. And the number of new foreclosures for the second quarter rose from 0.31 to 0.36 percent.
"That isn't huge, but it's still going up," Dr. McCarthy said, "which is the point. And that's before Sept. 11." 
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has estimated that $500 million in mortgages will be directly affected by the Sept. 11 attacks. (It has placed a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures of any federally insured mortgages for victims of the attacks.)
"People who rely on more than one income to pay their mortgages are going to be particularly at risk of default," Dr. McCarthy said. "And that's only the direct impact. It's not clear what kind of supports are in place to help people who are not directly impacted by the disaster." Demand for already spare foreclosure-prevention support is certain to increase, he said.
Some observers are cautiously optimistic.
"I think the balance of 2001 is going to be a down housing market," Dr. Hughes said. "However, the potential impact of direct federal aid, which certainly will exceed $20 billion, and of Federal Reserve actions at maintaining liquidity and the potential impact of new income tax cuts ultimately will be significant stimulators of the regional economy."
Professor Schill at N.Y.U. added another consideration. "If the stock market continues to exhibit high levels of volatility," he said, "people may pull their money out of equities and, instead, invest in real estate, thereby stabilizing prices."
To which Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal company that prepares the Insignia Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report, concurred, "Despite the negativity of recent events, real estate has been a solid investment for decades."
Asked to consult fellow appraisers around the metropolitan area, Mr. Miller pointed out that: 
A two-story colonial home in Great Neck that sold for $482,000 in 1980, sold again in April for $2,975,000 -- a $2 million gain even after adjusting for inflation. A semi-attached, two-story row house in Flatlands, Brooklyn, that sold for $52,000 in 1981, sold again last fall for $200,000, doubling in value after adjusting for inflation. A three-bedroom co-op on East 58th Street that sold in 1979 for $220,000, sold again in January for $2,500,000, an inflation-adjusted profit of over $2 million.
And, for an even longer perspective, a colonial in Bronxville, Westchester, which sold for $50,000 in 1963, recently closed at $1,355,000. "There were six backup offers, and the house was in the same condition as when" the original seller purchased it, "other than a 1963 kitchen renovation," Mr. Miller said. "In today's dollars, that would be a $1.2 million gain."
Mr. Miller, whose firm tracks sales activity below 116th Street in Manhattan, said that during the first two weeks following the Trade Center attack, "We saw very little purchase activity; everybody was still numb." That started to turn around in the third week, he said.
"In fact, last week we reviewed a contract assignment with a date of Sept. 17 that had a six-way bidding war," Mr. Miller said. "This is not a high-end property; this is a sub-million price range on the East Side."
Pointing out that the bidding war "doesn't imply that every transaction is like that," Mr. Miller said he had received "a number of inquiries from people who were in contract prior to the attack, and are now trying to decide whether to close or to walk away from their deposit."
"The feedback I've gotten from most of these calls has been that they are opting to follow through," he said.
Shaun Donovan, a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Clinton administration, assessed the impact of the Trade Center attack on the already constricted supply of housing for low- and moderate-income families.
"The common wisdom is that it's a serious blow to funding for affordable housing," Mr. Donovan, now a research fellow at the N.Y.U. Law School's real estate center, said. The best indication of that, he said, is that "all but one of the Democrats in the mayor's race specifically cited World Trade Center revenues for affordable housing, which would have meant as much as $100 million a year."
That money, obviously, is lost. But from his perspective as a recent housing official in Washington, Mr. Donovan believes that New York "has always seen itself as an island," with housing advocates focusing exclusively on the city's own investment in affordable housing -- currently averaging $440 million a year.
Mr. Donovan is writing a report showing that over $3 billion a year comes into the city from federal housing programs. "Even before Sept. 11," he said, "Congress had passed 40 to 50 percent increases in the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and in tax-exempt bond programs. These increases alone will add $50 million a year in subsidies and $150 million a year in bonding authority."
Assuming those appropriations withstand federal budget tremors in the fallout from the terrorist attacks, he said, "Now we can expect to see, in addition to the $20 billion emergency appropriation, a further shifting of federal resources to the city and the region for housing."
There are other slivers to a silver lining.
Professor Schill, a proponent of streamlining the city's complex building-approval process, voiced hope that "the need to expedite construction and make the city more economically competitive may finally provide the impetus to reform government regulations and industry practices that make new construction more costly."
"This may actually drive down the cost of construction and increase affordability in the long run," he said. 
And a softening of demand with prices moderating -- something already happening before Sept. 11 -- could carry some benefits. A recent report by the New York State Comptroller's Office indicated that more than 80 percent of businesses surveyed saw high housing costs as a significant barrier to companies coming to New York.
"Keep in mind," Mr. Donovan said, "the major problem for New York City's housing market has been the outrageously high cost. So a cooling of the market is not altogether a bad thing."
Dr. Hughes sees a V-shaped recovery: "A quick dip down in the fourth quarter and an equally quick upturn in the first half of 2002 -- because of all the stimulative effects I mentioned. So, unless external events provide other shocks, 2002 will be the turnaround year."
Dr. McCarthy, on the other hand, is in the U-shaped recovery camp. "I've been looking at signs of weakness in the economy for a long time," he said. "So the disaster just pushed something that was already rolling downhill. And the recovery, in my estimation, is going to take a good two, two and a half years of unraveling and then a recovery."
"I'm sure that some day I will be more optimistic than the other people you talk to," he said, "but it just ain't today."
Mr. Donovan, the former deputy secretary at H.U.D., was quite sanguine about the future. "There are some apocalyptic predictions that the Trade Center disaster will open the floodgates of people moving out of New York," he said. "My belief is that, in the long term, the disaster does not dim the prospects of New York City."
A scattering of some businesses from the city's core to commercial districts in the suburban ring -- certainly a concern for environmentalists and traffic monitors -- would eventually be a boon to the city, Mr. Donovan believes. "Already, the influence of new technologies that allow electronic commuting and the growth of edge cities have been a shot in the arm; you see the development of Silicon Alley, the growth in the city's population during the 90's, both signs of the city's long-term health in the new economy."
But beyond that, cities meet deeper human needs. "People need contact, not only to get business done, but also for building community," Mr. Donovan said. "And there's been no better sign of that than the response of New Yorkers to the disaster."
"I don't think that level is sustainable," he added, "but I do believe it has demonstrated the importance of reaching out to others in our everyday lives, something that cities make possible in thousands of ways."

HEADLINE: ART; 
Connecticut Focus For Painter's Brush

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM ZIMMER

 BODY:
THE Mattatuck Museum shows only work by artists with a strong connection to Connecticut, and in John Kensett it has a perfect specimen. Kensett was one of the leading landscape painters in the 19th century, and he is becoming more widely appreciated and understood.
 Kensett, who was born in Cheshire in 1816, is best known for his shimmering paintings of water and light, a style frequently called "luminism." His favorite locales included tourist resorts in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, fashionable places that helped make him a very prosperous painter. 
 During the last years of his life he spent much of his time on Contentment Island on Long Island Sound near Darien. The Mattatuck exhibition titled "Images of Contentment: John Frederick Kensett and the Connecticut Shore" is comprised mostly of paintings from that period, many of them based on the view from his studio and light-filled bedroom. 
It had long been thought that Kensett made all the Contentment paintings in the summer of 1872, and the period was referred to as "the summer of Contentment." It is now known that he had been painting them all along. 
The Mattatuck's curator, Ann Y. Smith, has been working on this show for five years, but she has been contemplating it for a lot longer, almost since she came to the museum in 1976. She was able to borrow widely from museums, galleries and private collections; the Metropolitan Museum of Art was a major lender. As is the case with all major exhibitions at the Mattatuck, the show includes a wealth of supplementary material.
"The nine acres he bought on Contentment Island, which included Fish Island and adjacent oyster beds, were a retreat for Kensett," Ms. Smith said. "People sought places of refuge after the Civil War. The aftermath of the war is reflected in many of his paintings. 'Passing Off of the Storm' and 'Twilight After the Storm' are distinct references to the recent conflict. 
"Contentment Island was especially desirable because it was within commuting distance of New York. It took two hours by train, and Kensett maintained a grand New York studio. We have included some photographs of the studio taken by the great photographer of the Civil War, Matthew Brady."
Kensett never built his own house on Contentment Island. Instead, he lived in the house of his friend Vincent Colyer from whom he bought his land on the island. His bedroom on the third floor had views in every direction and afforded him something of an aerial perspective.
The paintings from this period are more abstracted, more intensely colored and more textured than his previous work. 
"That they offer a more poetic view of nature was recognized by contemporaries," she said. "A common reaction was that they were less 'factual' but more 'truthful' in their depiction of nature.
"He would paint the same view over and over, but the paintings are quite different from each other," Ms. Smith continued. "He paid attention to changes in the weather, time of day and the reflection of light. With real economy the paintings with real economy record human endeavor and social changes. In quick strokes or daubs he'd correctly capture the oyster fisherman at work. Someone who knows boats tells me that those are yachts on the horizon of in 'Gathering Storm on Long Island Sound,' and although they are just daubs, this person said that Kensett got the rigging exactly right.
"He left a lot of work unfinished at his death. The painting that ends our show, 'Sunset on the Sea,' might look unfinished because of its spareness. It's a marriage of sea and sky, nothing else, but the sky is one of those that at the time prompted one admirer to say that it looked like he 'dipped his brush in flame.' At the time this painting was recognized as a bold departure in painting and about a decade after Kensett's death, other painters were moved to make radical compositions influenced by the extreme reduction demonstrated in paintings like "Sunset on the Sea'." 
Kensett died in a bizarre way. On Oct. 31, 1872, Vincent Colyer's wife, Mary, was returning to the island after a trip to New York. High tide obscured the bridge from the mainland, her horse carriage tumbled into the deep water and she drowned. Kensett arrived too late to save her life, but plunged into the cold water to retrieve her body. He caught pneumonia, which affected his heart, and he collapsed and died in his New York studio on Dec. 14.
"Just a few years after his death, the area in which he lived was transformed into 'the Connecticut Riviera,' " Ms. Smith said. "We have a large panoramic photograph taken this year by Randy Clark of the identical view that appears in a painting that Kensett took for a painting that includes Long Neck Point in the distance. The photograph looks very much like the painting, but in it you can see large homes and estates in the background. The notion of a painter's retreat was altered forever."

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND VINES; 
The $55 Question

BYLINE:  By Howard G. Goldberg

 BODY:
Lenz's 1997 merlot, $55 a bottle at the winery, cannot be drunk without the Big Question arising: Is it worth the price?
 Yes and no. 
 It is not the costliest Long Island wine ever made. I have neither seen nor heard of a local wine more expensive than Jamesport Vineyards's 1998 late-harvest riesling: $99.95 for a 750-milliliter bottle at the winery. 
If as a consumer I imagined that Lenz was signaling that its '97 was the best merlot that it, or the East End, ever made, I'd spend $55 to judge Lenz's judgment. But I would not spend a nickel more than $55 at restaurants, which have high markups, in order to experience the '97 at dinner. Instead, the price-value relationship would dictate that I order a Pomerol, St.-Emilion or California counterpart.
The balance-tipping factor is Eric Fry, Lenz's winemaker. I like the earthiness of his wines, his outspoken independence, which finds its way into his wine style, and the gusto and technical savvy he brings to the vineyard and cellar.
Is the unfiltered '97 Lenz merlot exquisite and memorable in its current phase of development? No.
Is it first-rate? Absolutely: worth 92 on the standard 100-point scale. Left to mature in the bottle under proper conditions, could it rise to at least 94 points? For sure. The blend (88 percent merlot, 8 percent cabernet franc, 4 percent cabernet sauvignon) will find new synergies.
Would curiosity move me to buy, say, three bottles in order to sample their evolution at different stages? Yes. Would I buy a case at discount? No. Would I buy a case of proved Bordeaux at the same price? Yes.
Economics aside, how does it taste?
In a delicate Riedel glass designed to display wine's strengths, the bouquet and flavor are rich, dense, concentrated, sumptuous. The wine is not merely mouth-filling but virtually palate-staining. It has a strong beginning, middle and end. It is crammed with dark-berry and licorice flavors, and is smoky and oaky. The grape solids are virtually beefy.
Of 1,200 cases made, about 425 are left. The wine has been on the market for about a year, Mr. Fry said. HOWARD G. GOLDBERG

HEADLINE: Ship Sits Waiting For Its Curtain Call 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER

 BODY:
LAST March, the "H.M.S." Rose left Bridgeport for Newport, R.I., the first stop on her path to the silver screen and fame.
 And there she has stayed the last seven months as the 20th Century Fox planned production of "Master and Commander," based in part on Patrick O'Brian's epic novel by the same name, awaits what's affectionately known in Hollywood as the green light. 
 "Big movies take a long time," said Tom Rothman, co-chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, which includes the Fox film studio, explaining the situation.
To make the point, he noted that the studio's remake of "Planet of the Apes," one of the studio's blockbuster summer offerings, took some 12 years to produce. 
In fact, he said, it's been nearly 10 years since Samuel Goldwyn Jr. of Goldwyn Productions convinced Mr. O'Brian to sell the rights to the series of stories. Filming could start as early as next spring, Mr. Rothman said, but nothing is set in stone.
"The real point is to do this series justice in the modern filmmaking era," he said. "To do for high seas adventure what 'Gladiator' did for Roman spectacle."
The movie will focus on the adventures of Capt. Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon and a spy, as they sail through the turmoil of the Napoleonic wars.
"Everybody will tell you don't make a movie using water," said Mr. Rothman, whose studio also made Titanic. "They're very complicated, expensive ventures."
If all goes according to schedule, the Rose, purchased for $1.5 million last spring, will star as the H.M.S. Surprise, Captain Aubrey's frigate. Plans call for filming in open waters and tanks as well as use of computer generated graphics.
It's a much more dramatic role than the ship had been playing, serving since 1987 as part-time tourist attraction at Captain's Cove Seaport in Bridgeport and sailing school vessel.
Peter Weir, whose films include "Gallipoli," "Witness" and the "Truman Show," has signed on to direct the film and is working on the screenplay, studio officials said. But bringing together the pieces of the project, which will involve a great deal of filming on water, takes time, Mr. Rothman said.
So for now, the Rose is waiting in the wings, dockside in Newport. She was the first part to be cast and Mr. Rothman said there was limited competition for the role.
"There were only a very, very few possibilities," he said. "Our people looked at them all and basically concluded, while there aren't that many of them, the Rose was the best one."
The Rose is a three-masted replica of a mid-eighteenth century Royal Navy frigate built in 1757 in Hull, England, to fight in the Seven Years War. The smallest ship that would be commanded by someone holding the rank of captain, the frigate's job was typically to operate as a scout ship for a fleet or patrol coasts.
The ship was built in the '70s, but had fallen into disrepair by the time it was purchased by Kaye Williams in 1984. He paid $50,000 for the ship and $20,000 for the sails, said his daughter, Jan Williams, a director for the foundation formed to manage the Rose as well as the Lightship Nantucket.
"You could walk through the side of the ship," Ms. Williams said. "There were no engines, no rigs, no middle."
By 1987, Mr. Williams had refurbished the ship and had her sailing again. Last year, the Rose kept up an active pace prior to the sale, participating in events in the Caribbean and serving as a sailing school.
In a sense, the Rose became a goodwill ambassador for the city, said Steven Paganelli, executive director for Connecticut's Coastal Fairfield County Convention & Visitor. In that respect, he said, she is sorely missed.
"I don't think there's been a significant economic impact from its loss," he said. "I think its more psychological. It's sort of like the loss of an old friend."
But maintaining the ship was a constant financial challenge for the foundation. Officials hope that by striking a deal to put her to work in the movies, it will help secure her future.
Current plans call for a number of improvements including new decks, running rigs, engines and a new suit of sails, which alone could cost around $100,000, she said, and would have been nearly impossible for the foundation to afford.
The captain of the ship, Richard Bailey, and a crew remain with the Rose to care for it and consult on production issues.
But Ms. Williams sees the ship's departure only as a temporary loss, one that she quickly learned to deal with.
"I miss the people and I miss Captain Bailey," she said. "But I don't miss the phone calls at 2 in the morning saying the engines have broken down and she's stuck somewhere."
In fact, she talks as though she fully expects the boat to be back working as a sail training vessel one day.
"The best way to keep her in shape," she said, "is to keep her sailing."

Rehabilitation for a Camden Apartment Complex

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
IF ever a city could be described as needing major overhaul, it is this one.
 Camden's finances were taken over by the state last year, after a five-year projection put its deficit at $30 million and the sitting mayor went to jail for corruption. The state Recovery Plan prescribed rehabbing just about everything: municipal government operations, budget structure, office buildings, tax collection procedures, crime-fighting, school performance and much of the residential housing stock. 
 "Bold ideas" are required to save Camden, the state plan said, adding, "This is not a time for incrementalism." 
Yet moderation has its place -- even in the recovery of Camden. 
In one corner of this once-great port city, on the other end of Ferry Avenue from where with great fanfare public officials operated bulldozers last February to begin demolition of drug dens, a modest renovation project is under way. Thanks in part to a nonprofit organization that has previously operated only in New York state, the Ferry Street Station Apartments are getting a $7.1 million sprucing.
Built in 1970 just east of downtown Camden, the apartment complex houses 544 one- and two-bedroom units in 26 two-story buildings.
The roofs are being repaired and replaced. The drainage system, which routinely flooded below-grade apartments, is being fixed. And a new structure is going up where a 10-unit building destroyed by fire had stood. The parking lot is also being restored, and the landscaping upgraded. Apartment interiors are getting new windows, front doors, carpeting, kitchen cabinets, appliances and floors.
"Ferry Street was not horrible, horrible" before work was begun, said Justin Peyser, vice president of the Community Preservation Corporation, a private not-for-profit company that finances affordable housing and provided the project's construction loan. "It was occupied. People were still paying rent. But definitely, the buildings needed work."
Mr. Peyser said the preservation corporation was motivated to invest in these dilapidated apartments in New Jersey's most distressed city by the company's core philosophy: "it's just as important to perserve as to reconstruct.
"In fact," he said, "it is cheaper, and it is more efficient to take steps to reverse a downslide than it is to let things get to the point where you have to do a gut rehab or knock something down and start over."
The Community Preservation Corporation set up shop in New Jersey two years ago, the lender's first foray onto new turf since it was founded 27 years ago in New York by commercial clearinghouse banks and insurance companies. The corporation was created as a mortgage-lending consortium that would focus on areas traditional lenders shied away from. It backed numerous multifamily rehab projects in Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Syracuse, Albany and Buffalo with loans and with technical expertise.
IN New Jersey, the mission remains the same, according to Mr. Peyser. "We do preservation projects in urban neighborhoods where others have not," he said.
The company lends to both profit-making and nonprofit concerns, large contractors and small landlords, urban turnaround experts and budding entrepreneurs, those who need subsidies to make projects work and those that do not, those who can wend their own way through the morass of government paperwork and those who need the company to handle that.
The preservation corporation has lent $68.1 million on 3,159 dwelling units in New Jersey, including two current projects other than Ferry Street: the rehab of a 12-unit building in Passaic and the conversion of two large loft buildings in Elizabeth for apartments.
In Camden, work will be finished by the fall of next year. 
There will be no ribbon-cutting or hoopla when it is finished, Mr. Peyser noted. "Moderate rehab never generates that kind of applause," he said. But he; the developers who purchased the complex to renovate it, Conifer Properties of Rochester; the contractors, Allied Construction Services II Inc. of Glenside, Pa.; and state and city officials all point to the stabilizing effect renovation can have on a neighborhood.
"Investment begets more investment, " said Anthony Cancro, New Jersey's deputy commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs. "We have tried to strive to get to the point where for-profit developers are interested in Camden," added Mr. Cancro, whose department supervises recovery efforts. "Now, that finally looks like a real possibility."
Even as work proceeds at Ferry Street, another private developer has expressed interest in providing Camden its first waterfront apartments, at the nearby Nipper Building, Mr. Cancro said.
The Nipper, which is beside the Delaware River and overlooks Philadelphia, is a relic of Camden's glory days. Now empty, it once served as headquarters for RCA and is named for the dog sitting beside the Victrola in the famous company logo.
Camden began losing its industry about 50 years ago and started a downward slide in general. At the close of World War II, as the state recovery plan notes, "its shipyard was mighty, its port thriving, its downtown bustling, its medical institutions pillars of the city, its neighborhoods buzzing with vitality."
But its shipyard role shriveled in the postwar economy, and decades of disinvestment followed.
BY the dawn of the 90's, Camden found itself stuck in a dependency cycle -- unable to compete effectively for residents and business and relying on special state aid payments reaching 11 to 13 percent of its operating budget. Per capita income sank to $7,276 last year, the lowest in New Jersey. As for property value, while the rest of the state reveled in a boom, the average one-family home here has a market value of less than $26,000. 
The recovery plan for Camden rests on spurring redevelopment so the local tax base can be rebuilt. That involves some very complex deal-making -- and highly creative financial packaging -- to make it worthwhile for developers, all parties to the effort agree.
For the Ferry Street project, Conifer raised money by selling $6 million in low-income housing tax credits to Columbia Housing, a subsidary of PNC Bank. It also obtained a payment-in-lieu-of-taxes agreement with the City of Camden.
Conifer tried to line up state commitments for subsidies, but missed several closing deadlines while struggling with bureaucratic tangles. The sellers, who had owned the project for 12 years, were about to take the deal off the table when the Community Preservation Corporation stepped up to help cut through red tape and speed closing, Mr. Peyser said.
The preservation corporation approved a purchase and rehab loan for a total of $16 million last April, even though the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency had not yet arranged the sale of tax-exempt bonds for the permanent financing. A $1.37 million Department of Community Affairs grant was still pending. In addition, plans for the new building and specs on the rehab work were still preliminary, 
"For us, the state's commitment to Camden and the developer's track record were strong enough to close the deal," Mr. Peyser said.
Mr. Peyser said the redevelopment process is not easy anywhere in New Jersey, and only the "hardiest, thickest-of-skin developers" successfully occupy the affordable housing niche.
The state building code was recently reformed to be more flexible when it comes to renovation.
Also, the Community Preservation Corporation lobbied the state to develop more developer-friendly programs, including a new subsidy for owners of small and midsize properties that house low-and moderate-income renters. The Department of Community Affairs grant for Ferry Street is an example of the new subsidy, called "rental rehabilitation," which is part of the department's Balanced Housing program.
Grants of up to $25,000 per unit are now given for building system upgrades and moderate renovation, compared with an earlier limit of $7,500. A 10-year lien is taken by the state on the properties and forgiven in steps over the last five years as long as rents are kept affordable.
At Ferry Street, the cost per unit of renovation will be $13,000. After work is done, rents will range from $460 for a one-bedroom apartment to $745 for one of the three-bedroom duplexes that will be constructed at the site of the building lost to fire.
Mr. Peyser walked through the still-rutted parking lot at the apartment complex one recent day and took a look inside one of the redone basement flats. Its new linoleum floor was dry and sparkling. Its bathroom tile had tidy new grouting. A shaft of sunlight from a window at sidewalk level reflected off a shiny new kitchen cabinet.
"You know, a real difference is being made here," he said. "You can already see some of the life coming back."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Massapequa Park; 
A Classic, Well-Kept South Shore Suburb

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
BACK in late 1960's, William E. Colfer recalled, the branches of young pin oaks in Massapequa Park sometimes poked him in the eye when he got out of his car. "Now the lowest branches are 20 feet high," said Mr. Colfer, the village administrator.
 Like the oaks and maples whose boughs now sway above the streets of this classically suburban South Shore, Long Island, community of one-family homes, Massapequa Park has matured into a stable place of deepening family roots first set down 40 or 50 years ago, when most of the ranches, Capes and split-level houses were built. 
 Children return as adults to buy, and residents stay long in this well-tended village fitted into the southeastern corner of Oyster Bay in Nassau County. 
"I notice that a lot of people are not selling," said Pat LiVecche, an associate broker at the Massapequa Park office of Prudential Long Island Realty. "They are making their houses larger and improving their property."
Thomas M. Brown, the owner of Camelot Realty in Massapequa Park, noted a similar trend among more recent arrivals. "Not many people who move here move away," he said. "They upgrade to a better house."
Few of the 6,000 almost universally well-kept houses along the broad village streets seem untouched by additions, new siding or other improvements. Weed-free lawns and meticulous landscaping prevail, and signature 60-by-100 lots join seamlessly together in neighborhood settings that are nothing if not orderly.
Prices range from the mid-$200,000's for the smallest homes along the blocks north of Sunrise Highway to well over $1 million in the Bar Harbour section south of Merrick Boulevard near Great South Bay, where the bulkheaded boating canals that run behind some houses are barely visible from the street.
The village mayor, James Altadonna Jr., said he chose Massapequa Park over Darien, Conn., and Plandome, a village of expensive homes in the Manhasset area on Nassau's North Shore, when he moved in six years ago. The father of three school-aged children, he said he regarded the Massapequa school system as equal to any on Long Island.
"Massapequa Park is one of those gems on the South Shore that is still undiscovered," Mr. Altadonna said. "It offers very good value in a very good community."
A near cessation of real estate activity after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 has given way to near-normal conditions in recent weeks, local real estate professionals said. They said prices, which had been rising, were unchanged in a village housing market where demand continued to outstrip supply.
"We are hearing that consumer confidence is on the wane all over, and that could soften prices over time," said Richard Witt, the owner of Century 21 Wittney Estates in Massapequa Park. "But the village is a very strong market." He said that in the days after the attack six buyers made offers on a split-level house that sold for $325,000.
There are no two-family houses or rental apartment buildings in the village. Mrs. LiVecche said house rentals were rare. The village permits mother-daughter arrangements but requires yearly renewals to assure they are kept within the family. 
Southgate at Bar Harbour, a 182-unit planned urban development of clustered town houses with brick, stucco and wood exteriors, is a more-upscale North Shore-style complex on the South Shore, according to Sheila Laufer, the administration manager for the homeowners association. She said a three-bedroom two-story unit recently sold for $445,000. Monthly maintenance ranges from $183 for one-bedrooms to $271 for three-bedrooms.
There is an outdoor pool for residents and an artificial lake near the main entrance at the carefully landscaped complex. 
At the newly constructed 48-unit Whitewood Landing, a co-op for people aged 62 and older, two-bedroom units cost from $164,000 to $174,990. Preference was given to village residents based on length of residency. Property taxes are frozen for 25 years, and taxes and maintenance are less than $300 a month. Buyers cannot earn more than $70,000 a year. 
The co-op, built under the state's Golden Age housing program, is sold out, and residents are moving in. "It did a wonderful thing for residents who could no longer really care for their homes," said Fern Karhu, a senior housing consultant involved in the project. "It gave them the option to sell their houses and not have to move far away from home." 
Local shopping is centered in the village's downtown area on Park Boulevard north of Front Street. "We pride ourselves on having the small merchants and local shops a lot of other towns and villages have lost," said Peggy Caltabiano, a village resident for 46 years. A $500,000 project to add bricks to sidewalks, add ornamental lights and install planters is now in progress.
IN the days after the Sept. 11 attack, residents placed flowers, ribbons and candles by a statue of a firefighter carrying a child to safety at the firefighters bell tower monument on Park Boulevard and Sunrise Highway. At least three village residents were among the missing.
The monument is by the elevated railroad station, where parking lots are reserved for village residents. Annual permits cost $35. 
Other commercial areas are on Front Street, where the village hall is situated, and on Merrick Road and Sunrise Highway. Sunrise Mall in Massapequa, an adjacent unincorporated area, has 160 stores and more than 1.2 million square feet of retail space. J. C. Penney, Sears and Macy's are the anchors. The Southern State Parkway, which has connections to major roadways, runs on the northern edge of the village.
There are three village parks. The 3.6-acre Colleran Park in Bar Harbour has views of Great South Bay. The 8-acre Mansfield Park, which juts into the Massapequa State Preserve on the village's western boundary, has a ball diamond, playing fields and access to bicycle and running trails in the wooded and wetland preserve. The 4-acre Brady Park has a Little League ball field, basketball courts, shuffleboard, a playground and a picnic area. It hosts special events, serves as a center for village recreation programs for children and also has a senior citizens center.
About 90 percent of the village is within the Massapequa Union Free School District, which with 8,022 students is the third largest district in Nassau County. The district has grown by about 200 students annually in each of the last two years, with most of the growth in its six elementary schools, serving kindergarten through sixth grade. There is a middle school for Grades 7 and 8, and a high school with a separate campus for Grade 9. 
In the Class of 2001, 71 percent of the 481 enrolled in four-year colleges and 26 percent went on to other schools. Mean scores on the College Board were 517 in verbal and 527 in math, above state and national averages but below the most academically elite Long Island public schools. But the average score in SAT II physics was a lofty 641.
More than a third of the graduates completed one or more Advanced Placement courses in a wide range of subjects. 
A $51 million bond issue approved by voters in 1999 provided more than $11 million to upgrade computer access and instruction for all students, purchase 2,267 new computers and wire all school buildings to the Internet. The district also refurbished buildings with new roofs, windows, ceilings and lighting.
A small northern section of the village is within the 6,500-student Farmingdale Union Free School District, where 89 percent of the 362 graduates of the Class of 2001 went on to higher education, including 63 percent who enrolled in four-year institutions. College Board averages were 488 in verbal and 509 in math.
The district has four elementary schools for kindergarten through sixth grade, a middle school for Grades 7 and 8, and a high school offering a menu of advanced placement courses. Full-day kindergarten began this year.
MASSAPEQUA PARK takes its name from Marsapeague, a northern Algonquin tribal name for what are now southern portions of Nassau County, meaning "great water land." In 1658, the sachem Tackapausha deeded meadowlands, including what is now the village, to English settlers of Oyster Bay, the town in which the village is situated. 
A mansion built by the Jones family in 1770, known as Tyler Hall and later as Fort Neck House, stood at what is now the junction of Cartwright Boulevard and Beverley Avenue until 1940. The railroad arrived in 1868. Until 1920 there were fewer than 20 homes in the village.
But by 1925, as prefabricated houses sold by Sears Roebuck began to rise, a public school opened on Massapequa Avenue with five teachers and 100 students. The village incorporated in 1931 and exploded with new residents during the 1950's and 1960's, when most of the village's 6,000 houses were built.
Annual village events include a Harvest Fair, held this year on Sept. 30; a Christmas tree lighting; and a Memorial Day Parade down Park Boulevard, which drew Gov. George E. Pataki among the marchers this year.
Mr. Colfer, the village administrator, who has lived in Massapequa Park since he was 3 years old, said he expected to stay on. "It's gotten a little more crowded, but it's still a great place to live," he said.

CELLULAR FLAGPOLE: Massapequa Park residents blanched last year when the flagpole outside the village hall was replaced by a pole much stouter and taller so it could double as a cellular tower, which brings the village a leasing fee. The village trustees' approval of the 140-foot-high cellular tower camouflaged as a flagpole, which dwarfs the one-story village hall, and plans by the same cellular tower builder to erect a second tower nearby touched off such a furor that the former mayor, Camillo Giannattasio, was unseated by James Altadonna Jr. in village elections in March. Mr. Altadonna campaigned against the towers. But in July, over Mr. Altadonna's protests, the Village Board voted 3 to 2 to settle a $30 million federal lawsuit brought against the village by the tower builder and a cellular service company. Under the settlement, the oversized flagpole will remain, but plans for a second tower were dropped.

HEADLINE: What Did You Do With Your Tax Refund? 

BYLINE:  By HARLAN J. LEVY

 BODY:
REMEMBER the $38 billion Bush tax refund, the $300, $500, and $600 checks that were going to "jump-start the economy?"
 The last of the 10 waves of payments went out at the end of September to little notice following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Of the $38 billion, the United States Treasury sent out an estimated $552 million to 1.27 million Connecticut households: $600 for joint tax filers, $500 for single heads of households, and $300 for single filers. 
 The question economists are asking is whether the terrorist attacks have changed the minds of Connecticut recipients who intended to eventually spend their windfalls.
An informal poll of Connecticut residents conducted before the attacks found most families intended to eventually spend the refund or already had. After Sept. 11, most respondents refused to change their plans and expressed confidence in the economy. 
But not all. 
Some, like Gina Kaplan, 34, a graphic designer married to a video director, with a son, 9, and a daughter, 7, decided to forego renovations to their Tolland home.
"Before all this happened, we were probably going to use it for home repairs and decorating," Ms. Kaplan said. "Now I don't know. I'm afraid to spend money now. We'll probably keep it in savings. We'll do the minimum on our house and put things on hold now, see how our stocks do in the next few months. I'm not losing sleep yet, but I'm concerned for what the near future holds."
Ira Mayo, 36, a lawyer in Waterbury with three young children, is also saving his refund. He received it in the last week of September, and he's putting the $600 check into a college fund.
"I still feel it's my kids' future that's at stake," Mr. Mayo said, "and that's what I have to take care of."
Before Sept. 11, national surveys had indicated that the majority would probably spend the refunds, said Peter Gioia, an economist at the Connecticut Business & Industry Association, "and I think a lot of them will still be spending it." Why? "Because terrorism has curbed some out-of-state and foreign activities, there may be greater use of the money in a local economy rather than a broad national and international economy," Mr. Gioia said.
In a year when consumer spending has been the main bulwark of the faltering economy, the consumer attitude about spending the tax refunds on this year's income taxes is significant, especially in light of the World Trade Center attacks.
"The rebate checks will certainly be an economic stimulus and not a small one either," said Donald Klepper-Smith, chief economist and director of research at New Haven-based Centerprise Advisors. "Now, in times of economic uncertainty, people may very well pay down debt, and my sense here is it might not wind up right away as consumption in Connecticut's economy, but maybe consumption down the road."
Barbara Turi, 40, of Old Saybrook, a benefits manager with the American Cancer Society who has two children, 10 and 7, said she and her husband, a Pfizer scientist, will eventually invest their $600 in the stock market, their plan before and after the terrorist attacks.
"I want to do something to support the stock market," she said after Sept. 11. When will she buy stock? "That's the million-dollar question," she replied. "In six months, I'm hoping."
Meanwhile, national retailers like Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Home Depot, which all ran special programs for cashing refund checks, had some success in Connecticut before the attacks, they all said.
That adds up to a bit of good news, according to the regional economists contacted after the Sept. 11 attacks, who are wary of the current uncertainty.
The refund can't hurt, said Nicholas Perna of Perna Associates, a consulting firm in Ridgefield, and formerly chief economist of Fleet Financial Group.
"It's the old adage about chicken soup," Mr. Perna said. "It can't do any harm, but will it cure your cold? I don't know, but we'll probably see this played out through the end of the year."
If the country makes headway in its fight against terrorism, these economists expected a resumption of spending by consumers.
Susan Glantz of West Hartford, 41, an equipment finance manager, isn't waiting and she and her husband, Stanley, a real estate developer, have already spent their $600 on an armoire.
"We were renovating our house and had been planning for a long time to purchase an armoire," said Ms. Glantz, mother of two sons, 12 and 14. "We were actually given some money towards an armoire as a gift for our upcoming 20th anniversary, and when we threw in the check it made up the difference to the penny."
The Glantzes bought it the same week they got the check. "I didn't waste any time," she said.
Neither did Wendy Macintosh of Hebron, head of Southern New England Telecommunications' External Affairs department, a divorced mother of two daughters, who split her $500 between the two. They spent it on a trip to Disney World with their children.
Others, like Mr. Mayo, are putting their refunds away for college expenses, including Lynn Decker, 45, of Wethersfield, an office manager with a 19-year-old daughter at Quinnipiac University; William Mascetti, a Plainville construction company executive, and Dennis Schain, 49, a bank's public relations chief from Manchester, with a daughter, a high school senior, and a son, 19, a college student.
Janet Nazarian, 39, of Fairfield, formerly in textile sales in Manhattan's garment district, said she plans on spending her $300 refund check on a weekend trip.
"I've just been burned out," she said. "I'm taking a little time off, and if I don't have a job it might be a nice thing to treat myself."
James G. Connolly, 40, of Farmington, chief executive of the state operation of the FleetBoston Financial Corporation, said he would spend his family's $600 refund on his two elementary-school-age sons. "I'll treat my kids to something nice," Mr. Connolly said. "I think it will help be a stimulus to preserve consumer spending and prolong it, particularly as we get into the holiday season."
Peter and Donnie Farrell of Branford, a natural gas marketer and a dental hygienist, both in their late 50's, said they intend to keep their $600. "It's found money, so you might as well just save it," Mr. Farrell said.
That's what Richard Martino, 43, of Brookfield intended to do. "We have mostly 'wants' in our lives these days, not needs, so we're putting the money away," said Mr. Martino, the father of two daughters, 15 and 13, who began working in human resources for the March of Dimes a year ago.
Jesse Hameen II, 60, a jazz band leader in New Haven, said he was buying a new set of tires with his refund check. "I wanted to put it toward something useful," he said.
At Wal-Mart stores and the company's Sam's Club discount warehouses, customers could cash their refund checks for no fee and without having to buy anything. However, Tom Williams, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said, "We continue to see customers spending 25 percent of the check in the stores when it was cashed in the stores, and initial analysis of the checks cashed at Sam's Clubs indicates that in the summer they continued to spend approximately 80 percent of the check when they cashed it in the store."
The categories benefiting most from the refund program, Mr. Williams said, were electronics, led by televisions, computers, video game hardware, DVD players, cameras, prepaid cellular telephones, and camcorders, as well as air conditioners, lawn mowers and bicycles.
"I think people felt it was a convenience, and that was what we wanted," Mr. Williams said.
Home Depot's nationwide rebate-cashing program allowed customers to cash their checks as long as they bought something.
"I can't quantify the impact, but it has been a success, especially so in Connecticut because of the demographics," said John Simley, a spokesman for Home Depot. "It's a high-income state with generally low personal debt, and the size of the refund has been on average higher than in other states. So it's hard to spend $600 on a new car or a cruise, but everyone has $600 worth of something that they'd like to do with their house."
In ads, Home Depot suggested that consumers look at programmable thermostats, compact fluorescent lighting, and energy-efficient appliances, Mr. Simley said. "We've seen increases of 100 to 500 percent in those categories, and it was clear that the tax refund advertising had a significant impact on those sales increases," he said.
Not much changed after Sept. 11, Mr. Simley added. "People did keep coming in just a very shoet time after the terrorist attacks," he said, "and all aspects of the sales patterns were remarkably normal."
However, right after the attacks, Home Depot stopped promoting products in its refund-check advertising and took out ads urging people to contribute refunds to the United Way's disaster relief fund.
Kmart has been offering customers an additional 5 percent of their refunds if they convert their checks into Kmart cash cards.
"We had a lot of people take advantage of it," Stephen Pagnani, a Kmart spokesman, said, "but most chose to do the cashing option. There's a fairly safe assumption that some of the money was spent in the stores, but we had no way of tracking it."
The question is whether all this additional money put into the economy can make a difference between boom or bust?
"Of course not," Mr. Perna of Perna Associates said. "It's only $38 billion in a $10 trillion economy. And is this enough to offset the negative forces that were there before the World Trade Center tragedy, such as rising unemployment and declining consumer confidence? Maybe not, but things would be worse without the rebates."

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF; 
Can the I.M.F. Tame the Capital Beast?

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
IT is impossible to separate the terrorist attacks last month from the subsequent gyrations in the financial markets. But without seeking to minimize the impact of the attacks, it may be worth recalling that the global economy was in trouble before Sept. 11. And even if the United States and its allies prevail in the war against terrorism, the world must still cope with deep-rooted problems created by the enormous amounts of capital that can move instantaneously across borders.
 Since Sept. 11, of course, the debate swirling around globalization -- until then the hot-button issue at every international gathering -- has been muted, overwhelmed by the onslaught on the icons of American financial and military power: the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The suicidal passions that drove those attacks will take months, if not years, to absorb and understand. 
 But as the publication of "The Chastening" (Public Affairs, $30), by Paul Blustein, reminds the reader, this has been a half-decade of financial roller coasters, beginning with the Asian and Russian financial crises of the late 1990's. Entwined with those crises is the questionable behavior of the International Monetary Fund, the guardian of global financial stability for the rich industrialized nations and the subject of Mr. Blustein's book.
Although the book was completed before Sept. 11, it is clear that Mr. Blustein has focused on an important issue that will not change, regardless of how the attacks reshape the way that America and the rest of the world look at each other. That issue is the "global financial architecture" -- one of those weighty phrases beloved by panelists at international monetary conferences.
AS Mr. Blustein, a financial writer at The Washington Post, makes clear in this crisp and fast-paced book, global financial architecture is not a theoretical concept. It relates primarily to the manner in which capital travels from one country to another in amounts and at speeds once unthinkable. When those flows become unmanageable -- as they did in South Korea, Russia and Thailand, for example -- globalization also means contagion: Other economies may soon be infected, an economic version of the cold war political domino theory of Communist advance.
Confronting such financial wildfires, the major Western economies have only one recourse -- the I.M.F. and its army of Ph.D. economists, a dark-suited, briefcase-toting army that for many years has assumed the role of fiscal troubleshooter for errant economies.
But what, Mr. Blustein asks, if the economies are not errant? What if they are merely vulnerable to what he calls, borrowing a phrase from Thomas L. Friedman, the New York Times columnist, "the electronic herd" of mutual funds, pension funds, commercial banks, insurance companies and other professional money managers?
For such institutions, the technology and lowered financial barriers of globalization have brought an unparalleled ability to simply pull the plug on investment in one particular country, leaving it exposed to a national version of an old-fashioned run on the bank.
To see how that affects Western investment and institutions, consider the experience of Long-Term Capital Management, the speculative investment fund that came perilously close to paralyzing the banking system in 1998 and required a bailout because of the huge bets it had placed with borrowed money.
Who puts out the fire then?
"The events of 1997-99 cast disquieting doubt on the I.M.F.'s capacity to maintain financial stability at a time when titanic sums of money are traversing borders, continents and oceans," Mr. Blustein writes.
"The I.M.F. is an institution designed to help countries correct problems in their economic fundamentals, and that was a manageable task when the flows of private capital moving around the world were much smaller than they are now. But the late 1990's brought crises of confidence in markets whose size, speed and propensity for large-scale disruptions have vastly outstripped the fund's resources and ability to keep up."
Mr. Blustein follows this crisis from Asia to Latin America with a storyteller's eye for dialogue and details. "The moon was full, imparting luminosity to the snow coating the Alps as Stanley Fischer left Davos, Switzerland, at 3 a.m. on Feb. 1, 1999," he writes, describing a journey by Mr. Fischer, the just-retired senior I.M.F. official.
That helps leaven a theme that elsewhere turns all too often into a debate as tedious and tinder-dry as the image projected by the men in suits from the I.M.F. themselves. They most certainly will not be heartened by the author's conclusions about their increasing propensity for huge economic bailouts of insolvent countries like Turkey and Argentina.
"We may have the worst of both worlds," Mr. Blustein writes. "On the one hand, the large amounts of money involved in these rescues often fail to achieve the desired aims of calming nerves, halting the withdrawal of capital and helping countries regain their footing when crises erupt. On the other hand, the fact that megabailouts have become such an accepted part of the global financial landscape engenders moral hazard, because some members of the electronic herd, figuring they'll be bailed out regardless of what happens to the countries in question, may invest and lend more recklessly than they would otherwise, setting the stage for future crises."
Of course, these complaints escalate longstanding criticisms of the I.M.F.'s economic prescriptions, particularly those for the ailing economies of Africa and other parts of the developing world. These prescriptions, known as structural adjustment programs, have often required financial austerity that has raised borrowing rates, unemployment and poverty. They have implied not just economic reform but also severe social upheaval, human suffering and political risk for insecure leaders.
PROTESTERS of globalization still level such criticism against the I.M.F. But what concerns Mr. Blustein is the way in which the I.M.F. copes with the more recent question of huge, untrammeled capital flows. In his conclusions, he dismisses some of the more sweeping proposals put forward by scholars and Congressional committees. And he does not rank himself among those who would dismantle the I.M.F. altogether. "Is the world truly prepared to stand by while the dogs of financial contagion run wild?" he asks.
Rather, he seems to come down on the side of new systems to tax short-term investors, to lock them in at times of crisis to the destiny of countries they would rather flee, and even to create an I.M.F.-approved mechanism to establish a form of Chapter 11 protection for nations in trouble.
Ultimately, of course, what Mr. Blustein seems to advocate is a cultural change in the I.M.F. after what he interprets as the chastening experience of the recent megacrises. "The health of the world economy depends, in substantial measure, on how that chastening is translated into action," he writes.

HEADLINE: RESTAURANTS; 
Unfussy French

BYLINE:  By DAVID CORCORAN

DATELINE: MAPLEWOOD 

 BODY:
GREAT name, Verjus. Sometimes spelled verjuice, it refers to the pale, sweet-sour juice from wine grapes that never ripened. This winsome four-and-a-half-month-old French restaurant keeps a couple of jars on display, and Charlie Tutino, the chef and co-owner, uses it to flavor dressings and sauces.
 The other day I asked Mr. Tutino how he and his wife and co-owner, Jane Witkin, had settled on the name. His answer was in keeping with his menu, his cooking and their whole approach to running a restaurant: smart and straightforward, thoughtful and self-deprecating. 
 "We wanted it to stand out," he said of the name. "We weren't going to use another mushroom or another wine, another 'le' or 'la.' Visually it looks nice, especially in upper and lower case. People mispronounce it" -- the pronunciation is vair-ZHUE -- "but that's all right."
This kind of attention to detail is winning Verjus a faithful following in its affluent swath of central Essex County, and the beginnings of a wider audience. It deserves one. 
My first visit was on the Saturday evening after the attacks on New York and Washington. I felt jangled and undone. So did everyone at my table. We weren't even sure we wanted to be at a restaurant. Verjus convinced us that we did.
Visually, it's as pleasing as its name, a plain but not stark off-white space, with comfortably spaced tables and Arts and Crafts chairs. A handsome if underused bar anchors the room. The noise level is low and soothing, with good jazz on the sound system. 
Besides calm, Verjus radiates intelligence. Mr. Tutino, 49, got an economics degree at New York University and worked as an analyst for the Federal Reserve, then changed course in midcareer to work for the famously demanding Jean-Jacques Rachou at La Cote Basque in Manhattan. Before jumping the Hudson, he was executive chef at Capsouto Freres in TriBeCa. He knows what he's doing, and it shows.
The rolls that arrive when you sit down are from Ecce Panis, the standard-setting Manhattan bakery. Nicoise and Moroccan olives, pitted and warmed, sit in a pool of herbed, peppered olive oil. (Sometimes the giveaway is home-cured salmon, or duck-liver terrine.) The wine list is short, unconventional, mostly French and fairly priced, with excellent choices by the glass.
The courses that follow aren't dazzling or spectacular, nor are they meant to be. These are dishes that would have pleased the great British cookbook writer Elizabeth David, who wrote in 1950 that French country cooking, "at its best, is the most delicious in the world; cookery which uses raw materials to the greatest advantage without going to the absurd lengths of the complicated and so-called haute cuisine . . . honest, sincere and simple." Occasional stumbles -- roast chicken that's a bit dry, leg of lamb that arrives overdone and tough -- keep Verjus from a higher rating. But it doesn't miss by much.
Connecticut bluepoint oysters are fat and briny, with a balsamic-vinegar mignonette and a dense, almost chewy tomato-horseradish cocktail sauce. Arugula salad is almost as simple, the fresh, flawless deep-green leaves garnished with goat cheese, roasted tomatoes and a mild vinaigrette. Escargots bourguignon arrive in a ceramic crock with a dozen snails that are firm without being rubbery, in garlic butter given a little zing with anise liqueur.
Carrot-ginger soup is given body not just by the pureed carrots but also by a sturdy meat stock; that's its predominant flavor, along with the ginger and a kick of cayenne. Mr. Tutino cures his own gravlax, using basil and not dill, and the resulting slices of salmon are fragrant and mild. The most complicated appetizer we ordered was a fine vegetarian terrine of roasted eggplant, peppers, goat cheese and smoked mozzarella.
Mr. Tutino makes an excellent case for sweetbreads, braising them to a deep brown and serving them in a powerful Madeira reduction with mushrooms and wild rice. Wild rice makes an ideal foil for the soft, mild chunks of meat. 
If sweetbreads sound too adventurous, you can't go wrong with shell steak crusted with green and black peppercorns and served with cubes of terrific roasted potatoes. Or with Pekin duck, no relation to the kind wrapped in pancakes in fancy Chinese restaurants. This is a breed of Long Island duckling, faintly gamy, roasted and served with braised red cabbage and sweet black rice.
Seafood is unfailingly fresh and well handled. Yellowfin tuna gets a welcome boost from its marinade of ginger, garlic and olive oil, and grilling leaves it smoky outside and purple within. Herb-crusted roast salmon, a big triangle of a fillet, is a little dry but fully flavored, with an ingenious assortment of vegetables, including roasted cauliflower and the briny seaweedlike green called pousse-pied. Five sweet, tender diver scallops are served over two kinds of homemade pasta, plain and tomato, in a suave cream sauce with porcini.
Desserts include a splendid, classic tarte Tatin, the upside-down apple tart, with an inspired counterpoint in creme fraiche ice cream; a variety of fine sorbets; and one of the best current examples of the omnipresent molten-chocolate truffle cake, this one given textural contrast by chopped almonds. I ordered the cheese platter, and if I hadn't been driving home, I'd have taken it with a glass of vintage Port. Intense, salty Roquefort, rich St.-Andre and tangy, creamy Boucheron -- like nearly everything else on this menu, they go beautifully together, leaving you with a powerful desire to linger, keep tasting and return to find out what other pleasures this smart, talented chef can come up with.

HEADLINE: BACKSLASH; 
Hope in a Land of Hyperbole

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
IN early September, many things were about as normal as they could be in Silicon Valley.
 People communicated with their neighbors via e-mail. Public relations firms sent out the usual news releases saying that it was a "crisis" that not everyone had affordable wireless Internet access. And teachers, firefighters and police officers commuted an hour and a half or more each day to towns like Palo Alto, where they could not afford housing, to teach the residents' children, put out fires and ticket improperly parked Saab Turbos. 
 Then came Sept. 11. In its aftermath, this valley, where multitasking and goal orientation might be courses in nursery school, flew its sense of urgency at half-staff.
Deal-making seemed less important. Day trading became something that could wait a day or two. E-mail took a back seat to hugs. Company hype dulled to the point that P.R. representatives had open discourse about responsible representation.
Now some people are viewing this as an opportunity to put longer-lasting change into effect -- a challenging charge for a wealth-focused region where some people have the attention span of an 8-year-old drinking a quart of Mountain Dew at Toys "R" Us.
One issue that is clearly getting a new look is the way companies promote themselves. More than once since the terrorist attacks, a company spokesman has pitched a story with the preface, "Please let me know if this is a bad time." Classy.
But not everyone has locked the hyperbole in the china cabinet. True story: On the day of the attacks, a public relations representative for an investment firm sent a note to a journalist that began: "Unfortunately, today's crisis in D.C. and New York is not the only crisis to hit American families. There is also a HUGE debt crisis in America." The message was leaked to other journalists by a less-than-impressed fellow P.R. person who labeled his forwarded e-mail "Idiot."
Maybe it's time to make it official: The word "crisis" may now be retired from corporate press releases. 
And while we're at it, perhaps we could take the time to change the way we use another word: "revolutionary." Look, a gadget isn't revolutionary if it locates the position of your car on Earth. It would be revolutionary if it located Osama bin Laden, then compiled a legal case against him.
Housing is also receiving renewed interest in Silicon Valley. Some groups have been pushing the valley's affluent towns to change zoning rules, to pave the way for construction of more affordable housing for people who work in the area but can't afford to live there, said Christine Burroughs, executive director of InnVision, a nonprofit agency that operates homeless shelters in the valley.
"This could raise awareness," Ms. Burroughs said, adding that it was important for the keepers of a community's infrastructure to live nearby, "especially when an emergency happens."
It makes sense. If someone decides to dump anthrax into the supply of designer bottled water in the middle of the night, residents might be glad that the fire chief lives next door, not in a more affordable bedroom community -- somewhere outside Las Vegas.
On a related note, Ms. Burroughs's organization will be sending out a plea in the next few weeks for help in caring for a growing homeless population in the area. These newly displaced people are casualties of a once-topless economy that was battered first by a dot-com bust and then by the effects of the terror strikes. Ms. Burroughs said corporations and wealthy individuals, who in her experience often have a "narrow minded" world view focused on wealth creation, should be helping people who might not have been victimized on Sept. 11 but are hurting nonetheless.
"There's been a great outpouring to support the disaster in New York from local corporations," Ms. Burroughs said. "I hope they will continue to support needs in their own community."
ALL that said, the denizens of Silicon Valley point out that this region has many attributes that could help make it part of our national ground zero of the healing process.
For instance, if you see a guy wearing a turban being accosted in Palo Alto, he's probably not the target of bigots or ruffians, but of job seekers. He may well be a vice president at a Fortune 500 company. This is a region, its promoters say, that takes rightful pride in its colorblindness -- hiring and promoting the best people, regardless of ethnic background.
The promoters add that the global reach of technology, not to mention the business of technology, has brought the world together and forged a kind of worldwide economic diplomacy. It can set the stage for creating common interests among nations, making it tough for fanatics to attract potential followers.
In the shorter term, perhaps Silicon Valley could put its incomparable collective intellect, innovation and goal orientation into pursuing a different end: holding onto a newfound perspective.

HEADLINE: Plenty of Drawbacks In Tappan Tunnel Plan 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The article on the Tappan Tunnel concept of Alexander Saunders ("One Man's Vision: The Tappan Tunnel," Sept. 16) did not cover in any comprehensive way the disadvantages of such a project and included some serious errors. 
 For one, "an extensive passenger rail line linking Stewart Airport to Metro-North" is not required, since there is already the Port Jervis line that is only seven miles from the airport. 
Secondly, the West Shore line, a freight line owned by CSX, is in no way being "considered for conversion to a commuter rail." There are those who want passengers to return to this line, but CSX shows no inclination to cooperate. Likewise, Metro-North is more interested in upgrading the Port Jervis line, which has more development possibilities. 
 I don't know any drivers who "just love tunnels," while bridges have inspired poets and writers through the ages. In fact, many people are afraid of tunnels. What Mr. Saunders is proposing is basically a New York subway and underground highway that will be longer than seven miles. 
Then there is the matter of what to do with the existing highway, which is being upgraded. It is the dominant commercial corridor for Westchester County and can hardly be returned to its natural state, as Mr. Saunders suggests, without seriously dislocating Westchester's commercial base.
The future health and economic vitality of the metropolitan region depend on finding a viable solution for the I-287 corridor.

PERSON: Jeffrey F. Rayport 

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
A Web Visionary, Unbowed

BYLINE:  By SUSAN E. REED

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
JEFFREY F. RAYPORT was voted outstanding professor at the Harvard Business School in 1997, 1998 and 1999. At the peak of the Internet boom, dozens of M.B.A. students who took his course in electronic commerce went on to start dot-com businesses, and some became stars. Mr. Rayport even quit teaching two years ago to start his own consulting and information company, called Marketspace, the word he coined at Harvard to describe e-commerce.
 Given the collapse of so many Internet ventures and the cutbacks at his own company -- 40 percent of the staff was dismissed in the summer -- it might be reasonable to expect that Mr. Rayport's exuberance has waned. But his faith in technology's new role in business remains unshaken. 
 "A lot of us here, even in a down market, even with the dot-com meltdown, share a conviction that this technology really is mind-bending, path-breaking and inspiring," Mr. Rayport, 41, said in a recent interview.
Mr. Rayport's enthusiasm developed when he was an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School, where, in 1995, he and a colleague, John Sviokla, were among the first at a major business school to teach a course in e-commerce. 
Called "Managing Marketspace Businesses," the class explored how businesses were substituting television and computer screens for people in communicating with customers.
Timothy P. Brady, now 32 and a senior vice president at Yahoo, was one of the first students to take the course. "I thought it was fantastic," he said. An engineer who previously worked in marketing at Motorola in Japan, Mr. Brady was already well acquainted with the latest technical wizardry. Yet, he said, the professors' approach was unique. "The ideas they were presenting were way ahead of their time," he said. He went on to write Yahoo's original business plan.
At that time, the Internet was still largely the domain of academics and engineers. America Online was already in business, but Amazon.com and eBay were just getting started.
Mr. Rayport, a quick-witted lecturer, engaged his students from the center stage of an amphitheater, his classroom. Students were enthralled by the possibilities of interactivity, and nearly half of each class of second-year students signed up to take the course. 
Mr. Rayport's popularity in the classroom -- he was the first Harvard business professor to win the "outstanding" title for three consecutive years -- may partly reflect his background. He comes from a family of professors. His mother, a psychiatrist, and father, a neurosurgeon, taught for many years at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. His older brother, a neurobiologist, teaches at Columbia's medical school, and his younger sister is an anthropologist. 
Growing up, Mr. Rayport lived in places as diverse as New Rochelle, N.Y., Paris, San Francisco and Perrysburg, Ohio, absorbing a mix of sophistication and humility along the way. As a child, he said, he loved to build model trains but was more interested in constructing a European cityscape next to the tracks. As an adult, he said, he works out compulsively but does not "know a football from a groundhog."
His celebrity status at Harvard, he said, was a mixed blessing. "I was getting eaten alive," he said. "The students were just in a fever state." He spent 30 hours a week in 15-minute appointments talking to students, and each "had a business plan that they thought was going to make them a billionaire and change the world."
"It was out of control," he said. "Nine out of 10 of my students didn't just go into this field, they moved into the Bay Area and went into this field."
To develop his own ideas about e-business without interruption from aspiring tycoons, Mr. Rayport called Mark Fuller, a friend who had already made the leap from academia to business -- he left a professorship at the Harvard Business School to start what is now the Monitor Group, a management consulting firm based here.
In more than a dozen meetings during the summer of 1998, most of them at the Charles Hotel in Harvard Square, the two devised a business plan for a new company, financed by Monitor. Mr. Rayport now had the chance to put his ivory-tower ideas into action.
He conceived Marketspace as a seller of information and analysis about the ways that businesses were using new technologies and the Internet. It featured a cable television program, "The Next Big Thing," shown in Canada and with Mr. Rayport as host; a research wing that produced cases and textbooks; a consulting group; and an online magazine called tnbt.com.
It was a modern information production line. Mr. Rayport attended Internet conferences where he taped interviews with industry leaders. The video made its way into the television program. The interviews were used for research, case studies and book writing. Audio and video clips from the interviews were featured on tnbt.com -- whose own writers and editors were compiling other e-business stories. Consulting was supposed to support the Web site, which "would provide rich media intelligence for people who are trying to use our ideas," Mr. Rayport said.
Theory did not meet practice. Because of the way the Web site had been designed, search engines missed ideas that were presented on it. Seekers of information about e-business who did not know Mr. Rayport or the site name could not find them. "It's called hiring the wrong technology vendor to build the first site," he said. He hired another company to improve it.
Working with Internet businesses proved a challenge for him. Many were unpredictable at best, and at worst they were unreliable. NAME, an Internet professional services firm, was a co-sponsor of his cable program in Canada last year. But it was acquired by another company, itemus Inc., which encountered financial difficulties and could not continue the sponsorship. (Itemus recently filed for bankruptcy.) As a result, Mr. Rayport lost an important way to cement his reputation as a leading thinker on the new economy. 
As the economy slowed and the consulting business softened, Marketspace scrapped a plan to go public and went through layoffs. With Mr. Fuller's help, Mr. Rayport narrowed the company's focus to serving consulting clients and business school faculties. Marketspace "went through its fair share of teething, but it's coming back," Mr. Fuller said.
Last month, Marketspace had another setback. Waleed Iskandar, who had led its office in London, was aboard the American Airlines plane that hijackers crashed into the World Trade Center. Mr. Iskandar, 34, who earned a master's degree from the Harvard Business School in 1993, was engaged to Nicolette Cavaleros, director of marketing at Marketspace.
Coping with these personal tragedies made it even harder to stay focused on the future, Mr. Rayport said one recent morning as he walked through Harvard Square to a memorial service for Mr. Iskandar at St. Paul Church. "It's been the most difficult year of my life -- emotionally, intellectually, physically -- to head a leadership team to keep this organization going forward," he said. "If I ever went back to a business school, I'd know what I was talking about. This is the real thing."

HEADLINE: Like It? I Did It Myself, Darling 

BYLINE:  By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
RUNNING the length of the wall above Alexa Hampton's sofa is a large gilt frame surrounding an empty canvas. When she is not scouting out fabrics or decorating the houses of New York's young upper crust, Ms. Hampton, a daughter of the legendary decorator Mark Hampton, plans to fill that provocative void with an image from the Parthenon -- one that she will paint herself.
 Already flanking her frame are a pair of smaller canvases she painted in homage to the Florentine interiors of Donatello. They are keyed to the sienna and ocher tones of her Upper East Side apartment. "No project could have been more satisfying," Ms. Hampton said. "I'm controlling the subject matter; I'm controlling the palette, and, you may notice, that palette matches my furniture. Painting these pictures," she added, "is about getting what I need." 
 In a shaky economy, Ms. Hampton's rarefied approach to do-it-yourself chic is finding adherents in unlikely quarters. Today it is not uncommon to find well-heeled young matrons, diamond-freighted dowagers and Hollywood divas who have belatedly discovered the pleasures of domesticity. Style-conscious plutocrats are running up French seams, embroidering footstools, painting highlights in their own hair and sometimes even banishing the caterer to fete their guests themselves. 
Of course, it was Martha Stewart who rekindled many Americans' interest in rituals of the hearth. She has had a profound impact on a generation of middle-class women who left careers to micromanage their households. But now the quest for self-expression through pinked seams and grouted tiles has trickled up to the gilded set. 
"We've gone way beyond Martha now, in a totally upscale direction," said Marian McEvoy, who as editor of House Beautiful, a high-end shelter magazine, is a self-appointed emissary to the upper crust. 
Seeking to explain the eagerness of the well-to-do to join the loving-hands-at-home movement, David E. Monn, a New Yorker who writes about home entertaining, used a familiar metaphor. "Very much people want to say, 'I'm in the kitchen now,' " he observed. "That means they want to ground themselves, to proclaim a sense of ownership, to take charge of their lives in any way they can."
Faith Popcorn, the consumer trends oracle, said that, "In the aftermath of 9/11, people want to feel resourceful."
This may be particularly true, she added, of "people who think they can't do anything real -- who are completely baffled if their clothes dryer doesn't work and who don't even think to check that it's plugged in."
"This is not about saving money," Ms. Popcorn said. "For people, especially those who have been used to having things done for them, it's about being in control of your situation." 
None of which is news to Ms. McEvoy, who sees as her mission the lifting of the Martha Stewart vision to an exalted plane. But Ms. McEvoy, who has spent months decorating the shell-pink walls of her country house with large pressed leaves that she scavenged from some nearby brush, concedes that "sometimes I feel like Marie Antoinette-goes-hunting-for-pine cones." 
A few socialites and celebrities have taken to flaunting achievements that in other times would have marked them as dowdy. Taking a cue, perhaps, from Marlene Dietrich, who famously baked birthday cakes for her celebrated friends, Julia Roberts announces in print that she cleans her own house, cooks and knits. Nicole Kidman describes blending her own fragrance from a private stash of essential oils. And Carolyne Roehm, the fashion designer who reinvented herself as a decorating maven, has turned her hand to pine-cone chandeliers. 
Ms. McEvoy recently assigned Ms. Roehm to write a monthly column in House Beautiful. Let Martha tell her readers how to make a fetching slipcover; Ms. Roehm gives do-it-yourself chic a distinct patrician spin, urging subscribers to do what the high-end decorators do: collect fabric swatches to pin on storyboards that would put Billy Baldwin to shame.
Ms. Roehm says the amateur movement stems at least in part from the desire of a nervous monied class to live a simpler, more authentic life. "I think when you are challenged and threatened, you tend to pull in, do your nest and stay at home," she said. "To some degree this trend is also about taking time for yourself, and reclaiming your creativity." 
A hybrid of amateurism and its close cousin, customization, do-it-yourself's new upmarket status has spawned its own mini-marketing trend. Among its chief proponents is the British perfumer Jo Malone. In her stores and in her literature, Ms. Malone encourages customers to blend their own scents, adapting formulas from the company's elaborate fragrance charts. 
"Creating a perfume gives people charge and a sense of connoisseurship," Ms. Malone said. "It allows the individual a chance to be an artist, but in a very controlled way." Her upscale American customers have responded eagerly, queuing up for a chance to play chemist at Ms. Malone's shop in Bergdorf Goodman and at her new Manhattan flagship on Park Avenue South.
In the world of high-end fashion, the Japanese designer Issey Miyake has entered the field with A Piece Of Cloth (known by its acronym A-POC), a collection of men's and women's clothing designed to be altered by the wearer at home. The line will be in Mr. Miyake's new TriBeCa store late this month. 
Publications that cater to the affluent hip are infused with the new upscale can-do spirit. In its current issue, Jalouse, a style primer for the fashion vanguard, follows a feature on Jennifer Lopez's showgirl hair with a spread that tells readers how to achieve J-Lo's highlights at home. Spruce, the fashion spinoff of Wallpaper, the strenuously trendy design magazine, has taken a similar tack, providing sewing patterns for trousers, a skirt and a cap in its premier issue in September.
Home sewing and the needle arts are thriving in these jittery times. As Susan Brandt, director of communications at the Hobby Industry Association, said in an interview on Wednesday: "We are an industry people go to in times of trouble. They take solace in staying busy and doing things with their hands."
Alluding to the collapse of the dot-com economy, Lauren Goodman writes in the November Jalouse, "If technology won't take care of me, I'm going straight to the hearth of the domestic arts to nurture myself into a more fecund new age." Ms. Goodman implies in the article that she plans to take up knitting. 
A visitor to the Web site of a Manhattan sewing school, Sew Fast Sew Easy, confided late last month that needlework had helped her cope since the World Trade Center attack. The woman, identified only as Vanessa, said, "After making myself sew this week (I made two skirts), I felt so much better and find the pain easier to deal with." 
Elissa K. Meyrich, who runs Sew Fast Sew Easy's classes, said her students, many who can well afford Gucci or Prada, had taken up sewing to mend frayed nerves -- and more than that, to maintain a sense of connectedness with past and future generations.
"In the wake of 9/11," Ms. Meyrich said, "people are beginning to re-examine themselves. They are reassessing what is important to them, what was important to their grandparents, and which traditions they are going to bring forward to the next generation. "After all," she pointed out, "what are you going to pass down to your daughter? A cell phone?"
Needlepoint, too, has been exceptionally popular. Erica Wilson, the English-born doyenne of American needle crafts, noted that classes in her Nantucket and Madison Avenue stores have not been so crowded since the mid-1980's.
"To my amazement, since Sept. 11, we've been busy," Ms. Wilson said. "Creativity is something people find relaxing." She added that she had noticed a surge of interest in needlepoint among her more affluent clients. "They know that needlepoint is the hobby of queens and their ladies in waiting," she said with a chuckle, "and the ladies in waiting are doing it again."

HEADLINE: Voices of the Past: We've Been There, Done That 

BYLINE:  By ALEX WITCHEL

 BODY:
CHRISTOPHER HAYES, 48, the chairman of the graduate program in gerontology at Long Island University, knows the pitfalls of being older in a youth-obsessed society. But the other day he saw a shift at his own dinner table.
 "My 80-year-old father was in Hawaii when Pearl Harbor was attacked," Mr. Hayes said, "and for the first time my 14-year-old son asked his grandfather what his World War II experiences were. My father's eyes just illuminated. There were two incredible hours of interchange that was very powerful." 
 While it's hard to make sweeping generalizations about anything lately, some people seem to have realized that even though Grandma and Grandpa still haven't figured out the VCR, they may know something more important. For decades, youth has proclaimed its superiority, from the counterculture of the 1960's that trusted no one over 30 to the 1990's children of the Internet who scorned their elders for not embracing the brave new world of technology. But since Sept. 11, the elderly -- especially those who lived through the last attack on American shores and the years of insecurity and privation that followed -- have emerged as sources of reassurance and even wisdom for younger generations. 
In a week in which the United States sent warplanes on combat missions and the F.B.I. warned of new terrorist attacks, newspapers have been filled with references to December 1941 and its aftermath. Over the phone and around dinner tables, Americans who grew up cosseted and safe have been quizzing their elders about their World War II experiences. Perhaps some of the most affecting moments are occurring for those adults who in years past constituted the younger half of the generation gap.
"Already, what we're finding in focus groups is that for baby boomers in particular, this event is creating a much greater bridge of intergenerational communication and understanding," Mr. Hayes said. "And that will provide a foundation for how to navigate socially and economically the conflicts of being at war."
Betsy Carter, editor of My Generation, an AARP magazine for boomers, agreed. "Everything boomers have used to get by, humor or arrogance, doesn't work now," she said. "We're as defenseless as everyone else. We have no great wisdom. We never witnessed World War II or the Great Depression or even Vietnam, unless you were there. We've only seen stuff on television. What I keep hearing is that people our age are getting comfort hearing from their parents about Hitler's Germany or World War II and how they lived through it."
It's not just boomers who are seeking out the elderly. Younger Americans of all ages are looking to them for perspective and a sense that the country will pull through. Matthew Reeves, a 14-year-old high school freshman in Atlanta, recalled a recent talk with his grandfather James Gaunt of Chattanooga, Tenn., who was in Army intelligence after Pearl Harbor.
"It makes you feel better to know things could be worse, like concentration camps," Matthew said. "Something bad happened, but people got together, they fought and had tin drives and rubber drives and they got through it."
Veterans of the home front also have insights. June Bingham, an 82-year-old playwright from Riverdale, the Bronx, recently wrote a letter to the editor of The Times about the attacks on New York that included this passage: "Because we elders, in a sense, have been there, done that, we turned out to retain inner muscles that enabled us to stay calm, go about our business, make no unnecessary phone calls or trips.
"We were also able to rejoice at seeing formerly self-encapsulated young people experience, perhaps for the first time, that curl of satisfaction that derives from knowing oneself to be part of something far greater than oneself, namely the need, yet again, to protect our city, our nation and the free world."
Ms. Bingham, who has 10 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren, said in a telephone interview: "After Sept. 11, the kids were in a state of nerves. I told them that the first time around it was all very unpleasant, with food rationing and not driving. Now we're being told to go to the theater and restaurants. So it's sheer heaven when your public duties turn out to be your pleasures."
That kind of advice seems much more grounded than the nostalgia of the 1990's that romanticized the so-called Greatest Generation -- you've seen the movies, now read the books -- and was something of a self-indulgent luxury in a fat and happy America.
Now, the horror of thousands of new casualties has overnight turned World War II veterans from gauzy cinematic close-ups into real people, though perhaps not as magical as Hollywood might have liked.
"At one level nobody is really prepared for the impact of this, even the World War II generation," said Alan Brinkley, 52, the Allan Nevins professor of history at Columbia University. "The difficult part of this is not knowing how or if the world will change. There was uncertainty at the time of Pearl Harbor, but there was great certainty about what needed to be done. So the idea that previous generations have real answers is probably a myth.
"Maybe what we see in the older generation is not so much experience to prepare themselves, but a legacy of engagement in a public cause that we've never pondered before."
Wayne Martin, an 80-year-old veteran of World War II and a retired police officer, was asked by a 12-year-old grandson, Philip, to speak at his school. "The question now is not what was Pearl Harbor, but what was it like," Mr. Martin said from his home in Federal Heights, Colo., a Denver suburb. "Throughout the time you are talking to them, you can feel them changing with more understanding about what took place."
Mr. Martin was stationed at Pearl Harbor during the attack. "I was on the second floor of our barracks on Dec. 7," he said, "and some of those thoughts came back, like: 'How do I find cover? How do I get out of this mess?' Those folks in New York had no idea where to go, what to do. We knew what it was to be defenseless."
Getting those wartime experiences down on paper is something Jan Bell, 50, has been trying to persuade her father, David J. Bell, 80, to do for years. After Sept. 11, Ms. Bell, who took over her father's insurance agency after he retired, finally prevailed. Mr. Bell was a cryptographer in the South Pacific from 1943 to 1945, encoding and decoding messages. He learned about Pearl Harbor at home in Nashville, while listening to the radio and waiting for his mother to finish making Sunday dinner.
"The kind of shock we had when the Japanese attacked is exactly the kind we had with the twin towers," he said from his home outside Atlanta. "But the worst part about what's happening now is that you cannot find the enemy. It's like finding rats in a hole. The thing that helps is to see the country finally united, which we have not been since World War II."
Ms. Bell said: "After Sept. 11, I really understood for the first time what my parents felt when they heard Pearl Harbor had been attacked. I think now, my generation will appreciate more of what they went through. We have a strong common bond now."
Not all people, however, are comforted by their elders' experience. Joanna Dreifus, 28, was on the phone with her 86-year-old grandmother when the first tower was attacked.
"She said, 'I've never seen anything like this,' " Ms. Dreifus recalled. "Then she said, 'I bet the second one is going to fall down too.' That didn't surprise me because my grandparents were German refugees, so my family always thinks something terrible is going to happen."
Later that morning, Ms. Dreifus's father, who works in Midtown, and her new boyfriend, who lives in NoLIta, both walked to her apartment on the Upper East Side, where they met for the first time. They hit it off, which was a relief, Ms. Dreifus said, although her recent conversations with her grandmother have not been.
"I asked her if she had any words of wisdom from this," she recalled, "and all she said was: 'For me it doesn't matter, but you're 28 -- you have your whole life ahead of you. It isn't fair.' Well that got me more scared. She keeps listening to the TV, all the stuff about anthrax and her imagination is running away with her. Finally I said 'Grandma, I don't think they're going to bomb an assisted-living facility in New Jersey.' "
Maybe it's just different with people of Ms. Dreifus's generation, those in their 20's and 30's who, by dint of the tech boom of the 90's, thought they had recreated the world and didn't need the benefit of their elders' perspective. But with the dot-com revolution's recent demise, fueled by a sinking economy, some of those Gen Xers seem to be recognizing the value of older adults' experience, especially in the last month.
Steven Johnson, 33, a co-founder of Feed, the defunct Internet magazine, and the author most recently of "Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities and Software" (Scribner), had a bigger epiphany than most: Sept. 11 was the day he and his wife took their newborn son home from the hospital.
"My dad was around for World War II, and he's always had a sensibility from his dad that it can all go to hell, however good it's looking," Mr. Johnson said. "But I had been living with the impression that these events don't happen anymore. The big historical events that happened since I went to college, with the exception of the Berlin Wall falling, have been technological developments, the Web.
"Then on the 11th we got home to our apartment in the village and I thought: 'My God, I have a family now. I need to safeguard it and keep it together.' I have no job anymore, just a book and a baby, and I thought that was all I needed to think about. And suddenly it was, 'I just want to make sure I can be with these two people and keep them safe.' "
Another Internet pioneer, Stephan Paternot, 27, a co-founder of theglobe.com, which folded in August, says he finds himself on the phone to his parents much more than usual.
"They live in Switzerland," he said from his home in the East Village. "I find that it just makes me feel better. After it happened, my dad and stepmom flew in, and we went down to ground zero to take a look. It gave them a better sense of what I'm going through. And my mom and stepdad and I are giving each other updates all the time.'
Like Mr. Johnson, Mr. Paternot is now busy trying to promote his new book, "A Very Public Offering" (John Wiley & Sons), an autobiography. In between, he relies on his family to provide a context for current events.
"My grandfather lived through the Nazi invasion in France," he said. "He and my grandmother were with my father on Sept. 11 and I spoke to them all. My grandmother was so strong and supportive. I could tell she understood what was happening; she had been through a world war. But none of them seemed completely out of their wits. Their attitude was: It has happened before. It will happen again. We just pray for the best."

Charities Ponder Tactics In a Post-Attack World

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL

 BODY:
Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, has watched charitable donations with deep concern since the Sept. 11 attack. Her organization, she fears, may lose up to a million dollars by year's end.
 "It's a disaster," Ms. Brooks Hopkins said, "and it's getting worse." 
 Three problems are converging on New York nonprofit agencies that are not receiving funds for disaster relief: a faltering economy, the diversion of charity money to the relief efforts and, in many cases, a demand for services that is ever-growing.
All this raises an uncomfortable question for fund-raisers: Should they mention their connections with the World Trade Center recovery efforts, or would that be callous?
The Brooklyn Academy of Music has decided to affiliate itself with the city's recovery, albeit delicately. "We hope you will agree that now more than ever we can turn to the arts to enlighten, educate and even heal us," one fund-raising letter reads.
Some groups are more direct; others shy away completely.
"These are case-by-case decisions," said Jon Small, president of the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York, an umbrella group. "No one wants to be suggesting disaster relief is not crucial, yet these organizations need funds."
Matters are especially difficult for social service agencies, whose resources have been deeply stretched. 
For example, the New York City Mission Society provides services to Harlem and Bronx residents who need trauma counseling, financial guidance or simply a free cultural event to attend for relaxation.
When Stephanie Palmer, its executive director, goes fund-raising, she brings up her group's role in the relief effort "every opportunity I get."
"I think what we're suffering from is the public not understanding the connection," Ms. Palmer said of the fact that many local charities like hers are helping people whose problems stem either directly or indirectly from the trade center attacks.
By contrast, the city chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society has completely avoided disaster relief in its appeals. A model fund-raising letter that was given to participants in a recent bike tour praises American generosity and remind donors that 200 people a week receive a diagnosis of the disease.
"That fact was true on September 10, on September 11 and on September 12," the letter reads.
What the letter does not mention is that after Sept. 11, the group provided emergency services for several dozen New Yorkers suffering from multiple sclerosis who live below 14th Street. 
"I don't think we can in any way position ourselves as a relief agency," said Carol M. Kurzig, the chapter's executive director. "I think that would offend people."
Richard Burns, executive director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center in the West Village, said, "It is a balancing act." 
"We have to be careful to talk about Sept. 11 in an appropriate context and not cheapen the strong feelings about the tragedy," he added. "I don't think any of us should be using American flags to sell groceries." SETH KUGEL

A Weekof Higher Rates Doesn't Kill a Bond Rally

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
INTEREST RATES crept higher last week. But that does not mean that the Treasury rally, which drove longer-term yields down a percentage point in four months, is over.
 In fact, rates are likely to decline further, though lower rates may not provide much help to the slumping economy if home buying and home construction sputter because of the terrorist attacks. 
 As stocks rebounded last week, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite bouncing back to their levels on Sept. 10, fewer investors sought the safe harbor of the Treasury market. That pushed short-term yields higher. The threatened return of budget deficits as the Bush administration and Congress prepare $100 billion in stimulus packages lifted longer-term yields. 
But interest rates are still low, and a hiccup should not signal a new trend. The yield on the Treasury's two-year notes, 2.78 percent, is just above its lowest since the government began issuing them in the 1970's. The yield on the 10-year note is close to its 1998 low, when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in the wake of the Russian default and the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management. Both yields are still well below their levels before Sept. 11.
And the Fed will cut again if needed, even though it has already reduced its short-term interest rate to 2.5 percent, a 39-year low.
But the revival of the economy also depends on longer-term interest rates, because they set borrowing costs for many businesses and for the housing sector. Policy makers and economists have worried that these rates, in the Treasury and the corporate markets, have not fallen enough.
One reasonably trusty barometer of these rates is pointing down. This tool is the historical relationship between the manufacturing index of the National Association of Purchasing Management and the Treasury's 10-year note, adjusted for inflation.
The manufacturing index, which has begun to decline again, is a good proxy for global economic performance, and Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, contends that an economic slowdown worldwide will pull down interest rates into early next year. He is not worried about the effect on the Treasury market of government budget deficits. "Large increases in government spending are the rule in recessions," he said, "and declines in interest rates are the rule in recessions."
He also says the stock and bond markets can rally simultaneously for a while. In past recessions, interest rates have continued to decline even while an increase in stock prices was predicting an economic recovery months in advance. Consider the last recession: stocks began to rally in October 1990, and the recession was over in March 1991. At the same time, the 10-year yield began a decline that lasted into February 1991, reversed some and then began another descent in July.
John Youngdahl, an economist at Goldman Sachs, also says the shift from surplus to deficit should not have a big impact on bonds. He predicts a $25 billion deficit in the 2002 fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, and a $30 billion surplus in 2003.
The return of the deficit, he said, will make the government a net borrower for the first time in almost five years. But the new borrowing will not add all that much to the new issuance of longer-term notes and bonds. Most of the increased sales will come in Treasury bills. The monthly sale of two-year notes could jump to as high as $21 billion next year from the $10 billion of May.
But Mr. Youngdahl is worried about housing. Despite the lowest 30-year rate on Freddie Mac mortgages in three years and the lowest one-year adjustable rate in nearly six years, there are signs that the housing market is slowing. Since the attack, the 30-year rate is down more than a quarter-point, to 6.58 percent, and the adjustable rate is off one-third of a point, to 5.26 percent.
The impact of Sept. 11 is not yet clear for housing, but if the sector continues to slow, even with lower interest rates, it will be harder for the Fed to get the economy back into gear.

How to Hatch a Foundation Without a Gold Nest Egg

BYLINE:  By KARL SCHOENBERGER

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif. 

 BODY:
DESPITE the rocky economy and the volatile stock market, interest in starting private charitable foundations remains remarkably strong.
 One good indication of that came last week here in the heart of Silicon Valley, long regarded as an incubator for start-up businesses. The region officially became home to the Foundation Incubator, an organization for fledgling philanthropists. The incubator -- housed in an 11,000-square-foot space and billed as the first of its kind -- provides guidance from established foundations on how to disburse wealth. 
 Setting up a private foundation remains a dream for many families and business owners alike -- they have worked hard, achieved financial success and now want to establish a legacy of giving something back to others. And in the aftermath of Sept. 11, more people may be expanding their philanthropic goals.
There are more than 55,000 active foundations in the United States, up from 40,000 in 1995, according to the Foundation Center in New York. They contribute a total of $24.5 billion to various causes, double the amount six years ago. About 5,000 private foundations were created nationwide last year alone, compared with 4,600 in 1999, according to the Association of Small Foundations, based in Bethesda, Md.
To establish a foundation, you need not have the wealth of a John D. Rockefeller or a Bill Gates. Many foundations are created through the estates of ordinary people. "The vast majority of foundations in this country are under $10 million in assets," said Charles Scott, executive director of the Association of Small Foundations. He added that 14 percent were under $500,000, and that half of those were under $100,000.
But getting started is not all that easy, which is why organizations like the Foundation Incubator can be useful. Among the many issues are these: What charities and causes should the foundation help? How much money should be put into the foundation? What are the tax ramifications? 
"The very first place to start is with a personal vision of how the world could be better," said Barbara Kibbe, director of the Organizational Effectiveness and Philanthropy program at the Packard Foundation of Los Altos, Calif. "You need a vision to find a pathway to your own philanthropy." The Packard Foundation is among the incubator's 20 backers; they also include the AOL Time Warner Foundation and the Kellogg Foundation.
Ms. Kibbe and other experts said it would be a mistake to approach a foundation as if it were a company. "Don't insist on developing something unique or competitive; that doesn't work as well in philanthropy as it does in business," she said. "The real intractable human problems have been with us for a long time, and will continue to be so. Look for people who are working on that problem you care about."
The incubator, whose Web site is www.foundationincubator.org, plans to assist as many as 20 fledgling foundations at a time. It is now host to seven, each with an asset base in the millions of dollars, by providing shared sites and mentoring. Member foundations are expected to spend six months to three years in residence at the incubator, learning the essentials of philanthropy. Members pay rent for their space.
Catherine Muther, who founded the Three Guineas Fund, a San Francisco foundation that helps women and girls enter technology careers, is one of the incubator's founders and mentors. Ms. Muther, a former marketing executive at Cisco Systems, started her foundation in 1994 with an initial investment of $2 million after cashing in stock options. 
She said the incubator should have no problem reaching its capacity of foundations. "Lots and lots of people are starting new foundations -- many of them are my friends," she said. "I keep hearing stories of people meeting each other over lunch at nice restaurants and saying, 'Gee, now what do I do?' " She said she hoped the incubator would lead to others around the country.
For people looking to establish foundations, perhaps on a far smaller scale than those at the incubator, there are many other sources of help. The Association of Small Foundations (www.smallfoundations.org), for example, is planning to have a "Foundation in a Box Resource Kit" ready by next spring. It will provide a wide range of material, including information on legal documentation.
Mr. Scott of the association said aspiring philanthropists must first fill out tax forms to apply for foundation status. That includes providing information about goals and budgets. He recommends hiring a lawyer for this work.
Then, Mr. Scott says, the benefactors need to decide how to manage the fund's endowment and subsequent earnings. The foundation's officers can handle the investments themselves, but they might be better off hiring a money manager. (The earnings within a foundation are not subject to taxes because a foundation is considered a not-for-profit corporation, which qualifies it as a tax-exempt charity under the Internal Revenue Code.) 
"To maintain that foundation status you have to do certain things, and one of those things is to give away at least 5 percent of the value of the assets every year to public charities," he said.
Money managers generally charge a fee of 1 percent to 2 percent of the foundation's assets. About 70 percent of the members of Mr. Scott's organization hire outside money managers.
While interest in charitable giving has been spurred in the aftermath of Sept. 11, although largely to the disaster relief efforts, organizers of the foundation incubator say it was pure coincidence that the opening of their organization was scheduled for last Thursday, one month after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
But the symbolism was not lost on the incubator's first residents. The organization is planning a symposium entitled "Philanthropy in the Aftermath of Sept. 11" for later this month, according to Elizabeth Bremner, its executive director. And three of the incubator's resident foundations have already decided to work together in financing a team of medical volunteers to aid Afghan refugees streaming toward the Pakistani border. 
That project, the Mobile Health Clinic, is an example of how fledgling foundations can collaborate in an incubator setting and accomplish things they might not try on their own, said Steve Toben, director of the Flora Family Foundation, an incubator member. His group is a spinoff of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation that is endowed by the assets of the second and third generations of the family of Mr. Hewlett, a founder of the Hewlett-Packard Company.
Another incubator partner in the Afghan refugee project is the Global Catalyst Foundation, which has sent a program manager to Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, to work with the recipient, Relief International, based in Los Angeles.
Mr. Scott said he did not think the terror attacks would lead to a sharp increase in the number of foundations. But, he added: "The world is now consciously aware of those who are in need. My sense is that Americans are very generous people and establishing a foundation is just one of the ways of expressing that generosity."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Government Spending Is Back. But for What?

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
AMERICAN companies had Western Europe frightened. They were overrunning the Continent, displacing native enterprise. Anger swelled at American imperialism. But a French journalist, J. J. Servan-Schreiber, had a different explanation. 
 In passionate prose, full of respect for the United States, he argued in "The American Challenge," a best seller in 1968, that America's success reflected a bold, innovative corporate sector combined with generous government spending. The two reinforced each other, generating expansion and prosperity. "This takes us a long way from the old image of the United States -- a country where business was not only separate from government but constantly struggling with it," Mr. Servan-Schreiber wrote. 
 America is mounting another challenge, this time declaring war against terrorism, and hastily resurrecting federal spending, which had fallen into disrepute. As in the 1960's, federal spending now seems important for the nation's success. Gone or suppressed is the "old image," that government is by nature inefficient and should be shrunk to accommodate a private sector insistent on functioning unencumbered.
Reacting almost overnight to the war and the incipient recession, Washington is stepping up spending for the military and for security at home. It is providing billions for repairs in Lower Manhattan and to bail out the airlines. Two proposals would extend unemployment benefits and subsidize health insurance premiums for workers who are laid off. But once the crises subside, will government spending go back out of style?
So far, the answer from Washington is yes. Fighting terrorism and recession is likely to increase federal spending by $60 billion to $80 billion in coming months. The emphasis is on the short term, to deal with war and recession, not on the public sector's long-term needs. Even Democrats in Congress who want to enhance government's role in the economy do not talk publicly about doing so.
Some still hold to a view that was popular in the Clinton administration, that balanced budgets and fiscal restraint are better for the economy than repairing deteriorated infrastructure. Other Democrats are afraid of being called big spenders, "The ghost of health care '94 and the larger specter of spending before that seem to haunt them," said Robert B. Reich, President Clinton's first secretary of labor. He is one of the few Democrats to argue that federal spending, properly done, will pay for itself in rising economic growth.
Change is likely to come only if the public insists on more public spending -- insisting in effect that the government can make better use of the money than individuals getting cash back in tax cuts and rebates, the Republican preference. And perhaps the public will insist. The new pride in America may make people want to spruce up their national surroundings, just as merchants who share a street want government to repair the sidewalk to make the neighborhood more appealing to shoppers. 
THE most immediate target of the public's insistence could easily be intercity rapid transit systems, as an alternative to airline stress. Frequent, high-speed trains -- traveling 150 miles an hour -- might even shorten the travel time, say, from New York to Washington or Boston. "We starved our railroads to get them to be self-supporting; that was ridiculous," said Alicia Munnell, a Boston College economist who served in the Clinton administration. 
Then there is school repair, disease prevention in an era of biological warfare and high-quality child care. Government would have to subsidize these projects because the private sector has not found them profitable -- although John B. Taylor, an economic adviser to President Bush, insists that these public needs offer "a huge opportunity for the private sector, for young people beginning careers to rise to the challenge."
Given the antipathy in Washington to public spending, the federal government over the years has shifted to state and local governments the responsibility for maintaining roads, bridges, sewers, airports and the like. By 1999, spending by state and local governments had reached an amount equal to 62 percent of all federal outlays, up from 54 percent in 1990 and 42 percent in 1960, according to James Hines, a University of Michigan economist. Now, with tax revenue falling in a weak economy, states and cities are cutting back. Mr. Hines and others would have Washington step in with federal subsidies to sustain the projects.
There are so many options, and that in itself is a problem. Without a broad public consensus on priorities, stepped-up public spending will degenerate into wasteful, unfocused pork, Mr. Reich says. Consensus on priorities existed in the 1960's. Mr. Servan-Schreiber described it and called on Western Europe to field a consensus of its own. Now it is our turn again.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Beware Calling A Bottom Too Soon

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
FOR a moment last week, it seemed that investor confidence, so crippled by the terrorist attacks and so crucial for the nation's economic well-being, was in the ascendancy again. One month to the day after the September calamities, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite had returned to their pre-attack levels. 
 The rebounds were more than a ray of sunshine after weeks of gloom. Some investors also viewed the big bounce by stocks off their Sept. 21 lows as evidence that the recession we have entered will be over almost before it began. After all, everybody knows that the stock market rallies well before the economy does. Might not this powerful climb -- 13 percent in three weeks on the S.& P. 500 -- represent the turn? 
 It certainly could. Stocks started falling in the spring of 2000, and the time since is a good bit longer than most bear markets last. Since World War II, for example, the median duration of a bear market in the Dow Jones industrial average has been 11.6 months.
In addition, there is no doubt that government spending and the gung-ho interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve will bolster the economy at some point. 
But investors looking for the turn in stocks can be easily burned. That danger is especially acute now. 
Although stock prices have recovered, the fact is that Wall Street has not. Many traders and investors, sales forces and portfolio managers -- the crew that makes the market go -- are still wounded by what happened. Participants who would normally be hellbent on identifying the next trade are distracted, passive, pulling back.
On the fixed-income trading desk at a major bank in New York, a managing director reported that his customers were doing half the volume that they had done before Sept. 11. And traders at brokerage firms everywhere are slashing their securities positions. 
"The price of poker has gone way up because the risks are immeasurable," one bond trader explained. "You don't want to put on trades waiting for the next attack and you can't put on trades thinking the worst is over because if you're wrong it costs too much. So you do trades much smaller or not at all." 
Although stock trading has been heavy in recent weeks, one hedge fund manager explained that much of the action appeared to be reaction. "There has been a fair amount of program trading related to asset allocations," the manager said. "It's been a long time since we've had a one-hundred-basis-point cut in the Fed funds rate in a month and, at the same time, the stock market dropped 10 percent. So everybody's asset allocation got really messed up." 
With many market players on the sidelines, acting only when they have to, the market is more like a mirage. And it is extremely vulnerable to emotions. As a result, the market's ability to sense the coming economic recovery may be more dubious than usual.
"I think this is a rally to watch, but I don't think it's a rally to be bought," said Liz Miller, portfolio manager at Trevor Stewart Burton & Jacobsen in New York. "Even though the market tends to rally ahead of the end of a recession, what sparks that rally is corporations giving some view that they can foresee what their business trends look like. I have yet to hear the bellwether company saying there is a visible trend."
And with consumers cutting back on spending, an economic recovery will have to include renewed corporate spending. Yet economists at Goldman, Sachs estimate that if a credit cutback forces companies to finance their investment with internally generated funds -- as has happened in virtually every recession since 1950 -- capital spending could fall another 30 percent. 
"Investors clearly want excuses to buy," Ms. Miller said. "But there's going to be plenty of time to participate in a recovery."

HEADLINE: Round Table:The New Challenges for Wall Street 

 BODY:
 LAST week, five veteran market watchers -- David W. Mullins Jr., Michael H. Steinhardt, Henry Kaufman, Richard C. Breeden and Douglas M. Atkin -- met to discuss the lessons learned and the potential impact of Sept. 11 on Wall Street.

Q. Were you surprised by the vulnerability of the markets, that they had to close for four days?

STEINHARDT -- I thought that the market opening as early as it did, in light of the physical problems, was very impressive. The market was extraordinarily -- far more than I would have envisaged -- stable, in light of the circumstances.

MULLINS -- When the attack happened, it had profound implications for investors and the value of stocks. Many, if not most, U.S. companies were simply worth less after the attack than they were before. So the markets had an enormous amount of work to do. Investors had to rebalance their portfolios, adjust their risk levels. Essentially every stock in the U.S. equity markets had to be repriced.
We knew this would involve a massive volume of trading, and it was extraordinarily important that the trading go smoothly. It's a remarkable achievement under those conditions and under those constraints that the New York Stock Exchange, for example, was able to trade a record 2.37 billion shares, indeed trade an average of 2 billion over that entire week. 
Had there been problems in the functioning of the market, this potentially could have been quite destabilizing.

BREEDEN -- The government bond market resumed trading Thursday morning Sept. 13 . So what we saw, both in the fixed-income markets and in the equity markets, was the legacy of almost 20 years of work in strengthening the physical infrastructure of our markets, making sure that they are resilient to interruptions. And both globalization and the move to greater electronic systems have helped put us in a more resilient position than we were 20 years ago.

KAUFMAN -- And the Federal Reserve did yeoman work during that hectic period. There were a lot of open contracts, repos, coming due, had to be refinanced. And the Federal Reserve, also the Bank of England, some of the other institutions, came in massively and injected a huge amount of funds very quickly.

STEINHARDT -- I don't think we've touched upon what might happen. There remains an extraordinary amount of bullishness on most levels, particularly in light of the circumstances and the uncertainties that we face. That will be the next war.

Q. You mean investor bullishness?

STEINHARDT -- Yes.

MULLINS -- One remote concern I had was that we might have a systematic move away from the stock market by individual investors -- in the extreme, a market equivalent of a bank run. It would take the form of large redemption of stock mutual funds. In the '87 event, stock mutual fund redemptions were a significant factor, but in 1987 stock mutual funds were tiny compared to where they are today, in absolute amount, relative to value and relative to volume. There was $180 billion in stock mutual funds in '87; now there's $3.4 trillion.
As it turned out, redemptions were less than 1 percent. This is easily absorbed by cash reserves, and individual investors over the past number of years have shown a remarkable capacity for calm and rational behavior in the face of wide swings.

ATKIN -- One of the repercussions from the '87 crisis was actually a push toward centralization. The events of Sept. 11 will make us look at market fragmentations in a different way, and we should look for ways to decentralize rather than centralize the markets.

Q. Is there a need for a centralized exchange in one place on Wall Street -- specifically, the New York Stock Exchange?

BREEDEN -- We learned there are some disadvantages of concentration, vulnerability to this type of situation. And both globalization and electronic networks in this tragic event proved their importance. Across the board, firms could switch to London systems to help out when New York was under strain or not operating. While over the last 20 years many people have decried globalization as something we should be spooked about and might be a danger to the markets, it showed this time that it can be a big plus to the stability of the markets.
Similarly, the electronic systems showed that they can play an important role in dispersing market activity from any single physical location, which gives us an ability to deal with not only terrorism but the natural disasters that we have seen take exchanges out temporarily in the past.
Both of those trends are pluses. But they don't add up to saying that the New York Stock Exchange is irrelevant. The big problem was the transportation infrastructure and the communication infrastructure, not the markets infrastructure the way we had in '87. Too many telephone lines ran through the basement of 7 World Trade Center. We need to think a little bit more about dispersing the fiber optic cables and communication lines.

MULLINS -- It does demonstrate that a centralized market has to have the same sort of redundancy and backup facilities that a firm has. And that is an extra cost. We have for a long time had a competition between a centralized marketplace and a less centralized marketplace in Nasdaq. My view is let 'em slug it out and we'll see who's provided the best value.

Q. A lot of professionals have pulled back from a lot of their operations, as if the year ended on Sept. 11. What does that mean?

KAUFMAN -- Well, they got disrupted. Some people in management aren't there.
But Wall Street was under pressure leading up to Sept. 11. Volume of financing was down, hardly any I.P.O.'s, junk bond volume was down, emerging debt financing was down. And a huge amount of overhead had been put in place by Wall Street to deal with a rapidly expanding market, not just in the investment banking function, but also in the research staffing. Not only in people, but in huge dollars that were laid out. And many of these firms put in fixed costs because they signed three- or four-year contracts with their employees.
Now what we don't know is, as this dust settles, how many more layoffs are going to be coming out of the financial business. I think there will be. I suspect some firms are holding back. 

STEINHARDT -- I would add another element -- that is, for lack of a better term, risk premium. There's just greater risks in these firms having positions. When you can speak about the possibility of new terrorist attacks, when the papers are filled with anthrax, the range of possibilities has so dramatically widened.
Can I conceive of this being the start of a more serious bear market? Certainly. Certainly. And my intuition is that the markets acted as if there remains a bullish sentiment. But my sense is that there remains a vast legion of investors who became investors for the first time in the 90's and who are, for the purpose of even a plain old bear market, virginal, much less that which we're experiencing now. And all of that, plus relatively high valuations, plus the negative impacts of globalization in a period when things start contracting, create for a range of uncertainties beyond that of a typical cyclical decline.

MULLINS -- Compared to '87, this was a walk in the park. In '87, the stock market fell by 22.6 percent on one day. Had it fallen Sept. 17 by 22 percent, it would have fallen by 2,000 Dow points. It did decline $600 billion on Sept. 17, which might be viewed as one estimate of one component of the cost of this terrorist attack on the U.S. economy.
But that's not that staggering a cost. If you look at the past sort of severe bear markets, we had one starting with the crashes in '29 where the Dow fell 89 percent and it took to the early 50's to regain that level. That took some waiting. And then in 1972, in January the Dow was over 1,000 and it dropped 45 percent, roughly speaking, by October of '74. It took till 1980 for that one to turn around. Both of these situations are characterized by very deep fundamental economic problems.
So the question of whether we're going to have a longer-term bear market has to do with the way the economy responds. Obviously, we had a lot of problems in the 30's and 40's in the geopolitical world. If we have our own version of this, this could create that long-term bear market. If indeed we get through this period and return to a path of growth, I think this would be relatively short-lived.

KAUFMAN -- But there are a couple of broad issues on the line here, what you would classify "uncertainty." A year ago, many business people and financial people wanted the government out of the business of business. We have reversed this. How long that will take, who knows? One of the issues is: Will there be another terrorist attack? No one can put that into a forecast.
The second issue is: Budget deficits are in and budget surpluses are out. We're going to have a deficit in this fiscal year just started. The administration claims there is a small surplus coming up, but I think there'll be a deficit of $25 billion, $50 billion.
In a period of economic sluggishness, we can all argue, that's fine. This is a very interesting war. We are cutting taxes, increasing spending and it's quite different from World War II, for example, where we didn't cut taxes, we raised taxes, government expenditures, there was rationing that was going on, there was tremendous drive to sell war bonds to people. Now the president has said this is war, but he hasn't put a lot of numbers behind it. But how do you know we're not going to have more military expenditures coming?
Another issue that you can front here: Globalization is going to be at a standstill for a while, until this high level of uncertainty diminishes. So just think about it, this drive toward globalization which is very powerful, the idea of budget surpluses, the sanctity of the Social Security program, which were in the headlines.

BREEDEN -- I'd like to take a more optimistic perspective. Terrorism is a threat we've faced for a long time. Clearly we may not have realized the magnitude of that threat. But long run, the civilized world is going to prevail over terrorism. Our country and the world economy are very, very strong.
Now, we have to deal with a short-term issue and if we have further of these shocks the short term may be measured in months or years. But I don't think the fundamentals are being completely washed away.

STEINHARDT -- Market bottoms aren't made in the description that Mr. Breeden gives, however.

Q. Is one of the things you're getting at that Wall Street hasn't adjusted, that it's in denial?

KAUFMAN -- I think Wall Street is in a period of denial in terms of the way it's going to run its business, that it isn't geared yet for difficult markets, for markets that are not going to rapidly accelerate and the volume of financing is going to boom.

Q. Don't brokerages have an obligation to convey that to the investing public?

KAUFMAN -- They have an obligation to their stockholders. Are you talking about the reports that they issue?

Q. I'm talking about the credibility of forecasts and their research reports.

KAUFMAN -- Forecasting is a very difficult business and is constrained by a whole series of aspects. One, people in forecasting love to be in consensus. Those who are outside the consensus, they may be heroes but when they're not heroes they stand out.
No. 2, the forecasting profession is constrained by the institution you're in. It's very difficult to be a bear in an institution that wants to sell obligations and instruments. Even in the government you're not going to have objective forecasting. Have you ever seen the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers forecast a recession?

STEINHARDT -- Can you see it three months from now? Merrill Lynch is bearish on America.

MULLINS -- I do think they've acknowledged, though, a lack of visibility, I believe they call it -- unlike the perfect visibility that they had in, say, March of 2000.

Q. But don't you think there's an artificiality about this market, owing to the lack of participants? A lot of people don't want to look at their statements.

STEINHARDT -- People are still innately bullish. There's patriotism; there's all that sort of stuff. And I hope they're right. But I think that the dire possibilities that we all see have not really been reflected very much in what's happened to date.

Q. Do you think American securities have lost the safety premium, the hegemony premium, that we used to have as the nation that was impregnable?

KAUFMAN -- You can say that the interest rate differentials between European governments and ours, that used to favor ours -- that's gone. In fact, in some sectors, European government yields are higher than our yield. A year ago, that was not the case. At the same time, you can also argue that we're in recession, probably. Europe is tilting toward recession, may not fully be up there in recession. However, a lot of it hinges on this war because the dollar was a key reserve currency, a safe haven. If by some chance the terrorists confined their attacks only to the United States, that will weaken the alliance somewhat and could strengthen the other currencies.
Now, the rest of the world cannot afford to have a weak dollar. Think of it: a weak dollar and a strong yen; the Japanese want to export. A weak dollar and a strong euro; the Europeans want to export. So it's a serious conundrum here. If by some chance the U.S. dollar weakens at a time of global recession, that's a real global problem, not just an American problem.

ATKIN -- Even pre the Sept. 11 attacks, people around the world were grappling with the definition of blue chip -- trying to find some stability within what you might call blue chips. But I think, in the medium term, that American investments will continue to be seen as some of the most stable places to put your money -- what looks safer than safe U.S. financial instruments?

MULLINS -- The risk premium's gone up and the cash flow has gone down. If anything, I think people have somewhat greater confidence in the functioning of our market -- the efficacy, the fact that you can buy and sell shares in a timely and orderly manner at any time. A lot of the foreign markets appear open, but if you try to buy and sell in volume, you find out differently.

Q. Do you have confidence in the president's economic team? It's focused on tax cuts, corporate tax cuts, capital gains tax cuts.

MULLINS -- We're a bit fortunate that the Fed had been cutting rates for a long time. It takes 9 to 12 months to see the full impact of interest rate cuts. That means we have likely not seen the full impact of the Fed's first interest rate cut on Jan. 3. And that the bulk of this stimulus is yet to come. That's the good news.
The problem is this quarter and next quarter. This shock could create downward momentum, a real recession, not just the economist's definition of a recession, but a self-reinforcing organic kind of downward momentum with the weak sectors spilling over into other weak sectors. That's why it might have been a good idea to move quickly with broad-based fiscal stimulus, which would benefit investors, consumers and businesses.
It hasn't quite turned out that way. It now looks like fiscal stimulus will come about in early November, two months after the event. We're already bombing Afghanistan and we're not taking care of the economy.
And then on top of this you have the other problem, which is once you start doing fiscal stimulus it's really hard to stop. I think it would be useful to design short-term investment tax credits and things of this nature.

KAUFMAN -- The problem ahead of us is not so much the consumer, it's the lack of creditworthiness in business today. Balance sheets have deteriorated in the last four or five years. Corporations went out and bought back a huge amount of shares. They borrowed money to do it.
Now you're going to find, in the next half a year, more businesses that are heavily indebted, have debt burdens, have declining earnings. And somehow they've got to be refinanced if we don't want more problems. 
The other side of this is also not very attractive, because what this will lead to is more mergers, more consolidations, more economic and more financial concentration. That's the challenge 10 years from now for the American system. There is a massive consolidation movement going on in the United States and other parts of the world.

Q. Is there any other way to work out the problems?

KAUFMAN -- Well, you've got to be able to make these marginal businesses viable. Bring down long-term interest rates.

MULLINS -- I don't think there's an easy answer to getting the long interest rate down, other than very good economic policy, maybe temporary fiscal stimulus, not moving systematically into having the government involved in business, and careful behavior on the part of the Fed.

BREEDEN -- Maybe because I work in the area of corporate restructurings and turnarounds, I don't find some of the readjustments so threatening. Yes, we'll have a record number of corporate bankruptcies this year, probably. We have had a long expansion of the market.
And now when conditions change and equity capital is not available, where for all those companies who are not high-grade issuers fixed-income markets may be closed to them with longer maturities, we may see a harking back to the problems we had in the late 80's, early 90's of the credit crunch, when the banks were not able to supply all the liquidity needs, particularly of smaller businesses. And that led to a persistent weakness in the economy.

Q. What happens to individual investors?

ATKIN -- I think the consumer mentality is very important. I was reading some statistic the other day that the number of times investors have actually checked their portfolios has been cut in half pre-Sept. 11. People were just getting out of denial about the Internet bubble bursting. Then you have Sept. 11, then you have the repercussions of immediately the airlines and Boeing, and then Wall Street. Where does it stop?

KAUFMAN -- When people realize that the market price is closer to the price at which they bought in, whatever that is, then they become a lot more nervous. Now, the market price in the averages is now down to 1998. So there were still quite a few gains from '95, '94, on to '98.
If you're older and closer to retirement you're going to be a little bit more nervous.

Q. We have had a nation of investors now for a while. Are we pulling back from that?

MULLINS -- Well, we did in the 60's, or actually the early 70's when that market declined. Following 1987 we had eight straight months of mutual fund redemptions. Most of these people, though -- much more than 95 percent of the stock in these funds -- have not experienced '87 or anything like this. Their housing wealth is up. And they've got cash coming in from refinancing. However, the market value of the stock market is down from almost $17 trillion to $11 trillion and that's 38 percent.
And one wonders how long this mentality will hold up. The balance sheets of consumers don't look so great anyway currently.

BREEDEN -- The fact of the matter is that we can have bear markets, and we know from history that they can be long ones, not just short ones. We have seen, compared to the era of earlier bear markets when the average household portfolio started at a high level, average amount of household assets that were in the stock market started at a 50 percent level and probably got down to below 20 percent at one point, and has come back up again.
Though American investors by the millions have been told and warned that markets go in both directions and you have to plan for the risk of a market decline, they hadn't seen it. And the likelihood is that the reality, when they do open their statements eventually, is going to cause a lot of families to reallocate assets and take some money that might have been in equities and diversify it to other kinds of investments or just pay down debt with it. 

MULLINS -- And the concern would be if this happened on one day, like Sept. 17, because 10 percent redemption in stock mutual funds is $340 billion.

Q. Do you think that Sept. 11 will lead to any more oversight of markets? Do you think that there will be a Brady commission looking at this from a technical point of view?

BREEDEN -- I think surely every regulatory agency and every major firm will reassess their vulnerability in the light of what we've seen. The whole concept of disaster recovery planning and corporate succession planning has been redefined by this. And I think the regulators will certainly require firms to pay more attention in that area.

Q. Will this lead to greater geographic dispersal of the securities industry outside of New York? Should it?

ATKIN -- The regulations do need to be updated. This gives us an opportunity to create a more robust and decentralized -- less single point of failure -- market structure in the United States.

BREEDEN -- One of the very specific things that we have to look at is the clearance and settlement system. One of the major clearing organizations lost not only their first site but their backup site as well and had some significant issues, not with solvency but with restoring functionality, so that it becomes very difficult for the overall market to assess credit exposure if some trades are being delivered in and others are not being delivered out because one clearing agency is functioning and one is not. Our concept of what an acceptable backup site is and how far away it ought to be and the redundancy in communication lines is just as important as redundancy in the computers.

Q. Do you think that this had an impact on the Wall Street culture?

ATKIN -- It's had a huge impact on the Wall Street culture. This has been a culture where, to get ahead, it's been, you must work weekends, you must work 18 hours a day or 20 hours a day. It took an event such as Sept. 11 to jolt Wall Street in general and the people who work in Wall Street in particular, to really refocus on what their priorities are. I see it, just going around to the different trading desks or going to the different fund management firms.

Q. Will that last?

KAUFMAN -- Wall Street culture keeps changing all the time. Each decade has had its own culture. We've moved away from the old days of the partnerships. Wall Street has become corporatized. In Wall Street, always there was money to be made. That will always sit in Wall Street. As we get over this period and the markets are developed, the issue really is how much of a corporatized world will Wall Street become.
In 10, 15 years, there are going to be a lot fewer Wall Street firms. They're going to be financial conglomerates. That will change the style of Wall Street. The competition within the street is going to diminish a lot over time. What you see, I think, is a response to the moment but isn't a long-term change. The long-term change is the institutionalization of Wall Street, the consolidation of Wall Street.

MULLINS -- I think mourning runs its course. I do wonder whether there won't be a residual sort of kinder and gentler version of Wall Street culture, although I wouldn't hazard a guess, given the uncertainty that's out there.

ATKIN -- Wall Street is a very tight industry, just like your industry is a tight industry. This will have an impact, and it should have an impact, on this industry for a long time to come.

Fake Goods AreFlowing Under the New Radar

BYLINE:  By JULIAN E. BARNES

 BODY:
CANAL STREET in Chinatown, the center of the Manhattan trade in knockoff luxury goods, has changed since Sept. 11. Fewer tourists roam the area. The already crowded storefront displays have made room for overpriced American flags and photographs of the World Trade Center.
 But what bothers Vance V. Lommen is how Canal Street remains the same: wedged next to the flags are dozens of styles of Oakley sunglasses, all of them fakes. In autumn, sales of counterfeit sunglasses usually start to slow, but this year stores are selling fake Oakleys briskly, and with more impunity than ever. 
 It was not supposed to be this way. 
Mr. Lommen, the security director at Oakley, has worked diligently with United States Customs Service officials, training them to spot fakes. He has cultivated police departments around the country, trying to educate them about the importance of enforcing trademark violations. He has hired private investigators to develop leads.
But the Sept. 11 attacks have led the police to focus on preventing terrorism, not trademark infringement. Customs officers are trying to stop explosives from entering the country, not fake sunglasses. And even private investigators, busy bolstering corporate security, have more work than they can handle.
Oakley's troubles on Canal Street are emblematic of what is happening to companies in other parts of the country. Some American manufacturers are worried that as the United States turns its attention to fighting terrorism, counterfeiting will be virtually unchecked and may expand.
Counterfeiting and product piracy are major headaches for manufacturers of products ranging from detergent to watches, and computer software to jeans. The International Anticounterfeiting Coalition, a manufacturers' organization based in Washington, has estimated that counterfeiting costs the American economy $200 billion a year and erodes consumer confidence in the quality of the real products.
Although manufacturers acknowledge that preventing terrorism must come before fighting counterfeiting and piracy, some trade groups that have led the fight worry that their work has been dealt a setback.
"Clearly we have had agents who have done criminal intellectual property investigations, and their attention has been diverted," said Tim Trainer, president of the coalition.
Some experts in intellectual trademark enforcement contend that the battles against counterfeiting and terrorism may not be as distinct as they seem. Roslyn A. Mazer, associate deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration, said that there were criminal organizations, including those of terrorists, that used counterfeit goods to finance their activities. That means that the effort to cut off the money flow to terrorists could include fighting counterfeiting.
"It's natural for them because of the high profits and low risks," she said. "The commitment to combating counterfeiting has not been serious until recently, but the events of Sept. 11 are a challenge to us to strengthen those efforts." 
Oakley, a publicly traded company based in Foothill Ranch, Calif., has been a leader at fighting counterfeiting. So far this year, 304 people have been arrested on accusations of selling fake Oakleys, and 363,651 pairs of sunglasses have been seized in the United States, according to the company. Outside the United States, 85 people have been arrested and 261,045 pairs of sunglasses seized. By comparison, Oakley made 5.1 million pairs of sunglasses last year. 
Oakley sunglasses, favored by athletes and people who want to look like them, are made in the United States and sell for $60 to $315. Counterfeit versions made in China sell for $4 to $20, with the price depending more on a shopper's ability to haggle than the quality of the fake. 
The company, which earned $51 million last year on sales of $363 million, spends more than $4 million annually on trademark enforcement. It has deployed private investigators around the world hunting for retail sellers, regional distributors and Asian manufacturers of the fake glasses.
NEW YORK has been a particularly difficult problem for Oakley and other companies. Chinatown in Manhattan attracts tourists from all around the world looking for faux Rolex watches and ersatz Gucci bags. But more important, Mr. Lommen said, New York has become a distribution hub. He said warehouses in and near Chinatown supply dealers of counterfeit Oakleys along the East Coast and as far west as Texas and Arizona.
Last spring, Mr. Lommen hired IPSA International, an investigative services company that had recently appointed Howard Safir, the retired New York police commissioner, as its vice chairman. Throughout the summer, IPSA gathered evidence -- buying fake Oakley glasses from stores, pursuing leads on the names of suppliers -- and fed the information to the New York Police Department's trademark enforcement division and local precincts that were doing their own investigations.
ON the morning of Sept. 5, six days before New York changed forever, IPSA investigators briefed Mr. Lommen about a series of raids on Chinatown shops and another raid on a warehouse suspected of distributing fake Oakleys.
"Everyone on my board of directors has been waiting for New York," Mr. Lommen told the IPSA investigators. "I want to be a rash in New York, so people can stop selling fake Oakleys and start doing something else."
Two hours later, Officer James Kim, dressed in a gray T-shirt and shorts, left the Fifth Precinct, near the corner of Elizabeth and Canal Streets, and walked to a store at 55A Mott Street. There, Mr. Kim bought a pair of glasses with Oakley's trademark "O" on their temples, and left. Thirty seconds later, Lt. Louis Turco of the Fifth Precinct strode up to the store with Mr. Lommen trailing behind.
Mr. Lommen took the sunglasses, popped a lens and scraped off the paint. Lieutenant Turco turned to one of his officers. "This is counterfeit Oakley," he said. "Take it all. I want to send a message."
The next day, the Police Department's organized crime division raided a Midtown Manhattan warehouse suspected of selling counterfeit goods. The raid, according to Mr. Lommen, turned up thousands of counterfeit Oakleys and shipping receipts with the addresses of the Chinese factories suspected of having made them.
On Sept. 10, four days after the raid, Mr. Lommen said he felt pumped up. Finally, he said, Oakley was poised to dent the New York market. 
"There were thousands of Oakleys," Mr. Lommen said. "I have never seen a building so full of counterfeits. Still, these are the distributors. They aren't the big, big guys we want. But we can get them. I have an opportunity to get these guys."
The next day, terrorists attacked the World Trade Center. Mr. Lommen's opportunity vanished.
In the days after the attacks, Canal Street was shut down. Now, the shops have opened again and sales of fake sunglasses have resumed with renewed vigor. But not the fight against such sales.
Trademark enforcement has dropped sharply on everyone's list of priorities. The entire police force is working overtime to secure the city and aid in the recovery. The organized crime division is working on terrorism-related investigations. The Fifth Precinct has put peddler enforcement on the back burner and turned its attention to looking for crimes deemed more serious.
Around the country, borders have been tightened, but customs officials are checking for explosives, guns and illegal immigrants. Mr. Lommen had been working with four customs agents in Los Angeles who specialize in spotting counterfeit goods sent by ship. Now most of those agents are working on the Mexican border, looking for bombs. Top customs officials have already said they are giving lower priority to drug interdiction, which means that counterfeiting has moved even further down the list.
"The standard answer is that you can do both," said Raymond W. Kelley, who stepped down as commissioner of the United States Customs Service in January. "In the real world, the focus is off of counterfeiting."
Even IPSA has other concerns and other clients whose needs are more pressing. Mr. Safir said the company had been contracted by many companies to create crisis management plans and to figure out better ways to evacuate buildings in the event of terrorist attacks. It is working to install new kinds of security devices for clients, including doors that close when an unfamiliar face approaches. A food distributor, prompted by worries that someone might try to contaminate its products, has asked IPSA to improve its security.
"You are not in the same universe any more," Mr. Safir said. "The truth is, dealing with trademark is an economic crime that is important. But it is not something that threatens our way of life."
Mr. Lommen does not disagree. Fighting terrorism is far more important that fighting counterfeit sunglasses, he said. He mourns the people killed in the attacks, yet like many Americans he also despairs over the work that was lost that day.
"We may have to start all over next summer," Mr. Lommen said last week. "They are selling more counterfeit Oakleys than ever, because law enforcement is out on the recovery effort. I wish the criminals were more patriotic and put that on hold."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/James L. Moffett; 
UMB Scout Worldwide Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
THE World Trade Center tragedy provides a sobering lesson for American investors in the value of diversifying investments abroad, says James L. Moffett, who runs the $340 million UMB Scout Worldwide fund. 
 "While all markets have been hit since Sept. 11, the economic impact will be felt directly here and less abroad," Mr. Moffett said from his office in Kansas City, Mo. 
 While global markets have moved in tandem lately, that has not always been the case, he said. "In the last few years, the whole zip around the world has been the tech bubble and the countries that were part of that looked most like us," he said. "It will not always be so. Remember it was only a little over 10 years ago, Japan was perceived to be an unbeatable economic powerhouse," only to run into problems as other world markets rose. 
The fund returned 7 percent a year, on average, for the three years ended Thursday, compared with 3.4 percent for its peers in the foreign stock group, according to Morningstar Inc. It lost 15.2 percent in the last 12 months, versus 25.9 percent for the group and 18.6 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Mr. Moffett, 60, is a vice president with UMB Bank, which advises the fund. He starts by picking the countries where he will buy stocks. By charter, the fund cannot invest more than 20 percent of its assets in a single country except the United States.
"We look for political stability and fairly well-developed financial markets," he said. "We also want to see solid legal systems that can protect creditors' rights and property rights." Using those criteria, he avoids countries like Russia, China and Indonesia.
Five percent of the portfolio is invested in Latin America, mostly in Brazil and Chile. "We think they've made good progress in terms of government and business stability," he said.
The fund's biggest stake is in Japan, at 15 percent of assets. But that is still less than the 25 percent allocation to Japan in the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia, Far East index. 
"Japan has been in a 10-year-long recession and still has major structural problems with its banking system," he said. "But we think there are some good companies there that are making money and that are available at fairly reasonable prices." Some of his favorites are Kao, owner of the Jergens line of skin care products; Takeda Chemical Industries, a drug company, and Canon, the maker of cameras, business machines and other products. 
The next-highest allocations are to Britain, at 8 percent, and Canada, at 7 percent. In Britain, he likes health care stocks, while in Canada, he favors oil and other natural-resource companies. 
After choosing countries, Mr. Moffett picks industries and companies. Generally, he prefers companies that have market capitalizations of more than $10 billion and trading volume of at least $5 million a day. He wants little debt on company balance sheets, typically, ratios of debt to capitalization of 30 percent or less.
Unlike many other managers of foreign stock funds, Mr. Moffett invests mainly in American depository receipts, mostly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Companies traded as A.D.R.'s must conform to United States generally accepted accounting principles, and he said he had found that over the long term, A.D.R.'s cost his fund less than owning shares directly.
He does not hedge exposure to foreign currencies, he said, because hedging would eliminate some of the diversification gained by investing abroad. Mr. Moffett recently added to his investment in Serono S.A., the Swiss drug company that manufactures Rebif, used to treat multiple sclerosis. Its main competitor is Avonex, made by Biogen, which has exclusive marketing rights in the United States until 2003 unless a competitor can show the Food and Drug Adminstration that it has a better product. Analysts think Serono can do that, he said.
He bought A.D.R.'s of Serono at $24 in May; they now trade at $22.25
WE also likes Aracruz Celulose S.A., a Brazilian company that produces wood pulp. "They are my Brazilian devaluation play because they export most of what they make," Mr. Moffett said. "If the Brazilian government devalues the currency, they effectively get a price increase for what they are selling." And while wood pulp prices have been low, he added, "it looks like they're starting to firm up around the world." The A.D.R.'s, bought in May 1997 at an average of $10.63, now trade at $16.96.
Mr. Moffett has owned A.D.R.'s of Coles Myer, the big Australian retailer, since the fund started in September 1993. He paid $25.79 at the time, and recently added more, at an average price of $34.33. The A.D.R.'s now trade at $30.10.
"Earnings weren't disastrous, but they weren't growing the way they should have been," he said of the last two years. He expects improvement because a new chief executive, John E. Fletcher, took over at midyear and has been streamlining the company's operations.

One Step Back, Two Steps Forward

BYLINE:  (COMPILED BY RICK GLADSTONE)

 BODY:
Ian Schrager, the hotelier, has learned something about life's ups and downs over the last 25 years. He helped start and operate Studio 54 in 1976 but was later convicted of tax evasion. 
He pioneered the concept of boutique hotels, but his business nearly fell victim to heavy debts in the 1990-91 recession. A long period of prosperity followed for Mr. Schrager, whose company, Ian Schrager Hotels, now owns nine thriving boutique hotels in New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco and London. So if history is any guide, the economic downturn and the terrorist attacks that traumatized the travel industry suggest that Mr. Schrager's luck should be declining again. This time, however, Mr. Schrager, 55, says he is less vulnerable.
 His newest hotel, the 375-room Clift in San Francisco, which opened in July, has enjoyed strong bookings despite the slump in the Bay Area's high-technology economy. "It's doing great," he said last week in a telephone interview, "which is not the easiest thing in the world."

HEADLINE: Refilling the Planes, Replenishing the Economy 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I could not agree more about the need to get passengers back on airplanes in the aftermath of Sept. 11 ("Now Make the Traveler Want to Travel," Five Questions, Sept. 30). 
 Like others in the airline food service industry, our company is under severe pressure from a combination of fewer passengers on fewer flights and the airlines' decision to reduce or entirely eliminate meal service on more and more of their flights. 
Our industry was not included in the airlines' relief package, and we are appealing to Congress for both direct, immediate aid and for longer-term, indirect assistance.
This industry is the safe, secure source of food and beverages for airline passengers. We operate under strict supervision of the Federal Aviation Administration and Food and Drug Administration. Nearly 75 percent of our employees are union members. However, unless we get help soon -- and unless airlines start refilling seats by keeping rather than eliminating passenger service, including meal and beverage service -- our companies and the 40,000 United States jobs we provide are not likely to be around when the airline industry turns around.

HEADLINE: The World; 
Rebuilding What War Has Destroyed

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE American-led alliance has already begun planning how to remake Afghanistan, arguably the world's least modern state, into a more open, tolerant, stable, prosperous and peaceful place. The giveaway was the choreographed symmetry in the skies: the C-17's dropped pre-packaged snacks; the B-52's dropped smart bombs.
 President Bush, whose foreign policy views during the campaign could be summed up as "no more nation-building," declared last week that the United States would help form a new government in Afghanistan and feed its "poor souls." 
 The largesse has come raining down with the ordnance because this war is at least partly about Afghanistan's extreme poverty. Once solely a matter of moral concern, the nation's destitution has become a security threat because it has helped create a fertile recruiting ground -- and a compliant host -- for Osama bin Laden. 
And it's not just Afghanistan. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy is calling for a huge aid program for the whole Middle East. So are Pakistan and many aid groups. They say the United States has to break decisively with the precedent it set after the Persian Gulf war, in which it left Saddam Hussein in power and slapped punitive sanctions on Iraq, breeding resentment and radicalism around the region.
"What does it say to the Muslim world if we just replace the ruling elites, without a framework for pluralism and prosperity?" said Peter S. Watson, president of the American-government-backed Overseas Private Investment Corporation. "We need to provide the building blocks for a new society."
A similar switch occurred between the world wars. The punitive surrender terms of World War I were replaced after World War II by the Marshall Plan, an enormous American effort at democratization and reconstruction throughout Europe.
That kind of undertaking could prove even more challenging in many Islamic nations, where resentment of Western power and influence runs deep. The Marshall Plan may have required $13 billion ($88 billion in today's dollars) in American aid, but western Europeans understood capitalism, and the language and cultural barriers were relatively minor.
In Afghanistan, a place that makes sub-Saharan Africa seem relatively well off, no one is even sure where to begin. It has few schools or hospitals. One in four children dies before turning 5. The average person lives to 40. Three-quarters of the nation's 26 million people cannot read, and an equal proportion have no safe drinking water. A generation of youth has been socialized by war and radical theology.
Still, the rationale for getting deeply involved is compelling. Mr. bin Laden through much of the 1990's based his operation in Sudan. But even that nation, which the State Department identifies as a state that harbored terrorists, wanted better ties to the West, and Mr. bin Laden got in the way. His refuge of last resort was Afghanistan.
The rise of the Taliban, headed by fundamentalist Islamic clerics who preach hatred of the West, is mostly to blame for its isolation. But the United States and other Western allies withdrew even before the Taliban consolidated power. 
The United States by some estimates spent as much as $2 billion financing Afghan rebels' struggle against the Soviet Union in the 1980's, and hundreds of millions of dollars more flowed to aid programs. 
But the political will to provide aid evaporated after the Soviet armed forces withdrew in 1989, and the United States effectively abandoned the country. Civil war divided the nation along ethnic, tribal and religious lines, shattering the anti-Soviet unity the United States had once encouraged.
Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, is among those who argue that America's work this time cannot end when the troops leave. He proposed a down payment of $1 billion in aid, arguing that Washington needs to "think big and stay in it for the long term."
The president has already approved $320 million in aid, and he signaled in his Thursday evening press conference that he, too, feels the United States should learn a lesson from its earlier withdrawal. 
"We should not just leave after the military objective has been achieved," Mr. Bush said.
Much of the American aid would go to feeding people. The United Nations estimates that some three million Afghan refugees have fled the country because of civil war, the repression of the Taliban and a three-year drought. The American-led assault, United Nations officials say, could force another 1.5 million people over the borders with Pakistan and Iran, many of them starving.
The early priorities are distributing food and water, weaning farmers from dependence on poppy for opium, a cash crop, and clearing land mines. Then comes basic facilities and infrastructure, like secular schools and hospitals, road and bridges, power plants and water treatment facilities. 
Longer term, the country will need help creating a modern legal system and a central bank, training customs officers and tax collectors, forming political parties and holding elections. The list is endless.
"Afghanistan is rocks and stones," said a World Bank official. "You name it, they need it."
Adding to the difficulty is a growing sense in the development community that aid money cannot be successfully showered on poor nations. The Bush administration itself bemoaned the lost billions devoted to Russia in the 1990's, though those loans at the time were seen as vital for helping America's cold war nemesis make the transition to democracy and capitalism.
AT one point during the first Bush administration's efforts to install a new government and finance reconstruction in Somalia, total international aid amounted to two-and-half times the nation's economic output. Nearly all of it was wasted when the United States withdrew, counting casualties and pledging not to engage again in open-ended, militarily dangerous humanitarian endeavors.
Afghanistan, with a gaping linguistic, religious, cultural and economic gap, poses some similar risks. The closest model could be neighboring Pakistan. Though the country has made progress in overhauling its economy under Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz -- the country recently met the loan conditions of the International Monetary Fund for the first time in years -- it staggers under a foreign debt of $37 billion, much of that in development loans squandered by the politically powerful. Today, after servicing its debt and maintaining its military, Pakistan has little left over to support health and education. One third of its citizens survive on $1 a day or less. The country is calling for its own mini-Marshall plan as a reward for fighting terrorism across the border.
Afghanistan, as one senior American development official put it last week, looms even larger. "It's a black hole," this official said, "and we're going to have to fill it."

HEADLINE: Sweeping a Tale Under Gulf Land's Pretty Rug 

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 

 BODY:
The one name no one here will mention is that of the 23-year-old citizen who is thought to have been at the controls of the plane that crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.
 The man, Marwan al-Shehhi, has been depicted by American investigators as the loyal sidekick of Mohamed Atta, the 33-year-old Egyptian considered a ringleader of the hijackers and probably the man who plowed the first plane into the World Trade Center's north tower. Both men had studied in Hamburg, in northern Germany, and both took flying lessons in Florida. 
 But that is not something you will learn from the government-guided news media in the United Arab Emirates. They have simply not mentioned the name of Mr. Shehhi, who came from Ras al-Khaimah, a community about an hour north of Dubai. 
If residents of Mr. Shehhi's hometown had heard of him before now, they were certainly not telling strangers. Four hours spent in the community yielded no address and no one -- policemen, firemen, pedestrians or local officials -- who did anything more than shrug at the mention of his name.
Very few people will talk about Mr. Shehhi; instead, most focus firmly on Dubai's real business -- boosterism.
"At first, we just couldn't accept it, we couldn't imagine why anyone from the U.A.E. would do such a thing," said Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the executive chairman of Dubai's Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation. "People love living here, they are happy, they have work, we have no political prisoners."
Inevitably in Dubai, the Arab world's hardest charging center of commerce, the judgment ends up at the bottom line. "You know," he said, "these people were losers. They were failures in life. All they could do was commit suicide."
Abdallah al-Serkal, a 35-year-old real estate developer, doubles as the director of the Sheik Muhammad Center for Cultural Understanding that seeks to explain Islam to Dubai's expatriate majority. He gives lectures to groups and takes them into mosques and Muslim homes.
Since Sept. 11, that mission has perhaps taken on a new dimension, but -- in keeping with the general effort to put the attacks out of mind -- he smooths over any unease with a new line in his presentation. "I tell them, 'Wrong doesn't wear a turban,' " Mr. Serkal said. " 'Wrong doesn't wear a cowboy hat. Wrong is wrong, and it can come in anyone.' "
Gassan Tahboub, a senior adviser on government projects, said: "In the first week after the attacks, we were shocked and astonished. The 10 biggest restaurants were empty for a week. But now go to any one of them, and you'll see lots of C.E.O.'s and beautiful women again."
Located at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, the Emirates has traditionally been a land of traders, people who got by on enterprise long before they did on oil. Discovered offshore in 1966, oil made them rich, and their embrace of business since has made many of them superrich. 
Multinational corporations have flocked here, attracted by a hands-off government that allows for full foreign ownership and repatriation of profits, no corporate taxes for 15 years, no currency restrictions and no income tax. 
"This is the El Dorado of business, the most globalized of all Arab societies," said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a professor of political science at United Arab Emirates University. The tiny country has the third-largest gross national product in the Arab world, behind Saudi Arabia and Egypt, and its economy is the most diverse and least oil-dependent. Residents believe "that after Singapore, Frankfurt and London, no other country is better prepared to serve the global economy than Dubai," Mr. Abdulla said.
Actually Dubai -- population 865,000, only 20 percent of that native -- is not a separate country, but one of the seven emirates that joined to create the United Arab Emirates in 1971. The capital is Abu Dhabi, a stand of glassy luxury skyscrapers rising off the desert floor down the coast, and a city dismissed by Dubai residents as slow, formal and stuffy. 
"It's like Washington compared to New York," said Mona al-Marri, the executive manager of the Dubai Press Club. "You watch on the weekend, and you'll see all the cars from Abu Dhabi headed this way."
Dubai, a city of dueling office towers on either side of a 10-mile estuary known as the Creek, is the Arab world's center for e-commerce, boasting a $200 million Internet City free trade zone, and a new Media City. Its emir, the horse breeder Sheik Muhammad bin Rashid al-Maktoum, has put Dubai on the international sporting calendar with high-profile golf and tennis tournaments, boat and horse races, desert rallies and air shows. Time Out, the British listings and trend-spotting magazine, has just published the first monthly issue of Time Out Dubai.
Even sushi cannot escape Dubai's bent for making everything jumbo-size. "Big enough for any appetite" is how the Creekside restaurant describes its portions, using a picture of a glowering sumo wrestler. "The sheer scale will amaze you."
Mr. Sulayem said, "We believe we can do anything in Dubai, and we have the luxury of having lots of income." 
He was showing a visitor around a $1.5 billion project to build a three-mile-long island in the Persian Gulf that will create 40 miles of new beach and shorefront building sites.
Mr. Sulayem has filled his beachfront office with pictures of the different housing styles the Palm Island Project will offer -- Ottoman, ranch-style, Arabian, Riviera, Japanese, Greek, Scandinavian, Malay, Mogul, Caribbean, desert Mexican, Gothic. 
It will, of course, be the largest manufactured island complex in the world, visible even -- its promoters promise -- from space.

HEADLINE: Economic Pain Spreads From U.S. Across Latin America 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 13 

 BODY:
Economies throughout Latin America have stumbled badly since the terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon, stirring fears of a long-term recession. 
 From Mexico to Chile, country after country has suffered an abrupt downturn. Currencies have plummeted as the jolt to the world economy has cut prices of basic goods like oil, copper, zinc, steel and foodstuffs. Vital capital inflows have withered, sending Latin stock and bond markets plunging, and driving up interest rates. 
 That in turn stalls business expansion and consumer spending. 
In assessing the damage, economists say the severity of the slowdown will depend on the course of the United States economy, which is influenced by unknowns like the duration of the fighting in Afghanistan and whether terrorists strike again. 
Already the slowing Latin economy has led to corporate layoffs and cutbacks in government jobs and social programs, and it has provoked protectionist policies that have worsened regional trade tensions.
"We must prepare for the most difficult scenario," the Argentine economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, said recently. "What is approaching is a deceleration of the United States and European economies in the context of a war against terrorism. Investment will increase in areas like security, while consumption, tourism and other activities that generate economic movement will fall." 
The vital tourism industry has dried up in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, putting new pressure on foreign reserves and increasing unemployment. Multinational companies, too, have shelved planned investments in the Peruvian mining and Brazilian telecommunications industries. 
"Latin America is entering one of the most difficult periods it has faced in many decades," Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank, said this week. 
So far, any backlash against the free-market reforms that swept the region in the 1990's has been muted. But politics here are tumultuous, and there is the potential for the political winds to change quickly. This may be more likely because poverty and high unemployment remain severe Latin American problems. 
The proportion of people living in poverty decreased modestly in Latin America in the 1990's, according to a new report by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, although progress was uneven. Meaningful social programs were begun in Colombia, Guatemala, Chile, Peru and the Dominican Republic. But unemployment actually increased in Brazil, Colombia and Argentina, and the income gap between the rich and poor grew in most of the region. 
Of the 500 million people in Latin America, 89 million live in extreme poverty, according to the United Nations. That number is bound to grow in a recession. 
Already, there are signs of a political shift. A backlash against the free-market economic policies of Argentina's president, Fernando de la Rua, is expected in Sunday's congressional elections, for instance, as the governing alliance is expected to go down to a decisive defeat. A downturn in Colombian manufacturing does not bode well for a government struggling against two guerrilla insurgencies. 
In Mexico, support for President Vicente Fox's efforts to undo seven decades of one-party rule continues to slip as his pledges to create jobs fall by the wayside. Because of geography and the North American free trade agreement, Mexico is intricately linked to the United States economy. 
Most of Latin America's economies had been slowing since the beginning of the year in tandem with the American economy, after generally good if selective advances throughout the 1990's, an era of deregulation and privatization. But as the economies opened up, they also became more vulnerable to troubles imported from around the world. 
Regional troubles this year are tied to the slowdown in the United States and to worries that Argentina may fall into a traumatic debt default and devaluation, which would scare away more investment and could cause serious repercussions in Brazil. The events of Sept. 11 have intensified threats to the economies. 
In a report this week, Goldman Sachs pulled back from its previous prediction that Latin America's regional economy would grow this year at a modest rate of 1.3 percent, adding, "we believe that real G.D.P. growth will struggle to remain in positive territory." 
The direct impact of the terror attacks has already been felt in Mexico, which sends 85 percent of its exports to the United States and relies on American travelers to drive a tourism industry that generates about $9 billion annually and employs up to 5 million people.
Aeromexico and Mexicana, the country's two leading airlines, have announced layoffs of several thousand workers as a result of a sharp decline in traffic at home and abroad. Hotels and travel agents are reporting mass cancellations. 
A considerable portion of the $30 billion of revenue that Mexico gets from oil in a year may also be in jeopardy; it provides about a third of government spending. Oil prices could reverse if a war disrupts Middle East supplies, helping Mexico as well as Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. So far, however, oil prices have eased as the prospect of a deepening world recession has increased. 
"In previous U.S. economic downturns, the impact took months to reach us but this time there has been an instantaneous impact," said Noe Aron Fuentes, chairman of the economics department at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana. "We now fear a deeper and longer U.S. recession, and that is going to mean higher unemployment for Mexico." 
Even countries with limited trade with the United States, notably Argentina, have been put at greater risk as international investment flows have shifted increasingly to cash, United States government bonds and gold, although stocks have rebounded a bit in recent days. In its 40th month of a deepening recession, cutbacks in consumer spending forced car production down by 47 percent and government tax collection by 14 percent in September, compared to the same month last year. With commodity prices low, interest rates rising, its currency tied to the strong dollar, and a big drop-off in investment flows, Argentina has few resources to handle the emergency. 
Its fiscal shortfall has forced the government to scramble to make more budget cuts, after already slashing salaries and pensions in recent months, stoking labor unrest. This week Standard & Poor's downgraded Argentina's credit-worthiness for the fifth time this year, and with United States Treasury officials now busy with more pressing economic concerns related to the terrorist attacks, they have been diverted away from their efforts to engineer an Argentine bond swap to relieve the government's immediate and medium-term debt burden.
With the deepening slowdown following the attacks, some economists have predicted that the $8 billion International Monetary Fund emergency package in August will probably only delay a default of Argentina's $130 billion central government debt and $20 billion more in provincial government debt until early next year. 
Mounting debt pressures and falling investor confidence could force the country to drop its decade-old currency peg to the dollar and devalue the peso -- a move that could have a devastating impact on a private sector with more than $20 billion in debts dominated in dollars and push up an unemployment rate that is already over 16 percent. 
Mounting skittishness over Argentina's finances has further eroded investor confidence in Brazil, whose currency was already declining in value at a disturbing rate before the terrorist attacks. After the attacks, companies, individuals and speculators sold the currency, reals, and bought dollars at a quickening rate, effectively producing a devaluation of more than 8 percent. 
Brazil's weak currency, economists say, increases exports but adds to the government's considerable debt. Economists also say rising interest rates in recent months could push Brazil into a recession while also increasing the cost to the government of servicing the debt. Since the September attacks, Lloyds Bank has trimmed its economic growth for the fourth quarter of the year to zero from 2 percent. 
"Before the attacks, the central bank was poised to lower interest rates because we had some signs that Brazil was facing a serious slowdown," said Odair Abate, chief economist at Lloyds Bank in Sao Paulo. But after the attacks, he said, a sharp drop in the currency's value took away the central bank's options to cut interest rates and spur growth.

Knicks Losing Johnson's Stabilizing Force

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE

 BODY:
The most noticeable difference about the Knicks is that they look nothing like the team you used to know, the perennial playoff club that usually found a way to survive and advance.
 It was not the character they were displaying on the floor during a meaningless preseason game or their body language. Except for a few regulars, their faces were different. Trade by trade, retirement after retirement, the names have changed. 
 "When I was here five years ago, it was always, 'Oh, man, John Starks, that's my man,' " Allan Houston said. "Or, 'Oak's my man.' And now it's a new breed. You see people going, 'Marcus' and 'Spree.' " 
Houston paused and added: "I feel fortunate to be part of two eras. That era back then, the Miami era and this era. Seems like I've been here awhile."
The old guard lost another last week when Larry Johnson retired. After protracted negotiations, the Knicks finally bought out his entire contract, $28.8 million. A chronically bad back forced his retirement.
At 32, Johnson got his money and is in relatively good health, so there is little reason for nostalgia today. No top pick in the draft that good should ever be robbed of his explosiveness as young as Johnson was, but he was not a bust. Johnson had some great nights and the uncanny ability to close out an opponent with a timely 3-pointer.
He did it against Charlotte in 1997 in the first round of the playoffs and at Toronto in the 2000 first-round series. And of course there was his memorable 4-point play, which astounded Indiana in Game 3 of the 1999 Eastern Conference finals.
"Time and again he would make big shots and big plays," Jeff Van Gundy, the Knicks coach, said recently. "We didn't accomplish everything we wanted to, but I don't think there was one thing Larry Johnson could have done more to try to win a championship. He did everything he could do. When you needed his best he would give you his best. Even when he couldn't."
Van Gundy added, "We had a nice run with that group."
Yet, with Johnson out of the picture this season, Patrick Ewing last season -- and Starks and Charles Oakley in 1999 -- everything you knew, embraced and ridiculed about the franchise the last five years is almost gone.
Houston arrived in 1996, on the same July day that brought Johnson and Chris Childs. Together, they won 31 playoff games, saw the transition of Ewing's team to Latrell Sprewell's crew.
One of the more telling stories about Johnson embodied the Knicks' frustration over the years. In 1997, he and Starks were suspended from Game 7 of the conference semifinals against Miami -- the infamous leaving-the-bench series. 
As Starks cursed the television and pounded the walls of his hotel room, Johnson kept taking showers all afternoon, almost trying to cleanse himself and his team of their boneheaded mistake. It never happened, as Miami went on to win.
There were other moments and moods: the incendiary remarks during the 1999 finals that made Johnson a lot less cuddly and a lot more surly; the insecurities of an injured player trying to make sure he did not lose face in the locker room.
But mostly, Johnson was the stabilizing force in a transitional locker room, the guy who always spoke carefully to his forlorn teammates and picked up the check when they all went for dinner.
"He meant so much to us," Van Gundy said. "And he's meant so much to me personally. You could always take the temperature of our team through him." 
The franchise moves on. Marcus Camby, Sprewell and Houston are now the cornerstones. And five years from now, they will have their own stories to tell. Too much else in life demands attention to make Johnson's playing days a worthy piece of nostalgia. But a little reflection does not seem out of place.

Jordan Is Still a Draw
The tickets for all his preseason games keep disappearing like hotcakes at a Rotary Club breakfast. The N.B.A. even marked his first game back on Thursday night by providing play-by-play accounts over the Internet.
Michael Jordan's comeback has indeed been drawn out like an overhyped mini-series over the past six months, every niggling detail paid so much attention to that many fans are already growing tired of the glut of Jordan stories.
Unlike the news media, even some of Jordan's most ardent supporters are almost taking a wait-and-see approach before getting caught up in more hyperbole.
And yet, his comeback does change how the N.B.A. and its television partners do business.
Before his return, only one Wizards game was scheduled on Turner Sports -- on Nov. 28 against Philadelphia. With NBC allowed to show up to 11 of a team's games and Turner allowed to televise 15 of a team's games, the all-Michael all-the-time programming is about to return.
NBC has added Washington's home opener on Nov. 1 against the 76ers to its Saturday prime-time lineup. The network also added a Dec. 1 game at Orlando, in which Jordan faces Tracy McGrady for the first time.
The Jan. 19 game between the Wizards and the Bulls, Jordan's first trip back to Chicago in another uniform, is also on tap. 
Still, as to whether Jordan will rescue declining ratings, no one can be sure. NBC's regular-season ratings were down 12 percent last season, following declines of more than 20 percent each of the prior two seasons without Jordan. 
The league's four-year, $2.64 billion deals with NBC and Turner expire after this season. Those networks' exclusive negotiating windows for new contracts are about to close.
Has Jordan's return significantly altered the bidding? Probably not.
With major advertisers unwilling to commit financially in a sagging economy, ESPN and other outlets will most likely stay with their current formats rather than try to take on a new sport in a dwindling marketplace. Also, given his initial 16-minute performance on Thursday night in a loss to the Pistons, no one really knows how much Jordan has left. And that uncertainty is enough to raise doubts about his marketability beyond this season.

Charity Benefit for Victims
Jason Kidd will be among the celebrities attending Celebration of Spirit, a concert-and-club event that benefits the Inner City Games of New York on Thursday night.
The charity, which raises money for disadvantaged children to attend summer camps and other activities, will donate half of its proceeds from the event to the Sept. 11 victim relief efforts. The event begins at 6:30 p.m. at Club New York on West 43rd Street.

HEADLINE: Outside New York, Charities Feel the Pinch 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
In normal times, 100 donations a week flow into the Make-a-Wish Foundation in Cleveland. But since Sept. 11, donations have dried to a trickle. 
 "We're feeling the pinch bad, so we've eliminated one of our seven staff positions," said Traci Felder, executive director of the foundation. "The money just went away overnight, and it's not picking up. We used to average about $2,500 a day. I don't have this week's figures, but Thursday, Oct. 4, we got $370." 
 While the relief funds created for victims of the terror attacks have been deluged with money, small charities throughout the nation are suffering. Fund-raising events and direct mail campaigns are bringing in less than expected, and some major givers are reneging on their pledges, sending contributions instead to relief funds for New York's victims. 
Small nonprofit agencies that help the needy -- food banks, battered women's shelters, programs for the homeless and people with AIDS -- have been hit especially hard. 
In Washington on Oct. 6, 5,000 people turned out for the annual AIDS walk, compared with the 20,000 to 30,000 who usually show up. The walk raised only $420,000, a far cry from the expected $1.2 million. Meanwhile, direct mail fund-raising for the Whitman-Walker Clinic, which sponsors the Washington AIDS walk, dropped 50 percent in September. 
"Since Sept. 11, we've lost $1 million in revenues," said A. Cornelius Baker, Whitman-Walker's executive director. "We have to begin trying to drain blood from a stone." 
While Whitman-Walker has been the second-largest beneficiary of the local United Way, that too may change. United Way officials said it was too soon to tell how contributors in the current campaign would apportion their money between local and New York needs. 
"All the United Ways and all our agencies are nervous," said Tony de Christofaro, a spokesman for the United Way for the National Capital Region. "We're hoping people won't make either-or decisions, that they'll contribute to their regular causes and then, above and beyond that, to the relief effort." 
But for now, many donors seem to be favoring New York's relief effort at the expense of local organizations.
"We're $300,000 behind in meeting our budget for the year," said Marilyn Fountain, community relations coordinator for Star of Hope, which runs three residences for the homeless in Houston. "On Sept. 20, we had no money at all come in. Since then, it's not an empty box, but it's stayed about 35 percent down from what it should be."
Also in Houston, the Spay-Neuter Assistance Program, which provides free or low-cost sterilization for cats and dogs, had to cut its services 10 percent when its Sept. 29 fund-raiser fizzled. Five large corporate donors, whose names were included on the invitation, backed out, with one saying it could longer support the program because the company had sent $50,000 to the New York Red Cross. 
"The face of philanthropy in the United States has changed forever as a result of the terrorist attacks and subsequent economic events," said Sean Hawkins, the program's executive director. 
At a time when the economy is faltering, Mr. Hawkins and others say the loss of support in the year-end giving season could seriously hamper their ability to provide services next year. 
Pamela Altmeyer, president of the Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana, whose fund-raiser on Friday was far smaller than planned, said she was worried about whether small charities like hers were even going to survive. "Even I sent money to New York," she said. "But at the same time, the layoffs here have really increased the need for food. I know hunger and housing and all the day-to-day needs are never going to look the same as this horrible, horrible thing purposefully inflicted on innocent people."
Already, many have had to tighten their belts. In Los Angeles, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals laid off eight of its 55 employees and closed one pet adoption center and is planning to close another. "It's too soon to tell if the Christmas season will be completely lost," said Madeline Bernstein, the society's president. 
Last week, Habitat for Humanity laid off 35 employees and worked out a plan with the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, a large contributor, to give the full $2 million donation this year that it had planned over the next five years. 
For social service agencies, next year's prospects look bleak. Making matters worse, private foundations are likely to cut back their grants, given sharp declines in the value of their endowments because of the economy. 
Even in New York City, with about $850 million pouring into terror relief funds, nonprofit programs that address other needs are suffering. At Gay Men's Health Crisis, which serves people with AIDS, direct mail donations have been down 30 percent since the attacks, while the number of new clients has doubled. 
"We usually take in 100 new clients a month, but we're up to 200 in the last 30 days, with people using drugs more, or needing more mental health services," said Ana Oliveira, the group's executive director. "The needs are growing. But with the financial situation, we have to be cautious. We're holding off on hiring new staff."
Groups in other cities, too, are overwhelmed by the coupling of greater needs and less support. 
"There was zero money coming in for about 10 days after the attacks, and it's still pretty bad," said Brian Burton, executive director of the Wilkinson Center, which serves low-income people in Dallas. "Dallas has been hit hard with layoffs, and we have 40 people lining up in the morning for our job assistance program. We can't handle that many, so we have to send some home." 
The largest national charities, like the American Heart Association and the Sierra Club, say that they have not seen a significant decline in donations. But they, too, have made adjustments since the attacks. 
The Sierra Club canceled a mailing that was to go out this month, and is rethinking the tone of its December appeal to make sure it does not appear to be attacking President Bush personally. 
"We don't have any difficulty saying we don't think it's going to help America's energy future to drill in Alaska," said Carl Pope, the Sierra Club's executive director. "But this is not the time for war analogies or anything that sounds like an attack on the president."

Hunsicker Pondering Future of the Astros

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 13 

 BODY:
Now that the Houston Astros have taken their usual leave of the playoffs after one series, Gerry Hunsicker can devote his complete attention to trying to resolve a dilemma he faces this off-season. In a baseball variation on "Hamlet," Hunsicker can engage in a soliloquy with himself.
 "To do it or not to do it, that is the question," Hunsicker, the Astros' general manager, will say aloud to himself as he walks the train tracks on the outfield wall at Enron Field. 
 Unfortunately for Hunsicker, he will find it no easier to resolve his problem than the great Dane.
Hunsicker's decision deals with the makeup of the Astros and how to achieve that makeup. In short, does he leave the team intact and figure the Astros will be good enough next year to win the National League Central championship for the fifth time in six seasons? Or does he set out to make changes that would give the Astros a better chance to go beyond the first round? 
The Astros have never won a postseason series. Not this year, not the three consecutive years before last year, not further back in their history, in 1986 or 1981 or 1980. They have won only 2 of 14 division series games, and their overall postseason record is 8-22. Their act grows tired after awhile, although not many teams have played in the postseason four of the last five years. The failures gnaw at Hunsicker.
Not that he was anticipating another postseason failure, but Hunsicker candidly addressed the problem a few days before the Astros began their series with Atlanta.
"In a perfect world I think I know what would make us better," he said. "It's not a deal where I can add one piece and make us better. I might add one piece with the intent of making two more moves, but if I can't make those moves, I might have made us worse because of the piece I might have replaced."
He offered an example using Moises Alou, the team's productive outfielder, who can be a free agent in a few weeks.
"Say we don't re-sign Alou," Hunsicker said. "That would take a major run producer out of the lineup. We go out and put a prototype center fielder out there: speed, steals bases, good defense. Well, if I can't add another power bat somewhere to replace Alou, I think we've actually hurt ourselves. It gets a little tricky."
Looking at what the Astros have accomplished, Hunsicker added: "We have found a combination that puts us among the best teams in our league on a rather consistent basis, barring key injuries. We know that we found a combination that works and at least makes us a contender.
"The question is to try to get a team that can get to the next level, which is the elite level. Do you stick your neck out there and take some major pieces out of this lineup and gamble or do you stick with what you have? Do you want to be a B student and be pretty confident you can be a B student year in and year out, or do you want to go for that A and maybe wind up being a C or D student? It's kind of like that."
The Astros presented a paradox this year. They were the league's second-best hitting and run-producing team, but they all too often plunged into periods where they did not hit or score. Their late-season difficulties that carried into the playoffs highlighted that shortcoming. 
"The better right-handed pitchers shut us down with regularity," Hunsicker said, continuing to speak with unusual candor for a general manager. "The left-handed pitchers, the soft-tossers, give us trouble, too. We have so many aggressive big-swing, power-swing type guys that we almost seem to be vulnerable to that type of pitcher. Because some of these guys hit the ball so hard -- Bagwell, Alou, Castilla -- they hit into a lot of double plays."
He cited a game in which San Francisco batters hit some slow infield grounders and scored some runs as a result. "We don't get many of those," Hunsicker said. "We don't seem to score any cheap runs. You look back at '98, '99; we had three 30-stolen base guys on the team. This year we had none. Biggio is probably as important as any single guy because he sets the tone, and when he's not hitting it seems like our offense is much different."
Craig Biggio did not hit in the Braves' sweep of the division series. But then neither did most of the other batters in the Houston lineup. Alou and Lance Berkman also had only two hits in 12 at-bats, and the Astros collectively batted .200, scoring six runs in the three games.

Loyalty Goes Only So Far
There's something to be said for consistency, but sometimes it can get a guy in trouble.
Tom Hicks, the Texas Rangers owner, fired his general manager, Doug Melvin, last week after Melvin had held the job for seven years. Among other reasons he gave, Hicks said that Melvin had been too loyal to certain people, suggesting that by staying with those employees Melvin had failed to perform as well as he otherwise might have.
Two years ago, when the Milwaukee Brewers were looking for a general manager, they were interested in Melvin but were unable to gain permission to talk to him because Melvin opted not to pursue the job. Hicks, he explained, had treated him well and he felt he should be loyal to him.
On the other hand, it apparently pays to be unemployed if a person wants to become a general manager. Unemployment worked for Dan O'Dowd two years ago, and now it has worked for Dan Evans.
O'Dowd, in effect, gave up his job as the Cleveland Indians' assistant general manager in 1998 when, contrary to terms of his contract, he sought the general manager's job with the Baltimore Orioles. But when the Colorado Rockies went looking for a general manager in 1999, O'Dowd was available.
Evans relinquished his assistant's job with the Chicago White Sox a year ago when they named Ken Williams and not him their general manager. He was thus available earlier this year when the Los Angeles Dodgers needed someone to work with Dave Wallace after Kevin Malone resigned under fire. With Wallace returning to his previous duties, Evans has been named general manager.

One Run Makes a Difference
In the first six years of the division series round of the playoffs, none of the 89 games ended 1-0. Last week two division series games ended 1-0. Arizona edged St. Louis and Atlanta topped Houston.
During the season, teams played 36 1-0 games. Atlanta and Florida played the most, six each, and they each won three and lost three. The Mets and Milwaukee each played five. The Mets won three and lost two, while the Brewers lost all five. The Yankees won all three 1-0 games they played. St. Louis and the Chicago White Sox were the only teams that played no 1-0 games.
Todd Ritchie was the winning pitcher in all three 1-0 games Pittsburgh won. Home runs won 16 of the 36 games. Gary Sheffield of Los Angeles and Bret Boone of Seattle each won two 1-0 games that way. The Yankees and San Francisco each won two 1-0 games with home runs.
Four of the games went extra innings, the longest being Arizona's 18-inning victory over the Giants. Had the Giants won that game and everything else had gone as it did, they would have tied the Diamondbacks for the N.L. West title.

Homers Down, Strikeouts Up
Home runs and runs were down this year from last. The number of walks dropped, too, as the number of strikeouts rose, indicating that the attempt to use the rule-book strike zone had some effect. Players hit 4.1 percent fewer home runs than they did last year (5,693 to 5,458) and scored 7.1 percent fewer runs. Walks dropped 1.3 percent, and strikeouts were up by 3.3 percent.
Only one team among the 24 that did not win division championships had a better won-lost record within its division than the division winner. The Mets had a 43-33 record against division opponents, one game better than Atlanta's 42-34.

Twins Thrived Under Kelly
Of all the criticisms of managers in recent years, one of the silliest was the idea that the game had moved beyond Tom Kelly's abilities. Kelly put that charge to rest this season, in which he did a job worthy of being named manager of the year. 
The Twins had neither the talent nor the experience to challenge Cleveland for the American League Central championship, but they actually spent more days in first place alone (94) than the Indians (90, including the seven-day layoff). The Twins also had the same division record as the Indians (47-29).
In the end, the Twins collapsed like a marathon runner who sprinted too far and too long. But Kelly induced his primarily young players to keep playing for second place, which they earned by beating the Chicago White Sox in the final two games of the season. That finish was not quite as good as the Twins' 1987 and '91 World Series victories, but in a sense it was as gratifying.
By retiring Friday, Kelly relinquished his reign as the longest-running manager/coach currently in professional sports. He began managing the Twins on Sept. 12, 1986.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: WHO SEETHES, AND WHY; 
Despair Beneath the Arab World's Rage

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 13 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's war on terror is in some ways a war on the Islamic extremism that was born and bred in the crowded slums of Egypt and the sterile desert cities of Saudi Arabia, out of the abject sense of powerlessness that drives some people to loathe anyone who represents power. 
 As such waging and winning the war could require colossal change in both of those nations, whose rulers have often been America's strongest allies in the Arab world. 
 "This war on terrorism may eliminate a few terrorists," said Mohamed Zarea, a human rights activist in Cairo who believes political and social improvements are the ultimate answer. "But without basic reforms, it will be like killing a few mosquitoes and leaving the swamp." 
American strategy in the Middle East has long relied on Egypt as a moderating force, particularly in the conflict with Israel, and Saudi Arabia as a stabilizing influence on the weak tribal regimes of the Persian Gulf, which control oil riches. Washington's appeal now would seem to be tailor-made for them. The Egyptians have known terrorism first hand -- President Hosni Mubarak was the target of an assassination attempt by Islamic militants in 1995. His predecessor, Anwar Sadat, was killed by them in 1981. The Saudi royal family, whose power rests on its claim to religious piety, has endured Osama bin Laden's charge of being unfit to oversee the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
But there are problems, too. Both groups of rulers are entrenched elites dealing with increasing social frustration -- rooted in stagnant economies and a paucity of jobs -- and the difficulty of managing generational change at the top.
Both have tried to weather a storm of anti-American sentiment in the last year, growing from the perception that the United States supports Israel against the Palestinians.
And now, the list of America's most-wanted terrorists, replete with the names of Egyptians and Saudis, has made it abundantly clear that hatred for the United States and its friends was nurtured on their own soil.
Egypt, with 69 million people, is the Arab world's most populous state. In a region made up of nations carved by European powers from the carcass of the Ottoman empire, it has the distinction of being the only Middle Eastern country living within its historic borders.
The Arab world's defining political ideologies have come out of Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhood, the grandfather of the modern movements that seek to replace secular governments with Islamic states, was born here. Pan-Arab nationalism, the secular movement that sought to erase the European-made borders and create a single Arab nation, took concrete form here.
Egypt was also the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel, a decision that ushered in Egyptian-American cooperation but cost President Sadat his life. 
In the view of many Egyptians, the peace treaty has not brought the rewards they were led to expect in compensation for their isolation in the Arab world. The bulk of the more than $2 billion annual American aid goes to the military. Huge public housing projects, built far from the city centers in the desert, sit empty. Unemployment, especially among college graduates, has been rising.
Reform of the centrally planned economy has never really got off the ground. One third of the work force still holds government jobs that pay so little -- about 300 Egyptian pounds a month, or the equivalent of $71 -- that most people have to take on another job or two.
Yet Egyptian universities continue to grind out graduates. Each year, 20,000 new lawyers hit the streets, swelling the ranks of what economists here call the "educated poor."
Mr. Zarea, the rights activist, went to law school, like many young men from working-class families, carrying all his family's dreams of a better life.
Most of his classmates -- those lacking political or family connections to get a high-paying job -- ended up scraping by in private practice on $30 a month. "You can't afford to take a taxi to court," said Mr. Zarea, who is 36. "You go by bus. You can barely afford the suit you need to appear before a judge. So you work a second job as a waiter or a taxi driver or a manual worker. 
"And after all this physical and mental effort," he said, "you can't even start a life and get married because you can't afford it. And you end up blaming society and the government." 
Frustration is likely to intensify. Like most Arab countries, Egypt is awash in young people. More than 55 percent of the population is under the age of 25 and has known no other president than Mr. Mubarak.
In Saudi Arabia, almost 60 percent of the population is under 25. Unemployment is high. The oil wealth that seemed unlimited in the 1980's has proved insufficient to subsidize today's young people the way it did their parents. Criticism of the Saudi royal family that has ruled the country since its creation in 1932 is dealt with severely. 
Predictably, the disappointed youth of Egypt and Saudi Arabia turn to religion for comfort. They blame the government but are fearful of expressing their anger openly. They blame outsiders -- in the Middle East, that is the seemingly all-powerful United States -- who seem to have everything.
"It's easy for the average Egyptian to say, we tried modernity but it didn't take us anywhere and we didn't become Europe," said Tarek Heggy, a wealthy Cairo businessman and political analyst. "It's easy for him to say, we tried pan-Arabism and it didn't work. And, if he's a simple-minded person, he might say they didn't work because God wasn't with us." 
The Palestinian uprising, and the continued American and British bombing of Iraq, have also stoked the discontent about America.
When Mr. bin Laden was blamed for the attacks in the United States, many people in Cairo reacted with anger and disbelief. "Every time it has to be Muslims to blame, every time!" shouted Amaal abdel Rabboh, a housewife of 42, outside a mosque on Friday. "Our blood is cheap, eh? No, our blood is precious and the American blood is water. Bin Laden is just an excuse to occupy Afghanistan." 
When Mr. bin Laden, a son of one of the richest men in Saudi Arabia and a one-time hero for taking up arms against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1980's, portrayed himself as a champion of Palestinians, he struck a responsive chord. 
"You cannot expect people to join him tomorrow," said Fahmi Howeidi, an Egyptian commentator on Islamic political movements. "But in the long run this increases sympathy for him."

This Just In, About a Year Ago

BYLINE:  By SETH MARGOLIS

 BODY:
 WHEN he isn't traveling the world for "Investigative Reports," the documentary series celebrating its 10th anniversary this week on A&E, Bill Kurtis is the anchose and producer of "Cold Case Files," a show under the "Investigative Reports" banner about crimes that have long remained unsolved. And when he isn't working on "Cold Case Files" he is the anchor of "American Justice," an A&E series that presents historical documentaries on high-profile crimes. Indeed, for fans of the long-form documentary, Mr. Kurtis seems all but ubiquitary. No less an authority than Dr. Jennifer Melfi, the psychotherapist played by Lorraine Bracco on "The Sopranos," observed on one episode, "I get all my information from the movies and Bill Kurtis." 
 Before this A&E affiliation, Mr. Kurtis, whose serious, buttoned-up mien and resonant voice lend a Rod Sterling-like portent to the subjects he covers, spent nearly two decades in television news, beginning in his native Kansas and continuing in Chicago, where he joined the local CBS affiliate. From 1982 to 1985, he was the anchor of "CBS Morning News" in New York, where he also produced hourlong documentaries for "CBS Reports." Since beginning the "Investigative Reports" series in 1991, he has tackled topics like the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Ritalin abuse, the Los Angeles riots and the disappearance of money put into Swiss bank accounts by Jews during World War II. 
 For such a champion of the long-form documentary, a tragedy as all-consuming as the terrorist attacks last month poses a special challenge. " '60 Minutes' and shows like it can get out a piece on some aspect of this event the next week," Mr. Kurtis said. "The fastest we've ever produced a full documentary is three months." Mr. Kurtis has sent crews to Lower Manhattan, Washington and the Pentagon to record the disaster recovery efforts although he is unsure of what aspect of the tragedy he'll cover. Before the attack, he had completed an "Investigative Reports" segment on bioterrorism to be shown on Nov. 6. Although the subject is very much in today's headlines, Mr. Kurtis's work on the segment - including a visit to a research complex in Obolensk, Russia, where Soviet scientists once labored to turn anthrax and other diseases into weapons - began a year ago.
 For the 10th anniversary of "Investigative Reports," Mr. Kurtis has prepared a two-hour special edition on the death penalty; he calls the program "perhaps our most mportant in 10 years." the catalyst for "Death Penalty on Trial" was the well-publicized exoneration of 13 death-row inmates in Illinois and the subsequent moratorium on executions in that state. To explore the issue, Mr. Kurtis focused on four cases. In one, a death-row inmate was represented by a lawyer who was abusing alcohol and cocaine at the time of the trial. Another involves a man on death row for 25 years after a blatantly biased judge unilaterally changed the life imprisonment sentence to death. The third is about a death-row inmate who contends that his confession was elicited under police torture. In the fourth, the prosecutor hid evidence that showed the star witness against the defendant was lying. One inmate died on death row; the other three remain there. None of them is unequivocally innocent.
 By eschewing cut-and-dired cases like those in Illinois, in which the accused were conclusively exonerated by DNA evidence, the documentary directs viewers' attention not to the question of guilt or innocence but to the fairness of the process that puts people on death row. "We agonized over the choice of subject," Mr. Kurtis said. "In the end we didn't want to leave the impression that this issue is black and white." In fact, Mr. Kurtis, who covered the Charles Manson trial as a correspondent for CBS News, was a supporter of the death penalty. "but if there's even a question of guilt, why kill the person?" he asks.
 Two weeks after "Death Penalty," "Investigative Reports" will be shown in two-hour blocks on Tuesday nights at 9. The first hour, "Investigative Reports: Criminal Justice," will feature crime-oriented documentaries, including some from "Cold Case Files." The second hour, "Investigative Reports: Special Edition," will look at hot-button issues in the areas of medicine, ethics, drugs, the environment and technology. The show will also feature a series of documentaries produced with Newsweek journalists, beginning with "Obesity and Kids" on Oct. 30 at 10 p.m.
 "The broadcast networks consider the long-form documentary a dinosaur," Mr. Kurtis said. But it is far from extinct on cable networks, with one-hour documentaries, including biographies, regularly featured even on unlikely outlets like Court TV and E! One important reason for the documentary's profliferation on cable is economics. Producing a one-hour documentary can cost as little as $150,000, Mr. Kurtis said, a relative pitance compared with the cost of producing a show like "E.R."
 At Kurtis Productions in Chicago, a full-time staff of 22 provides an unusual degree of continuity and stability in a field dominated by freelance crews. "Most docuemtnary producers have to do corporate videos to pay the bills," he said. "We're lucky to have enough volume to focus on making the types of shows we're interested in."
 Mr. Kurtis also credits A&E with being a supportive partner. He regularly pitches ideas for documentaries to the network's editorial staff, who decide if they reflect the identity of the series - "contemporary issues, but not too sensational," according to Mr. Kurts, who is eager to point out that "Investigative Reports" likes to take on a topic about which there are two distinct opinions and to explore it from the viewpoint of a curious outsider.
 " '60 Minutes' and 'Frontline' have definite points of view about the subjects they cover," he said. "We have no point of view, other than that old standby, 'Let the viewer judge.' "

Playing the Potential In Internet Security

BYLINE:  By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
STOCKS of companies that provide Internet security have been battered in the past year, but demand for their services appears to be on the rise. 
 Interest in antivirus software, fire walls, intrusion detection and other forms of Internet security has been heightened by fears of cyberattacks as the United States fights a war against terrorism, many experts say. Demand has also increased because of an outbreak of computer viruses that have slowed many corporate networks, and because of technological advances that permit remote access to networks but that can also grant entry to intruders. 
 Some analysts are optimistic that the increased demand will lead to improved stock prices. "We have probably seen the bottom," said Israel Hernandez, a senior research analyst and vice president for equity research at Lehman Brothers in San Francisco. But in light of the weak economy, he remained cautious about the outlook for the remainder of the year. 
The stocks tumbled after poor second-quarter earnings and slow revenue growth, he said, and one company, RSA Security, known for its SecurID technology to allow only authorized users remote access to corporate networks, announced a third-quarter loss of $15.5 million last week. Its stock now trades at $10.75, down 70 percent for the last 12 months.
"There are a lot of uncertainties," Mr. Hernandez said, and corporations will need a few months to approve budgets to bolster security. He expects the sector to rally when the economy recovers, probably in 2002.
Mr. Hernandez called Network Associates his top pick. "It has good antivirus software" for both companies and individuals, he said. "New management has done a really good job."
The stock, which closed on Friday at $18.38, is down 18 percent for the last 12 months but well above its 52-week low of $3.25 set on Dec. 27.
HE also recommends Internet Security Systems. Many large banks, corporations and government agencies hire the company, which is based in Atlanta, to handle their Internet security needs. Its shares, now at $19.01, are down 76 percent for the 12 months.
John Pescatore, research director for Internet security at Gartner Inc., which advises 10,000 corporate clients, agreed that Internet Security Systems could benefit from today's environment. 
"Since the terrorist attacks, there has been a growing interest in intrusion detection," he said, but the software is complex and in-house technicians "have been overwhelmed by false alarms." As a result, many companies prefer to retain outside experts for that work.
Symantec is active in all three areas of Internet security and serves both corporate and individual customers, he said.
Mary O'Rourke, a software research analyst at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis, likes Symantec's multifaceted approach and rates the stock a strong buy. "Security is going to get a bit of a push now," she said. Symantec's stock, which closed at $48.13 on Friday, has risen 11 percent in the last 12 months, the only one in the group to advance.
Ms. O'Rourke also has a strong buy rating on Check Point Software Technology, a leading provider of fire walls to cable and D.S.L. Internet service providers,, and VeriSign, which provides technology for secure Internet transactions. Check Point closed at $30.95, down 73 percent for the 12 months, while VeriSign now trades at $49.08, down 70 percent. 
But not everyone is convinced that Internet security stocks are a worthwhile investment. Peter Doyle, chief investment strategist at Kinetics Mutual Funds, where he specializes in Internet stocks, said he did not hold any of the security company shares and did not plan to jump in. "Many of the stocks tumbled because they were overvalued to begin with," said Mr. Doyle, who is based in New York.
"We are not optimistic about the underlying economics of this sector," he added. "It does not have the recurring business cycle we like," because most businesses already have security systems and expect the companies that provide them to provide upgrades as needed.
In addition, the field is competitive as well as volatile. Mr. Pescatore said the publicly traded companies that specialize in Internet security face competition from a number of small, privately held companies, as well as from big hardware and software providers like I.B.M., Cisco Systems and Computer Associates. 
Still, he expects demand for their services to grow. In recent weeks, he said, hackers increased attempts to breach the systems of the United States military, Israeli banks and American banks doing business with Israel.

Uncertainties All Around, but Stocks Climb

BYLINE:  By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
The United States rained bombs on Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden promised holy war. The F.B.I. warned of new terrorist attacks in the United States. 
And an anthrax scare spread from Florida to Manhattan. The stock market, however, showed some spunk.
 Demonstrating a surprising resilience to bad news, stocks ended the week higher and have now recovered nearly all the losses from the Sept. 11 terrorists attacks. Even news of disappointing earnings and a layoff of 7,000 workers at the technology bellwether Motorola had little effect on the market. 
 But analysts said stocks remained vulnerable to political and economic surprises. Many of the biggest blue-chip companies, like Citigroup, McDonald's, General Motors and Pfizer, report third-quarter earnings next week. Although expectations of weaker results from the economic slowdown have been built into the market, they said, any unexpected weakness from one of these companies could spread gloom.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 224.39 points, or 2.5 percent, to 9,344.16. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 20.27 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,091.65. The Nasdaq composite index rose 98.1 points, or 6.1 percent, to 1,703.40. RICK GLADSTONE

HEADLINE: Reconsidering Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
Moments of international crisis have a way of stripping away diplomatic facades and exposing uncomfortable truths. One of the disturbing realities clarified by last month's terror attacks is Saudi Arabia's tolerance for terrorism. Students of America's deeply cynical relationship with Riyadh have long known that the kingdom did little to discourage Islamic extremists, as long as they operated outside its borders, and that Washington muted its objections to keep oil flowing to the West. It is now clear that the Saudi behavior was more malignant. With Riyadh's acquiescence, money and manpower from Saudi Arabia helped create and sustain Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization.
 Over the decades, the United States and Saudi Arabia have benefited from the cold-blooded bargain at the core of their relationship. America got the oil to run its economy and Saudi Arabia got the protection of American military might whenever the kingdom was threatened by its violent neighbors, including Iraq and Iran. Now, as international affairs are reordered in the wake of the terror attacks, it is time for American and Saudi leaders to see if they can fashion a healthier relationship that still serves the interests of both countries but with greater frankness and honesty than in the past. 
 The Saudi royal family can begin that process by looking unblinkingly at its passive attitude toward terrorism. Osama bin Laden happens to come from a wealthy Saudi family, but that is not the issue. The problem is Saudi Arabia's tangible connections to Islamic fundamentalist terrorism.
Until recent weeks, Saudi Arabia was one of the two critical sponsors of Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement, along with Pakistan. Saudi money, religious teachings and diplomats helped the Taliban secure and keep control of Afghanistan. The country was then used to provide sanctuary and training camps for the bin Laden network. Saudi Arabia has also sponsored the fundamentalist academies known as madrassas in Pakistan. Many graduates of these madrassas have headed straight to Afghanistan, some to bin Laden training camps.
The Saudi government has allowed Saudi-based Muslim charitable organizations to funnel money to Al Qaeda and its terrorist network. On Friday, Washington moved against a prominent Saudi businessman said to be involved in these transfers. Since Sept. 11, Riyadh has refused pleas from Washington to freeze Mr. bin Laden's assets and those of his associates. Of the 19 hijackers who carried out last month's attacks, at least 10 were Saudi nationals. Riyadh has so far refused to cooperate fully with Washington's investigations of hijacking suspects. It has also barred Washington from using Saudi air bases to launch attacks against Afghanistan.
This is hardly the performance Americans expect from a country that is nominally its closest ally in the Persian Gulf region. It reflects the powerful tensions in Saudi society between the absolute rule of its worldly and Western-aligned royal family and the Islamic puritanism of the officially sanctioned Wahhabi sect on which the monarchy's legitimacy is built. In a closed political system, the only available outlet for criticism of government policies and corruption is Islamic fundamentalism. For some, that path has led to Pakistan and Afghanistan. For a small minority, it has led to terrorism and Al Qaeda. 
Washington's embrace of the Saudi royal family dates back to the era of Franklin Roosevelt. It has always been primarily about oil, but other factors have played a role, including Saudi investments in American Treasury bonds and the purchase of expensive American weapons systems. Since the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia has given American military forces limited access to its bases. Until now, the stream of Saudi oil and money has all but silenced serious American criticism of the royal family's pervasive corruption, its contempt for democracy and the appalling human rights abuses carried out in its name. 
There is no simple way to refashion this unsound relationship. The demise of the Saudi monarchy could well lead to the installation of an anti-Western fundamentalist theocracy like that in Iran. Nor can America and its allies abruptly close the Saudi oil spigot. Still, reforms are possible. The royal family has a self-interest in making Saudi Arabia more democratic to ease political pressures that now drive some Saudis to extremist groups and could eventually destabilize the kingdom itself. The monarchy should crack down on its own corruption and do a better job of distributing the nation's wealth so that economic inequities do not generate new legions of terrorists. Saudi temporizing on matters like freezing the assets of terrorist groups and their supporters must end immediately.
Washington's evasions need to cease as well. Pretending that Saudi Arabia is not a source of support for terrorism only invites further trouble. Muting criticism of corruption and political repression in the kingdom simply encourages these destructive habits. Over the longer term, the United States should be trying to develop alternative, environmentally sound sources of energy so that Western reliance on Saudi oil is reduced. 
Decades of equivocation and Hobbesian calculations have left American relations with Saudi Arabia in an untenable and unreliable state. The deformities must be honestly addressed before they do further damage to both nations.

HEADLINE: When Golden Arches Are Too Red, White and Blue 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
HOURS after the United States started its bombing raids in Afghanistan last week, the backlash began. In Pakistan, angry crowds vandalized McDonald's outlets in Islamabad and Karachi. In Indonesia, demonstrators burned an American flag outside a McDonald's restaurant in the resort town of Makassar and then stormed it, while across the country in Yogyakarta, other protesters blockaded yet another McDonald's. 
 Elsewhere, chanting throngs vented their displeasure with the policies of the United States government by descending on Pizza Hut restaurants, Dunkin' Donuts stands, a Nike store and even billboards for KFC, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and other symbols of American corporations. 
 Multinational businesses have long been the target of complaints about the Coca-Colonization of the planet, about globalization creating a McWorld in which people in a standardized and ultimately antiseptic global village are cowed into existing on Big Macs and fries. But the growing worries about what some people, even in Europe, see as American cultural imperialism sweeping the globe, as well as the events since Sept. 11, have infused the debate about culture and cuisine with the even more volatile issues of politics and religion. And some executives who have pinned their companies' futures on conquering fast-growing new markets around the world are wondering: Is globalization, the chosen growth strategy of so many, still going to work? 
"Globalization is going to be at a standstill for a while, until this high level of uncertainty diminishes," said Henry Kaufman, the economist and former vice chairman of Salomon Brothers. 
No company faces that issue more acutely than McDonald's, which registered more than half its sales last year from outside the United States, up from one-third of its sales 10 years ago. The McDonald's Corporation, based in Oak Park, Ill., is already in so many cities and towns in the United States that its executives concluded long ago that rapid growth of its namesake restaurants would have to come from abroad. If that option is denied, shareholders and Wall Street analysts are beginning to wonder, can the company thrive?
McDonald's and other major brands -- like Burger King, which was founded in Florida but is owned by Diageo P.L.C. of Britain, and KFC, which is owned by Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. of Louisville, Ky. -- said they were not considering scrapping their global ambitions or taming their expansionist hopes. But some branding experts said that, for indisputably American brands like McDonald's, global dominance now -- more than ever -- may be as much a liability as an asset.
"I definitely think the golden age of the global brand has passed," said Alan Brew, a corporate branding expert at Addison, a communications consulting company in San Francisco. "The great appeal of the global brand in the 50's, 60's and 70's was that it could be the same worldwide; that it's just a question of distribution. But you're getting a lot of reaction against that, particularly against the big American brands."
ASIDE from McDonald's, food and lifestyle brands like Coca-Cola and Nike have suffered various degrees of backlash after expanding aggressively around the globe -- some say too aggressively. Recently, Muslim clerics in Lucknow, India, urged the faithful to boycott all things American and British, including airlines, movies and television programs.
But McDonald's, which has planted its trademark golden arches outside more than 29,000 outlets in 120 countries, stands as one of the most visible and ubiquitous symbols of America in the world -- and is one of the most American of American companies, at least in the minds of foreigners. And because McDonald's has its distinctive outlets just about everywhere, from Andorra to Oman, it is much more exposed to shifting economics and political upheavals around the globe.
Despite all the success that McDonald's has had overseas -- and that success has been impressive, analysts and investors said -- its stores have been vandalized repeatedly by people angry about everything from genetically modified foods to globalization to United States foreign policy.
Even before the American strike against Afghanistan, McDonald's executives were trying to cope with a multitude of global problems. Profits have been hurt by the strong dollar and slowing economic growth in Latin America. Sales of burgers have been depressed by fears in Europe and Japan of mad cow disease.
Some branding experts say the McDonald's juggernaut may be slowing. The same may be true of Coca-Cola, they add.
"The world will not stand still and let one brand dominate," said Mr. Brew at Addison. "You can no longer sit in Atlanta and decide what people in Karachi are going to drink."
That may be why Coca-Cola is moving to sell more bottled water, tea and other noncarbonated beverages, and why McDonald's is looking into pizza. It certainly accounts for the two corporations' efforts to cast themselves as global companies with local operations, not insensitive American behemoths.
McDonald's executives declined to be interviewed for this article, but a spokesman repeated a longstanding corporate tenet: McDonald's, he said, is not an American company, but a global one owned and run by local people around the world. "We're a confederation of very local companies," said Jack Daly, the spokesman. 
McDonald's is so adamant that its outlets in France are French that two years ago, when the company came under attack as a symbol of American culinary and cultural imperialism, it ran print advertisements in France that poked fun at Americans and their food choices. One depicted a hefty American cowboy and said that although McDonald's was born in the United States, its food was made in France, by French suppliers using French products.
The problem is that many people around the world do not believe it. They see Coke and McDonald's as quintessentially American. The brands represent the hopes and aspirations of many people who admire the American spirit and business ingenuity -- not to mention the quick convenience of the products. But they also represent what people most despise about American culture: its seductive, indulgent and fast-paced lifestyle.
And because American brands dominate the global landscape -- 9 of the top 10 global brands are American, according to a recent survey by Interbrand, the branding consulting firm -- being Coke, McDonald's or CNN is problematic, academics and branding experts say. The lines between America, its foreign policy and its corporate brands are blurred, particularly in parts of the world where governments own or control oil companies, utilities and other big businesses. Americans are not simply a diverse, freedom-loving people, these experts say; to many others, they are the sum of their corporate identities.
"This is how people see America, the America of fast food, fast computers, MTV and Hollywood," said Benjamin R. Barber, author of the book "Jihad vs. McWorld" and a professor of political science at the University of Maryland. "This crisis has made clear that Americans have no idea how they're perceived around the world."
IN his 1995 book, recently reissued, Mr. Barber argues that there could be a coming clash of cultures between a globalized, standardized "McWorld" that everywhere looks and operates alike and a splintered, tribalistic world that will ultimately resist what it considers a threat to traditional cultures.
Coca-Cola is making war on the tea culture of India, he said, by trying to persuade people to drink more of its carbonated beverages. McDonald's is at war with the French idea of an almost sacred, lengthy mealtime. Often, he adds, American and Western companies are insensitive to the impact of their goods and images on other cultures.
"The McWorld cultivates its own resistance," Mr. Barber said in a telephone interview last week.
Multinational corporations "are engaged in a kind of symbolic war that other people perceive as a war on their culture," he added. "Most of the world is attracted to our brands, but they're angry about being seduced by them."
McDonald's officials strongly disagree. They say that the company is acutely sensitive to local cultures, that the stores are run and supplied by local people, and that this longstanding principle is one reason McDonald's has been so successful in expanding abroad.
In Saudi Arabia, for instance, single men must eat separately from women and children. In India, there is no beef or pork, but a vegetarian Maharaja Mac, the equivalent of a Big Mac. And in Japan, where the "r" sound is rarely pronounced, Ronald McDonald is known as Donald McDonald.
"We don't act local; we are local," said Walt Riker, a spokesman at McDonald's. "It's localization, not globalization. We're exporting the business dynamics."
Sporadic vandalism and violence are things the company said it had learned to live with; that is the price of being the largest restaurant chain in the world, and a major source of jobs around the world, with more than one million employees, executives said.
Some academics said McDonald's was so big that it was inevitable there would be jealousy, envy, anger and anti-establishment and anti-American sentiment directed at the golden arches.
"People think that if they can't get the U.S. embassy, McDonald's is the next best thing," said James L. Watson, editor of the book "Golden Arches East: McDonald's in East Asia" and a professor of anthropology at Harvard. "It's almost as identifiable as the Stars and Stripes, so they think it's the next best surrogate."
Mr. Watson said he had spent 20 years interviewing McDonald's customers in East Asia. For the last 10, he has also tracked attacks on McDonald's franchises. So far he has registered attacks in about 50 countries. He and others say, though, that the attacks come from a tiny minority who inflate the significance of McDonald's because of what the company symbolizes.
"It represents American popular culture and many of the features that people might now loathe and despise," he said. "The middle classes love it but the intelligentsia and the guardians of culture find it troubling. From their perspective, this is an overarching foreign policy. We don't use the Marine Corps or the Delta Force; we use McDonald's to dominate."
Marketing experts say that in the short run, the vandalism is not likely to cost McDonald's much in terms of lost sales. After all, it is a $40 billion global enterprise. But the array of troubles the fast-food franchiser now faces may be a sign of something much deeper. Perhaps McDonald's and America's other big corporate brands have expanded too quickly, too aggressively. Perhaps they have exposed the public, here and abroad, to too many marketing images, golden arches, smiling colonels, swooshes and other logos. Perhaps the small, underground resistance is a sign of things to come: a feeling that the globe and the market are supersaturated.
WALL STREET analysts are also beginning to consider such a possibility.
"Even pre-Sept. 11, there were some very real concerns about whether McDonald's had grown too aggressively around the globe and whether they had reached the saturation point in some of these markets," said Andrew Barish, an analyst at Banc of America Securities.
The problem may be in the United States, where McDonald's has been trying to cope with a fully developed market since the mid-1990's. To drive growth, the company moved aggressively overseas, expanding to about 15,000 restaurants outside the United States today from about 3,000 a decade ago.
"McDonald's is like the British empire was," said Eric Schlosser, author of "Fast Food Nation." "It looks enormous on the map, but it expanded because there were core economic problems at home."
McDonald's is hedging by investing in different, faster-growing kinds of restaurants, outlets that sell everything from pizza to upscale coffee. But a significant crimping of growth abroad would be grim news for the company, as it would be for many others. And it may be unavoidable.
"I think there is a grave danger for American companies," Mr. Brew said. "The world is no longer a bigger version of the U.S. What plays in Peoria doesn't necessarily play in Poland."

HEADLINE: Clinton at Yale: Optimistic on Crisis, But Work Is Ahead 

 BODY:
FORMER President Bill Clinton wrapped up Yale University's yearlong 300th birthday celebration with a speech on globalization and the current crisis to about 8,000 people on campus on Oct. 6. Following is a portion of that speech as recorded by Yale.
 I was fortunate enough to be here at Yale Law School with a phenomenal number of outstanding men and woman who were my fellow students. One of them did become the United States senator from New York. Senator Clinton went to Harvard. Meeting Hillary was the best thing that happened to me at Yale, and maybe the only thing that really stuck over all of these 30 years. I understand there was some discussion here in the Yale community about whether this tercentennial should go forward in the aftermath of the awful events of the Sept. 11. I thank you for going forward. It is what President Bush asked us to do when he asked us get on with our lives, and it is particularly important at this time. 
 Marking 300 years of learning at any time would be a significant event. But marking it at this time with a commitment to be a truly global university is obviously profoundly important. For 300 years, before the Declaration of Independence, Yale has taught young people the wisdom of the past, the analysis of the present and the importance of looking to the future. Yale has asked hard questions and looked for honest answers. That is what I found here years ago, and that is what I see when I look out on this vast array of faces today.
America is full of hard questions now. And I have spent a great deal of the last three weeks in Manhattan, visiting the crisis center, visiting ground zero, visiting fire stations and police headquarters, going to three schools, two of them double schools because the children were blown out of their schools by the events of Sept. 11. And I have found so many questions. Hillary and I went to an elementary school in lower Manhattan, where 9- and 10-year-old students asked me these questions: Why do they hate us so much anyway? How did that guy get all those people to commit suicide? I never thought I would hear a 9-year-old ask a question like that.
I have gotten calls from women friends of Hillary's and mine who are the mothers of young children from all over America with a simple question. 'Bill, is it going to be all right? Tell me it is going to be all right.' Well, first of all, it is going to be all right. I can tell you that.
Terrorism, the killing of innocent people for political or religious or economic reasons, is as old as organized combat. It has gone on a very long time. If we searchingly look through history honestly, we find it in uncomfortable places. In the crusade in which the European Christians seized Jerusalem, they slaughtered 300 Jews and killed every mother and child on the Temple Mount who was Muslim. But no campaign of terror standing on its own without organized military combat has ever succeeded in all of human history. Indeed, it is not the purpose of terror to succeed militarily. It is the purpose of terror to terrify, and I would guess a lot of young people in this audience today who have never lived through such a difficult crisis were understandably terrified. And what is sought from the terror is the people who are afraid.
First of all, in a vast and diverse country like ours, you see we have got people here from just about every country, every racial and ethnic group and every religious heritage. What is sought is, first of all, to make us afraid of each other. And secondly, to make us afraid of the future. We are afraid to plan; afraid to invest; afraid to trust, that is what they seek. Therefore, terrorism cannot prevail unless we cooperate. It is not a military strategy, it is a psychological and human one. We have to give the people that attacked us permission to win. I do not believe we are about to grant them that permission.
Mr. Bin Laden and his allies misjudge America. They think we are fundamentally a weak, greedy, selfish, materialistic people. They think we are weakened by a lack of international religion and imposed social order. But, they are wrong. All Americans have been proud in these last days of the performance of our leaders, to the president, to the governor, to the mayor of New York, yes, to the senators. I am very proud of my wife and her colleagues and the House and the Senate, but especially the people. 
When I went into the family crisis center the first day, a man came up to me and said to me: 'Why Mr. President, I haven't seen you since Oklahoma City.' And I said: 'How did I see you there?' He said: 'You came to console me. My wife was blown up in the bombing of Oklahoma City and I had no one to talk to. So when I saw that this happened, I went in to my job and I told my boss I was taking two weeks off, and I got in my car and I drove here -- and I sit here all day, every day talking to people. I had no one to talk to and I thought I might be of help.'
I have visited many of the firemen. The fire department is a marvelous organization in the modern world. It is more like a medieval army where instead of sitting and issuing orders, the leaders lead. And so in our fire department, we lost three top aides, the chaplain and some 200 other officers, 340 killed, necessitating over 200 promotions, because no one took a backseat when it came to sacrifice.
I think those who believed we would be weakened by this have misjudged us. All over America there has been a tremendous outpouring of caring -- over $600 million given from Americans. I thank the workers and the people at Yale for the work you did for those who have lost loved ones or feared they had. We are going to be all right.
STILL, we must realize that we have a formidable adversary and a difficult challenge. Partly, because in every conflict throughout human history, defense lags offense by a little bit, and we got caught not being caught up. This has always happened. But so far the human race is still around because self preservation and decency catches up and triumphs. Nevertheless, I think we have to take this seriously and see it for exactly what it is. I believe we are engaged for the first great struggle of the soul of the 21st century. We must understand terrorism in the context of the modern world. And we have to ask ourselves what we have to do, not only to prevent terrorism and protect ourselves, but to undermine the conditions and attitudes that bring to terrorists' banners their foot soldiers and sympathizers.
If I had asked you on Sept. 10 the following question, what would your answer be? What is the dominant trait of the world in the early 21st century? If you are an optimistic person, it seems to me you might have given one of four answers. You might have said, well, it is the globalization of the economy and culture that has lifted more people out of poverty in the last 20 years than any time in all history and brought America unparalleled wealth and opportunity, including the opportunity for, first, immigrants from all over the world.
Or you might have said if you are a "techie," it is the information technology revolution. When I became president in January 1993, there where 50 sites on the World Wide Web. When I left office, there were 350 million. There was never anything like it in the history of communications.
Or you might have said if you were a scientist, it's the evolution in the sciences. Last year we found two new species of life, in two previously unexplored rivers. The human genome has been sequenced and soon women will bring home babies from the hospital with little gene cards saying here are the kids' problems and the kids' strengths. And very soon babies born in America and any country with a good health system will have a life expectancy in excess of 90 years. We have scientists working on digital chips to replicate the nerve functions of damage in the spinal cord and raising the prospects that a chip might do for a spine what a pacemaker might do for the heart. And people thought permanently paralyzed might get up and walk. And all of this is truly amazing.
Or if you are a political scientist you might say the dominant theory of this period is the explosion of democracy around the world and diversity at home. Just for the last three years for the first time in human history, more than half the world lives under governments of their own choosing. This never happened before. And in our country and indeed in most other countries with a strong economy, there is an absolute explosion of diversity. America is a lot more interesting place than it was 30 years ago. If we had this meeting 30 years ago, you wouldn't look like you do. And it's a lot more fun to be here, and a lot more educational and a lot more exciting because of that. 
It seems to me if you are optimistic on Sept. 10 when I said what is the dominant strength of the 21st century world, you could have given one of those four answers. The global economy, the explosion of democracy around the world and diversity, and the scientific evolution.
On the other hand, if you are a little more pessimistic, or if you are what Hillary refers to in our family as her being the designated worrier, you might have mentioned four negative things. You might have said all those things are just fine, but the environmental crisis facing us is so great that they all threaten to engulf all the progress and let it go away. Nine of the hottest years ever recorded occurred in the last 12. If the climate warms at the same rate in the next 50 years as it has in the last 10, we will lose 50 feet of the Florida everglades, agriculture will be disrupted all over the world and millions and millions of food refugees will be created and there will be a lot more violence out there.
There is a terrible water shortage in the world already and one in four people on the globe never get a clean glass of water. There is a serious deterioration in the floor of our oceans, which are responsible for so much of our oxygen. And you could say it doesn't look to me like there is much going on about this and if we don't reverse these we will be having terrible problems. 
OR you could say no, no, before that happens, we will be engulfed by a health crisis, the breakdown of health all over the world. This year one in four people in the world will die of AIDS, TB, malaria or infections related to diarrhea. Thirty-six million people will have AIDS within five years. The fastest-growing rates are in the former Soviet Union on Europe's back door, and in the Caribbean on our front door, and in any of the world's greatest democracies. And China just admitted they have twice as many AIDS cases as they had previously thought. And only 4 percent of the adults know how the disease is contracted and spread. You could say when we have 100 million AIDS cases it will collapse a lot of these democracies, and it is a recipe for total turmoil and violence.
Or you could say, no, the real problem is the flip side of globalization. Half the world's people are really not part of it. It is true that more people have been lifted out of poverty by globalization in the last 20 years than ever before. It is also true that half the people in the world still live on less than $2 a day. That a billion of our people still live on less than $1 a day. And think about it the next time you buy a cup of coffee. A billion go to bed hungry every night, and one woman dies every minute in childbirth. And that is a recipe for revolution, compounded by the fact that 100 million of our children in the globe never go to school at all: half the kids in Africa and a quarter of the kids in East Asia and Indian subcontinent. So you might have said that.
Or even on Sept. 10, you might have said, no, the biggest problem is going to be terrorism, coupled with weapons of mass destruction and rooted in racial and religious and ethnic hatred.
And here is what I would like to say. Whether you would have given a positive answer, or a negative answer, there is something that all eight of these elements, positive and negative, have in common. They all reflect the astonishing increase in global interdependence. The extent of which we have seen the collapse of distances and barriers, bringing us closer together for good or ill. Terrorism is simply the dark side of our increasing interdependence. We have not repealed human nature or the fact some people see reality very differently than we do. And it was inevitable, if we take down all the barriers, if we open the society, that people who represent organized forces of destruction would take advantage of the very forces that could make us richer, more diverse, and made our lives better. Therefore, all the great questions of the 21st century boil down to one: Is this new age going to be good or bad on balance for me, my family, my community, my nation and the world? 
What do we have to do to make sure that we encourage the positive forces of independence and that we restrain the negative ones? I'd like to make three points. First, first things first, we have to defend ourselves against terrorism. I want you to know that there are good people, lots of them, who have been working on this for years. And I want you to know that there were many, many more attacks that were planned on the United States which were thwarted by our public servants and our allies. In the last millennium alone there was plan for a bomb in Boston, a bomb in Seattle, a bomb for Los Angeles airport, and half a dozen other plans all thwarted. There are good people who are working hard.
Nonetheless, clearly there is more to do to build our defenses, to build our ability to be offensive, to build our capacity to maximize computer networks to ward off people who mean us harm. I don't want to say more about that right now because the president and national security teams and our allies have some tough technical decisions to make. And I think we ought to stick with them and give them the room to make decisions. So far they have been making good decisions, and we have no reason to believe they won't do so in the future. I think it is important for America to stay united. We are and we must stay that way. And I will say again, I know it was frightening to have the first massive attack on American soil. And nothing can minimize the humans lost. 
BUT let me remind the young people here, that the century we just left was the bloodiest in all human history. Twelve million died in World War I, 20 million in World War II and another 20 million from government oppression after the war, not counting the million that died in Vietnam. And the world has never been free of violence. And we took down the walls and collapsed the businesses. We were independent and therefore all the things that we have benefited from in this global economy, sharing with it the price tag of being vulnerable to those who would do us harm. But we will catch up and that will be handled. What we have to do as citizens is to think about what else has to be done and what else we personally can do. We have to lead an assault on the conditions of negative independence and create more opportunities for positive independence.
Americans should continue to work to reduce poverty, with things like more debt relief, more micro credit, more sensible trade. America should contribute its fair share to the secretary general's health fund to fight the AIDS epidemic and other health problems. America should deal with the challenge of climate change through conservation, through the development of alternative energy, through helping our friends and neighbors throughout the world do the same. America should continue to promote democracy.
One particular problem we have in the present crisis is that so many people who hear the siren song of radical fundamentalism live in countries growing ever larger, ever younger and ever poorer where there is no democracy or chance to express dissent or even assent in a normal political way. And it keeps the populous in a state of sort of permanent infancy, in which you never have to take responsibility for your own lives and making it better, because you never get to take responsibility.
And, therefore, it is very easy to listen to someone say your problems were caused by America's success. It's a hard case to make because people from all of those countries come to America and they share in that success. It is a hard case to make, because America last used military power to protect poor Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo. But nonetheless, if you never get to vote for office, you never get to stand up in a public forum and say what you think, you are permanently disempowered. And you could hear the siren song; it is all because of America. So, we have to keep urging our friends to find ways to move to greater democracy and freedom. 
And finally, let me say this. Even more important than what we do, is who we are. We must understand that this present conflict, as agonizing as the loss was, is about far more than the buildings collapsing and the people dying. This is about a global force with a fundamentally different view of the nature of truth, the value of life, the character of human community. Mr. Bin Laden and the Taliban believe they have the truth. And everybody that agrees with them is good, and everybody that doesn't is evil. This great university is dedicated to the proposition that nobody has the absolute truth. We all get to vote. We have the right to freedom of speech. We have the right of freedom of religion. We have the right of freedom of assembly. And we have the responsibilities of a free people because we believe that fundamentally life is a journey because we move closer and closer to the truth. But because we are finite human beings we never will achieve it.
THEREFORE, we don't have the right to impose our iron will on others. And the more the merrier, with the thought that together we might find more truth. That is a fundamental difference. And it leads people to a different view of the value of human life.
Because we believe that we are all traveling on this journey together, we have come over time, more and more and more to value all life. To think that everybody counts, that everybody deserves a chance. But for them, they believe there are three kinds of people. There are the people that will embrace their particular views of Islam. And then there are the Muslims who don't agree with their views of the Koran, who keep saying that Allah put different people on the earth not that they might despise one another, but that they might get to know one another and learn from one another. They hate that in Afghanistan.
And the rest of us who are not Muslims are infidels. We are all combatants in the war and we all deserve what happens to us, including death, even if it's a 6-year-old girl who decided on the morning of Sept. 11 to go with her mother to work in the World Trade Center. 
Of all the things that I have seen and been moved by in these last few weeks, the thing I will carry with me to the grave is the lines of the victims' families holding their little fliers, because for days and days and days, people didn't know whether their loved ones were in the building when it was hit. But they all made up fliers. And they had pictures of their loved ones. This is my wife, my husband, my brother, my sister, my mother, my father, my child, here is the picture.
And outside, often in handwriting, this is what floor they were on, this is how tall they were, this is how much they weighed. All these people holding these pictures, there were Indians and Pakistanis, Japanese, Chinese, British, and German, Mexicans, Chileans, there were people from every conceivable religious faith. They were all there. A stunning rebuke, to the people they thought they had the right to kill them because they had the whole truth.
We believe in a different character of community. We believe we all do better when we work together. And all you have to do in our country is to accept the rules of engagement. Our rules about everybody counting, everybody getting to vote. People who will have to show up every day to do what is right. It gives us the freedom to celebrate our diversity that we could be united by our common humanity. Their community is not united by common humanity, it is united by what it is not.
And Mr. Bin Laden has a political agenda. He wants to take over Saudi Arabia, get rid of Israel and purge the whole Middle East of all the apostates so they all look like the Taliban. What a dreary world. We have seen in the pictures on television from that movie "Behind the Veil," what their ideas are like, forcing women to wear those horrible burqas -- and beating them with sticks in public and worse. But this is a formidable adversary because they do not believe they are evil. They believe they are doing good. 
THE most important thing over and above anything we do, is that we have in our minds clearly the world we are trying to make, that our wealth is not an end in itself, but a tool for the people to live up to their God-given abilities, that we keep struggling to get beyond the categories of difference to our common humanity. And we should never be blind to how difficult it is going to be. Think of the great spirits of the last 50 years, Gandhi killed, not by a Pakistani Muslim, but by one of his own Hindus who hated him because he wanted India for the Muslims, the Sikhs, for everybody. Sadat killed by the organization that Mr. Bin Laden's No. 2 heads now, not by an Israeli, but by an Egyptian who hated him for reaching across the religious and ethnic bloody divide to make peace.
My friend Yitzhak Rabin -- a lifetime of defending Israel, killed, not by a Palestinian terrorist, but by an Israeli who hated him because he wanted to lay down arms and take up peace. This is hard. I thank God that of all the great spirits of the last 50 years, Mandela survived, probably only because he first had to pay with 27 of the best years of his life being in jail. It is hard. To get people beyond the notion that they are defined by their differences and not by their common humanity.
But you can do it by living it and you can do it by recognizing that it is time to take America's eternal mission to the world. A mission to widen the circle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of freedom, to strengthen the bonds of community. We can no longer deny others what we claim for ourselves. That is the ultimate lesson for the independent world.
We are going to get through this crisis. Our leaders are going to make good decisions. But in the end, we not only have to stop bad things from happening, we have to build for you, the best, the most prosperous, the most peaceful and exciting time the world has ever known. And we can do it, if we remember who we are and what we believe.

HEADLINE: THE AGE OF DISSONANCE; 
The Money Culture Fizzles

BYLINE:  By BOB MORRIS

 BODY:
IT wasn't the hottest ticket in town last week (that was probably a tour of ground zero with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani) but there was a crowd waiting on West 67th Street on Wednesday to see a taping of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." This was not my idea of fun. But my decidedly nonmaterialistic parents looked thrilled. They adore Regis Philbin and his mild-mannered show.
 The shiny circular set had images of dollar signs everywhere, imposing as church windows, and suggesting in an unseemly way that we are still what we make and wear and drive. Mr. Philbin stepped out from the wings in a banker-blue suit. "I guarantee you're going to see a millionaire on this stage tonight," he told us. "I can guarantee it because it's me." It may have been the only place in town where people were celebrating money again. 
 Let's face it, this is a time when we're supposed to be raising money for others, saving money in the event of a job loss or spending it as a quasi-patriotic act. Amassing more for fun is out.
"Is it O.K. to think about money now?" asks the new issue of Money magazine, which answers, in a somber editorial, yes, but not like before. "Managing our money is no end in itself," writes Walter Updegrave, an editor. "It is only a means, a way for us to create wealth that we can share with our families and others, a road to a life that offers meaning and fulfillment." Who would have thought that the same money-hungry culture that created the New Economy and "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" would have become so philosophical? 
In the weeks after Sept. 11, some financial companies that expected a high volume of calls from jittery investors didn't receive many at all. "Our clients are less concerned about their portfolios than other aspects of their lives," said Paul Beirne, a principal at Alliance Capital. "They know they have to have other priorities these days."
"Breathing precedes being rich," added James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and author of "The Trouble With Prosperity" (Times Books, 1996).
Even now, when the markets are creeping back up, the big money talk in New York is about the $1 billion freeze in city spending and $54 billion in requested federal assistance. And the wealthy aren't thinking about getting wealthier. They're thinking about getting out of town.
"I feel lucky to have options," said Ilona Rich, the daughter of Denise Rich and an artist-turned fashion designer who left her Charles Street town house to stay in Southampton for a month. "Not that Long Island is that safe. Where do you go if you have to evacuate? Who wants to be freezing on a boat off Long Island? I think we should all relocate to the Bahamas and start businesses there." 
There are those who would like us to get back on the horse. "There shouldn't be any shame associated with wealth, especially now," said Ken Kurson, a financial writer. "The heart of our financial markets were hit, and those markets represent freedom, not a greedy accumulation of assets. The markets are what allow you to pursue the fulfillment of your goals and dreams."
True, but in such nightmarish times, there's no denying that a once-fizzy money culture has gone flat. It isn't just the giddy obsessions with wait-listed handbags, restaurant reservations and year-end bonuses that has fallen off. It's all the talk about it. Discretion, once integral to a moneyed life, is back. 
"People are embarrassed to call in light of what's happening," said my usually perky stockbroker at Chase. "And if they come in we don't talk about stocks. One client had a nervous breakdown in my office. I find myself being more psychologist than financial adviser." 
She sounded so glum that I was inspired to cheer her up and asked if it was possible to buy stock in the maker of Ativan, a trendy new anti-anxiety medication. Was it a public company? Was it morally wrong to want to get out of tech and into drugs?
"Your call is certainly unique," my investor said brightly, "but it's very nice." Who wants to be a millionaire? I do, I confess, and maybe that's O.K. It might even be patriotic. 
"Money can't buy happiness," my mother said as we watched Mr. Philbin's show.
Maybe not, but it can buy a week in the Bahamas.

HEADLINE: The 'Freedom' America Forgot 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman ("It's Freedom, Stupid," column, Oct. 9) insists that the "animating vision of America in the world is the promotion and protection of freedom." His definition of freedom consists of freedom of speech, religion, politics and "freedom of markets" -- that is, economic globalization. 
 In practice, this last freedom has meant allowing multinational corporations to shift resources across the globe in an endless search for lower wages and looser labor standards. It involves empowering institutions over which there is no semblance of democratic control, like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to dictate national economic policies. What kind of freedom is that? 
 Mr. Friedman should look at the Allies' war aims in World War II as embodied in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Four Freedoms -- freedom of speech and religion, freedom from fear and freedom from want. During the cold war, this last disappeared from official rhetoric as vaguely socialistic. But it is a worthier goal than the pursuit of profit heedless of the human consequences, even if wrapped in the language of freedom.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Man the Martinis? That Bridge Is Too Far

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
IN this time of national crisis, Americans are being asked to shoulder new burdens. This is to be expected. But there is one challenge that even the most patriotic citizen may not be able to meet. I refer to the three-martini lunch.
 In an effort to stimulate the economy, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have come up with far-reaching and often ingenious tax proposals and spending ideas. It's a measure of their resolve that their gaze has fixed on a cultural artifact that has been gathering dust since the Carter era. 
 Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and the majority whip Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, recently proposed a $40 billion stimulus package that would make business meals fully deductible. Current law allows a write-off of 50 percent on a business meal. That means breakfast, lunch or dinner, but the tax deductible meal is forever fixed in the public imagination as the three-martini lunch. A spokesman for Senator Reid said, "Writing off the full cost of business meals would achieve the three aims of encouraging consumers to spend, putting people back to work in the hard-hit hospitality industry and easing tax burdens on employers."
There is a flaw in the plan. Americans are not capable of drinking three martinis at lunch. Weakened by decades of white-wine spritzers and designer mineral waters, they can barely hoist a Bud Lite. At this late date, a three-martini lunch would kill them. In fact, conspiracy-minded analysts might well wonder whether this part of the stimulus package was not in fact sneaked past the F.B.I. and the C.I.A.
Like "twenty-three skidoo" and "here come de judge," the phrase "three-martini lunch" needs to be explained to Americans under the age of 60. Believe it or not, there was a time in the history of the republic when solid, upstanding (at least at the beginning of lunch) professionals would gather at a restaurant and, over a leisurely meal, consume three martinis. In the golden age of the three-martini lunch, from, say, 1945 to 1975, this behavior was not considered abnormal. It was a way of doing business, especially on Madison Avenue.
Public sentiment began to change in the 1970's, however. Jimmy Carter railed against the three-martini lunch as an unfair subsidy. Sober, hard-working taxpayers of modest means were being asked to pay the bill for lavish-spending fat cats. It was not until 1986, however, that Congress succeeded in whittling away the three-martini perk, cutting the rate from 100 percent to 80 percent. In 1993, Bill Clinton tamped the rate down to 50 percent as part of his deficit reduction legislation.
Now, even if the full deduction is restored, it may be too late to reap the benefits. The generation that put the three-martini lunch on the map, the greatest generation, is much older now. My own feeling is that those Americans who lived through the Depression and fought to victory in World War II have served their country and deserve a rest. It is too much to ask them to drink three martinis.
No, the burden falls to a younger generation. And the prospects of success look bleak. What have they been drinking in the peace-filled interval between 1974 and the present? Cosmopolitans, which are a kind of vodka Kool-Aid, and all manner of mixed drinks that make the Shirley Temple look like a Zombie. Their martinis, tinted every color of the rainbow, merely advertise their moral weakness.
There is one way out. The martini has been redefined, repositioned, deconstructed and reconstructed so many times that it might as easily be a glass filled with salmon mousse, marinated squid or chocolate pudding as a blend of gin and vermouth garnished with an olive. With restaurants struggling to bounce back, it would not take a genius to print up a three-martini tasting menu and advertise it as a tax-relief special. The only worry for today's executive will be disguising the telltale signs of fish breath.

HEADLINE: BACKTALK; 
Stock Car Racing as Major-College Sport? Why Not?

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
Someday, when the beer gods are smiling, someone who looks like Britney Spears will cry, "Student-athletes, start your engines!" and the first season of intercollegiate Nascar will roar to life.
 What are we waiting for? Why isn't stock car racing a big-time college sport? 
 Although merging the seemingly clashing cultures of Nascar, a covert family business, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, a bloated bureaucracy, will require commitment and diplomacy, the results will assure their futures.
College sports, their costs rising and their transgressions becoming less forgivable, will be able to further commercialize without losing control of their tenuous affiliation with higher education. 
Stock car racing, its costs rising and its blue-collar fans and corporate sponsors in an economic crunch, will be able to reach out to an affluent audience that will give it new cachet.
This brilliant idea, my best of the century so far, crystallized two weeks ago in Madison, Wis. It was the day after the N.C.A.A. dropped the other shoe, so to speak, on the University of Wisconsin's football and basketball teams for violating the basic rule of college sports: athletes must not profit from their work.
For years, the owner of one of the Midwest's largest shoe stores had been giving deep discounts and interest-free loans to athletes. The Wisconsin program was tied into the violations because the shoe store owner was a major public booster of Badger teams. Wisconsin may also have been a target because it has been among the national leaders in N.C.A.A. rules violations.
Once The Wisconsin State Journal exposed the favored treatment of athletes, the university hurriedly gave itself penalties. While I was there, coincidentally I hope, the N.C.A.A. trumped Wisconsin's self-inflicted wrist slaps with sterner, yet still not particularly harsh, penalties. My favorite was the N.C.A.A.'s depriving Wisconsin of two football scholarships a year out of the 85 it is currently allowed to hand out.
One of the 13 basketball scholarships was also taken away, and the basketball coach said, "Our stick will be a little bit smaller and we'll have to swing it a little harder." 
That afternoon, swinging my own small stick, I admitted to a group of students, faculty and administrators that I thought the penalties were absurd and the violations inconsequential in a system that was basically corrupt.
Punishing Wisconsin for the so-called Shoebox scandal was like busting murderers for income tax evasion; it proved the N.C.A.A. did not have the will to tear down its termite-ridden house.
A senior administrator, with that certain air of pity for another's lack of information, an air best breathed among members of the State Department, explained the real purpose of college football. The games, he said, offered a unique opportunity for university officials to entertain and chat up the executives of major corporations in the state. Once seduced by the sight of thousands of undergraduates with their cheeks painted red and white, these executives would surely lobby state legislators for more funds for university teams.
That's when it hit me.
Imagine, I thought later, those executives in boozy skyboxes watching a Big Ten stock car race, or in the pits watching a coed crew change tires, or in the garage watching science majors rebuild an engine. After that, they would surely wring millions out of state legislators, maybe enough for a few library books, too. 
And with Nascar steering, the only petty business would be Richard. N.C.A.A. rules forbid athletes to be offered perquisites not available to other students (other than full tuition, books, training table, gut courses, term paper ghostwriters and, in some instances, freedom from literacy). Meanwhile, Nascar is always rewarding the more successful racing teams with perks that start with preferred parking and garage space and go on to favored financial packages. And when that's not enough to lubricate the engines, Nascar tweaks the rules of racing itself to keep control and competitive balance.
Intercollegiate Nascar, afloat on a river of beer, will be a model merger. It may have to be a spring sport so as not to eclipse football. Because women will be welcome (a problem for Nascar at first), there will be no Title IX issues; in fact, it may even help some universities that have had to drop wrestling and men's swimming to reach compliance. Minorities will, of course, also be welcome, an even bigger problem for Nascar. In the long run, however, it will mean broadening the talent and fan pool, and the Nascar royal family will decree equality.
For starters, it would make sense to follow the existing conferences and traditional rivalries of college football. One can only imagine the excitement when cars representing the various Florida universities or the Texas universities are competing against each other, and how meaningful those wrecks will be. Even the Ivy League would be exciting, although one would insist on special heavy-duty head and neck restraints to protect those valuable Harvard and Yale brains. 
On the other hand, just to temper their natural aggressiveness, drivers from, say, Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana universities will be made to drive in their underwear. Nascar would call that restrictor pants racing. 
One can only imagine the stampede of computer, apparel, automobile and beer companies to sponsor cars. What a way to develop brand loyalty. Nascar, which prides itself on being the most "commerce friendly" of major sports, will make sure that even the likes of Reed and Carleton Colleges in their little Go Kart Conference will at least have Barnes & Noble and Borders logos.
And then there's Division I. Imagine the University of Michigan Cadillac with its Apple, Nike, Heineken and Victoria's Secret logos storming into a turn with the Michigan State Mercury, wearing the paint of Microsoft, Reebok, Coors and the Gap, trying to slingshot past. 
Imagine the screaming in the skyboxes, the bingeing in the infield, the understanding professors working up Nascar major courses on the anthropology of moonshining, the history of the carburetor, the denial of death.
Education can't get higher than that.

The Stuff of Patriotism, And Cheap, Too

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR

 BODY:
FOR weeks, the nation's leaders have called on Americans to return to the rhythms of their lives: to get back on airplanes, go see a show and generally try to keep the economy running. On Thursday, in a news conference about the American strikes on Afghanistan in response to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, President Bush repeated the suggestion. "We cannot let the terrorists achieve the objective of frightening our nation to the point where we don't conduct business, or people don't shop," he said.
 Retailers, who responded to the attacks by replacing sales efforts with ads expressing sympathy and fortitude, have -- for better or worse -- led the way back to business as usual. After all, if shopping is normal, so is all manner of selling. JAYSON BLAIR 
 Cafepress.com, which helps companies sell merchandise on the Web, has over 200,000 clients. Many of them are now selling special designs to raise money for the Red Cross Liberty Fund. One, Newgrounds (www.cafepress.com /newgrounds911), has T-shirts and a mouse pad with a "Have you seen me?" milk carton picture of Osama bin Laden: 
America is Angry, and Newgrounds is here to help! Osama Mousepad. $14.99. Rub it in his face.
In Manhattan, merchants are hawking 
T-shirts that say "America Under Attack" and "I Can't Believe I Got Out," as well as hats and handkerchiefs that read "Evil Will Be Punished." The site www.tshirtterrority .com offers khaki and gray World Trade Center T-shirts for $17.99 to $22.99:
Click here to show your support for the victims with the "In Memory of the Victims" T-shirt. It is a 100 percent cotton longsleeve T-shirt. "In Memory of the Victims of The World Trade Center" on both front and back.
Buttons have also become hot items. From DiscountPrinter.com:

Mailings from Dreamcloud Productions, a California company, began arriving in New Yorkers' mailboxes last week, advertising its Dreamhelmet with an American flag on its side. The Dreamhelmet, a pillow that covers the eyes with a sleep mask and the ears with sound-muffling material, was created to help people sleep on planes, but it blocks out sirens, too. 
Dreamhelmet protects the head and keeps the head and ears warm while sleeping. . . . All Dreamhelmets now include secret pockets to hide valuables, money, or your alarm watch! Soft foam earplugs are also included free of charge! . . . Dreamhelmet is made in the USA! 
Bloomingdale's is offering a 4 1/2-inch by 2 3/4-inch Waterford crystal flag for $99. Its newspaper advertisements say:
The Emblem of the Land We Love. Waterford's poignantly Grand Old Flag in brilliant clear crystal. Honoring our past. Saluting our future. Reminding us now more than ever of freedom, tolerance and bravery. . . . Reserve yours now in person or call toll free. . . . 
Within a few days of the attacks, people were approaching family members of victims -- many of whom feared their loved ones' bodies might not be recovered -- offering to sell them soil from the site. After receiving reports from one of the city's consumer affairs officials, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, in a daily news briefing, told people to be wary:
We're going to have an urn prepared for the families in which we can give them something from the World Trade Center -- soil from the World Trade Center. I make that announcement now because we have found out that some people are trying to sell something from the World Trade Center to families. So no one is going to sell anything from the World Trade Center. We're going to give it to you. 
So if anybody comes along and wants to sell you something, they're fraudulent, they're deceiving you and we will provide every single family with an urn made in beautiful wood with soil from the World Trade Center. And that will be done over the course of the next several weeks. 
It might take a little longer than that but we're in the process of doing it. So don't buy anything from anyone because they're probably, almost definitely, defrauding you. 
The post office did its best to promote patriotism, repackaging some of its stamps into a $13.60 "combo pack" that includes stamps picturing the American flag, the White House and the American kestrel:
Honor the Heroes of 9.11.01 with our Honoring America Combo pack. 
On eBay, the Internet auction house, the collapse of the twin towers almost instantaneously created a new market for World Trade Center memorabilia. A piece of tower debris went on sale within hours; a drawing of the World Trade Center that was selling for $5 jumped to $250 before eBay banned the sale of all World Trade Center items. In a Sept. 21 statement, eBay softened its stand and said it would allow memorabilia to be sold for charity:
After consultation with the government of New York, eBay will now allow positive commemorative items that relate to the Sept. 11, 2001, tragedy to be sold in Auction for America charity listings. This includes items that incorporate images of the World Trade Center or Pentagon before the attack. This policy change only applies to the Auction for America listings.
Out of consideration for the many victims of this tragedy, eBay will generally not allow items (commemorative or otherwise) that portray any aspect of the World Trade Center or the Pentagon during or after the attack, or any victims of the attack. In addition, domain names referencing the Pentagon, World Trade Center, Sept. 11, 2001, or any other aspect of the attack will not be allowed.
We are also extending the temporary suspension of listings in World Trade Center memorabilia outside of the Auction for America program for the rest of the year. . . .
At street level, Roshan Parmar, a Harlem merchant, is selling twin tower postcards, three for $1, and larger pictures for $35, from a sidewalk table in front of his store. And he says he doesn't need a sales pitch:
We all know why they are buying them. People don't even have to say it. We'll never see these towers again and they want to show their children and grandchildren.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Past Ground Zero; 
The Distance Traveled in a Month of War

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
ONLY a month has passed, but "only" means different things to different people. For many Americans, the wounds from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks remain raw, as if inflicted but a day or two ago. For others, the topsy-turvy world they now inhabit has become quickly familiar, curiously so, as if life has been like this for a year. Hard to believe, they say, that a mere month has gone by.
 These are, to state the obvious, confusing times. So much has happened on so many fronts since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that trying to process it all is overwhelming. For the first time most Americans can remember, especially those who thought prosperity had become unbreakable, there is no sense of what the future may hold. So many things seem beyond their control. 
 And so many things are new. The country has new alliances, a new presidential mission and style, new tremors in the economy, a new balance between civil liberties and national security. 
Suddenly, Americans are tasting a fear they have never known. In Florida and New York, at least four people in two media companies were exposed to anthrax, apparently carried in letters mailed to their offices. One person died. No clear connection to the Sept. 11 terrorists emerged, but the mere possibility leaves many frightened.
Suddenly, Americans are learning the names of cities in Afghanistan that they never heard of. Keeping track of terrorist cells involves a bewildering collection of names, many of which may not even be real. Many people say life will never be the same, even if the reality for most of them is that daily routines have not changed much.
What follows is a look at major events of the last month, a map of the road traveled thus far and where it may lead. If the recent past is a guide, though, the only certainty for America is continued uncertainty.

The Bombs Fall
President Bush declared war on terrorism the day that hijackers slammed commercial airliners into the trade center and the Pentagon, killing more than 5,000 people. But the actual military response, by American and British forces, did not begin until a week ago, Oct. 7. Bombers, fighter planes and Tomahawk cruise missiles pounded terrorist camps run by Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, and knocked out the airfields and other military strongholds of his Taliban protectors. Within a couple of days, the Americans were able to claim that they basically controlled the Afghan skies, though Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said on Friday that not all of the Taliban's air-defense capabilities had been knocked out.
From the president on down, officials repeatedly warned Americans against short-term thinking. This war, they said, could last months, even years. Britain's top military commander talked about an operation in Afghanistan stretching into next summer, "at the very least," and involving ground forces.
It was clear from the start that special forces would carry out covert operations, but the pace of mobilization in recent days suggests that significant numbers of regular troops may go in. A battalion of Marine assault forces was poised in the Arabian Sea aboard one of three aircraft carriers sent to the region. In Pakistan, on Afghanistan's southern border, an official said that thousands of American troops were expected. In Uzbekistan, to Afghanistan's north, 1,000 soldiers trained for mountain fighting arrived. The United States' presence in Uzbekistan was a remarkable sign of how the world has changed since the cold war. Never before had American forces set foot on territory that was once part of the Soviet Union.
No one doubts that the United States has overwhelming firepower. But how it will be used remains a big question. For starters, Pentagon strategists are well aware that Afghanistan is a black hole that has swallowed many a world power. The Russians can tell the Americans all about that.
There are also political constraints. While the Bush administration wants not only to capture or kill Mr. bin Laden but also to unseat the repressive Taliban, doing that may result in a takeover by the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. That possibility worries Pakistan, which views the alliance with suspicion.
The result is a delicate balance for the Americans. In the first week of air strikes, they did not bomb the Taliban's front lines outside the capital, Kabul. The Americans want access to Pakistani territory. No less a concern is chronic instability in Pakistan, rocked by anti-American protests. A political implosion in that nuclear-armed country is something Washington deems unthinkable -- but not impossible.

A Manhunt Begins
As the investigation into the bin Laden operation proceeds, a classic line from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is hard to avoid: Who are those guys? It is the question that has been on just about every American's lips since Sept. 11.
Officials in Washington and elsewhere say there is strong circumstantial evidence implicating the wealthy, Saudi-born Mr. bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda (The Base). Some of this proof was set forth in a document that the British government put on the Internet.
It said that at least 3 of the 19 plane hijackers on Sept. 11 were Al Qaeda members. Officials also believe that Mr. bin Laden's top three lieutenants were involved in the planning. Their conviction that they have the right man in their sights -- even if, for now, they cannot find him -- was reinforced by a videotape of Mr. bin Laden praising the suicide bombers and warning Americans that more terror could lie ahead.
From information that has dribbled out from various authorities in the United States and Europe, his network seems formidable. Some 600 people have been arrested in the United States and three dozen others in eight European countries, many with apparent links to Al Qaeda. They are said to have formed cells in those countries, apparently operating with a degree of independence but also forming alliances with one another.
In Europe, the authorities say that many of the men in custody, all linked to Al Qaeda, embrace a radical form of Islam. They are dedicated to jihad, or holy war, to such an extent that to pursue it they even discard the practices of devout Muslims and adopt Western styles. Thus they blend in, imbedding themselves in the very cultures they vow to eradicate.
They seem to have been amply funded, a point underlined on Friday when the Bush administration more than doubled, to 66, the number of people and organizations whose assets have been frozen. The hunt for the sources of Mr. bin Laden's cash have turned up intriguing discoveries. One revenue source, investigators say, was a network of honey shops in the Middle East, where honey is a staple.
As for the hijackers, suspicions are that money was funneled to them by a shadowy figure from the United Arab Emirates who called himself Mustafa Ahmad. Just hours before the September attacks, investigators say, this Mr. Ahmad wired about $10,000 to Mohamed Atta for car rentals, hotel rooms and other expenses. Mr. Atta, the son of an Egyptian lawyer, developed a fierce hatred of the West and is considered a ringleader of the attacks; he was aboard the first plane to hit the World Trade Center.
Not that the overall operation was prohibitively expensive. Government estimates are that it cost between $200,000 and $500,000, for flying lessons, travel, food and accommodations. Indeed, the hijackers did mundane things like shop at malls and rent cars. They moved about at will, using America's very freedoms to attack it.

Allies Follow, or Tremble
American officials have suggested they are prepared to go it alone in this war. The United States was attacked, after all. Besides, one senior official said, the fewer partners you have, the fewer permissions you need for action. Early on, the message from Mr. Bush was, "Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists."
But coalitions can be useful. It is politically easier to send troops into a Muslim country if other Islamic countries agree force is necessary. Besides, the United States needs help with logistics and intelligence-gathering. So partners have been sought, and found, though complexities shape American choices. For example, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have been slow to permit use of bases on their territory for major military operations. That helped lead Washington toward the Russians, to arrange agreements that would allow American forces to work out of a former Soviet republic like Uzbekistan.
On several levels, United States diplomacy has been turned on its head. Through the 2000 campaign and the first months of his presidency, Mr. Bush derided the concept of "nation-building," his short-hand for repairing broken societies, as attempted by the Clinton administration in the Balkans and Somalia. Yet there he was last week, endorsing the idea of nation-building in Afghanistan and saying that country could effectively become a United Nations protectorate once the Taliban is removed.
It was not Washington's only reversal. A key ally for Mr. Bush these days is President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. He chose to bind himself to the West in this war on terrorism, even though domestic critics viewed this as yet another case of Russia's following the leader.
But Mr. Putin got something in return: a shift by the Bush administration on Chechnya, dealt with brutally by the Russian army as it suppressed Islamic separatists. As Mr. Putin sees it, Russia is also a victim of Islamic terrorism. But until this crisis Mr. Bush spoke more about the need for Moscow to respect human rights. Now his tune is different. Yes, the administration says, Chechnya's rebels are terrorists.
Shaping a wobbly coalition led to several odd situations. Through the British, discreet contacts were made with, of all countries, Iran. Washington officials said that Syria expressed a willingness to take measures against terrorism, even though it is on the State Department's list of terrorism sponsors. Friendly Saudi Arabia proved loyal only up to a point. It hasn't cooperated fully in investigating the hijackers or in freezing Mr. bin Laden's assets, American officials complained.
And then there were, as ever, the Israelis and Palestinians. Needing to keep moderate Arab friends on board, the Bush administration allowed for the first time that the creation of a Palestinian state might not be a bad idea. Practically apoplectic, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon warned against appeasing the Arabs the way western Europe tried to appease Hitler in the 1930's. The comparison did not sit well with the White House, which dressed down Mr. Sharon, forcing the old soldier to sound retreat and apologize.
Calm was restored. Still, the episode showed how thoroughly the cards of diplomacy have been tossed in the air, forming new arrangements as they float back down.

The President Finds His Issue
As some within his administration acknowledge, Mr. Bush did not project the strongest image on Sept. 11. As Air Force One hopped around the country in the first hours after the attacks, some Americans wondered if he was afraid to return to Washington. Unflattering comparisons were made with the stalwart performance that day of New York's mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
But the president soon overcame that shaky start, and he then ruggedly asserted himself as commander in chief with a speech to Congress on Sept. 20 that dazzled even his critics.
His approval ratings soared to 90 percent or higher. They don't get better than that. But mindful that his father enjoyed similar popularity at the end of the gulf war in 1991, only to lose to Bill Clinton the following year, Mr. Bush has pressed for a stimulus package of tax cuts and, to a lesser extent, government spending. He learned from the mistakes of the first President Bush how slip-ups on the economy can make approval ratings fade as fast as the evening sun.
In a matter of hours, this became an altered White House. Mr. Bush shoved all matters to the side except the war on terrorism, which he now sees as the defining mission of his presidency, the issue on which he will be judged by history. People at the White House say that focusing on a single topic plays to his strength, because he is not especially adept at juggling several issues at a time. This war, they say, gives him the focus and the passion that he needs. It also comes at a time when the public seems unlikely to settle for the surgical strikes of the past. What people seem to want is a campaign to end terrorism once and for all.
The president has been so passionate that he risked a collision with Congress over who on Capitol Hill would receive classified briefings. After some sensitive intelligence was leaked to the news media, an angry Mr. Bush ordered that secret information be given only to eight senior lawmakers. Not acceptable, others in Congress replied, saying that they, too, needed access if they were to do their jobs right. In short order, Mr. Bush relented. But by dressing down Congress, he made clear that he intends in this war to be all business.
Differences also emerged among the president's senior advisers. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and his deputy, Richard Armitage, argued that the first American strikes should be narrowly focused, aimed entirely at Mr. bin Laden and his Taliban supporters. But the Defense Department, conspicuously Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, urged a broader campaign to include other state sponsors of terrorism, notably Iraq.
In the end, after talking with his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, the president chose the more narrow approach. For now. The possibility of raids into other countries has not been ruled out. The Philippines, whose government is fighting Muslim rebels linked to Al Qaeda, could be next, some officials said.

New York Seeks Recovery
New York's comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, said that the city "took the hit for America." And what a hit it was.
The number of people who died in the twin towers of the World Trade Center is still not known. Maybe it never will be with precision. Figures have gone up and down, in part because of overlapping lists of victims. But after a month the number of missing settled in the area of 4,800, in addition to more than 440 confirmed dead at the trade center, and 189 at the Pentagon.
The human toll was devastating. For thousands, the ordeal of putting their lives back together is immeasurable. But also painful is the task of rebuilding New York's financial heart.
An estimated 1.2 million tons of debris was left by the buildings' collapse, and, after a month, about 80 percent of it still has to be cleared away. Construction crews are likely to need until February, at least, to reduce the pile of rubble to street level. Then they will have to deal with six levels of the trade-center complex that lie below ground, while bracing a retaining wall that keeps out the waters of the Hudson River. 
The assignment is so daunting that some New Yorkers wanted to scrap their term-limits law for citywide officials so that the suddenly, and wildly, popular Mr. Giuliani could run for a third term. But that is not to be, even though the mayor has not given up his hope to extend his present term by a few months.
A mind-boggling amount of money will be needed. Mr. Hevesi estimated that the total cost to New York, including lost jobs and tax revenues, will come to $105 billion. City and state leaders asked the federal government for $54 billion in subsidies, tax breaks and incentives to redevelop lower Manhattan and get the local economy back on its feet.
Will they get all that they want? Not likely. People around the country are feeling an economic pinch. And despite the warm national embrace for the city, nothing suggests that Congress will sign a blank check.
For that reason, New York's governor, George E. Pataki, and other officials turned to the White House. Their hope was that this president would not do what a Republican predecessor did in the 1970's when he rejected a federal bailout for New York during a severe fiscal crisis. Surely, the New Yorkers figured, this president does not want to see a reprise of a memorable Daily News headline from the Ford administration, one that with updating would read, "Bush to City: Drop Dead."

Fear Changes Lives
It is there, and it is palpable, despite pleadings from the president for Americans to go about their normal lives. People are not flying nearly as much as they did before Sept. 11. They are not going to the malls in the same numbers. Many more of them are turning to video-rental shops and crafts stores, businesses whose sales are based on customers' staying home.
Fears of possible bioterrorism spread with the news that three people who work for the same media company in South Florida had tested positive for anthrax, including a man who died. The anxieties were hardly stilled on Friday when it was disclosed that an assistant to Tom Brokaw, the NBC anchor, had also tested positive, more than two weeks after she opened a threatening letter that contained a white powder. That same day, another envelope containing white powder forced the evacuation of the newsroom at The New York Times.
Around the country, people depleted supplies of antibiotics at drugstores. Mailrooms changed their procedures. 
Life had changed. Suddenly, the United States had a federal office devoted to homeland security. Customs agents were ordered to put their hunt for drug smugglers on a back burner; they were to look for terrorists now. Airline pilots asked Congress to let them carry guns. The Air Force said that, in rare situations, its pilots could shoot down hijacked commercial airliners posing an imminent threat to American cities. Security was tightened at airports and at the United States Capitol. National Guardsmen patrolled Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station in New York.
Americans were told by the White House press secretary that they now had to watch what they said, this after a talk-show host made a disparaging remark about America's courage. At the White House's urging, the major television networks agreed to edit -- critics preferred "censor" -- future videotapes from Mr. bin Laden.
Non-Americans were warned to watch out, period. Congressional legislation was prepared to give the government new powers to wiretap and to monitor Internet communications. Under some bills, foreign citizens could be held without charges for up to seven days if the authorities had "reasonable grounds" for suspecting terrorism.
It did indeed seem that life had changed forever. But perhaps not as much as it seemed at first glance. The economy, which was veering toward a recession before Sept. 11, weakened further as consumer confidence ebbed. But then normality began to creep back. After four weeks, the stock markets recovered nearly all the losses suffered when trading resumed after the terrorist attacks. Car sales picked up, even though tens of thousands of workers were still laid off, notably in the travel and hotel industries -- job losses that may not be quickly recouped. On a less quantifiable scale, near-apocalyptic talk about the death of irony and the end of Hollywood as we knew it proved to be exaggerated.
Still, things were different. How could they not be? One New Yorker felt it when he went to the movies last week in search of relief. In the film was a glimpse of the World Trade Center. It lasted only a second. But it was enough to make his heart ache, an ache that he knew would not fade soon.

HEADLINE: Bills Would Help New Jobless Keep Insurance 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 

 BODY:
President Bush and Congress are working on legislation to provide health benefits to hundreds of thousands of people laid off in recent months. But they disagree over how to deliver the aid and how much to spend.
 Nearly two-thirds of Americans receive health insurance through employers. When workers lose their jobs, they often lose health insurance as well. Congress is considering several approaches. One would help laid-off workers pay premiums so they could keep coverage under group health plans operated by their former employers. 
 Under a 1986 law, many workers have the option of continuing their employer-provided coverage, at their own cost, if they lose their jobs. But fewer than 20 percent of eligible workers take this option. Many jobless workers say they cannot afford the full premiums, which average more than $7,000 a year for families.
Two influential Democratic senators, Max Baucus of Montana and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, have drafted a bill under which the government would, for 12 months, pay half of the premiums for workers laid off since Sept. 11, the date of the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.
The 1986 law provides no assistance to people who work for small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. Nor does it help people who bought individual insurance coverage on their own. 
For those who cannot obtain benefits under the 1986 law, Mr. Baucus and Mr. Kennedy would authorize coverage through Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people. This option would expire in March 2003. Mr. Baucus is chairman of the Finance Committee, which has authority over Medicaid and tax legislation.
Senator James M. Jeffords, independent of Vermont, has introduced a bill that would provide laid-off workers with a tax credit equal to half the cost of any health insurance premiums they pay under the 1986 law. The maximum credit would be $110 a month for individual coverage and $290 a month for families. 
The tax credit would be available even to people who did not earn enough to owe any income tax. The credit would be paid each month, for a maximum of nine months, to employers or their health plans.
Many lawmakers want to include health insurance subsidies in legislation to revive the economy, which is now moving through Congress.
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said, "There's a good chance that any agreement on a stimulus package will include some assistance for those who become unemployed as a result of the economic slowdown and the Sept. 11 attacks."
As part of the stimulus package, President Bush said he wanted to provide $3 billion in grants to the states to help jobless workers. The money could be used to pay up to 75 percent of health insurance premiums for laid-off workers or to provide job training or cash benefits to people who have exhausted their unemployment compensation.
Mr. Bush also said that states could provide health insurance to the unemployed by taking money from the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. About $11 billion earmarked for the program remains unspent, he said.
This proposal has provoked a storm of criticism in Congress. Senator Kennedy, the chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said: "This is robbing Peter to pay Paul. During the economic downturn, more children will need health insurance and will be relying on the CHIP program."
Aides to Mr. Baucus and Mr. Kennedy said their proposal would cost $16 billion to $17 billion over two years. Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has proposed giving the states $3 billion to help newly unemployed people buy health insurance.
Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer group, said New York would be "a big loser" under Mr. Bush's proposal. New York has enrolled more people than any other state in the Children's Health Insurance Program. Under existing law, New York receives some of the money left unspent by other states. If those states could spend their money on jobless workers as well as children, less would be available for redistribution to states like New York, which have spent their full allocations.
"States have three years to spend each year's allotment," Mr. Pollack said. "Congress purposely established this time frame to accommodate growth in the program as states enroll more children."
Bush administration officials said they had not realized the effect of their proposal on New York.

HEADLINE: Our Towns; 
On an Antiterrorism Mission, Straight to the Heart of Broadway

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: NORWALK, Conn. 

 BODY:
MANY were retirees, and they'd never been on an antiterrorist mission before. They had come on orders from the nation's mayor. "Mayor Giuliani wants us," said Dee Schreer of West Hartford.
 "That mayor," said Veronica Bielewicz, a retired factory worker. "Whoa, what a man." The tour bus was heading south on I-95, past Stamford. Nervous? "No," Ms. Bielewicz said. "I pray a lot." 
 Most were making their first trip to New York City since the terrorist attack. A few had been dispatched by Rosie O'Donnell. "Rosie said, 'They need you! You have to go!' " recalled Judy Browning of Trumbull. "After that, I said to my husband, 'Come on, it's time.' " George Browning took a day off from his cable installer's job. Liz Louziotis, a Sears sales clerk, used vacation time.
Several had tried to recruit neighbors but were turned down because of fear. "My friend's the type who cringes at anything," said Virginia Fanelli of Rocky Hill. "She used the excuse she was dog-sitting for her daughter. Ha! I let it go. I'm not going to allow this to stop me." Terrorists? "I wish I could go over there and shoot 'em down," Mrs. Fanelli said.
Still, she was doing what she could on the home front and was armed. "Got my Visa card," she said. She would need it on this mission. Besides taking in a Broadway matinee, the 25 passengers on the Show Bus Tours trip were planning to do their duty for their country by eating lunch at an overpriced Midtown restaurant.
At Exit 2 in Greenwich, Les Kozbinski, the Show Bus driver, switched on the music, and to no one's surprise, it was the Chairman of the Board, singing "New York, New York." And while Ms. Bielewicz prefers the Liza Minnelli version, she still got that swelling feeling inside. Those Rocky Hill blues were melting away.
They turned onto the Bruckner Expressway, ready to make a brand new start of it, and the driver said, "Coming up, straight ahead, the skyline of Manhattan!" Usually, this draws oohs and ahs but now, as the antiterrorists looked up from their Show Bus restaurant tip sheets, they were silent. Ms. Bielewicz and Ms. Browning teared up. "I'm crying for what's gone," Ms. Browning whispered.
THIS, in a nutshell, was their trip to the city, a million ups, a million downs and all those dancing feet. For 40 years, Show Bus Tours has been transporting Connecticut theatergoers to Broadway matinees, but only in the last month has ordering two tickets to "Les Miserables" become the equivalent of buying a war bond. The little tour company is a barometer of how badly Broadway has been hurt since Sept. 11. Usually Show Bus runs two full buses to matinees; yesterday, 37 rode one bus.
Maureen Rosenthal, the Show Bus manager, almost gave in to fear and laid off most of her staff. But if you were casting for Ms. Rosenthal, you might want to look at old clips of Debbie Reynolds in "The Unsinkable Molly Brown." Fear? She has bought 2,000 tickets through October 2002 for the show she's convinced will be the next matinee smash, "Mamma Mia!" To gauge how it will play with her people, she sent her bus driver to a preview. "Les loved it," Ms. Rosenthal said. "He was dancing in the aisle."
When the bus arrived at 11 a.m. on 45th Street, most just sat, and the driver said, "Time to get out." The matinee audience normally is not too adventurous. As Ms. Rosenthal says, a big risk for many would be two tickets to "Urinetown."
Mrs. Louziotis took her husband's arm. "I don't know New York," she said. Someone asked for directions to "The Lion King," and the driver said, "Don't worry it's just three blocks -- you have three hours to make it."
But you know what? The day was a smash hit! On a tip from the driver, the Louziotises tried the Broadway Diner and, as predicted, the roast beef sandwich was a meal all by itself. Mr. Louziotis even ordered a piece of raisin pound cake for dessert to stimulate the economy. Mrs. Louziotis bought herself a sweater she didn't really need at R.A.G.
They felt a change in Midtown, and it wasn't just that Saks was less crowded. They mentioned fewer horns honking, and Mrs. Fanelli said, "Not so hurrying and everyone wanting to run you down when you cross the street. People have come down a peg, not so selfish."
Mrs. Browning spied a handsome man playing the guitar on Broadway dressed only in a cowboy hat, boots and underwear. "I was a little shocked," she said, precisely the reason there will always be a New York.
On the ride home, several said they'd be back next month. It was after 9 by the time Ms. Bielewicz got to New Britain and she was tired, but it was a good tired.

HEADLINE: Congressional Memo; 
Congress Resumes Partisan Warfare

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 

 BODY:
One month of bipartisanship is all, it seems, that the 107th Congress can manage. 
 In the House, Democrats were screaming on Friday about everything from House rules to airport security to tax cuts. Republicans generally did not answer back. They did not need to for, after all, they had the votes. 
 In the more decorous Senate, a 100-to-0 vote put a false facade of unity over the airport security bill on Thursday. Republicans had filibustered it for days in a successful effort to prevent Democrats from attaching a measure to aid displaced workers for airlines, airports and airplane makers. But their success led Senator Mark Dayton, Democrat of Minnesota, to call them "stingy" and "cruel."
The skirmishing is almost back to the pre-Sept. 11 levels, as the political desire to present a popular image of unity gives way to the political differences and antagonisms developed over many years. 
As Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate majority leader, told reporters on Friday, "We're seeing Democrats and Republicans being Democrats and Republicans." 
He added, "I just hope we can avoid the temptation to be strident Democrats and strident Republicans." But a minute later he attacked the House Republican plan to use tax cuts as the core of an economic stimulus package as an effort by the "hard right, especially, to go back to the drawing board as they have known it for generations now and pull off the same tired approaches to economic policy that we've seen now for a long time."
Economic issues form a fundamental divide between the parties. Nowhere is that clearer than in the House Ways and Means Committee, whose chairman, Representative Bill Thomas, is not known for a diplomatic touch. This week he pushed two major bills through his committee, where Republicans hold a 24-to-17 majority.
When he won approval of a trade bill on Tuesday, Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the committee's senior Democrat, told him, "This bill will deeply divide this House when it is so important to the American people that we stay together." On Friday, when the tax cut measure was adopted, Mr. Rangel accused Mr. Thomas of "looking for a confrontation." And Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan said Republicans thought of "bipartisanship with a bumper sticker instead of a bill."
On Thursday, his brother, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, accused House Republican leaders of trying to block a bill to combat money laundering opposed by several big banks. Today Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said the bill would probably be voted on next week.
The House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, has been urging Republicans not to reply in kind, and has generally succeeded, although when assured they will not be quoted by name, some House Republicans say Democrats are trying to score partisan points by accusing Republicans of abandoning bipartisanship. And they accuse Democrats of trying to use the terrorist crisis as an excuse for pushing their ideological favorites -- like government spending and an increase in the minimum wage, although Democrats seem to have given up on the wage issue, at least for the time being.
Mr. Daschle said today that it would be inappropriate as part of a short-term stimulus package because it would not be temporary.
Senate Republicans have used delaying tactics to try to force action on an energy bill that would allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and Mr. Daschle has responded by stopping committee action on the bill. 
Each side says the other is being partisan at a time when the nation expects something better. The public tone has been milder in the Senate, where bipartisanship appears from time to time on all kinds of issues because neither party has had the votes to break filibusters without help from the other. But there has been plenty of sharp bargaining behind closed doors in the hours when C-Span viewers see nothing more than one extended quorum call after another, and often only a single senator, presiding, in the chamber.
The House has no such restraint. It operates under rules that allow a disciplined majority to do anything it wants. So, as one senior Democratic aide put it on Friday: "We yell. That's all we have left -- the ability to yell." And yell they did. Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip, shouted at the Republicans who would not tell him when airport security legislation would come to a vote. "We are running out of patience," he bellowed. "There is no reason why we keep delaying and delaying and delaying."
Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that when Republican leaders had shelved a compromise bill that the usually sharply divided Judiciary Committee had adopted unanimously, they had followed "the least democratic process I have ever seen."
The dean of the House, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, said Republicans had behaved in a "sneaky, dishonest fashion." The Democratic leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, was not ready to give up on bipartisanship, though he said it had suffered a "breakdown." Mr. Gephardt, in the last month, has developed a close relationship with Mr. Hastert, who had disdained him for seeking partisan advantage. The fate of that relationship is uncertain.
As Norman J. Ornstein, a Congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said on Friday, it appeared that Congress had lost the sense that it was under a "direct and immediate threat" and reverted to a familiar level of hostility. "They are used to it, and now, sadly, they are more comfortable with it, like a dysfunctional family that gets together in a crisis, and finds they really don't like each other."
Still, the harshest attack offered this week was not between the parties, but by a Senate Republican, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, against House leaders. He joined Senator Levin in accusing them of trying to block the legislation on money laundering, and said that made them "unpatriotic."

HEADLINE: Soros Gives $250 Million To University In Europe 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
In what will be the largest single gift to a European university, George Soros is giving $250 million to endow Central European University, a graduate-education institution in Budapest and Warsaw that he and a group of former dissidents founded in the wake of the sweeping changes that reshaped Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980's. 
 Mr. Soros has provided the bulk of support for the institution from its beginning in 1991, through contributions of roughly $20 million a year. The endowment is part of Mr. Soros's overall commitment to give away his fortune while he is alive, rather than leaving a philanthropic fortune to be directed by others who might not share his vision. 
 "This replaces my annual contribution," said Mr. Soros, whose network of foundations last year gave out nearly $500 million for education, public health and the development of open societies in Central and Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, the United States and elsewhere. "It's the cutting of the umbilical cord. This university is the brain center of my foundation network. It was originally meant to be a regional university, but our focus has shifted and expanded, now that the major issues are issues of globalization."
The university has grown rapidly from its modest start in 1991, with 100 students in Prague. The main campus is now in Budapest, where it offers graduate instruction, mostly in humanities and the social sciences, to 858 students from 40 countries. Most pursue master's or doctoral degrees in economics, history, legal studies, medieval studies, political science and sociology. The nearly 100 faculty members come from 26 countries, and classes are given in English. 
The university is known for its nationalism studies program, started by Ernest Gellner, and its medieval studies, which bring together Western, Eastern Orthodox and Islamic cultures. 
The Budapest campus, a complex of several buildings, from a late Baroque city palace to a postmodern tower, lies on the Pest side of the city. The university's library is the largest English-language collection in the region. Although the sociology department has been in Warsaw, a department in Budapest is being established. 
"The original idea was to have a university with three legs: Budapest, Prague and Warsaw," Mr. Soros said. "But we came to the conclusion that running a university in three towns is not efficient. I am ready to contribute about $100 million to what would be a sister institution, the Warsaw Academy, and the Polish state has contributed some valuable land. All we need is some additional funding to match mine, and there are positive signs within Poland." 
Central European University is now accredited by the New York State Board of Regents, but the earliest students had to be accredited retroactively. 
Most European universities are largely state-supported. Previously, the biggest single gift to European higher education was a $210 million grant to Cambridge University last year by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to endow a scholarship program. 
Although the Central European University is new, its graduates are already moving into important positions in their home nations. In the Czech Republic, for example, Jana Chalupova, is director of the Constituent Relations Department in the president's office. 
"What makes Central European University unique is the genuine social relevance," said Yehuda Elkana, the rector of the university. "Our faculty and students are not doing theoretical work. They are trying to create new knowledge on issues that matter now, questions like what kind of international institutions can be created for distributing public good, and what can be done for societies where generation after generation has no hope. These are academics who are really interested in helping their own countries."

HEADLINE: Sharpton, in Attack on Green, Hints He May Sit Out Election 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
As Mark Green tried to build support among black voters yesterday in Brooklyn, the Rev. Al Sharpton called Mr. Green's campaign tactics racially divisive and hinted that he might not endorse either Mr. Green or his Republican opponent, Michael R. Bloomberg.
 During a rally at the National Action Network headquarters in Harlem, Mr. Sharpton and a number of black and Hispanic lawmakers fumed about Mr. Green's runoff victory over Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president. The race was sharply divided along racial lines, with the vast majority of black and Hispanic voters supporting Mr. Ferrer. 
 Mr. Sharpton and the politicians at his rally -- including Representative Jose E. Serrano and Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr., both of the Bronx, and Assemblyman Roger L. Green of Brooklyn -- also spoke angrily about the appeal that Mr. Green has made in recent days for their support.
Mr. Sharpton complained about telephone calls that he said some white households received last week warning that Mr. Ferrer would appoint Mr. Sharpton as the police commissioner if Mr. Ferrer were elected. Mr. Green has denied that the calls were made by his campaign.
"There will not be silence and consent to the insult that we've been dealt in this race," Mr. Sharpton said to loud applause, addressing about 200 people.
Mr. Sharpton did not go so far as to say he would not endorse Mr. Green in the general election. But he took every opportunity to suggest that he might sit out the election and urge his supporters throughout the city to do the same.
"I'm not endorsing Bloomberg," Mr. Sharpton said. "But I'm not endorsing nothing that doesn't stand for us. And if I could survive eight years of Giuliani, I can survive four years of Bloomberg." Mr. Sharpton and others suggested that supporting Mr. Green would amount to a capitulation, saying that white voters may have turned away from Mr. Ferrer simply because of his association with Mr. Sharpton, and that Mr. Green's campaign had encouraged them to do so.
In Brooklyn, Mr. Green spent about an hour walking along Flatbush Avenue with several black lawmakers and a crowd of supporters. He ducked into beauty salons, Caribbean restaurants and discount shops to shake hands and pose for pictures as an aide with a loudspeaker chanted, "Mark Green wants to unite the city!"
Mr. Green reiterated two goals that he outlined on Friday: reaching out to Mr. Ferrer and his supporters to "persuade them to join our cause," and accelerating planning so that if elected mayor, he would have selected a cabinet and begun shaping an agenda long before taking office on Jan. 1.
Mr. Green again denied any association with the phone calls warning white voters about Mr. Sharpton, calling them "despicable" and "indefensible." He also said, as he has several times since winning the runoff, that he would welcome Mr. Sharpton's support: "This big city needs a big tent where all the prominent leaders work together, and that certainly includes Rev. Sharpton."
Mr. Bloomberg met yesterday with downtown business and community leaders who are worried about the economic health of the area around the World Trade Center. Mr. Bloomberg, who is expected to unveil an economic recovery plan this week, has made a point of publicly consulting with some of the city's most worried communities.
Continuing an early theme of the general election campaign that he regards the entire city as up for grabs, Mr. Bloomberg also visited another traditionally Democratic neighborhood, greeting shoppers at the Fulton Mall in Downtown Brooklyn. His campaign also confirmed that he met privately with Representative Major R. Owens, a Brooklyn Democrat and one of the city's leading black politicians. No details of the session were made available.

HEADLINE: Fears, Again, of Oil Suppliesat Risk 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE

 BODY:
THEY are the nightmares, the worst confluence of misguided decisions and startling violence, that politicians and oil executives ponder briefly and then shoo away:
 That sympathizers of Osama bin Laden sink three oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz and choke off the narrow, bow-shaped channel that funnels 14 million barrels a day from the Persian Gulf to the rest of the world. That the United States attacks Iraq, and Israel launches a huge strike against the Palestinians, driving them from their camps and staking out more land -- all of which spurs the Persian Gulf states to cut off oil for the West. Or perhaps that a popular uprising, led by sympathizers of Mr. bin Laden, topples the ruling Saud family in Saudi Arabia, by far the world's largest oil producer. 
 "If bin Laden takes over and becomes king of Saudi Arabia, he'd turn off the tap," said Roger Diwan, a managing director of the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm in Washington. "He said at one point that he wants oil to be $144 a barrel" -- about six times what it sells for now. 
The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the subsequent battering of the global economy have stretched the edges of imagination. Most Western politicians and oil industry experts say they believe assurances from the Middle East that oil supplies will stay stable as the American-led attacks on terrorist groups continue. But in such a profoundly changed world, they concede, anything is possible.
If there is a serious disruption of oil supplies, it will probably not be in Venezuela or in the North Sea, but in the countries of the Persian Gulf. Those countries have taken the politically risky position of siding with the West, however quietly, in the campaign against Mr. bin Laden, thereby alienating many of their own citizens. And the proof of their support for the West is in the oil that OPEC nations continue to ship, recently forgoing a production cut even as they faced falling prices that rob them of revenue.
By attacking oil supplies or the Middle East regimes themselves, Mr. bin Laden's supporters would strike a powerful blow against the West.
The United States' own oil production and that of its allies in the Western Hemisphere could not take up the slack. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a stockpile created in 1975 to deal with such emergencies in the United States, could cover the lost oil for a time, but its efficacy would depend on the length and size of the disruption. Congress is looking for ways to add to the reserve, but it remains unclear whether the money could be found to acquire the oil quickly. New oil fields could not begin pumping fast enough to make up for the shortfall, and they would not produce enough anyway. The United States has only 3 percent of the world's known oil reserves.
The country's ability to navigate such a rocky period, industry experts said, ultimately depends on how much American society scales back its prodigious consumption of oil. High prices and lower supplies pushed the United States to trim its use of oil in the 1980's, but the country now relies more than ever on imports. Imports account for 60 percent of daily American oil consumption, up from 47 percent a decade ago. "We can't just blame Detroit for higher oil consumption," said Jay Hakes, the former director of the Energy Information Administration, the analytical arm of the Energy Department. "We're all in this. We have met the enemy, and the enemy is us."
As far back as the Truman administration, when automobile use started to soar, the United States has grappled with where to get oil and how much to pay for it, Mr. Hakes pointed out. The nation has always faced a choice. It could rely on its own small output but pay much higher prices for it and for alternative energy sources. Or it could open itself up to imports from places like the Persian Gulf, increasing its economic and political vulnerability. It chose the latter.
The United States gets only about 13 percent of its daily dose of oil from the Persian Gulf states, and that is down from 23 percent a decade ago. But those countries produce 18 percent of the world's oil, and a significant disruption in their output would set off price spikes, if not outright shortages. The turmoil in the region during the last three decades frequently aroused fears, sometimes well-founded, of oil supply disruptions.
BUFFETED by repeated wars, the Persian Gulf states have long been aware of the need to protect their pipelines and oil fields, and industry experts familiar with the region say those countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, have heightened security since Sept. 11.
No system, however, is impregnable. Terrorists in a dinghy in the Persian Gulf could launch missiles at offshore rigs or Saudi fields, some of which are just a few miles inland. They could rupture a pipeline. They could attack the string of oil loading docks along the Persian Gulf, or on the Red Sea to the West, from which 500,000 to 6 million barrels a day are shipped. An attack could disable an oil processing facility, which separates the hydrocarbons from other liquids, and remove 200,000 to 400,000 barrels a day from the market.
But while a successful attack on the Middle East's oil infrastructure could rattle the markets, most analysts say it would have little impact on global supplies. "They are likely to be nuisances rather than major disruptions because there are multiple redundancies in the system," said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, an industry-supported group that runs a consulting business in New York. "There are other loading, storage and shipping possibilities to get oil in and out. The real trouble would be only if countries cut off oil supplies, and that won't happen."
The chances are slim -- for now. But Mr. bin Laden has long made clear that his ultimate goal, more than wreaking havoc in the West, is toppling the Saud family. And Saudi Arabia would be a crucial target for anyone seeking to cut deeply into the world oil flow. 
"The Saudis are the linchpin," said Ronald E. Minsk, an energy adviser to former President Bill Clinton. "It's because they have so much more oil than anybody." 
Saudi Arabia exports about eight million barrels a day and is the biggest single supplier of oil to the United States, accounting for 1.7 million barrels a day. The world's No. 2 exporter, Russia, which is not a member of OPEC, exports only 2.9 million barrels. The Saudis are the only ones with enough spare oil-field capacity to call on if there is a severe disruption elsewhere. Although Saudi Arabia led the 1973 oil embargo to protest American support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War, it later stepped in to make up shortfalls of millions of barrels a day caused by conflicts in the Middle East, including the Iranian revolution, the Iran-Iraq war and the Persian Gulf war.
Even over the past year, as Iraq intermittently curtailed its exports of two million barrels a day to demand changes in the United Nations sanctions against it, Saudi Arabia acted as the "swing producer," making up much of the difference.
Short of withering in the grip of a coup d'etat, Saudi Arabia's oil exports could be cut if its rulers decide that they no longer can afford to support the United States-led campaign against terrorism. If the bombings kill many civilians or if the war expands quickly, the Saudis may feel that they have no choice but to veer away from the United States and reduce the flow of oil.
"The only way I see that happening is if the U.S. would continue to pick targets that would include Middle Eastern oil-producing countries -- and how many it picked -- and if it were done in a unilateral way," said Marianne Kah, chief economist at Conoco. "But if it continues its multilateral approach, and includes friendly Arab countries, that won't happen."
Even in the case of state overthrow somewhere in the Middle East, she said, the flow of oil would be likely to continue. "Usually anyone in power wants oil revenues," she said, "though that may not be true for Osama bin Laden, who wants to live in a cave."
If oil supplies from the Middle East dwindle, the impact on the United States would not be acute shortages, at least for a few months. Less of its oil comes from the Persian Gulf now, and more from Canada, Mexico and Venezuela.
Instead, a sharp drop in oil supplies would set off a steep rise in prices. How long they stay high would depend on the length and the severity of any cuts. The United States has few options to increase supply and damp a price surge. Oil fields in the United States and most of the rest of the world are running close to full capacity, except, as luck would have it, in the Persian Gulf. New fields, regardless of the promise they hold, take several years to bring on stream.
"There is a big lag time between when you drill exploratory wells and when you get production," Ms. Kah said. Although the Bush administration and the oil industry have long pushed to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, delivering oil from there would mean "expanding the oil pipeline in Alaska to handle the extra volume, and then you would be sending the oil down at the soonest in three or four years."
DURING the Persian Gulf war, the government tapped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to make up for expected shortages. The United States now has less oil in the reserve than it did then, and it would not go as far in the event of a supply disruption, explained Mr. Goldstein of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. In the early 1990's, the reserve, stored in underground caverns in Texas and Louisiana that can hold up to 700 million barrels, contained about 590 million barrels. At the time, that would have lasted about 82 days with no imports. 
The reserve has nearly as much now -- about 545 million barrels -- but today that would last just 53 days, according to the Department of Energy. That is because the United States consumes more oil now, and imports much more of it. Elsewhere in the industrialized world, including countries like Germany and Japan that have no oil fields, imports have remained flat, largely because of conservation and high fuel taxes, Mr. Diwan of the Petroleum Finance Company said.
The United States, with just 5 percent of the world's population, has an enormous appetite for oil: it goes through 19 million barrels a day, or nearly one-quarter of the world total of about 76 million barrels. Imports increased about 4.5 million barrels a day in the last decade. To put it in perspective, Mr. Diwan pointed out, Germany and France together consume 4.7 million barrels a day.
The dependence on foreign oil and the lack of a backup plan, either in the form of a bolstered reserve or conservation, evolved in large part because the United States thought Saudi Arabia would again make up for any supply disruption. "In the 90's, we let a lot of things slide," said Mr. Hakes, the former Energy Department official. "We quit improving the efficiency of automobiles. We quit buying oil" for the reserve.
"It's not anything that would have made us fully independent," he said, "but every little bit helps, so you get a full slap in the face."
The price shocks from a serious disruption in oil supplies would course through every quarter of the United States economy. Prices for gasoline and jet fuel would jump, hamstringing commuters and businesses alike. Heating-oil prices would climb. The drain on people's incomes and companies' revenue would further sap a weakened economy.
Most major oil companies, like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, and large independent refiners like Valero Energy get substantial amounts of oil from Saudi Arabia. Oil companies declined to comment officially on the impact of a disruption, but some industry executives said privately that if the Saudis continued to ship oil elsewhere, American oil concerns could buy it through third parties, although at higher prices. If an embargo turned global, American companies could get some oil from the petroleum reserve before that ran out.
The House of Representatives recently passed a nonbinding resolution that urges the Energy Department to procure more oil for the reserve, but it appropriates no money for the effort. That, in effect, will do nothing to fill the reserves fast. Mr. Goldstein estimated that if Congress allocated about $1.5 billion for buying oil for the reserve, an additional 60 million barrels would flow into the caverns by April -- on top of the 20.7 million the reserve already expects to receive by the end of the year. Oil prices are lower than they have been in two years, and as the global economy stalls and demand drops, they could go even lower. 
"We could buy the oil from OPEC, and because it is not a commercial sale, the members would not be violating their production quotas," Mr. Goldstein said. "It wouldn't push up prices, because oil demand is so low. It buys us flexibility, because none of us know what tomorrow will look like."
IF prices surge in response to a break in oil supplies, American political leaders and consumers will have to think about lifestyle changes needed to cope with supply disruptions. Most fuel used in the United States is for transportation, as people buy bigger cars and travel farther daily. If the pain is bad enough, the government may dust off old ideas like enforced carpooling or a return to the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit. 
But more than anything else, consumers would be likely to react on their own. In 1981, during the Iran-Iraq war, oil prices hit $40 a barrel. By 1986, they had dropped to $12, largely because of reduced demand. "Prices go up, people consume less," Mr. Diwan said. "The market really does work."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: STRATEGY; 
PRESIDENT WEIGHS WHO WILL FOLLOW TALIBAN IN POWER

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 

 BODY:
In at least two meetings in recent days with his National Security Council, President Bush has begun discussing how the United States and its coalition partners could help Afghans quickly form a new government. 
 The discussion so far, one senior official said, has focused on what arrangements should emerge if the Taliban government falls. The planning sessions have had three broad aims: creating a viable and broad-based coalition government, beginning economic rebuilding and providing a security force that would keep the peace. 
 In those sessions, Mr. Bush "has said repeatedly that we don't want to have to deal with a similar threat like the Taliban three years from now," an official said. 
A power vacuum and renewed civil war would create that risk, which could mean that the American bombing campaign would have been wasted, Mr. Bush has warned his aides, as the discussion picks up speed.
In the latest military actions, the Pentagon said today that a 2,000-pound bomb fired from a Navy jet had landed in a residential neighborhood of Kabul. Reports by news agencies operating there of four people killed and eight injured could not be confirmed in Washington, but casualties were considered likely. The Pentagon said it appeared that a targeting error had aimed the bomb, which is guided by satellite, at the wrong spot. The intended target, a military helicopter on the ground, was about a mile away. Page B2. 
Taliban leaders rejected today President Bush's offer of a second chance to surrender Osama bin Laden and stop the week-long bombing.
The White House has said nothing in public about Mr. Bush's involvement in discussions of a new government in Kabul. Senior officials worry that any overt action to shape an Afghan government will inflame fears in Central Asia that once again a superpower is trying to unite the country on its own terms, even though the United States has made assurances that it will not try to choose the country's leaders. 
Russia and Britain struggled to make decisions for Afghanistan in a succession of wars and invasions from the 1830's to the 1980's, and were always stymied by the terrain, feuding tribes and the nation's tradition of opposition to strong central authority in Kabul.
The sensitivity of Mr. Bush's personal involvement in the subject was evident on Friday when his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, was asked if the administration had already begun work on the shape of a new government in Kabul. "Not that I'm immediately aware of," he said, though he added quickly that "there are many smart people who work on future contingencies" who "may be doing some thinking about that topic."
In fact, officials familiar with the discussions say that in at least two meetings in the last few days Mr. Bush has delved into the details. 
"The conversation has gained a lot of speed," one senior administration official said, "reflecting the growing recognition that the use of military force will create opportunities, but that it could also create a dangerous vacuum."
Another official said that at a meeting last week Mr. Bush was told that the United States might need to create the conditions for a new government within weeks. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is likely to discuss the issue on a trip to Pakistan and India that begins on Sunday.
Then, on Thursday, Mr. Bush and Secretary Powell will meet in Shanghai with Asian and Pacific leaders at the region's annual economic summit meeting. This will include talks with President Jiang Zemin of China and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The Russian and Chinese foreign ministers have already held at least one parallel discussion on their own about Afghanistan's next government, American officials said.
Mr. Bush has asked for regular briefings on negotiations under way in Geneva to help a coalition government come together under the symbolic leadership of the country's 86-year-old former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, who could provide a unifying presence. Under most plans under discussion, however, the former king would not actually rule the country, officials said. One senior administration deeply involved in the discussions said the question at the White House has been "is the king a factor, and how?"
In meetings with members of Congress and others, Mr. Bush has said that the reconstruction of Afghanistan would cost billions of dollars, and he seems likely to raise the question of sharing the costs when he meets with leaders in Shanghai. 
The administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, Andrew Natsios, discussed the depth of that challenge this week when he said that "we need to begin the agricultural reconstruction of the country, reconstruction of wells, of roads, not huge projects." Eventually, he said, the country would need airports and universities. The few airports in the country, largely military, have been destroyed in the week of bombing, but he added that such projects were "for a large-scale reconstruction and will have to come later on."
Officials said Mr. Bush has, somewhat reluctantly, come to accept the approach advocated by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain of putting the United Nations at the center of efforts to form a new government. Mr. Bush alluded to a leading role for the United Nations at his news conference on Thursday, without adding that hours before he had discussed the issue with Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations.
He raised the issue again when he called Mr. Annan on Friday to congratulate him on winning the Nobel Peace Prize.
But Mr. Bush is described by aides and Congressional leaders who have visited him as adamant that American troops should not get tied down in a peacekeeping role in Afghanistan. He is concerned, those officials say, that American forces could be ensnared in precisely the kind of open-ended "nation-building" exercises that have tied up thousands of American troops in the Balkans. Mr. Bush has often said that American military forces should be reserved for fighting wars, not helping governments, schools and justice systems to sprout.
"I wouldn't read anything he's saying to suggest he plans to keep American troops on the ground in Afghanistan," one senior official said. "He's quite adamant on the point." But a senior member of Congress, who discussed the issue with Mr. Bush recently, said, "I'm not sure there is a Plan B yet" that would call for the insertion of an international force after the end of the military operation. 
A hint of the nature of the discussions came up on Thursday when Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage said that "we have had discussions with some of our coalition partners about the eventual shape of an Afghanistan." But he quickly added: "We have said we don't want to run it; it's not ours."
Then he repeated the administration's position that the next government had to be "broad based and representative of all Afghans," code words for the American determination that the Northern Alliance, which has long fought the Taliban, could not dominate a government. 
The Pentagon appears to be prosecuting its bombing campaign in a manner that makes it difficult for the Northern Alliance to take Kabul. The alliance appears to have an agreement in place with representatives of the former king, who has been living in Italy for about three decades. American officials are hoping to expand that government-in-waiting to include the largest tribe, the Pashtuns, along with Tajiks and Uzbeks.
Though the White House has not discussed the issue publicly, administration officials say any new government could also include defectors from the Taliban. "The Pakistanis very much want the defectors to be part of it," said one senior State Department official, hoping their participation would help quell the pro-Taliban, anti-American protests in several Pakistani cities. 
Mr. Armitage also noted on Thursday that the United States would be unwise to press for a strong central government in Kabul. "As we've studied the situation," he said, "the Afghan experience seems to show that when government is roughly a loose federation, it seems to work best with a lot, a very high degree, of local autonomy."

 BODY:
IMAGINE checking out the new fall television schedule and finding a modern-day minstrel show set in an Alabama watermelon patch and starring black people in blackface (Savion Glover as Mantan and Tommy Davison as Sleep 'n' Eat). The humor is outrageously racist, and it's a runaway hit. Spike Lee Imagines all of this in BAM-BOOZLED (2000), whith Damon Wayans as the Harvard-educated network executive who creates the show, thinking it will prove to his white boss (who tells him, "Brother man, I'm blacker than you") just how wrong demeaning TV portrayals of black people are. It doesn't - Saturday at 8 p.m. and Saturday/Early Sunday at 3:15 a.m. on Starz.
 When Mike Nichols remade "La Cage aux Folles" as THE BIRDCAGE (1996), he moved the setting from France to Florida. As a Miami beach nightclub owner, Robin Williams is the quiet one, leaving the over-the-top comedy to Nathan Lane as his high-strung longtime lover. The son of Mr. Williams's character has just become engaged, and the couple decide to humor him by hiding their sexual orientation from his conservative future in-laws. But when the boy's mother (Crhistine Baranski) is delayed in traffic, Mr. Lane eagerly fills in, turning up at the dinner table looking strangely like Barbara Bush. Elaine May wrote the screenplay - Saturday at 8 p.m. on Channel 7. 
 Murray Burns (Jason Robards) seems pretty happy as an irresponsible unemployed beachelor rearing his 12-year-old nephew (Barry Gordon) in a one-room Manhattan apartment. But early in A THOUSAND CLOWNS (1965), evil social workers threaten to take the boy away. Happily, one of those social workers (Barbara Harris) is so charmed by Murray that she's soon sprucing up the apartment and staying overnight. Now will he be forced to return to his television-writing job for Chuckles the Chipmunk? Martin Balsam won the best supporting actor Oscar for his role as Murray's far more responsible brother. Fred Coe, the golden-age-of-televsion producer, directed - Saturday at 4 p.m. on TCM.
 When Angelica Huston turned Dorothy Allison's powerful 1992 novel about a sexually abused South Carolina girl into a television movie, TNT decided against broadcasting it but Showtime picked it up. Showtime's gain. BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA (1996) is a sensitive, haunting film with an outstanding cast. Jena Malone, then 12 years old, plays Bone, the title character and victim; Jennifer Jason Leigh is her mother; and Ron Eldard, who was later so brlliant on stage in "Death of a Salesman" and "Bash," plays Daddy Glen, Bone's vile an violent stepfather. The rape scene is painful to watch but it conveys the real horror of the crime - Monday at 9 p.m. on Lifetime.
 Stephen Fry gives a poignantly commanding performance as Oscar Wilde in Brian Glbert's handsome, touching drama WILDE (1997). Jude Law makes his young lover, Lord Alfred Douglas a k a Bosie, as cruel as he is beautiful. And Jennifer Ehle is quietly strong and sympathetic as Wilde's wife, Contance, who keeps her dignity as she loses her husband, first to a series of relationships with men, then to the 1895 sex scandal that sent Wilde to prison and ruined his name during his lifetime. The script contains just enough of Wilde's with and insight to remind us why he was the most acclaimed play-wright of his day. Don't let the first scene, which looks like a western, throw you; it's just the Colorado stop on Oscar's American lecture tour - Sunday at 9:45 p.m. and Sunday/Early Monday at 3:45 a.m. on IFC.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Telecom Recovery: A Matter Of Time

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
IN some parts of the country, the most reliable mode of communication since Sept. 11 has not been the telephone. It has been the Internet.
 That hasn't done much for the value of telecommunications and telecommunications equipment stocks. Many of these companies are still trapped in a vise of big debts and big inventories. And the sour economy is not helping to ease the pressure. 
 James P. Parmalee, a managing director in technology equity research at Credit Suisse First Boston, talked last week about when the sun might start shining again on these stocks. Following are excerpts from the conversation. 

Q. These companies were hurting before Sept. 11. What has happened since?

A. My sense is you are seeing a substitution of communications for what would have been travel. But at the same time, the economy continues to deteriorate. So overall usage has not increased.
From a stock perspective, there is not a near-term growth catalyst. But the fact that valuations are down so much -- an average of 80 percent so far this year -- you are starting to see some bottom-fishing.

Q. What is the inventory situation?

A. The inventory overhang is probably still being depleted, and will be over in the next three to six months, with some segments of the long-haul optical networking companies requiring a longer period. Internet Protocol routing inventories may be worked off over a shorter period.
In short, you are beginning to move to a situation where you will see revenues more closely match customer requirements. 

Q. What happened on the Internet after the attacks?

A. The flexibility and scalability of Internet Protocol networks was phenomenal.
Voice networks supported a twofold increase in normal loads before a busy signal started to implode. The Internet supported an enormous multiple of that. If I recall correctly, Yahoo said they saw a 40-fold increase in voice streaming requirements in the hours after the attack. There was some slowing in response time, but the networks worked well. 

Q. What does the Internet's ability to handle that surge in traffic suggest for the future?

A. Over time, the Internet will become more robust in handling all types of traffic, be it voice communications or data. That is not to say the voice networks will go away.
Verizon did a great job in downtown Manhattan, and part of that was due to the efforts of the large systems integrators, Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks and Cisco Systems.
When it comes to the next generation of products, the ability of those companies to support an event of that magnitude will favor those types of vendors, as opposed to others with less resources. 
Growth in the telecommunications market will not resume prior to 2003, but once we get beyond this correction period, we are absolutely convinced this will become an even more important piece of the economy, as communications permeate even more of our everyday lives. 

Q. What is your view of Lucent and Nortel?

A. We have a buy rating on Nortel and a hold on Lucent.
Nortel will complete the bulk of their restructuring by the end of this year. But Lucent will remain in a restructuring mode through September of 2002. 

Q. How do you assess Cisco Systems?

A. Cisco is a core holding in the space. They have a focus that is primarily Internet Protocol, which is where we think the spending is going to be. But the stock has had a strong move in a short time frame, and is getting close to our 12-month target of $18 a share.

Q. Characterize the balance sheets of the companies you cover.

A. Cisco has by far the strongest balance sheet. TellLabs has a relatively clean balance sheet. They would be followed by several of the emerging players like Ciena and Juniper Networks. Nortel and Lucent have improved, but there is more to go.

Q. Congress is considering accelerating depreciation schedules. Would that help these companies?

A. Accelerated depreciation would help marginally, but we need a further rationalization in telecommunication services. That will be the key driver to improvement, leading to better pricing and better returns. Restructuring is much more important than a V-shaped economic recovery.

Q. When will the consolidation begin?

A. Once the fundamentals stabilize and managements have a better view of the economic outlook in the wake of Sept. 11, serious discussions will begin. That suggests takeovers will not heat up until the middle of next year.

Magazine Jobless Feel Twice Battered

BYLINE:  By DAVID HANDELMAN 

 BODY:
It was the first day for Mademoiselle's new beauty and health director, Alexandra Parnass, so she wanted to arrive early. She left her Greenwich Village apartment at 8:45 and rode the subway to the Conde Nast Building in Times Square. But when she got off the elevator, she found her new co-workers crying, huddled around a TV in a conference room. It was Tuesday, Sept. 11. 
 "I didn't even get to my desk," Ms. Parnass, 30, recalled. Within minutes, the shaken staff was fleeing the building. Ms. Parnass returned home only to witness the first World Trade Center tower collapse. Two days after, Conde Nast, which is owned by Advance Publications, received a bomb threat. So it was not until the next Monday that Ms. Parnass finally started work. 
 Two weeks later, on Monday, Oct. 1, she and her colleagues were summoned to a 10 a.m. meeting, where the Conde Nast editorial director, James Truman, announced that the company would be shutting Mademoiselle.
People burst into tears. Suddenly, Ms. Parnass and 92 others found themselves in the swelling ranks of the magazine unemployed. Ms. Parnass, who had worked at Marie Claire for six years, had turned down a half-dozen job offers the last year. But when she started calling her contacts in the industry, she discovered that the terrorist attacks had dried up the job market, which was already saturated with stranded former dot-commers.
Last Friday, Mademoiselle's senior staff reconvened for a brunch and discovered that except for one person in the art department, no one had a single lead for a position anywhere.
From the point of view of the newly unemployed, like Ms. Parnass, Sept. 11 seemed to sharpen a downturn in the magazine world, both in economic and psychological terms.
The magazine business had already been badly hurting. Operating with small profit margins and vulnerable to ever-inflating costs of printing, mailing and distribution, magazines are always among the first to feel the pinch of a softening economy. But the contrast is even starker this time because ad revenues had been so artificially pumped up by the dot-com stock market.
Even long-established magazines like Time, Rolling Stone, Good Housekeeping and Business Week have cut their staffs. In 2001, the closings have included George, Working Woman, Family PC, PC Magazine, Individual Investor, Golf & Travel, Maximum Golf, The Industry Standard and Business 2.0.
And after terrorists attacked the World Trade Center, things went from bad to worse. A European firm that had promised to buy the plus-size fashion magazine Mode withdrew its offer and the magazine folded. Then Mademoiselle was closed. Last week, Ziff Davis Media shut Expedia, citing a shakeout in the travel magazine world.
"This is one of the bleaker times I can recall," says Kathy Bishop, 39, the former editor in chief of Mode. "Two years ago, you could just walk down the street and get a job without blinking your eye."
She cites the closure of the 70-year-old Mademoiselle as a pretty scary sign. "The smaller publications, you expect. But not a venerable institution. You always had the sense that Conde Nast could weather any storm."
Michael Boodro was Garden Design's editor in chief until July, when its owner decided to relocate it to Florida and dismiss the nine-member New York staff. "It hasn't been the easiest time to look for work," he said. "It's like, 'Hey, 6,000 people just died, but how about me?' "
Mr. Boodro, 48, hopes to find a full-time job; he and his partner had recently bought a new apartment -- in TriBeCa. But there are not that many positions around for an editor in chief. "People ask me, 'Would you take a No. 2 job?' " he said. "I say, 'How about 3 or 4?' " Since Sept. 11, Mr. Boodro said, the job market seems scarier. He is now trying to get domestic-partner health benefits. 
When Maximum Golf folded, a senior editor, Cameron Morfit, relished the prospect of becoming a freelance writer. But after the terrorist attacks, he took a full-time editing job at Sports Illustrated for Women. "The freelance thing was just a little too daunting in these uncertain times," Mr. Morfit said.
Even those who can afford not to work for a while are grasping for a sense of purpose. After Working Woman closed in August -- felled on the eve of its 25th anniversary by its costly Web site -- its editor in chief, Lisa Benenson, took her first two-week vacation in five years. On her return, she began lobbying for jobs for her 20 former employees, with little success. Since her husband works, she said, "I wanted to take some time off, but then Sept. 11 happened and made me feel I want to be someplace, doing something." A few days later, Harper's Bazaar called and asked her to fill in for an editor who was going on maternity leave. Ms. Benenson jumped at the offer. 
But those offers are rare. One of 400 laid off by The Industry Standard, Hugh Garvey, a former senior editor, is still unemployed. He had just bought a house in Los Angeles and on Sept. 15 his wife gave birth to their first child. "I hate to say it," Mr. Garvey said, "but with a new mortgage and a baby, I may be a turncoat" and go to public relations.
Ms. Bishop of Mode lives downtown, and on Sept. 11 she found herself bringing several distraught, disoriented Wall Streeters to her place to help them regroup. So when she lost her job two weeks later, she says, she had perspective. "I haven't given my next job a thought yet," she said. "I'm just home playing with my 2-year-old daughter."
She added that when young people ask her advice about entering the business, "I tell them don't do it; it's a fickle field."
Mr. Boodro feels magazines will eventually bounce back. "In some ways it's a dinosaur, but it's a very comforting dinosaur," he said. "People like getting their magazines."
Michael Caruso, the former editor of Maximum Golf, is less sanguine.
"I think something fundamental has changed, a shrinking of possibility and ambition, that may be permanent," he said. "I certainly hope I'm wrong because magazines are my first love. But my favorite magazines are Granta, The New Yorker, Lingua Franca and Harper's. Not one of them makes money, and I'm not sure any of them would be launched today."
He added, "On a purely anecdotal level, I don't think I've ever seen fewer people reading -- reading anything -- when I take the subway. Just cars full of people staring into middle distance, as if at a television screen that isn't there. For someone who loves print, it's disheartening."

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the plight of magazine employees who have become unemployed in the economic slowdown referred incorrectly to two publications. PC Magazine, owned by Ziff Davis Media, is still publishing; it was not closed earlier this year. Business 2.0 is also still publishing. AOL Time Warner bought it from Future Network in June and merged eCompany Now into it. The article also misstated the name of a Ziff Davis magazine that closed last week. It is Expedia Travels, not Expedia.

To handle complexity,computer researchers look to the self-regulating human body as a model.

BYLINE:  By Steve Lohr 

 BODY:
THINK of it as computing's crisis of complexity, revisited.
 For more than three decades, the big advances in computing have soon brought new headaches. The initial steps ahead are typically in hardware -- processors, storage and networks -- and the headaches are manifested in software. 
 It is software that is the medium for doing all the new things in computing that hardware makes possible -- whether simple numeric calculations or increasingly sophisticated functions like symbolic processing, graphics, simulations, artificial intelligence and so on. 
In computing, opportunity breeds complexity. And complexity begets systems that can be buggy, unreliable and difficult to manage.
This cycle of challenge became apparent shortly after the I.B.M. 360 mainframe, introduced in 1964, brought computing into the mainstream of corporate and government life. In 1968, NATO sponsored a conference prompted by concerns that the "software crisis" at the time posed a threat to the economic health and military readiness of the West.
Training, engineering and new software and hardware tools helped the computing community cope with the crisis of the late 1960's. But as Frederick P. Brooks Jr., one of the architects of the I.B.M. 360, observed, "Complexity is the business we are in, and complexity is what limits us."
Paul M. Horn, a senior vice president who oversees the research labs at I.B.M., says the time is ripe for an assault on the ever-increasing complexity of computing in the Internet era, with its global networks and proliferation of digital devices. "We have a growing crisis on our hands," he said.
Mr. Horn hopes to do something about it. Starting today, at the Agenda conference in Scottsdale, Ariz., I.B.M. will begin distributing 75,000 copies of a 39-page paper written by Mr. Horn, in which he calls the current version of the complexity problem the industry's "next grand challenge." 
The paper will be distributed to computer science researchers in universities, national labs and companies worldwide. I.B.M. is also making a commitment to underwrite 50 research projects at universities the next three to five years to take on the complexity challenge -- millions of dollars of research grants.
Mr. Horn's paper is intended partly as a call to action for researchers and the industry, but it also points toward a path for solving the problem. He calls it "autonomic computing." It is a biological metaphor suggesting a systemic approach to attaining a higher level of automation in computing. Just as a person's autonomic nervous system automatically handles all kinds basic functions -- the heart rate, breathing and digestion, for example -- in response to changing conditions, so, too, should computer systems, according to Mr. Horn.
The human body "does all this without any conscious recognition or effort on your part," he writes. "This allows you to think about what you want to do and not how you'll do it: you can make a mad dash for the train without having to calculate how much faster to breathe and pump your heart."
Similarly, Mr. Horn says, the way to handle the complexity problem is to create computer systems and software that can respond to changes in the digital environment, so the systems can adapt, heal themselves and protect themselves. Only then, he adds, will the need be reduced for constant human maintenance, fixing and debugging of computer systems.
His work with I.B.M.'s fast-growing services business, Mr. Horn said, set him to thinking deeply about the complexity issue. The services arm of I.B.M., he notes, has been growing by about 15,000 people a year the last five years. "They're all managing the complexity we've created in the information technology industry," he said in an interview. "The only way to get efficiency gains in information technology is to take some of the people out."
Even with the industry's current slowdown, the demand for information technology workers is expected to grow by more than 100 percent over the next six years. "There just aren't enough skilled people," Mr. Horn said. "If we don't do something, we'll be a services industry, and the industry won't grow. We're already headed in that direction."
Mr. Horn insists that no one company can handle the complexity challenge on its own, and that doing so will take research efforts over the next 5 to 10 years in areas like adaptive algorithms for software agents, self-healing server computers, artificial intelligence and control theory. Still, many of these are fields in which I.B.M. has its own research projects under way.
"We're certainly trying to push academic research in this direction," Mr. Horn said, "because we think it's an important direction."
I.B.M. will begin showing its autonomic computing vision to the rest of the industry this week. A handful of academic computer scientists have already seen Mr. Horn's paper. They see I.B.M.'s initiative as an endorsement of ambitious computer science research in a variety of fields. Ben Kuipers, a computer scientist at the University of Texas, has been conducting research aimed at building "common sense knowledge" into software agents -- one of the technologies needed if autonomic computing is to become a reality someday. 
At the University of California at Berkeley, John Kubiatowicz has been researching "introspective computing," or systems that constantly monitor themselves and adapt to changes in the computing environment.
Mr. Kubiatowicz says that the time is right for research efforts of the kind I.B.M. is championing, both because complexity is indeed a growing problem and, as in the past, the steady gains in hardware -- processing power and storage -- have opened the door to addressing the challenge. 
"We suddenly have the resources to do this," he said.

PERSON: Michael Kahan 

HEADLINE: Michael Kahan, 61, a CUNY Scholar on Electoral Matters 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Michael Kahan, a political science professor at Brooklyn College who was one of the leaders in the battle to keep poorly prepared students from being turned away from the City University of New York, died on Sept. 30 in New York City. He was 61.
 The cause was cancer of the gall bladder, his wife, Emily Altman, said. 
 A scholar on electoral matters who wrote about the news media and politics, he was a frequent commentator on radio and television and in newspapers on issues that included Japan's growing economic strength in the 1970's, Brooklyn politics and the 2000 presidential election results in Florida. 
Dr. Kahan was a member of the executive committee of the CUNY Faculty Senate and of the steering committee of the Friends of CUNY, groups that opposed the recent ending of remedial instruction at CUNY's senior colleges. He also helped create a higher education political action committee at CUNY to support candidates who were advocates for public education. 
Dr. Kahan believed that college students should be held to rigorous standards, but that using tests to screen who would be admitted to CUNY's senior colleges was inappropriate because such tests did not predict who would graduate. He said that using the tests as an entrance requirement would bar minority students disproportionately.
At one point, he tried to broker a compromise with CUNY's trustees that would have allowed students who could pass some of CUNY's entrance examinations to enter the senior colleges and complete the tests within one or two semesters. But the trustees chose to require students to pass all the tests before they were allowed to enroll.
Dr. Kahan was also a member of the executive committee and governing council of the American Jewish Congress. As chairman of the congress's Commission for Domestic Public Policy Advocacy, he pressed for gun control and affirmative action and opposed school vouchers.
From 1979 to 1982, during a break from the university, he was press secretary for Representative Frederick W. Richmond, Democrat of New York. He was his spokesman when Representative Richmond pleaded guilty to tax evasion and two other federal charges and agreed to resign from the House of Representatives and not seek re-election. 
"Mike saw his work with Richmond as an opportunity to be in a pivotal place with a guy who shared his progressive views," said Vincent Fuccillo, chairman of the political science department at Brooklyn College and a longtime colleague.
Dr. Kahan also took on battles in his own professional life. As a young professor in 1976, at a time when some professional academic associations were criticizing the Central Intelligence Agency for using academic positions as a cover for spying, Dr. Kahan reported that his brother-in-law and departmental colleague, Michael I. Selzer, had conveyed information to the agency. 
The charges roiled the department and the university. Dr. Selzer acknowledged that he had had one brief conversation with the C.I.A., but not a continuing association.
Both men were denied tenure, both left the college, and both sued. Dr. Selzer's suit was eventually settled for an undisclosed sum, and Dr. Kahan was later allowed to return and given tenure. 
Dr. Kahan, who was born in Detroit of Hungarian descent, completed his undergraduate studies at Wayne State University in Detroit, and in 1972 received a doctorate in political science at the University of Michigan. He also studied and worked at Nuffield College, Oxford, and at Australian National University in Canberra.
Dr. Kahan's marriage to Dr. Selzer's sister, Hazel, ended in divorce, as did a previous marriage. In addition to his wife, Ms. Altman, he is survived by a son, Ted, of Madison, Wis.; and a brother, Marc, of Chicago.

HEADLINE: In America; 
Living With Fear

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
So there I was on Friday -- the morning sun streaming through the window, a container of coffee on my desk -- trying to put together an analysis of the runoff election.
 I was typing, "It may be tougher for Mark Green to run the table than a lot of people realize," when a friend from my days at NBC called. She said that Tom Brokaw's assistant had tested positive for anthrax infection. 
 This is what life is like in New York nowadays. Terror has wormed its way into our daily routine. A sense of dread hovers over the city, undermining the most ordinary activities. Some New Yorkers are afraid to ascend to the upper floors of tall buildings. Others are reluctant to go down into the subways. Or open their mail. 
Amy York, a receptionist who works in a midtown skyscraper, told me she can't shake the fear that her building may be annihilated at any moment.
Weirdness rules, and individuals are coping as best they can. Smoking, drinking and attendance at religious services are up. And people are clinging more tightly to friends and loved ones.
"Hi. What's up?"
"Nothing. Just thought I'd give you a call."
A cab driver taking me to work the other day said: "Did I enjoy going to the airport before the unthinkable happened? Of course. Big money. Now I see the airport as a source of trouble. Not only that. I don't like driving in tunnels anymore. Or over bridges. I can imagine one of these bridges going splash into the water. These are not good feelings for someone in my profession."
The coffee was cold by the time I got off the phone. I went back to the column. I was planning to take another look at Mr. Green's economic recovery plan when an announcement over the office loudspeaker informed us that there was a problem with an envelope that had shown up at The Times. No one, we were told, could leave the building.
People began to call. What's happening? Are you all right?
I'm fine. Fine.
If everything's fine, why can't you leave the building?
I went to the cafeteria and got a fresh cup of coffee.
It is now believed that the envelope sent to The Times did not contain anthrax. It was addressed to Judith Miller, a reporter who has written extensively about chemical and biological weapons. When Ms. Miller opened the envelope, a sweet-smelling powder, similar to baby powder, wafted out.
Preliminary tests came back negative. But even if the powder proves harmless -- which everybody at The Times and all sane people fervently hope -- the envelope nevertheless sent another wave of fear through a shaken city and beyond.
We are told to go about our lives as normally as possible, and I can't think of any better alternatives. But in New York we have come up against the limits of normalcy. You can behave normally, pursuing so-called normal activities, but there's no way to escape the fact that something profoundly sinister is going on.
In yesterday's Times, in an article under the headline "New Yorkers Are Shaken, but Resolute, After Attack," a retired police officer named Norman Steinmetz spoke of how proud he was of the way New Yorkers have behaved in this crisis. But in the same conversation he broke down and began to sob, whispering, "Look at what happened to my beautiful city! I can't take it."
So we lead two lives. There is the daily life most of us have always known -- friends and family and work, a birthday party, a pickup basketball game, an evening of bridge.
But that is encased in the other life that has been dealt to us by the terrorists. It affects most New Yorkers and consists primarily of a heightened sense of caution, varying degrees of anxiety and fear, and a sharply etched sense of grief for the thousands lost on Sept. 11 and the wounds inflicted on the city as a whole.
We'll be leading this dual, disorienting existence for some time.
It appears that Judith Miller will be fine, and Mr. Brokaw's assistant is reported to be responding well to treatment and is expected to recover fully, which is great news.
No doubt there is more terror and sadness to come, for the city and the country as a whole. But there is also a sense of optimism, reflected in polls, that this insane threat will ultimately be defeated. Sadness is not a synonym for surrender.

HEADLINE: Campuses Split Over Afghanistan 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich., Oct. 12 

 BODY:
The Eugene V. Debs cooperative house here on the University of Michigan campus is a house divided.
 A flowered sheet hangs over the porch, painted with a huge peace symbol, the message "No More Dead" and a picture of a bomb with a red line through it. Inside, the long-haired students who gather nightly over vats of vegetarian food all want peace. But some wonder if it is possible without bombs and body bags. 
 "If we don't drop bombs, there's still no peace," said Beth Nagalski, a junior, one of 21 students who share the house filled with raggedy couches and mismatched dishes.
"This doesn't seem right," Jen Dombrowski, a junior from Grand Rapids, Mich., said of the airstrikes in Afghanistan, "but what else can we do?"
The dissension here, in a left-leaning house on the liberal Michigan campus, reflects the quandary facing the fledgling antiwar movement that has been sprouting at colleges and universities across the country since Sept. 11.
While there have been scores of fervent rallies on more than 100 campuses, they have been staged by small bands of committed organizers, veterans of the labor struggles and affirmative action battles of recent years, and in many cases have faced strong opposition, even among leftists who previously sympathized with their causes.
The peace movement -- students here and around the nation are reluctant even to use the word "antiwar" -- has benefited from the wave of student protests that culminated in the antiglobalization demonstrations in Seattle and Genoa, Italy, and student sit-ins for higher wages for Harvard's lowest-paid workers.
Many of the new organizers are leaders of those previous campaigns and are linking the war on terrorism to racism at home and imperialism abroad, issues that they have been rallying about for years.
"This attracts people who already had some sort of grudge before this," said Michael Frazer, a graduate student at Princeton, where the Princeton Peace Network's chants of "One world, no war" have been matched by the Princeton Committee Against Terrorism's flag-waving and a cappella patriotic songs. "There is this love of the 60's on the part of these activists," Mr. Frazer said.
Even at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, where students helped coordinate a "national day of action" with rallies on Sept. 20, only a few dozen students participated in a classroom walkout last Monday, the day after the bombing began.
"This ambivalence is definitely there," said Robert Loevy, a political science professor at Colorado College in Colorado Springs who studies social protest. 
Still, here in the birthplace of the antiwar teach-in, and at other prominent colleges, seeds of protest might yet blossom.
In the current climate, many students are shunning slogans and signs in favor of educational leaflets and teach-ins about nonviolence as a philosophy and about Islam and Afghanistan. They are focusing on racial profiling -- scores of non-Muslim women here have donned head scarves on Fridays in solidarity with those who have faced discrimination -- rather than the more complex questions about United States foreign policy.
"No one can say, 'Make love, not war,' " said Lara Jirmanus, who participated in the sit-ins before graduating from Harvard last spring, and who has helped coordinate antiwar activities this fall. "It's not like you want war and we want peace. Who wants war? What we're saying is that this isn't going to work, to go and attack more people."
Here at Michigan, advocacy organizations quickly morphed into peace groups. (Students here, as at Berkeley and Princeton, are teaming up with left-leaning professors, though far fewer than in the Vietnam era, and perennial protesters from their communities.)
"Being American does not mean blindly supporting the American government," said Fadi Kiblawi, 20, a Kuwaiti-born Palestinian who went to high school in St. Louis and is among the peace group leaders. "It means using your civil rights to say what you think America should be." 
Instead of bombing targets in Afghanistan, these students suggest prosecuting Osama bin Laden and other terrorism suspects through an international war tribunal. They fault the United States sanctions against Iraq and Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as Western economic policies throughout the third world, for inciting anti-American hatred.
Even if few civilians are killed by allied bombs, they say, the action will create millions more Afghan refugees.
"There are institutions in place that can bring justice in a way that is not retaliation," said Jackie Bray, 19, a sophomore from Ridgewood, N.J. "The idea of wiping out every terrorist across the world is very appealing, but it's not very realistic."
The Michigan Daily -- Tom Hayden, author of the Port Huron statement and founder of Students for a Democratic Society, was once its editor -- has been critical of the military campaign, but a divided Michigan Student Assembly passed a pro-war resolution on Tuesday.
For every co-op house with a peace banner there is a fraternity with a flag hanging from its window. At each antiwar gathering, a handful of counterdemonstrators show up with flags and soon swell to a modest crowd.
"Instead of being a conservative organization with these conservative views, we've all of a sudden become the hub of patriotism on campus," said Peter Apel, a senior, whose Young Americans for Freedom chapter has been coordinating the pro-war protests.
Many on the 38,000-student campus are preoccupied with midterm exams, not military policy. The Diag, the crossroads of the Ann Arbor campus, was decorated this week with banners advertising Homecoming 2001, National Coming Out Day, and "All Nations, Campus Ministry."
In the center of the Diag, young men tossed a lacrosse ball, part of a 100-hour fund-raising marathon (they are donating 10 percent of the proceeds to New York firefighters).
"We stayed out of it, just trying to stay in the middle," said Jason Hall, a sophomore, referring to the dueling antiwar and pro-war rallies as he played catch in the rain on Thursday night. "This campus is so active. Everything's a huge deal around here."

HEADLINE: Reservoir Roadway Closings Hit a Town's Economy 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SHOKAN, N.Y., Oct. 13 

 BODY:
Across the nation, anthrax mailings have led to increased fears over bioterrorism, focusing on the potential chemical contamination of water supplies. But here in this quiet Catskill town, just 100 miles from ground zero and alongside a reservoir that supplies much of New York City's water, the concern is an older one: the local economy.
 Minutes after the second plane hit the World Trade Center last month, officials from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection closed the three roadways that cross the Ashokan Reservoir here and set up a round-the-clock patrol by the agency's police officers. The closings have required drivers to and from Shokan to detour more than 20 miles around the reservoir, the second-largest in New York City's vast water system. 
 Two results have been higher gasoline expenses for commuters and school buses and a severe decrease in customer traffic for stores and restaurants. The parking lots at two shopping plazas on Route 28, the main thoroughfare here, stand deserted. The Tongore Restaurant, a mainstay since the 1980's, has closed its doors until further notice.
Residents say they are aware this is a time for sacrifice, but they question whether the stepped-up reservoir security is a deterrent to anyone but them. Their frustrations boiled over last Tuesday night in a meeting at a local library, where a crowd of 150 grilled officials from the environmental department about the need for the restrictions.
"What's going to happen to the ghost town of Shokan?" one woman asked.
David Kalpakis, owner of Winchell's Pizza, said that his business had fallen 65 percent and that local merchants were suffering "collateral damage" from the terrorist attacks. For years, he said, he has feared what he considers the city's encroaching authority over the reservoir area. "Starting two years ago, you guys started clearing everybody off the reservoir," he said. "I just have a feeling something big is going on; I think you're trying to get rid of all of us."
On Thursday, environmental officials responded by allowing residents who obtain special permits to drive the restricted roads during the day. But some here are still concerned that the limits will curtail the tourist trade during the busy foliage season. 
Tension between Shokan residents and the watershed police is almost a tradition here, stretching back to the construction of the reservoir from 1907 to 1916, when whole villages were submerged. "It just shows up more directly in times like this," said Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, a Democrat from nearby Saugerties, who has challenged the environmental department's security measures and persuaded city officials to attend the meeting to heal rifts that are decades old.
The meeting was the first time that residents were able to air grievances publicly against the agency, which is widely resented here as an outside force, defending a water supply for a distant city. Although local residents are allowed to boat and fish in the Ashokan and hunt in the watershed forests, those activities have been prohibited since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
"They're pretty tough people up here," said Peter J. Naccarato, an Ulster County legislator. "It's just that they're not used to being stepped on."
At the meeting, concerns about possible attacks on the reservoir seemed almost secondary; many residents wanted to know the precise nature of any threat that justified the road closings.
The city's responses only made the crowd angrier. Citing security restrictions, the officials answered in generalities, saying that chemical or biological contamination of the reservoir was extremely unlikely, but that physical sabotage of the water system was a concern. Robert Varieur, director of the agency's police force, was emphatic, though, in denying a local newspaper's report that the Ashokan was second on a list of terrorist targets.
Department officials are not the only ones concerned about reservoir security. Environmentalists and other city officials have warned for years that not enough has been been done to protect the water supply from a terrorist attack.
When the United States airstrikes on Afghanistan began, watershed police patrol shift lengths were doubled, but not the number of officers. While the 100 officers at Ashokan are currently working 12-hour shifts, Mr. Varieur said, more department recruits are expected when a $30 million plan is passed by the New York City Council. Mr. Hinchey has asked Tom Ridge, the new director of homeland security, to set aside some of the $40 billion that is earmarked for disaster relief to pay for increased protection of the watershed.
The department's deputy commissioner and director, Dr. Michael Principe, said reservoir access would continue to improve in the next few weeks, although restrictions would remain. "It's not a lifetime thing," he said. "We're not closing things down forever."
Vin Martello, a local businessman who organized the town meeting, said he planned more gatherings to help close the rift with the Department of Environmental Protection. "It's an ongoing process," he said. 
But Antonia Weidenbacher, 60, a local artist who roller-skates on roads running over the reservoir, urged the formation of a citizen patrol to staff checkpoints on the restricted roads. She said they would be better able than the city officers to spot suspicious travelers.
"If this sacrifice was going to make us safer, then I would say O.K.," she said. "I'm not sure it makes us safer; it makes us more unhappy."

HEADLINE: Mexican Immigrants Face New Set of Fears 

BYLINE:  By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: DENVER, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
The whole nation has been anxious this past month, but for millions of Mexican immigrants around the country there have been added fears.
 Roundups of illegal immigrants in Colorado and tough enforcement of immigration laws at workplaces in Oregon have led to anguished, and apparently unfounded, concerns that the government is cracking down on Hispanic workers in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
 But the truly punishing repercussion of those attacks has been a round of sweeping layoffs in the airline and hotel industries and other industries with large Mexican labor forces. One national union estimates that a third of its 265,000 members, most of whom are Hispanic immigrants, have been dismissed since the attacks. 
The layoffs have posed harsh choices for Mexican immigrants as they consider whether to live with joblessness in the United States, where food stamps, health benefits and other services are mostly unavailable to them, or return to Mexico, where the outlook is still more foreboding. Hundreds of thousands of jobs in Mexico have been eliminated as the American slowdown has sparked a serious recession south of the border, not only in the villages that depend on money sent home by Mexican workers in the United States but also in the maquiladoras, the border assembly plants, where employment is off about 20 percent from last year.
The hardship began in late September for Dario Elizalde and his wife, Olga, when they returned to their home in a trailer park in Avon, Colo., after visiting relatives in Mexico. Olga, who had earned $7 an hour scrubbing toilets in vacation homes, was dismissed by her employer, who said tourists had canceled fall trips to the Rockies. Mr. Elizalde, who had earned $12 an hour framing houses, was also laid off.
"Its like we're in purgatory," Olga said in Spanish. "We don't know if we're staying or leaving."
The government registered a sharp drop in the number of illegal immigrants detained along the Southwest border in the first eight days of October -- 10,622 people, less than half the 22,912 detained in the same period last year. The drop may indicate that many workers are not trying to travel north, at least for now, because American agents have been searching border crossers more vigorously since Sept. 11.
But others may be staying home because they have heard about the layoffs of thousands of Mexicans in the United States. Leaders of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union in nine major cities reported last week that between 25 and 40 percent of the union's heavily Latino work force in those cities had been laid off.
"This is devastating," said Maria Elena Durazo, a national vice president of the union, which is setting up several relief centers to collect food for unemployed workers. "Nothing like this has ever happened in the memory of our union's leaders."
Thousands of Mexican workers have been dismissed from airport restaurants and parking lots and from companies that prepare in-flight meals. Others have had full-time jobs cut to part-time. 
Ramiro Rivera, a father of two who waits tables in one Houston hotel and washes dishes in another, was working 80 hours a week before Sept. 11. Both hotels have trimmed his hours, to a total of 32 a week. "I'm surviving, but barely," he said.
Other industries with large Hispanic work forces have not seen large layoffs. Meat packing and poultry processing plants concentrated in the Great Plains and the Southeast are operating normally, although construction has slowed.
Still, some workers are returning to Mexico to wait out the storm. At a meeting that brought hundreds of Mexican workers together in a Roman Catholic church near Vail, Colo., last week, an unemployed carpenter said he was leaving for home and asked Leticia Calzada, the Mexican consul general in Denver, whether authorities would levy a tax on his power tools when he returned home. (She said they would not.)
Ms. Calzada said she received scores of anguished calls from workers fearing mass deportations after 29 Mexican dishwashers and janitors working at the Denver airport with false documents were detained on Sept. 19 and sent home.
Mexican workers were involved in at least two other immigration enforcement actions in recent weeks, one small and the other sweeping. But nothing suggests that the terrorist attacks have resulted in harsher treatment of Hispanic immigrants.
The same week as the airport roundup, immigration agents detained and deported more than a dozen Mexican laborers outside a slaughterhouse in Fort Morgan, Colo., northeast of Denver, workers said in interviews. Nina Pruneda-Muniz, a spokeswoman in Denver for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, confirmed the detentions but said they were part of a long-running criminal investigation.
In a broader action that also raised fears that authorities had begun to enforce immigration laws more harshly, 834 Mexican workers in Portland, Ore., most of them janitors, were dismissed in recent days. But the mass dismissals resulted from an audit of 41 companies by the immigration service, begun in July, which determined that the workers lacked valid work permits, said Karen Kraushaar, a national agency spokeswoman. The agency has not altered its enforcement tactics with regard to Latin American immigrants since Sept. 11, she said.
At last week's meeting near Vail, Ms. Calzada repeated what President Vicente Fox of Mexico had said on a visit just before Sept. 11: that the United States could benefit both nations by granting legal status to three million undocumented Mexicans. But Tom Stone, a local county commissioner, told the largely Mexican audience that Americans now favor tightening, rather than relaxing, immigration laws. 
Ms. Calzada has learned how the attacks have emboldened some anti-immigrant groups.
After ski resort owners invited her to address a Sept. 20 gathering in Snowmass, Colo., she received a letter from Mike McGarry, a leader of a group that opposes growth in Mexican immigration, warning that it would be "grossly inappropriate" for a Mexican official to speak in public after "the murderous destruction" caused by "illegal aliens."
"I don't like the idea of Fox telling us to legalize Mexicans who compete unfairly with the native American worker," Mr. McGarry said in an interview. 
Yet Ms. Calzada said she had been warmly received everywhere she had appeared recently, a sign of continued good will toward immigrants.
"Americans as a people have noble hearts," she said.

HEADLINE: And Now, We Return To Scheduled Programs; 
TV Production Quickly Rebounds, With New York City as a Backdrop

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
On a television stage in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, it was still very much ground zero on a recent afternoon, even though the Sept. 11 catastrophe was more than a month old.
 The cast and crew of "Third Watch" -- a streetwise NBC series about rescue workers in a city that is still in a state of shock because so many rescuers were victims of the terrorist attack -- was feverishly shooting a crucial scene for one of three new episodes about the tragedy. 
 Dave Shanker, the assistant prop master, slammed a six-foot piece of plywood to simulate a reverberating boom. Yes, that boom. Then the camera tracked Jason Wiles, an actor whose role is a patrol officer who responds to major disasters. At the boom, he looked up. He moved to the window. He peered out at the burning trade center, his face a mask of disbelief, concern -- and purposefulness. 
His final expression could not more perfectly mirror the stubborn resilience of New York City's $2.5 billion television and film industry after the Sept. 11 tragedy and its devastating effects on business, now complicated by the uncertainties of the Afghanistan war.
Thanks to a scheduling anomaly, the livelihoods of those who make films and television shows have not been as seriously disrupted as those in many other segments of New York's economy.
Since the turn of the century, New York's five boroughs have been one large movie set, and right now 301 square miles are available for shooting 24 hours a day -- with a permit, mind you.
"New York is open for business," said Patricia Reed Scott, commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. "Anyone can work who wants to work."
Surprisingly, film and television production will actually be increasing exponentially over the next month, outpacing the slow recovery of New York's tourism and hospitality industry, "which is taking one heck of a hit," according to Tim Zagat, chairman of NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors bureau.
A conjunction of unusual circumstances aided the film and television industry. For starters, most of the prime-time television productions set in New York, from "Sex and the City" to "Law and Order," were on hiatus in early September.
At the same time, feature film production had been suspended for the most part, because in the first half of 2001, Hollywood studios had geared up to beat expected strikes in May and June. In New York, "the first half of the year was incredibly busy, and we had all the work we wanted," Ms. Scott said.
But filmmaking "lulled out after June," she said, and by mid-September, there were no major Hollywood feature films shooting in New York and only a handful of independent films. If business was largely dormant on Sept. 11, it had nothing to do with the terrorist attack. Many catering, security, and scene-construction companies were idle in September, and so were most of the 78,000 union members employed in New York filmmaking and the 5,000 production-services businesses serving the industry.
After the catastrophe, the producers of up-and-running television shows like "100 Centre Street," on A&E, and "The Job," an ABC series, were able to shoot scenes in studios or outside of Manhattan. Now, many film and television productions are gearing up for more work.
The feature films from major studios that will be shooting in New York in the next month include "Sweet Home Alabama," starring Glenn Close, Patrick Dempsey and Reese Witherspoon. Incoming independents include a movie from Magic Johnson's production company.
In addition, television production will resume this month on "The Sopranos," and "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit," and in November on the original "Law and Order."
No production better exemplifies the post-disaster arc than "Third Watch." On the day of the attack, the show's cast and crew had scheduled a 2 p.m. shoot in Harlem.
After the first plane struck, the show's four principal technical advisers -- who are Police and Fire Department employees, paramedics and emergency medical technicians -- immediately headed for ground zero. Subsequently, all four were engulfed by the collapse of both buildings. (One, Charlie Wells, was buried for an hour before being rescued.)
"They were all incredibly fortunate to have survived," said Brooke Kennedy, the show's New York-based executive producer.
Unfortunately, other rescue specialists who worked with "Third Watch" did not escape.
They included three emergency-service police officers, two of whom had speaking roles on the show; six firefighters who had appeared in scenes, and three other firefighters who were off-screen technical consultants.
The production and its complement of 200 crew members was shut down for 11 days, but the cast and crew joined those of many other television production teams in immediately volunteering for the rescue effort.
On the first night, they discovered that rescuers at ground zero were finding it impossible, and dangerous, to navigate the wreckage using their weak helmet lights. Worse, the city's standard-issue emergency lights were bulky and immobile.
So film and television crew members, working with donated equipment from movie-lighting businesses, helped install flexible 9,000-watt movie-production lights that brilliantly illuminated the area. 
The "Third Watch" studio in Greenpoint, which had stores of medical supplies, clothing, protective gear and emergency equipment for use as props and set-dressing, donated its inventory.
Professionally, the cast and crew of "Third Watch" also threw themselves into a new production plan, creating three new episodes on the trade center tragedy, the first of which is to be shown tonight.
That first show, expanded to two hours, will be what Ms. Kennedy called "a tribute documentary" of interviews with firefighters, police officers and emergency medical technicians about their courageous actions on Sept. 11.
The second show, to be called "Sept. 10," will portray the fictionalized lives of the "Third Watch" characters before the tragedy. And the third, to be called "Beginnings," will pick up the fictional characters several weeks after the terrorist attack.
"It's therapeutic to be working on the show again," said Anthony Ruivivar, who plays Carlos Nieto, a paramedic. "But we are here to represent the true heroes -- the people running into those buildings." 
And so, despite the late-summer lull and the aftermath of Sept. 11, "at its core, the film and television industry in New York is very strong, because there is a critical mass of experienced people in every aspect of the business here, from acting to advertising to technical production," said Harold L. Vogel, an independent entertainment analyst and author of "Entertainment Industry Economics: a Guide for Financial Analysis."
The city's film and television industry peaked in 1998, with 22,851 shooting days, according to the mayor's film office. The six major Hollywood studios began making fewer feature films in 1999, and by 2000, New York's shooting days declined to 21,393. The shooting of commercials was hit hard after a five-month strike that ended in November 2000, "but commercials are now back to prestrike levels -- a happy surprise," said Ms. Scott, the commissioner of the city's film, theater and broadcasting office. 
Currently, the city is sensitive to production decisions made in Hollywood. Mr. Vogel said, "Now, there is uncertainty about what kind of programs people will like in the current environment."
Hard times have sometimes buoyed the entertainment industry in the past. "The cliche was that during the Depression, people smoked, drank and watched movies," Mr. Vogel said. "But if people are glued to their television sets watching real-time war coverage, that won't cause an increasing demand for movies."
Given the example of "Third Watch," it is "possible that New York City will generate more stories after the tragedy than it did before," Ms. Scott said. "That depends on how much new product is going to be made in this climate. Does anybody know what this climate is?"

HEADLINE: Strike in Minnesota Ends As State and Unions Settle 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
State and union officials in Minnesota reached an agreement today ending a two-week walkout of more than half the state government's work force.
 More than 23,000 public employees will return to their jobs on Monday. Negotiators early this morning settled wage and health care disputes that had prompted the strike that began on Oct. 1. 
 "I consider this a win, a clear win, for our members," said Peter Benner, executive director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 6, one of the two striking unions that negotiated the agreement.
The settlement was reached after three days of negotiations. Union officials said the settlement gave Mr. Benner's union a 3.5 percent wage increase for the next two years -- less than the 5 percent per year it had sought, but half a percentage point higher than the state's final offer before the strike.
The state also agreed to give 3 percent annual pay increases for the next two years to members of the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees. Union officials said the state also offered a better health care package.
Members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, among them highway maintenance workers, janitors, food service workers and corrections guards, had earned an average of $30,000 a year. The forensic scientists, food inspectors, computer professionals and other members of the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees had earned an average of $49,000 a year.
"All sides ought to be very pleased at how they came through this," said Julien Carter, the state employee relations commissioner.
Gov. Jesse Ventura said last week that the state could not increase its offer without risking layoffs of state employees. 
Mr. Carter said he could not rule out layoffs to cover the increases in the state's offer. He said it would be up to individual agencies to trim as needed if the costs were too high.
The strike was the largest government walkout in Minnesota history and had drawn tepid support from the usually pro-labor public because of its timing after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A poll by The Star Tribune of Minneapolis found people more sympathetic to the administration's position than to the unions'.
Last week, union officials and the state said they agreed to resume negotiations after the start of the military campaign in Afghanistan.
But state officials said the weakening economy more than anything else had prompted a deal. "The constant through all the talks has been the economy," Mr. Carter said. 
The strike's effect was tempered by the state's hiring of nearly 1,000 National Guard members to cover essential services, including nursing care. But the signs of labor action were becoming more clear, from the prevalence of dead animals along highways to unrepaired traffic lights, a closed zoo and increasing stress on services like parole monitoring and health inspections.
Early last week, Minnesota state epidemiologists blamed the strike for a slow response to an outbreak of E. coli that affected 15 children in a suburban Minneapolis preschool.
Some of the strike's effects may linger. "There's a lot of hard feelings," Lisa Maidl, a revenue collector in Ely, in northeastern Minnesota, told The Associated Press. "I'm just going to go in, sit at my desk and hopefully avoid some of those people for a while."
The deal is subject to ratification by the unions, a process that may take several weeks. It also is subject to the approval of a joint committee within the Minnesota Legislature.

HEADLINE: Good Omens Come With Warnings for New Jersey's Next Governor 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
The companies that rate New Jersey's state bonds gave the state's creditworthiness another good grade last week, with a warning: a tidal wave of new debt in the offing could still swamp the state. In a sense, the same ambiguity hangs over almost every aspect of the state as it prepares to elect a new governor.
 The next governor will take over the richest state in the union, one that bustles with high-wage, high-technology jobs and investment, yet he will immediately face a budget deficit that legislative experts say could reach $1 billion -- an immense gap that has barely been mentioned in the current campaign. 
 He will take over a state with some of the highest-scoring students in the country, taught by the best-paid teachers. But education costs also saddle the state with the highest property taxes in the country, while years of litigation and wrangling have failed to solve the problem of inequality between city and suburban schools. 
He will inherit one of the most powerful governor's offices in the country. But much of his success in office will depend on how well the state's crazy quilt of 566 municipalities and 611 school districts, often rife with inefficiency and patronage, manage their own problems.
The new governor will take over a state in which sprawl has become cemented into the daily experience of millions of drivers on clogged highways, as the very prosperity that has lifted New Jersey beyond its neighbors in wealth produces more growth, more traffic and less open space. With 1,100 people per square mile, New Jersey is already more crowded than India or Japan.
Above all, the winner will become governor of a state that has been in recession since February, when an extraordinary period of economic growth ended after nearly a decade, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, and the state's leading economic forecaster.
"It's likely that January will be the trough of the downturn," Dr. Hughes said, "so the next governor is taking office at the worst possible time, and most likely there will be short-term budgetary crises to grapple with. However, the economic situation could turn around dramatically as 2002 unfolds."
The candidates, Bret D. Schundler, the Republican, and James E. McGreevey, the Democrat, have been talking about some of the major policy challenges that await the winner on Jan. 15, inauguration day. For example, Mr. Schundler says he would goad public schools into working harder by increasing public financing for private and charter schools to compete with them, while Mr. McGreevey says he wants to hold students and teachers to stricter standards.
Mr. Schundler says he would combat sprawl by directing growth back to the cities. Mr. McGreevey says he endorses the state plan -- a set of guidelines for controlled growth -- which was adopted 20 years ago to high praise but has yet to stop many old farms from sprouting condos and office parks. 
Mr. Schundler has acknowledged that a recession could grip the state, and has said it would provide an opportunity to force spending cuts that would otherwise be politically impossible to pass. And he has said that a continued downturn could force him to postpone giving the elderly $800 million in property tax relief. At the same time, he has stood by his promise to remove the tolls from the Garden State Parkway; the state would take over the roadway's $130 million a year in operating costs and $650 million in debts.
Mr. McGreevey has acknowledged the likelihood of difficulties ahead by saying that it would be irresponsible to promise not to raise taxes. But the closest he came to discussing economic issues in Wednesday's televised debate was to joke that his mother was saying the rosary for a strong economy. 
The state Constitution requires the next governor to present a new 2002-2003 budget almost as soon as he takes office, and it will not be an easy task, said Alan R. Kooney, legislative budget and finance officer in the Office of Legislative Services, the Legislature's nonpartisan administrative and research staff.
"Whoever gets elected will walk in and face a situation that will probably not be dissimilar to the situation that Jim Florio faced in 1990, and he got hit just at the end of an incredible boom that had suddenly halted," Mr. Kooney said.
"I don't know how many hundreds of millions or billions in deficits that we're talking about," he went on, "but it will be an extraordinarily difficult budget."
In 1990, Mr. Florio rammed through $2.8 billion in higher taxes to fill a budget deficit. In the ensuing antitax furor, Republicans won the governorship and control of both houses of the Legislature for the rest of the decade, and a pervasive culture of tax-loathing was born.
But experts like Dr. Hughes and Mr. Kooney emphasize the prospects for a strong eventual recovery. There is no real estate bubble to burst this time, like the one that deepened the recession of the early 1990's, they say. The economists add that the state's industries are strong, and that the destruction of the World Trade Center by terrorists may even produce more investment and still more jobs for the state.
"We're a very wealthy state," Mr. Kooney said. "But you can be O.K. in the long run but still have a budget process where the year-to-year fluctuations give you agita, and year to year is where politicians live."
The latest census reported that New Jersey had passed Connecticut as the richest state in household income, with an median income of $54,226 a year, compared with $53,106 for Connecticut, which ranked first in 1990. 
It was the high wealth of New Jersey that prompted the bond rating companies to continue to give New Jersey's public debt high ratings, despite a huge increase in debt over the decade. In 1990, New Jersey owed $4 billion, and it will soon be closer to $20 billion when new borrowing already approved goes on the books, Dr. Hughes said.
But while New Jersey can afford its current debts, the rating firms said in reports last week, extensive new borrowing could jeopardize the state's ability to pay in later years.
Still more worrisome to economists is the likelihood that the high salaries and bonuses paid by Wall Street will dry up and severely hurt state revenues. Last year, nearly 73 percent of all income taxes were paid by taxpayers making more than $100,000, and nearly 46 percent were from those earning more than $250,000. Any decline in those high-end salaries, Mr. Kooney said, would affect state revenues immediately.
New Jersey is under court order to correct the imbalance between rich and poor school districts, yet the state's deeply balkanized system of independent districts has made it hard and expensive to meet the court's demand. For example, the school construction figure is so high, in part, because once the state agreed to build new schools for the inner cities, representatives from even the wealthiest suburbs refused to vote for the funds until schools in their districts got a share.
Leo F. Klagholz, the former state commissioner of education, said in an interview that fragmentation was the defining characteristic of New Jersey's school problems, along with a powerful teachers' union, the New Jersey Education Association, which guards members' rights jealously.
And with responsibility divided among hundreds of districts, local school officials often feel protected from state pressure to improve efficiency.
Similarly, a multiplicity of school districts tends to drive up salaries, since the latest settlement tends to become the benchmark for all other district contracts, said Henry A. Coleman, a professor in public policy at Rutgers. New Jersey already spends nearly $10,000 a year per pupil in public education, far more than any other state, and 60 percent of that is paid for by the highest property taxes in the country, with the rest coming from the state.
Not surprisingly, high property taxes continue to be a volatile political issue at election time, yet the candidates have tended to approach the issue around its edges, with proposals for changing the system of rebates from the state. Mr. Schundler would compensate the elderly for their property taxes. Mr. McGreevey has promised to freeze property taxes and limit the New Jersey Saver tax rebate program to taxpayers earning less than $200,000, which amounts to a tax increase on the wealthy. 
But then, however much they may complain, the voters have so far neither managed to hold the line on teacher salaries, the largest component in school costs, nor pressed hard to have the state assume a larger proportion of education costs. Instead, each spring, they continue to vote for the most lavish school programs in the country.
None of this surprises Dr. Coleman. "New Jersey is a rich state," he said, "and buying expensive educations for their children is something rich people like to do."

HEADLINE: Insurance Could Largely Shape the City's Economic Future 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER and LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
A torrent of money is starting to flow into New York City, a wave of cash that will dwarf the federal aid promised to the city in the wake of the World Trade Center attack and the money that charities have raised for the victims.
 This money, which could easily top $40 billion, will be crucial to the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. And because it is coming from the most mundane of sources -- insurance -- how and where it is spent will be decided not by do-gooders or the governor or a blue-ribbon commission. 
 Instead, this money will go into the hands of individual families and business owners across the city. Their decisions -- about how much they like living and working in New York City, how much they want to rebuild, how much they can afford to replace -- will determine much of the city's economic future. 
They are people like Lisa Chapman, a graphics designer who lived and worked just steps from the World Trade Center. She had only $25,000 of business property insurance and an unknown amount of coverage for the interruption of her business, Chapmanworks. 
The insurance proceeds are almost certainly not enough to replace her elegant office in the historic building at 90 West Street, much less everything in it: decades of artwork and designs, family photographs, Christmas gifts for her twin sons.
The building was heavily damaged; where her office used to be, she said, "There's not even a paper clip left." How and where will she rebuild her business? "That's the thing I've been trying to get my arms around," she said.
New Yorkers have already received more than $4.5 billion in advances against damage claims and payments on life insurance policies; $15 billion more is expected to gush into the city by the end of the year, insurance consultants say.
Ultimately, insurance will probably cover about $17 billion of property damage, $4 billion for loss of life, and perhaps $18 billion in economic losses, according to the New York City comptroller's office. But it could take several years for businesses and insurers to agree on the final amounts, said Chris Campos, a business insurance consultant in Teaneck, N.J.
Some insurance money will simply replace income lost when businesses were knocked out by the attacks. But much of it will be new money that has the potential to give the battered economy a boost, as insurance payments have done to places like California after earthquakes and Florida after hurricanes.
"The money is going to provide a much-needed jolt to New York's economy," said Robert Hartwig, the chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group.
That insurance money is a huge sum when compared with the promised $17 billion in federal aid and less than a billion dollars pledged to charities in the wake of the disaster.
Some economists caution that the situation in New York is far different from that in areas that have experienced natural disasters. Stephen Kagann, chief economist to Gov. George E. Pataki, notes that in those places, much of the damage was to residential neighborhoods.
Efforts to rebuild an area crammed with offices and stores may well proceed more slowly and produce less of a sharp economic rebound, Mr. Kagann said, adding that the most important factor in an economic recovery will be the time it takes for people to feel comfortable returning to their normal habits.
Insurance money is already helping some people do that. Take the 40 or so law firms that occupied 217 Broadway, which closed on Sept. 11 and reopened on Oct. 2. As the twin towers collapsed just blocks away, a thick cloud of dust and debris enveloped the Broadway building and was sucked inside by the air-conditioning system.
"We had to clean every office and every passageway and all the air-conditioning ducts," said John DiMurro, president of Columbus Properties, which owns the building. "The cooling tower had to be drained and flushed. And we had to test the air quality."
The Hartford, a unit of Hartford Financial Services Group, has already advanced Mr. DiMurro $200,000 to help pay for the cleanup, and he expects his total claim will reach $1 million. H.J. Kalikow & Company, the owner of the 29-story office building at 195 Broadway, has received $1 million from the St. Paul Companies in advances on a claim expected to run to several million dollars. "They said, 'If you need more, just tell us,' " said Peter S. Kalikow, the president of the company and the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Naturally, real estate companies will spend their insurance proceeds on fixing up their buildings in Manhattan; office towers cannot pick up and move to Jersey City. Nor can some other outfits with big insurance claims, like the Legal Aid Society of New York, which represents indigent defendants.
The society had its main offices in three floors of the Postal Service building at Church and Vesey Streets, so close to the trade center that it is officially part of the crime scene and under control of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The society's 500 employees have been reassigned to offices around the city. And that has been expensive.
There's the rent for office furniture and for 275 laptop computers, and the cost of 300 desk phones and 120 cellphones, as well as the fees to have everything hooked up. And last week, there was the cost of moving 20 truckloads of legal files to eight sites. The Hartford is paying for all of it.
"We're going to end up spending several million dollars," said Dan Kessler, director of general services for the society. "And the insurance is going to get us there."
For many companies, insurance is paying, at least in part, for a move outside the city. Frankel & Company, a 123-year-old regional insurance brokerage firm, had leased the 36th floor and part of the 35th floor of 2 World Trade Center. "We lost everything," said Robert E. Shunk, the firm's chairman.
The company quickly found temporary office space in Midtown that it is leasing for $100,000 a month until the end of the year. But it also moved 40 people to an office building in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., where about 30 employees had previously worked.
Frankel got a $2 million advance from the St. Paul Companies and spent hundreds of thousands of it in Manhattan, much of it for computers and phones that were sent to the New Jersey office. Frankel is looking for permanent space in New York, and plans to keep as many employees as possible here, Mr. Shunk said, "depending on the availability of space and the cost."
Smaller businesses say they are finding it harder to deal with their insurance companies, and many do not know whether they will get enough money to recoup their expenses, much less to rebuild.
Julie Menin, the owner of Vine restaurant at 25 Broad Street, said that so far her insurance company had advanced only a small sum, "not enough to cover food spoilage or cleanup, not to mention our losses from canceled events."
Ms. Menin, who is trying to run her restaurant and is heading up a new civic group called Wall Street Rising to try to restore the vitality of downtown, is frustrated that she cannot get her phone calls returned. "I want to get back to focusing on my business," she said.
To help her and others in her situation, the Bar Association of the City of New York is training hundreds of volunteer lawyers to help small businesses with insurance and other questions.
Jeannine W. Chanes, a lawyer who specializes in representing policyholders, said that many small businesses were unsure of what kind of insurance they had, and that many had no insurance at all.
Ms. Chapman, the graphic artist, is among those getting legal help to untangle her questions about business interruption insurance, and to advise her about the policy, which lapsed in August, on her apartment in Battery Park City. She is also dealing with the emotional toll of watching people jump from the twin towers before the collapse.
"There are issues of trauma," she said. "But I'm trying to think for myself and residents and small-business owners. It could be therapeutic, going down and rebuilding our community."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DISPLACED; 
Afghan Family Salvages Little but Its Hopes

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: QABEZAN, Afghanistan, Oct. 13 

 BODY:
At the age of 11, he moved with his family from this mountain village to the capital, Kabul, in search of a better life. At 22, he married. When he was 25, in 1979, the Soviet Union invaded his country. At 32, he became a father when his wife gave birth to their first child. At 38, he lost his wife, who became one of the first civilians killed in a four-year civil war that plagued Kabul and left 25,000 dead.
 When he was 43, the Taliban brought a promise of peace to the city. But later he was beaten by the religious police, who accused him of not praying enough. And last Sunday, American cruise missiles shattered the windows of his home. 
 At 48, Afzal, who has only one name, has lived through a long, painful arc of Afghan history. And sadly, he and his family are a testament to the country's present plight. 
Afzal is illiterate. He earns $8 a week as a truck mechanic. His family is spread across the front line and the world. He has not been allowed to watch television for five years. His political views consist of crude diatribes against the Taliban and the Afghan faction he blames for his wife's death.
After 23 years of invasion and civil war, 70 percent of Afghans are illiterate, one out of every four children dies before the age of 5, and Afghanistan is one of the world's poorest nations. The country's main economic activity is serving as a smuggling hub for the global arms market. Over 1.5 million people have died in the two decades of fighting. 
But Afzal, like many of Afghans, is a determined and resourceful survivor. After all, he is 48. The average Afghan man is dead at 43.
But with his salt-and-pepper beard, leathery skin and two missing front teeth, he appears to be in his late 50's, not 40's. His 11-year-old son, Abubakar, also seems prematurely aged. He was standing with his mother in the family's garden on the summer night in 1992, when she was killed in a rocket attack, along with his aunt and two cousins. Only Abubakar survived.
A decade later, the boy still seems on edge. His eyes dart from side to side. His brow seems to be permanently furrowed.
Despite a lifetime of disappointment, Afzal says he is optimistic that his country's hour has finally come. A better era, better than his own, he hopes, awaits his children.
"I hope he might become a doctor, engineer, teacher," he said referring to his son, "or other profession that helps our people."
The Kabul to which he moved with his family in the late 1960's was a completely different city from the one he fled this week.
"The people who lived in Kabul were able to move where they wanted," Afzal said. "There was no problem walking during the day and night."
In an interview here in his native village, in an area which the Northern Alliance rebels control, he described a Kabul where intellectuals from around the Muslim world filled cafes, and Indian and American movies played in theaters. The country's ruler was Mohammad Zahir Shah, the man the Bush administration hopes may play a role in forming a post-Taliban government.
The country's many ethnic groups mixed together well in the late 1960's and early 70's, he said. Many women wore the burka, a veil covering them from head to ankle. But others wore Western clothes and used a veil to cover only their hair.
Afzal traces the violence that now grips Afghanistan to Communists who took control of the country in the late 1970's. A small Marxist-Leninist party seized power in a 1978 coup and then carried out radical land reform. Tens of thousands of people were arrested in the countryside and executed. Politicians, religious leaders, teachers and other professionals came under attack. "They killed many people," he said. 
Afzal paints Afghan politics in stark black-and-white terms. The sources of all the country's problems, he says, are the the Taliban, the Communists and faction whose rockets he believes killed his wife. 
He has never known an elected government; most came to power by force. 
On Dec. 24, 1979, Afzal watched from his apartment as the Soviet invaders landed at the Kabul airport and moved out to take control of the country. He served as a conscript in the Afghan Army for three years, performing menial duties in Kabul. His younger brother, Yonas, fought on the other side of the front line, serving as a mujahedeen guerrilla. Thirty-four people from his home village died in the fighting.
When the Soviets left after a decade, peace seemed to have returned to Kabul. In 1992, mujahedeen forces took the city. But one group of mujahedeen commanders created a government that excluded others. One commander responded by indiscriminately firing rockets and artillery shells into Kabul. It was one of these that killed Afzal's wife, Nazy, and maimed his son.
His wife was 35. A mother of four, she was an unusually accomplished Afghan woman; she had a ninth-grade education. An estimated 87 percent of women here are illiterate.
The fighting and shelling that ensued forced Afzal to stay in his apartment with his remaining family members rather than risk fleeing. "My children were young," he said. "We were safer in our home."
His wife's relatives received refugee status and left the country, settling in Germany. But as the situation continued to deteriorate, communication with the outside world became more difficult. Afzal was unable to speak with his in-laws for seven years.
In 1996, the Taliban seized control of Kabul, promising to end the chaos. But the stringent Islamic code they imposed forced many changes. Afzal grew his beard long to avoid harassment by the religious police. He had to close his truck repair shop five times a day for prayers. His children were barred from flying kites, which the Taliban said took time away from studying the Koran.
"Since the Taliban took control," he said, pointing to his beard, "it's difficult for people to control their own body."
One night the religious police paid him a visit. "They took me out of the apartment and kicked me in the face," he said. "They said, 'Why don't you go to the mosque for prayers?' "
Afzal, incensed by the Taliban's heavy-handedness, said he wholeheartedly supported the American bombing that began a week ago.
When the first American cruise missile hit, Afzal was listening to the BBC. His son Abubakar was asleep. Afzal said he was confident enough that American bombs and missiles would not miss their targets that he left his new wife and other children in Kabul. Afzal and Abubakar plan to return to them this week.
He was puzzled when asked about the danger of returning to a city that was being bombed. "I have to accept the risk," he said.
But while Afzal said that he was not frightened, his son clearly was. "I don't come out of the house," the boy said quietly when asked what he did when he heard jets. "When I'm at home it's safer."
Afzal said he was optimistic about the future and predicted that the Taliban would fall. This time, he said, stability will come to his country.
Asked how he had managed to survive so much, he shrugged. "It's in God's hands," he said.
His late wife, he said, shared his hopes for their children.
"Her biggest wish was to make her sons and daughters educated," he said. "To become doctors, engineers, teachers, and other professions that the people need."
But only a few schools are functioning in this country that seems to be moving backward in time. His late wife's dream remains unfulfilled. All four of her children are illiterate.

Israel Kills Hamas Leader, Eases Some Restrictions
An Israeli military sniper killed a local leader of the radical Palestinian group Hamas during his dawn prayers, and hours later Israel said that it would reward the relative quiet in Palestinian areas by relaxing some of its security restrictions. Senior Palestinian officials, although they condemned the killing, sat down again in Jerusalem with their Israeli counterparts to discuss strengthening their peculiar truce. A8

Maps depicting the new "buffer zone," or "closed military area," that Israel has created in the northern West Bank have appeared recently outside mosques there. The hope, it says, is to stop potential killers from crossing the boundary into Israel. To avoid arrest on the Israeli side, Palestinians must be able to prove that they live in any village where soldiers stop them. A8

Irish Funeral, 80 Years Later

LADLEY, JAMES PATRICK

 BODY:
 LADLEY-James Patrick, 41, a Cantor Fitzgerald Partner and Corporate Bond Broker, was working at 1 World Trade Center on the 104th floor. James was last spoken to at work on the morning of September 11th. He was a lifelong resident of Staten Island, NY, where he attended Saint Adalbert's and Moore Catholic High School. An accomplished athlete, he lettered four years and was captain of the baseball and basketball teams. He earned a baseball scholarship to North Adams State College, Massachusetts, where he played for four years in his best known position as catcher. He graduated in 1982 and was awarded a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. James Ladley returned home to Staten Island where his love for baseball resumed with the TWYFord Muche Leagues. At the same time, he pursued his interests in Finance and Economics, which ultimately led him to a successful career. James P. Ladley began his career on Wall Street 17 years ago. He started as an assistant broker at Fundamental Brokerage, Inc. James spent many evenings entertaining clients and built strong business relationships as well as friendships along the way. He moved to Chapdelaine Corporate Securities, became a Partner and held a position within the corporate bond division. James continued his successes as he accepted a new position at Cantor Fitzgerald. For over six years he enjoyed working for the firm as a Partner and as a corporate bond broker, one of the top producers for the firm. James won the respect and admiration of his many friends and co-workers. He expected a lot from himself and out of life. He had a tremendous work ethic and a rigorous schedule that began at 5 AM and ended at 7 PM: it was just a day's work. James P. Ladley also loved the recreational game of golf. He truly enjoyed the friendships and the beauty it offered. These past few years on any given Saturday, he could be found on the Green at the Colts Neck Golf Club.

HEADLINE: A Nation Challenged 

 BODY:
 A Political Puzzle

AFTER THE TALIBAN -- One week after the bombs started falling on Afghanistan, the United States military campaign has run ahead of Washington's political strategy to install a new regime in Kabul. While United States has pursued Osama bin Laden and sought to neutralize the Taliban that shelters him, the behind-the-scenes effort to organize a regime that would replace Taliban leaders has made no discernible progress. A1

A MISSING VOICE -- The recent assassination of the Afghan rebel leader is being felt most deeply in the alliance's efforts to persuade Taliban commanders to defect. B3

IN PLAIN SIGHT -- Where do Taliban soldiers hide from American bombs? At the front line, say commanders, soldiers and refugees. Political factors appear to have made the front lines north of Kabul one of the least bombed places in the country. B3

A Loud 'No'

REJECTED AGAIN -- President Bush rejected another offer from the Taliban to negotiate the surrender of Osama bin Laden if the United States stops bombing Afghanistan. "When I said no negotiations, I meant no negotiations," the president said. Mr. Bush spoke as American aircraft continued to bomb Kabul and other cities in Afghanistan and as Islamic militants clashed with the police. A1

WAR AND SACRIFICE -- The president faces a dilemma that none of his precursors encountered. He is hemmed in by the very nature of the foe he is pledged to defeat -- not a nation or an ideology but terrorism itself. B1

The Biological Threat

EXPANDING A PROGRAM -- The Bush administration announced a huge expansion of its program to deal with the threat of anthrax. It said it was moving to buy antibiotics that could be made available quickly to treat up to 12 million people, six times the number that could be treated by drugs now kept in reserve. A1

BUILDING A STOCKPILE -- The Bush administration's decision to seek the money to buy 10 million more doses of drugs to fight anthrax represents the latest measure by the government to build stockpiles in the event of a bioterrorism attack. B8

DEALING WITH COPYCATS -- As law enforcement officials struggle to track down the perpetrators of real anthrax threats, they must also deal with a growing number of hoaxers, who sometimes invoke the specter of biological attack to evade responsibilities, settle a grudge or gain a sense of power. B8

NERVOUSLY WAITING -- Hundreds of employees of the company where anthrax killed a co-worker are returning to their temporary offices today unsure how long it will be until they know whether they, too, have been infected. B8

CUTTING THE RISK -- Experts say there are many ways a business or institution can cut the risk of being contaminated by anthrax or another biological agent arriving in the mail. B8

NEGATIVE TESTS -- Four people tested for exposure to anthrax from a letter sent to a Microsoft office in Nevada have received clean bills of health. B9

POSITIVE TESTS -- A New York City police detective and two Health Department lab technicians who were involved in the investigation of the NBC anthrax scare have tested positive for exposure to anthrax. The findings led the city to alter how it responds to such incidents. B1

Leisurely Combat

LOW-LEVEL CONFLICT -- The civil war between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance, now the focus of the world's attention, seems hardly a war at all. The fighting rarely reaches a fever pitch. B5

A RETURN TO SERVICE -- The Bridge of Friendship in Uzbekistan is seeing wartime duty again. B5

Battered Life, Early Death

AN AFGHAN'S LIFE -- At 48, Afzal, who has only one name, has lived through a long, painful arc of Afghan history. Sadly, he and his family are a testament to the country's present plight. A1

BOY KILLED -- A 5-year-old Afghan boy was killed when an American bomb crashed into the bedroom where his family was sleeping, a casualty the Pentagon calls collateral damage. B4

Money and Protests

FINANCIAL INQUIRY -- Officials of the United Arab Emirates are examining the country's banking practices to determine whether they were used to transfer money to the hijackers who attacked the United States. B6

DEADLY CONFRONTATION -- Two demonstrators were killed and at least six injured in Pakistan when police fired on a stone-throwing crowd trying to block entrances to an airport where American aircraft are based. B6

Diplomacy and Refugees

BLAIR-ARAFAT TALKS -- Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain will meet Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, in London today in an effort to jump-start stalled peace negotiations in the Middle East. B7

NO EXODUS -- Although aid agencies had expected that thousands of Afghans would try to flee to Iran after the American-led bombing began, the huge exodus has not come. B7

KUWAITI OBJECTS -- A former Kuwaiti government minister and member of the ruling family has denounced what he called his country's "hesitant and timid" support for America's war against terrorism. B7

Tracking a Terror Network

THE INVESTIGATION -- Federal officials said that their aggressive campaign of arrests in recent weeks had broken up several active Al Qaeda cells in the United States. A1

SAUDI ACCUSED -- The placid surroundings where Yasin Abdullah al-Qadi does business in Saudi Arabia were shattered when he found himself on a new list of 39 individuals and groups accused of financing Osama bin Laden. B10

TELEVISION NEWS -- Many Arab Americans have been tuning out American television news in favor of Al Jazeera, the satellite channel that infuriated the White House by playing a tape of Osama bin Laden. B10

Business

A NEW TACTIC -- News company headquarters are accustomed to verbal assaults, not physical ones. That has all changed with the delivery of anthrax into the mailrooms of two American media companies. C1

A MOMENT TO SHINE -- CNN, which has lost market share and direction in the last year, is going all out in covering the bombing of Afghanistan to regain its reputation as a world news leader. C1

SATELLITE TV -- The images now reaching American living rooms from Central Asia and the Middle East are delivered by a loose amalgam of companies from around the world -- many of which may not be as willing as their American counterparts to follow government suggestions not to use raw footage of Al Qaeda statements. C1

The Aftermath

SOMBER ASSEMBLY LINE -- On the second floor of police headquarters in Lower Manhattan, police officers in full dress uniform and white gloves are part of a solemn ceremony, filling 4,000 urns with powdered debris from the World Trade Center. B11

A RESILIENT INDUSTRY -- The livelihoods of those who make films and television shows in New York have not been as seriously disrupted as those in many other segments of the city's economy. F1

PRO BONO EFFORT -- More than 1,000 members of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America have volunteered to help the families of victims of the terror attacks obtain awards from the federal victims' compensation fund. B11

PURSUING HAPPINESS -- Hundreds of people at the Texas State Fair were on the lookout for the carefree, a precious commodity lately. B11

HEADLINE: Outcomes Differ for Insiders and Small Investors at Global Crossing 

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Many people in upstate New York have been financially devastated by the collapse of Global Crossing's stock from $61.375 two years ago, to 82 cents today.
 That is because Global Crossing Ltd., which aimed to build a worldwide fiber optic communications network, swallowed up the old Rochester Telephone, and many investors and workers in the region owned shares in that reliable, low-risk utility that were converted into shares in a high-risk start-up. 
 But some of Global Crossing's executives and directors have done quite well, cashing out to varying degrees the last couple of years.
Gary Winnick, a former sales executive at Drexel Burnham Lambert under Michael R. Milken, put up $20 million to help found the telecommunications company in 1997. Since taking it public in August 1998, he has sold shares for more than $600 million, according to Thomson Financial/ First Call. 
Not a bad pretax return for anyone, even if the nearly 9 percent of the company he still owns has dwindled in value, knocking him off the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people in America.
Long after the telecommunications bubble burst, Mr. Winnick, who is chairman of Global Crossing, continued to be a savvy investor. As recently as May, he locked in a profit on a big stake. Using a transaction known as a collar, in which he gave up some potential to gain, he guaranteed himself a minimum price of $12.38 apiece for nearly 10 million Global Crossing shares. The deal was worth $123 million.
"The company told me that the sale was for diversification," said Rick Grubbs, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais. "I can understand it in a fiduciary capacity. It is hard to have 80 percent or 90 percent of your assets in one stock. But is he getting out at what he perceives to be the top? Does he see something as an insider that we don't? There is a fine line between portfolio diversification and the perception of bailing out of a stock."
All along, Mr. Winnick has said that he and the Pacific Capital Group, an investment firm he controls, were selling for diversification. In May 1999, when the stock hit a closing high of $61.375, Mr. Winnick made news by buying a Bel Air estate for more than $60 million. He ranked as the nation's 68th wealthiest American on the Forbes list, with a fortune estimated at $3.2 billion. 
Mr. Winnick's remaining holding of roughly 68 million shares, warrants and options is now worth only about $55 million, down from about $986 million in May.
Other company insiders also sold earlier this year. David A. Walsh, president and chief operating officer, sold more than 670,000 shares, not quite half his stake, according to a filing, for proceeds of $8.7 million in May.
Joseph P. Clayton, director and division officer and president of Global Crossing North America, owned roughly 2 million shares and options, according to a filing in April. He sold about 49,000 shares for $768,000 in May.
Lodwrick Cook, the company's co-chairman and a retired chairman of ARCO, sold about 763,000 shares either directly or through a family trust for $8.9 million. He owned about 20.5 million shares, options and warrants. John M. Scanlon, a director and one-time chief executive of the company, sold 70,000 of his 2.8 million shares and options for $940,100.
Paul Elliott, an analyst at Thomson Financial/First Call, said all the selling was troubling. "You never like to see insiders selling when a stock is declining, and certainly not declining that dramatically," he said. 
Mr. Winnick envisioned a telecommunications empire with undersea fiber optic cables that would become a worldwide network to transmit information via the Internet. Part of the company's rapid growth came through acquisitions, including the Frontier Corporation.
Rochester Telephone remade itself in 1995 when its president, Ronald Bittner, created a corporate parent named Frontier, which tried to become a player in long-distance, fiber optics and cellular services.
Employees of the telephone company wound up pushed into shares of Frontier and then of Global Crossing.
The union, Local 1170 of the Communications Workers of America, which represents telephone workers in Rochester, had a traditional pension plan, under which retirees received a guaranteed monthly payment. But in 1996, that plan was frozen, and all workers were told that subsequently they would begin receiving Frontier stock instead for their retirement. Many workers also bought additional shares from the company.
"The company told us we were all going to be millionaires," said John Pusloskie, the union vice president, who said his stock is now worth less than $100.
When Global Crossing bought Frontier in 1998, the union argued that the workers should be able to diversify the company's contribution out of stocks, saying that a company financed mostly with junk bonds was too speculative for retirement savings.
Randal Simonetti, who as Frontier's spokesman defended the retirement change in 1996, said the value of his retirement and stock option plans had fallen by about $1 million from their peak.
He did not sell when the stock began to slide, he said, because "you like to remain committed to the firm."
"It is a psychological investment," Mr. Simonetti added, "because when you own a significant number of shares, you want to work hard and make the company prosper so you will prosper."
Richard T. Hogan, 62, a lineman who plans to retire soon, saved for retirement mostly through the the Rochester Telephone 401(k) and stock purchase plans. He said he had $480,000 at one point, but most of it is gone.
"I am still going to retire in three months," he said, though his plans of buying an recreational vehicle and traveling have vanished. "The pension I have, nobody can touch that. It is guaranteed, and no matter what happens I will still get that amount, while you are always at risk with any 401(k) plan when you invest in stock or mutual funds. The pension is much better."
On July 2, Global Crossing sold the local telephone companies in Rochester and dozens of other communities to the Citizens Communications Company. The workers were finally given a chance to sell their Global Crossing shares. But with the stock approaching $9 a share, the union said, few people did. Citizens declined to say how many workers had diversified.
Clover Capital, an investment management firm in suburban Rochester, bought $100 million of Frontier stock and got out for a quick $80 million profit early on, said Mathew P. Kaufler, its chief strategist. But it started buying Global Crossing again a year ago. By August, it had $17 million worth.
"We totally miscalibrated the extent to which the industry and, in particular, the fiber optic market was deteriorating," he said.
Mr. Kaufler said his wife inherited some Rochester Telephone shares and held them all the way down. "This is a community in which an enormous number of people bought Xerox, Kodak, Bausch & Lomb and Rochester Tel and out of inertia were loath to sell them," he said. "Now pain is very deep and very widespread in Rochester."

Help Wanted becomes a battlefield for the Internet and newspapers.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
THE Internet has failed to live up to its billing as a transforming technology for every industry. But it has managed to stir things up in the job-recruitment category.
 Through the years, newspapers have made considerable money through classified employment advertisements -- each a few lines of small type listing job openings. 
 Online job sites give employers what many analysts consider a more cost-effective way to fill empty positions. While advertisers pay in the range of $250 for a few lines of text in a Sunday newspaper's help-wanted section, "for about the same amount, they can get an ad on Monster for two months, in front of a national audience, with a whole bunch of other features, like employer information, job assessment tests," said Charlene Li, an analyst with Forrester Research, a consulting firm. "The value proposition online blows newspapers away." 
Initially, many newspapers were reluctant to make a big push into online job listings for fear that the technology costs and the lower online pricing plans would undermine their print businesses. More recently, though, newspapers have been pushing into online extensions of their print classified ads -- as The New York Times does with The New York Times on the Web. 
Lately, the rivalry between online sites and the most active newspapers in this field has intensified. As the economic doldrums reduce the number of available jobs, the main World Wide Web recruitment operation backed by a newspaper -- CareerBuilder -- and the leading Internet competitor, Monster.com, are stepping up efforts to hold onto online market share, while hoping to increase revenue from the few job categories that are expanding.
"This'll be like the battle between Pepsi and Coke -- fighting it out for that two points in market share," said Robert McGovern, chief executive of CareerBuilder, an online recruitment site owned jointly by the Tribune Company, publisher of The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune, and Knight Ridder, whose big papers include The San Jose Mercury News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. 
The prospect of such a contest is exciting, Mr. McGovern said, "especially since there are very few online markets where you have two profitable players generating $1 billion in revenue."
Analysts said these companies were not quite at that level yet, but they did say the two sites could reach $1 billion in annual revenues in 2002. That figure is still a small part of the roughly $8 billion spent on all types of job recruitment advertising annually, but the online market share is growing quickly -- particularly that of Monster.com.
Ms. Li said Monster had about 42 percent of the $1.2 billion online job ad market, compared with 11 percent for CareerBuilder. (Both figures include the market share of the companies that Monster and CareerBuilder are acquiring.)
Unlike just about every other online media company, Monster's revenues have continued to grow despite the economic slowdown. The site's owner, TMP Worldwide, said this month that its Internet division, which consists mainly of Monster, would fall $60 million short of its previous third-quarter revenue estimate of $715 million to $735 million, and that Monster would cut its American work force about 10 percent, to 1,200 people. The company has an additional 1,000 or so employees overseas. 
Despite such bleak news, TMP said Internet revenue would still be 44 percent higher than in the third quarter of 2000.
Monster started on an acquisition run last year, culminating with the June announcement that it would acquire its chief online rival, Hotjobs.com, for about $460 million in stock. CareerBuilder has been in acquisition mode as well, most notably with its pending $200 million purchase of HeadHunter.net. 
As aggressive as CareerBuilder has been, it will have to work harder still to catch up with Monster. The combined HeadHunter .net and CareerBuilder revenues will amount to about $125 million this year, Ms. Li said. She estimated that the combined 2001 revenues of Monster and Hotjobs would be about $500 million. "Monster is just a huge money machine," she said. 
Jeff Taylor, Monster's chief executive, said the company had operated in the black for four years, with profit margins of more than 25 percent. Such performance would be impressive for any Internet company, but given that Monster has spent more than $175 million a year on Super Bowl ads and other expensive media campaigns, the company's success is even more notable.
Unlike those of other Internet companies, whose Super Bowl ads were tantamount to highly entertaining corporate farewells, Monster's ads demonstrated the value of a niche online company's spending heavily to build its brand. 
Such an approach worked largely because Monster has fairly low operating costs. The site's content -- job listings and resumes -- is created by employers and roughly 13 million prospective employees around the world, not teams of editors, writers and photographers. And although job applicants pay nothing for using the site, employers pay $300 or more a month, depending on how many listings they post.
CareerBuilder follows a similar approach. But instead of posting the classifieds on just one site, it essentially syndicates the listings to more than 40 newspaper sites, including a handful of those not owned by Knight Ridder or the Tribune Company, like The Providence Journal and The Dallas Morning News. It also permits each site to modify its format to reflect the local job mix. 
Mr. McGovern, CareerBuilder's chief, said the company had been forced to keep pace with Monster's marketing budget, "since they had the first seat at the poker table, and they set the ante at $100 million."
But, he said, CareerBuilder's marketing approach is fundamentally different, much more focused on specific industries and regions. "Instead of running an ad on 'Ally McBeal,' " he said, the company will promote jobs through the Bloomberg financial information system and on the Bloomberg Web site. "So when our customers want financial industry people, we've got the best way to find them." 
The notion of challenging Monster with a local approach is one often heard among newspaper executives and other vendors in the online job recruitment category. Late last month, in fact, CareerBuilder began forging closer links with its newspaper partners: within the print newspapers, Knight Ridder and the Tribune Company are changing the names of their Sunday help-wanted sections to CareerBuilder.
"We do have the advantage of having the trusted brand," Mr. McGovern said. "That means something to consumers and employers." 
For some analysts, the assertion that newspaper employment sites are somehow more local than Monster is not easy to swallow. Noting that Monster divides jobs into about 400 local markets, Ms. Li, of Forrester, said, "You can go to Monster and search the Central California Valley, and that's the same as searching on the Fresno paper's site."
The good news for newspapers, Ms. Li said, is that job candidates look at an average of three media outlets when looking for work, while employers advertise in three to five publications or sites. "So the newspaper sites may not be the first buy, but they'll be right there next to Monster." 
Such a prospect gives at least some hope to newspaper publishers, which have been pummeled by declining ad revenues in general over the past two years. Ms. Li estimates that newspapers will generate about $53 billion in advertising of all types this year, down from $56 billion in 2000. Lanny Baker, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said newspapers' revenue from job recruitment ads would drop about 25 percent from last year. Job ads typically represent 15 percent of a newspaper's overall revenue, Mr. Baker said.
One big question, of course, is how much of that drop is caused by competition from the online-only companies, and how much represents lost revenue that will return once employers resume hiring. Mr. Baker, for one, pegs the newspaper decline to online competition: "People are taking money out of papers more than the Internet. And those who are still hiring are adding the Internet to their mix."
Roger S. Kintzel, publisher of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, is not so sure the Internet is stealing as many sales as Mr. Baker suggests. Mr. Kintzel, who said his paper's employment ads dropped about 20 percent last year and an additional 30 percent so far this year, said he thought the drop was primarily caused by the weak economy. 
Still, Mr. Kintzel hedged his bets earlier this month by licensing software from Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive, which is meant to permit The Journal-Constitution to expand its online job listings with a more sophisticated system, starting in December. "We know the market's going down," he said. "But when it turns, we want to be ready to compete with Monster."

HEADLINE: Threat of Terrorism Leaves Trade Summit Plans in Doubt 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
Less than a month before thousands of government officials and private experts were scheduled to gather for the first global trade summit meeting in two years, a Bush administration official said today that the threat of terrorism had left arrangements for the meetings in doubt.
 Trade officials meeting in Singapore over the weekend said they were concerned that they could not safely gather in Qatar, the Persian Gulf state that had been preparing for the meeting for more than a year. Officials were expected to decide in several days whether to hold a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Doha, Qatar's capital. 
 The officials said that they were considering alternatives and that Singapore had volunteered to serve as a last-minute site for the negotiations. Some trade officials have also suggested holding the sessions at the W.T.O. headquarters in Geneva. 
Bush administration officials said today that if the meeting was moved, logistics and security concerns could force officials to shorten them and reduce the size of the delegations, given the work necessary to find a new location and reserve thousands of hotel rooms on short notice. 
The meetings are scheduled for Nov. 9 to 13.
While officials were questioning the site of the meeting, American and European officials in Singapore said that they had reached some agreement on how to harmonize trade rules and ease the flow of goods across borders. They said they had a better chance of settling on a framework for such action than they did in Seattle in 1999, when talks collapsed.
Officials in Qatar and at the W.T.O. continue to maintain that the meetings will take place as planned. Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the emir of Qatar and the host of the session, will probably be given the opportunity to announce any decision to choose another site.
The issue is a sensitive one because the United States military uses bases in Qatar, an ally in the war against Iraq and the latest conflict in Afghanistan.
Qatar, moreover, had pledged months ago to provide tight security for the meetings because antiglobalization protest groups had threatened to disrupt the talks as they did those in Seattle.
But Bush administration officials have begun quietly to lay the groundwork for a change. Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative who attended the discussions in Singapore, said trade officials had little choice but to consider their safety.
"As President Bush has said, it's a different world," Mr. Zoellick told reporters today. "We have to take every threat seriously." He stressed that the meetings would still take place within the original time frame even if they are moved.
Uncertainty about the meetings is a blow to the Bush administration, which had sought to use the talks as a way of signaling that a sensitive international meeting could go on as scheduled despite the disruptions caused by the attacks on Sept. 11. 
Mr. Zoellick had also argued that the trade discussions themselves, which will focus in part on satisfying the trade demands of poor nations, are needed to solidify the coalition against terrorism.
Some developing countries have expressed skepticism that wealthy countries are any more willing to address their concerns this year than they were two years ago. Poor nations have argued that American and European restrictions on importing textiles and farm goods, as well as American use of antidumping rules to protect manufacturing industries from foreign goods priced below the cost of production, greatly reduces the exports of poor countries.
But trade officials said over the weekend that doubts about the talks did not extend to the substance of trade negotiations themselves.
They said they had made progress in narrowing differences on a range of trade disputes, making it more likely that they could settle on a framework for global talks when the meeting is held. They provided few details on their talks. But officials said they had been working from a draft text that served as the basis for negotiations, rather than with rival drafts as they had in Seattle.
"There's a huge difference," Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner, told reporters today. "It's night and day." Mr. Zoellick agreed, saying, "I think we're better positioned."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Nature of Foe Is Obstacle In Appealing For Sacrifice

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
Toward the end of his news conference last week, President Bush turned to the hard topics of war and sacrifice.
 Having commented earlier, as he has done so often since Sept. 11, that "the American people have got to go about their business" and live normal lives, Mr. Bush said that Americans were sacrificing when they waited in long lines at airports and at ballparks. And he spoke of the profound sacrifice of the friends and families of those who perished in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon -- those, as he remarked in a moment of rare lyricism, who have lost "a piece of their soul." 
 Presidents and other leaders have for centuries turned to the language of sacrifice to ennoble the harsh experience of war and bestir their countrymen. Lincoln celebrated it at Gettysburg. Churchill told his beleaguered people in 1940 that more "blood, toil, tears and sweat" lay ahead. In June 1944, in a D-Day prayer, Franklin D. Roosevelt called for rededication to God in "this hour of great sacrifice."
In the cold war, John F. Kennedy said the nation would make any sacrifice -- "pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty."
As President Bush suggested, the loss of blood and treasure in New York has shocked Americans into a passionate sense of commitment that is both more widespread and less superficial than most recent fevers of patriotism. The new sense of national peril, the erosion of the sense of security the United States has relied on for 200 years, has begotten a new national unity.
There is no doubt what the mission is: making the world safe from terrorism. This contrasts sharply with the situation in 1990, when Mr. Bush's father had difficulty explaining precisely why it was necessary to defend Kuwait, whether because of its oil or the strategic importance of the Persian Gulf or the evil of aggression. It is far, far easier to call for sacrifice when the goal is clearly defined and self-evidently worthwhile.
Yet looking forward, Mr. Bush faces a dilemma that none of his precursors encountered. He is hemmed in by the very nature of the foe he has vowed to defeat -- not a nation or an ideology but bands of terrorists, whose goal is to sow enough terror to produce paralysis. So the president appeals for normality, which implies giving up little or nothing, and that consorts incongruously with sacrifice, which involves giving up a lot, sometimes life itself.
Shop more, consume more, the nation is told. No sacrifice there, especially at fire-sale prices. Taxes are to be cut to stimulate the economy, not raised to pay for war. Hard to see sacrifice there. Waiting in line and undergoing baggage searches are inconveniences, not sacrifices.
Watching the news conference, one could not help wondering why Mr. Bush chose not to invoke, as examples that others might be called upon to emulate, the heroic firefighters who went to their death in New York in an effort to rescue others, or the burly men who tried to subdue the hijackers of a second plane bound for Washington, causing it to crash in Pennsylvania.
The president has at no time attempted to minimize the gravity of the current crisis. Indeed, in a videotaped speech today to a physicians' group, Mr. Bush called this "one of the darkest moments in our history."
In his news conference, he put forward a plan for American children to contribute dollars earned by washing cars or raking yards to the wretched, malnourished children of Afghanistan. The idea had the virtue of not only motivating the children and especially their parents but also underlining his contention that the Afghan regime, not the people, is the enemy.
But he has found no way yet to involve the American people as a whole in the campaign -- that vast majority who were not touched by the Sept. 11 attacks or the various anthrax scares, who do not serve in the military. The danger, over the long term, is loss of interest. With much of the war to be conducted out of plain sight by commandos, diplomats and intelligence agents, will a nation that has spent decades in easy self-indulgence stay focused?
The experience of Vietnam is instructive. Lyndon B. Johnson, sensing the minimal support for the war in Vietnam, hesitated to appeal for sacrifice. He restricted tours of duty for the military, and he promised the American people that they could have both guns and butter. In the midst of "prosperity that has been unequaled in this nation," he said defiantly in 1965, "I see no reason for declaring a national emergency, and I rejected that course of action."
There was no dearth of heroes in Vietnam. But few who survived were lauded at home, like Alvin York in World War I and Audie Murphy in World War II, and we remember few if any of the names of those who made what patriotic orators have always called the supreme sacrifice. People paid no attention.
Heroes matter. The medals awarded to them honor their sacrifices and spread their renown, which in "popular" wars fire others to emulate their feats, on the battlefield or the home front. Heroes in the war against terrorism could provide powerful symbols for Mr. Bush in keeping the nation with him.
What will happen on the battlefields of the next months and years is unclear, of course. This is no conventional war. But two things seem evident: there have already been civilian casualties, and there will be more; and there will be American military casualties as well, unlike the war in Kosovo in 1999.
There, while inflicting widespread casualties not only on enemy troops but also on innocent civilians, the United States and its NATO allies set out as a matter of policy to hold themselves harm-free. To that end, they eschewed the use of ground troops, of low-flying planes that might have been shot down, even of air drops of food and medicines to refugees in some circumstances.
To many, that kind of antiseptic, push-button warfare seemed ignoble, no matter how fine the cause may have been, precisely because it removed the element of potential self-sacrifice from the cruel equation of combat.

HEADLINE: The Future of Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Now that President Bush has committed himself to building a stable Afghanistan after military actions there end, the United States must come up with a workable plan. Mr. Bush and his aides began discussing options last week. Stabilizing Afghanistan will not be easy, given the divisions there and the lack of an international consensus about future governance of the country. Success is more likely if three basic principles are respected. No government should be imposed from outside. All the country's major ethnic, language and religious groups must be fairly represented. Political and economic reconstruction efforts will require sustained international support. 
 Afghanistan's recent history underscores the difficulties. Moscow's efforts to impose a Communist government in the decade after its 1979 invasion failed disastrously. America's error was to leave the war-torn country to its own resources after Soviet troops withdrew in 1989. The guerrillas who had defeated Moscow with American assistance quickly began fighting one another, letting the country slide into anarchy and opening the way for the Taliban. 
 The Taliban government is narrowly rooted in the Pashtun ethnic group. Though this is the country's largest single group, less than half the overall population is Pashtun. In northern areas, where Persian-speakers and other non-Pashtun elements predominate, civil war has continued. The anti-Taliban Northern Alliance is also too narrow to rule the country, and America has had to calibrate its air strikes to slow the alliance's advance toward Kabul until a broader national coalition can be established.
Washington and Moscow appear to have learned from their past mistakes and are now supporting United Nations attempts to bring a broad range of Afghan factions together. The U.N.'s special representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, has good relations with most of the country's main groups. In the past, his efforts have not been supported by Pakistan, which felt more secure with the Taliban monopolizing power. But Pakistan has now distanced itself from the Taliban leadership. 
If Mr. Brahimi succeeds in creating political unity, the next step will be recruiting an effective administration to manage day-to-day challenges like replenishing food supplies, rebuilding the educational system and reviving the economy. To prevent the return of internal conflict, an international military force of some kind, under U.N. auspices, will be needed. Ideally, it should be drawn from Muslim countries not bordering on Afghanistan, like Turkey, Morocco and Bangladesh. Washington should be willing to help finance this international effort. The $320 million in direct American aid to the Afghan people Mr. Bush announced last week is a good start. 
Constructing a new government in Afghanistan must await the collapse of the Taliban regime, but Mr. Bush and his aides are right to start planning.

HEADLINE: Heavier Economic Clouds Are Gathering Over Japan 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
In its latest monthly economic report, the Bank of Japan has thrown aside the customary carefully shaded jargon and declared in blunt language that Japan's economy is in bad shape and becoming worse.
 Exports have been undercut in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror attacks in the United States, and companies at home have shed jobs and trimmed wages, the bank reported. 
 In downgrading its outlook for the economy for the fifth consecutive month, the bank said that production continued "to decline considerably," hurting employment and consumer confidence, and that corporate profits were being eroded by the fall in exports. 
"There exists a risk that the prolonged downturn in U.S. private consumption affected by the terrorist attacks would induce another round of adjustments in the Japanese economy, starting from the decline in exports such as consumer goods," the bank said.
Exports are crucial because the strongest companies in Japan's otherwise moribund economy rely heavily on sales in North America and Europe. Major exporting companies from Sony to Matsushita Electric Industrial to NEC have lowered their earnings forecasts since Sept. 11. 
Travel and tourism, another important engine driving the Japanese economy, are also ailing. Japan Airlines, which now expects to lose money this year, has scrapped about one-quarter of its trans-Pacific flights.
"There are no forces of growth in Japan," said John Richards, a strategist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo. "What would make a difference is a recovery in the U.S., but I don't see that happening soon."
Mr. Richards said he expected a pickup in America in autumn 2002 and an upturn in Japan about three months later.
The bank said the economy's fragile state was making financial institutions cautious about lending to smaller companies, creating a credit squeeze that showed up in the latest figures on bankruptcies, which were released separately today. Corporate failures rose 4.4 percent in September from a year earlier, with some three-quarters of the bankruptcies attributable to the current economic slowdown, according to the Teikoku Databank, the private research institute that publishes figures on corporate failures.
Analysts expect bankruptcies to continue rising into next year as the recession deepens. But with short-term interest rates already effectively at zero, there is little the central bank can do with monetary policy to promote growth. Politicians are calling on the bank to buy more long-term government bonds and to set a goal of a minimal amount of inflation, rather than the falling prices seen now.
For his part, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has abandoned his promise to limit new issues of bonds to 30 trillion yen ($248 billion) in the fiscal year starting April 1, 2002. The reversal opens the way for more stimulus spending by the central government.

HEADLINE: Young Japanese Breaking Old Salaryman's Bonds 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 13 

 BODY:
Toward the end of the week, when Keisuke Sauri gets bored driving a kerosene delivery truck, he does something very un-Japanese. He skips work and follows his inner passion for antiquing.
 "The advantage of being a 'freeter' is that if you missed the shift, the responsibility falls on the person who hired you," said Mr. Sauri, 22 and looking sharp in a red blazer and bristle-brush haircut. He got the delivery job, he said, only because his new girlfriend, a nurse, pushed him. "In reality, I usually get sick of working pretty fast and skip a couple of days a week," he said. 
 "Freeter" -- a hip hybrid word composed of the English "free" and the German "arbeiter," or worker -- is this generation's answer to the driven Japanese "salaryman" of the past. Rejecting the 70-hour workweeks that were the emblem of their parents' generation, and unwilling to offer big companies the selfless loyalty of their fathers, 20-something Japanese are creating a new way of life. They work when they like, job-hop in short-term jobs and indulge themselves with foreign travel, hobbies or other passions.
The coming Japanese stereotype may not be the white-collar workaholic but the 20-something Tokyo video store clerk snoozing in a hammock in Bali.
Among young Japanese, the freeter phenomenon is expanding, stoked by a many things:family affluence, a lack of corporate jobs, attachment to family and home, and a generational revolt.
Many of these young workers continue to live at home, usually with the encouragement of their parents. Relieved of the need to pay rent, buy groceries or even to do their own laundry, they have money to spend on themselves.
"It's easy to get a new job," says Eriko Sauri, Mr. Sauri's younger sister. A longtime job-hopper at 19, she takes temporary jobs directing traffic at construction sites, then blows most of her money on clothes and trips. "My boyfriend and I spent a month in Hawaii," she said. "Now we are saving up for Indonesia."
Like many of the estimated 2 million to 3 million freeters, the Sauris live with their parents. As dreams of lifetime employment have disappeared into Japan's endless recession, the average age of workers at Japanese corporations has steadily increased for more than 20 years. The trend reflects hiring freezes that turn away young workers.
Partly as a result, the unemployment rate for male job seekers aged 15 to 24 more than doubled during the 1990's and hit 11 percent in August. Overall, Japan's unemployment rate is 5 percent. Although low-wage, no-future jobs abound, many young people pass them up, holding out for the kind of corporate career jobs that their fathers got in return for a liberal arts degree. 
With a wealth and poverty divide deepening along generational lines, many young Japanese follow the path of least resistance, gluing themselves to their parents, the generation that accumulated houses and savings during the boom years of the 1970's and 1980's. Surveys indicate that roughly two-thirds of freeters live at home, depending on mom for meals and clean laundry and dad for a bedroom. 
"A big gap in assets is forming between the generations," said Yuka Masuda, an editor of Spa! a weekly magazine catering to this growing legion of young temporary workers. "Also, in the U.S. parents tell their kids, 'You have to become independent.' Japanese parents tend to say, 'Stay in the house as long as you like.' "
Asked why her fat, glossy magazine runs ads for cars, CD players and hot springs resorts, she responded: "In general, freeters are not poor. They have a considerable amount of money because they do not have to pay rent."
The average freeter lives at home, earns about $1,000 a month, and stays in a job about nine months, according to surveys conducted by the Recruit Corporation, Japan's largest job placement company. Recruit estimates that 3.4 million Japanese, aged 19 to 30, are freeters, working part time or at temporary jobs. Ms. Masuda estimates that one quarter are college graduates.
Some experts predict doom for a society that does not provide enough career opportunities for young people.
Freeters "who have no children, no dreams, hope or job skills, could become a major burden on society, as they contribute to the decline in the birthrate and in social insurance contributions," Masahiro Yamada, a sociology professor here, wrote in a magazine essay titled, "Parasite Singles Feed on Family System."
Many young Japanese, pained by memories of their fathers' long office hours, are hardly troubled by statistics showing that the average Japanese now works slightly less than the average American.
"I had no desire to become a salaryman after my graduation," said Akira Yamauchi, who makes a living selling English tea through the Internet. After graduating from college in 1993, he wandered from South Korea to Mexico, from Ireland to Bali. 
Koichi Kaminaga, a graduate of Tokyo's prestigious Waseda University, gets by on savings from odd jobs, devoting much of his energies to a group he named, with a touch of irony, the Dame-Ren, or No Good People's Association.
"The white collar freeters, the members of the Dame-Ren have the nuance of strongly resembling the old-time hippies -- they are dropping out of modern capitalist society," he said of his coffee club group, largely composed of university graduates. "They felt suffocated by the schools and the experience in society. They did not want to live like that, and they dropped out."
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare estimates that 70 percent of junior high school graduates, 50 percent of high school graduates and 30 percent of college graduates now quit their jobs within three years of leaving school. Many young people mistrust big corporations after seeing their fathers or uncles eased out of "lifetime" jobs.
"Japanese were too loyal to companies, and young people see what happened: the loyalty was wasted," said Ms. Masuda, the magazine editor. "They think: 'Look at Americans. They job hop. They seem to be free. That's the way we want to live.' "

HEADLINE: Operating Profit Rises 23% at Fannie Mae 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
Fannie Mae, the leading buyer of mortgages in the country, said today that its third-quarter operating earnings rose 23 percent as homeowners refinanced loans at a record pace. 
 Profit from operations rose to $1.38 billion, or $1.33 a share, a penny above analysts' expectations and up from $1.12 billion, or $1.09 a share, in the period a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 31 percent, to $2.59 billion. 
 In the latest quarter, a $122 million after-tax loss on buying back debt early resulted in net income, which includes changes in the market value of its derivatives' holdings, of $1.23 billion, or $1.19 a share.
Fannie Mae is benefiting from the lowest mortgage rates in three years after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates nine times this year to bolster an economy growing at its slowest pace in eight years. 
The company's shares rose $1.52, or 2 percent, to $78.95, the biggest percentage gain in three weeks. The shares are down 9 percent this year, after rising 38 percent in 2000. 
The company's net mortgage portfolio grew $24 billion, to $686 billion, in the quarter, up from $571 billion in the third quarter last year. Fannie Mae said its purchases of $16 billion last month would have been higher if not for the Sept. 11 attacks, which largely shut down the mortgage market in the following days.
Fannie Mae is also benefiting from a widening spread between short-term and long-term interest rates. The company's net interest margin -- or the difference between what it makes from its investments and its borrowing costs -- was 110 basis points in the third quarter, compared with 100 basis points a year earlier.
Net interest income rose to $2.1 billion from $1.4 billion.

HEADLINE: Brill's Content Closes; Web Site, Inside.com, Is Cut Back 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
A few years back, Steven Brill had a brainstorm: the public, he thought, was fascinated with news about highly visible media organizations, and this appetite could be converted into a business that would thrive as it revealed the mysteries and missteps of those organizations.
 Yesterday, after sputtering for years, the vision died. Brill's Content magazine suspended publication, ending a three-year run of dissecting the personalities, obsessions and machinations of news organizations. At the same time, Inside.com, a Web site created by Powerful Media Inc. and later sold to Mr. Brill's company, has been trimmed back, essentially becoming an online gateway to a group of media trade magazines. 
 The decision was announced by Mr. Brill, who had failed, after weeks of negotiation, to reconcile his agenda -- supporting his struggling publication -- with the needs of Primedia, his publicly held partner, to appease dissatisfied shareholders by cutting costs.
Primedia, the magazine publisher headed by Tom Rogers, took a 49 percent stake in Brill Media Ventures in January. They have now decided to dissolve the partnership.
While Brill's Content shuts its doors, Inside.com, the Web site whose aggressive and sassy coverage of the media industry quickly earned it prominence when it started in the spring of 2000, will lose its dedicated reporting staff and will be remade into a portal for the articles of its owner, Primedia.
Brill Media Ventures had acquired Inside.com from Powerful Media Inc. in April.
Like Mademoiselle and The Industry Standard, Brill's Content is disappearing amid the brutal business climate of 2001.
Unlike this year's other magazine casualties, however, Brill's Content, as it went through three editors, retained the unique stamp of its founder's personality. It was the ink-on-paper representation of Mr. Brill's audacious desire to win influence and profits by playing Savonarola to powerful institutions. This time, the formula that Mr. Brill rode to success two decades ago when he founded The American Lawyer did not work.
Even after gaining intense publicity for the premiere edition with his dissection of the Lewinsky scandal and Washington reporters' dependence on the special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, he was never able to translate the magazine's prominence into a readership even close to its original goal of as many as 600,000. Its most recent circulation, as reported to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, was 325,000.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Brill declined to blame the sour advertising climate or the economic aftershocks of the terrorist attacks for the demise of his magazine.
He said: "The current economic climate, let alone Sept. 11, is no excuse for us. If we had built a vibrant, independent, successful magazine, which is what I told the world I was going to do, we would have survived the economic climate we were in."
Thirty-eight employees will be laid off as a result of the dissolution of the partnership of Primedia and Brill Media Ventures, including David Kuhn, the editor of Brill's Content for the last 18 months and, for the last three months, the editor of Inside.com.
Mr. Brill said yesterday that he had come to the decision over the weekend after months of discussion with Mr. Rogers. He gave no details. "I just decided that I don't want to go deep into those issues -- Tom was my friend, is my friend -- he has his perspective and I have mine." Mr. Rogers turned away interview requests yesterday.
All employees have been assured four weeks of severance pay.
Stock in Primedia, which publishes such magazines as New York, Seventeen and Media Central trade properties like American Demographics and Telephony, closed at $1.98 yesterday, down 3 cents, and just 28 cents above its 52-week low of $1.70.
A year ago it was trading at more than $16. In January, when it took its share in Brill Media Ventures -- and Brill took an undisclosed share of Primedia -- Primedia's stock price was $12.94.
Yesterday's announcement came less than three weeks after Mr. Brill shut down another venture, Contentville, a Web site created early in 2000 in partnership with Primedia, NBC and CBS, among others. 
Asked at the time about the propriety of being in business with organizations covered by his magazine, Mr. Brill said that written agreements between the partners set up firewalls that preserved the independence of the magazine's journalists. 
The Contentville partnership, like the backing Mr. Brill originally obtained for Brill Media Ventures from the entrepreneur Barry Diller and the investor George Soros, was a testament to his ability to persuade wealthy friends that his ideas would flourish. Asked about the extent of the financial losses of Brill Media Ventures, Mr. Brill said only: "It's safe to say we all lost money. Our net worth was not greatly diminished."
The partnership with media figures like Mr. Diller, who were the subject of the magazine's coverage, illustrated the tightrope Mr. Brill chose to walk as both a media critic and a media baron. His magazine began with aggressive coverage of news organizations' performance in its coverage of the scandals around President Bill Clinton.
The magazine also tackled questions as disparate as war coverage and plagiarism, sometimes with mixed results. Mr. Brill's own writing for the magazine veered from scolding to prognostication. In the February 1999 issue his cover article carried the headline, "What A Deal! Why CBS News and CNN Should Merge."
About 18 months after the magazine's beginning, when it had already undergone one face lift, Mr. Brill brought Mr. Kuhn in as editor, with a mandate to lift the publication beyond its focus on media organizations' problems and mistakes and giving it a more general appeal with personality features. Shortly thereafter, it changed its publication schedule from a monthly to 10 times a year. and cut its size. Earlier this year, it downsized again, and decided to publish quarterly.
Mr. Brill's announcement to the staff yesterday was unemotional, according to two reporters present, both of whom had been trying to finish articles to meet this week's deadlines for an issue that will never be published.
Jesse Oxfeld, a senior associate editor, said: "It was totally expected. The last two weeks have been ridiculous -- this constant 'what do you know, what do you know.' It's nice to have closure."

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex. Oct. 15 

 BODY:
Temple-Inland, a paper and lumber company, said today that its third-quarter profit rose 2.3 percent after it sold timberland in Georgia.

Revenue fell 2.7 percent, to $1.06 billion. 
 Excluding a gain of $9 million from the timberland sale, profit would have been $35 million, or 72 cents a share. Temple-Inland, which is based in Austin, said prices for building materials fell, including a 10 percent drop in lumber, 29 percent in gypsum and 14 percent in particle board. Profit in its paper group fell 46 percent and box shipments dropped 3 percent.

HEADLINE: Boise Cascade's Earnings Slide in Quarter 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
The forest products company Boise Cascade Corporation said today that its third-quarter earnings had fallen sharply, hurt by declines in paper operations and its office products distribution business.
 Boise Cascade, which makes both paper and wood products, said earnings were hurt by the sluggish economy and a recent decline in demand for housing. 
The company said it remained cautious about its prospects for the fourth quarter and early 2002. 
 Including a one-time gain from a change in tax rates, net earnings in the latest quarter were $15 million, or 20 cents a share. Year-earlier net earnings, including a gain from the sale of its European office distribution operations, were $84.6 million, or $1.33 per share.
Excluding unusual items, earnings fell to $12.2 million, or 16 cents a diluted share, from $27.4 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by the market research firm Thomson Financial/ First Call had expected earnings of 16 cents a share. 
Total sales in the third quarter were $1.9 billion, compared with the $2.0 billion a year earlier. 
Building products income increased, but were offset by a modest decline from the paper and office products distribution businesses, and high energy costs, the chairman, George Harad, said.

HEADLINE: Bush Details Plan to Help Insurers on Future Terror Claims 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON with JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
The Bush administration today proposed to pay the vast majority of losses of the insurance industry from any terrorist attacks next year and to cap the industry's liability at $12 billion. 
 Under the administration's plan, the government would pay 80 percent of the first $20 billion of claims next year and 90 percent of the next $80 billion. If claims exceed $100 billion, Congress would determine how they would be paid. 
 The proposal would also limit the industry's liability from terrorist claims to $23 billion in 2003; insurers would pay all of the losses on the first $10 billion. In 2004, the industry's liability would be limited to $36 billion; insurers would pay all of the losses on the first $20 billion in claims. 
Such a proposal, if approved by Congress, would give a huge guarantee against losses to an industry that has about $300 billion in available capital for all property and casualty claims.
Administration officials said they had selected the insurers from a host of other industries pleading for federal assistance because the industry has said it will no longer cover damages from terrorist attacks. Officials fear that since 70 percent of insurance contracts expire at the end of the year and banks and other lending institutions demand insurance coverage to make loans, the government needs to intervene to forestall a cascading financial crisis at a particularly vulnerable time in the economic cycle.
In recent weeks, banks, real estate companies and manufacturers have urged the White House and senior lawmakers to quickly approve a package to stabilize the insurance markets and calm growing fears that credit will shrivel up.
"Without coverage against terrorist acts, banks will not lend to new construction, it will be difficult to sell major projects such as new pipelines, new power plants, skyscrapers," an administration official said. "There is a problem that needs to be addressed."
But the three-year package offered today by the administration was immediately criticized by some officials in Congress, who said it was too generous, and by industry executives, who said it was not generous enough, particularly in its second and third years. 
Republican and Democratic aides in the House and Senate said it would be a hard sell politically because it required taxpayer-financed assistance on the first dollar of losses to an industry that is financially healthy. They expected it could lead to intense negotiations in Congress between the industry -- which is fighting for all it can get -- and lawmakers who want to fix an emerging problem at the least cost to taxpayers and are leery of a bailout.
"We want this to be a backstop, not a bailout," said a Republican official in the House.
A Democratic aide to a central player in the Senate echoed those sentiments.
"If another senator came to my boss and said, 'How could you justify immediate assistance on the first dollar of losses to an industry that is in good shape right now,' I don't know how he could answer," the aide said.
Some members of Congress said the administration's formula would not be adequate to meet the White House's goal of encouraging lending, as its three-year time frame is too brief by corporate planning standards.
"If you're planning to build a major power plant, a major amusement park, and major skyscraper, you won't be done in three years if you start today," said Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York. "The problem with this proposal is that it's the opposite of putting your toe in the water. It's jumping in and then walking out."
Other officials said that to the extent Congress decides to use the administration's framework, there will have to be major changes in the formulas to require the insurance industry to bear the initial costs and have the government step in only if insurers suffer large new losses.
The administration's proposal rejects a plan by some Senate Democrats to create a government-backed reinsurance company similar to the one begun in Britain after a bombing in the financial district of London by the Irish Republican Army. It also rejects proposals by Republicans to offer the industry tax incentives to develop its own new catastrophic reinsurance pool.
The proposal provides no money for last month's attacks, which according to official estimates will probably cost the industry $30 billion to $50 billion. President Bush has already signed a $40 billion measure that provides about $20 billion for aid and reconstruction to New York for costs not covered by insurance.
Administration officials said the proposal was intended to remedy the problem that the world's major reinsurance companies -- which insure the insurers -- have announced their intentions to exclude any coverage for future terrorist attacks, beginning in January. 
It would set up a single jurisdiction to handle claims and restrict punitive damages in a manner similar to the $15 billion airline bailout package recently signed into law.
Among insurance companies and their lobbyists, reaction to the plan was mixed.
Franklin W. Nutter, president of the Reinsurance Association of America, an industry trade group, applauded the administration for moving swiftly, but said its plan did not assist the industry enough after next year.
"The out years suggest funding levels that may be unrealistic," Mr. Nutter said. "The money has to come from consumers. Both they and the industry want coverage that is affordable." 
Maurice R. Greenberg, the chief executive of the American International Group, one of the world's largest insurers, said the White House plan was "all right," but it should be reconsidered after the first year.
"I could live with what they are proposing for the first year," Mr. Greenberg said. "At this point, to look out two or three years to determine what the program should be is trying to crystal-ball it. And I don't think that's possible. If obviously there are no terrorist attacks, then that all might be possible. I'm just looking at the first year right now. And I can't look much beyond that."
He said the industry cannot handle huge losses on its own. 
William R. Berkley, the chief executive of the W. R. Berkley Corporation, a small commercial insurance and reinsurance company in Greenwich, Conn., said the White House proposal would be "an excellent solution" provided it permitted insurers to set aside tax-free reserves to pay for the larger potential losses in the later years of the plan.
Mr. Berkley said that like other reinsurers, his company had stopped selling coverage for terrorist attacks after Sept. 11. "You're trying to figure out where your exposures are," he said, "and you don't have the answer."
He said he thought the White House's plan would make it possible for private reinsurers to once again begin providing terrorist coverage. 
"I would think so," he said. "Insurance is a business of details. But we could certainly live with that for now."

HEADLINE: High Cost of Being Well: Benefits at a Premium; 
Employees Will Pay A Sharp Increase For Insurance Plans

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Workers now signing up for health plans for next year are facing the largest rate increases in 10 years.
 Employees of many large companies are facing increases of roughly 15 percent, according to a survey early last month by Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm. The increases are much sharper at some small companies; for their employees, costs are actually doubling. 
 "I got my $600 tax rebate; now I'm going to spend it for my health insurance," said Laurie Goode, office manager at the Aerial Crane Company, a small business in Parsonsburg, Md. She will be paying $4,264 a year to cover her family, up $676, or 19 percent. 
For now, most large employers are absorbing as much of the increase as their employees are. So even though employees are paying a larger amount, they will not pay a larger share of their health insurance costs. But a year from now the situation will probably be different, employers and health benefits experts say. Companies that are contending with a weak economy will ask their employees to cover a larger share, even as those rates continue to rise.
"The rate of increases will continue to rise, and our ability to absorb those kinds of increases will not," said Kathy Reinhardt, benefits director at Analog Devices, a chip manufacturer with 4,700 employees based in Norwood, Mass. Analog absorbed 80 percent of its increases for 2002; the increases varied widely for its employees across the country, from single digits all the way to 34 percent. 
Besides the higher monthly premiums, many employees will also pay more of the cost of their prescription drugs. Some plans are also raising deductibles and co-payments for doctor visits and even adding co-payments for hospital stays.
Fifteen years ago, managed care companies promised to control costs for employers without sacrificing the quality of care by striking hard bargains with doctors and hospitals. But in recent years, they have been unable to keep those promises. Costs have been rising faster as the insurers have yielded to customer demands for more freedom to select doctors and hospitals. Also, hospitals, strengthened by mergers, are raising prices. Finally, the average age of the American population is increasing, and that means more medical bills.
Paul B. Ginsburg, president of Health System Change, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, said premiums were going up faster than the insurance companies' costs. He said the insurers were still playing catchup after four lean years from 1996 to 1999 when premiums did not cover costs.
At McGraw-Hill, the information and publishing company, employees will pay 20 percent more in monthly premiums next year. About half its 11,300 covered employees will pay higher co-payments for certain doctor visits, a spokesman said. Like many large companies, McGraw is also reducing the number of insurance plans it offers in the hope of increasing its bargaining power with insurers it continues to use.
But employees at small businesses are suffering more. Steve Youtsey and his wife, Elaine, the sole employees of New Mexico Surveying outside Albuquerque, are facing a doubling of their monthly premium, to $794 from $396, for insurance they buy through a coalition of small businesses. Part of the increase was based on their age -- in their early 50's. And Ms. Youtsey has medical problems that would not be covered if the couple transferred to another insurer, so they could not shop around for lower rates, Mr. Youtsey said. "We were just stuck."
In Pueblo County, Colo., where hospital charges have soared, insurance premiums are doubling for many state employees. David Scott Sandoval, a technician in the accounting department at the University of Southern Colorado, said his monthly premium would rise to $549 from $258 in December to cover him, his wife and two children.
"People are going to have to leave their jobs and go bankrupt," he said. "They are going to be putting people in the streets." 
Even such large increases do not reflect a probable increase in mental health costs related to the terrorist attacks. In future years, "there will be higher health care costs due to Sept. 11, especially in the Northeast," said Randall Abbott, a senior consultant at the Watson Wyatt Worldwide consulting firm. 
"It will show up in the claim costs of employers during the year and likely would be included in premiums for the coming year," he said. "For people who are depressed, medical costs are typically two to three times higher than for those who are not depressed." Overall health care costs in the Northeast may go up 1 to 1.5 percent as employee assistance counselors refer workers to doctors who then prescribe calming drugs, he added.
Even before the attacks, medical costs were increasing more rapidly than employers had expected. Some 200 large companies raised their 2002 forecasts of health care costs by "surprising numbers" last month, before Sept. 11, Mr. Abbott said. 
Not since 1991 have large companies faced premium increases exceeding 12.5 percent. Mr. Abbott said the increases for large employers would average 15 to 17 percent for H.M.O.'s, the most restrictive, lowest-cost plans; 9 to 12 percent for looser networks that let patients consult doctors without prior approval; and 12 to 15 percent for traditional fee-for-service plans. 
Kenneth L. Sperling, a health care analyst at Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm, said Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer, and HealthNet in California had further raised their rates last summer after bills from hospitals and doctors exceeded the insurance companies' predictions. 
Mr. Sperling said large employers were dealing with H.M.O. demands for increases of 19 percent, on average, by leaning on the H.M.O.'s to accept about 16 percent.
Smaller companies like Accent Food Services, a coffee and vending machine operator in Austin, Tex., frequently switch insurers to try to hold down costs. "Blue Cross got us" for an increase of more than $200 a month per family, said Martin Blank, a senior partner at Accent. "We went to UnitedHealthcare." Employees with families will pay $275 a month, still an increase of $100, or 57 percent, from this year.
Accent has also doubled the deductible that its 70 employees pay before the insurance takes effect, to $1,000 from $500. Mr. Blank, a senior partner at Accent, said the company would pick up most of the deductible for families with heavy medical expenses. 
Blaine Bos, a health care expert at the William M. Mercer consulting firm, said double-digit increases would probably last three more years, into 2005.
But Mr. Bos said employers could not shift costs to employees indefinitely without pushing people to drop their insurance. "When employees in small businesses have costs of $700 a month, anybody who doesn't expect to need health care will drop the program," he said, setting off a cycle in which costs increase still more for those who remain.

(Frank Curry for The New York Times) Graphs: "Paying More For Coverage"After a few years of stable or even declining costs, the amount employees pay for health insurance is rising again and is expected to go up even more sharply next year.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: TEHRAN; 
Iran Dances A 'Ballet' With U.S.

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO and NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
In an important sign of growing cooperation with the United States in its war against Afghanistan, Iran has sent a secret message to the Bush administration agreeing to rescue any American military personnel in distress in its territory, American and Iranian officials said today.
 The Iranian message was sent on Oct. 8, just hours after the United States launched its first military strikes against Afghan targets, the officials said. It was a response to a confidential message from the Bush administration the day before assuring Iran that the United States would respect its territorial integrity, including its airspace. 
 The messages, delivered through the Swiss government, reflect what appears to be a significant shift in Iranian-American relations since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. The Bush administration has set aside for now its criticism of Iran for supporting Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim militant group based in Lebanon, and the Palestinian group Hamas. It did not include either group on two lists of terrorist groups and individuals whose assets have been frozen because of the attacks. 
In its message, the Bush administration requested that Iran go to the aid of any American who might be shot down or forced to land in Iranian territory, or who escaped into Iran, the officials said. 
The Swiss government officially represents United States-Iranian interests in the absence of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
The Iranian and American messages are the latest and most important of several to pass between the two countries through the Swiss channel in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks and could have political ramifications extending far beyond the fate of American military personnel.
But the diplomatic maneuvering is extremely delicate. Iran is still listed by the State Department as the world's most active state supporter of terrorism, largely because of its support for Hezbollah and for the Palestinian groups Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The assets of those groups are frozen under previous executive orders that appear to be less sweeping than the two most recent orders.
Nevertheless, the signs of movement are notable. The administration has, for the first time, asked a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit brought against Iran by the 52 Americans who were held hostage for 444 days beginning in 1979 and many of their relatives, who are seeking damages from the Tehran government.
The litigation was brought last year. Because Iran did not contest the suit, saying it did not accept that United States courts had jurisdiction, the hostages and their relatives won the case by default in August. 
But representatives of the Justice Department and the State Department appeared in court today just as the case was to go to trial to determine how much Iran owed in damages to the 137 people who brought the lawsuit.
Asked by the judge why it had taken so long for the government to intervene, James J. Gilligan, a Justice Department lawyer, said his agency had not learned of the lawsuit from the State Department until last month. But William Coffield, one of the lawyers representing the former hostages and their relatives, said in an interview that it appeared that the administration was trying to send a friendly signal to Iran. "They're clearly carrying water for Iran," he said.
In recent weeks Iran and the United States have engaged in what one senior administration official calls a ballet, in which both sides are taking tentative steps to explore where their national security interests intersect, in this crisis and beyond.
Weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks, the Bush administration opened a full-scale interagency review of American policy toward Iran. The State Department, with its policy planning director, Richard N. Haass, taking the lead, has tried to accelerate the review since the attacks, administration officials said.
Among the issues under discussion are how much Iran needs to build its conventional defensive military strength and whether American economic sanctions against Iran should be sustained, administration officials said. There is a growing consensus in the administration that the Clinton administration policy of "dual containment," which isolated and punished both Iran and Iraq, was unwise and that the United States could no longer have both as enemies.
"How did it happen that we are on the opposite side of both Iran and Iraq?" Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld asked a journalist at a black-tie dinner three days before the attacks. "It makes no sense."
In a related diplomatic development, American and Iranian officials met face to face on Oct. 7 in an obscure United Nations-sponsored forum in Geneva for the second time since the Sept. 11 attacks to discuss the shape of a future Afghan government, American and Iranian officials said. They added that the talks had focused on ways to broaden the base of the future Afghan government.
The United States, through the United Nations World Food Program, is shipping food aid overland from Iran to Afghanistan. A first consignment of 110 tons of wheat was delivered to Herat, Afghanistan, without difficulty on Wednesday. 
In a briefing last week, Andrew Natsios, the head of the United States Agency for International Development, called Iran's cooperation on the relief front excellent.
He said Iran was making possible the relocation of a number of private relief organizations into Iran from the Pakistan border area. Iran already has about 1.5 million Afghan refugees on its territory, Mr. Natsios said, and does not want "large-scale population movements and millions of refugees."
Iran's offer to help American military personnel is a signal that Iran does not intend to use the United States military campaign against terrorism as a pretext to target American interests in the region, officials from both countries said. 
In its war in Afghanistan, the United States needs at least the tacit support of Iran, which shares a 560-mile border with Afghanistan and supplies weapons and logistical and financial support to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance.
Iran's stance is reminiscent of the situation after the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1990, when Iran refrained from meddling with the United States-led coalition to expel Iraq. In the Persian Gulf war of 1991, Iran turned a blind eye to the Pentagon's violation of airspace along its western border with Iraq, the best route for American warplanes to fire missiles over Baghdad. During that conflict Iran also gave the United States a secret assurance that it would go to the aid of Americans in combat against Iraq.
But Iran for years has refused to open a broad, official political dialogue with the United States, and a number of different voices are coming from Iran's leadership.
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, condemned the military strikes on Afghanistan last week and accused Washington of lying about its true intentions. Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, has called for an immediate end to the military strikes, saying they were causing a "human catastrophe."
But Mohsen Rezai, the former head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard who now serves as the secretary of the powerful Expediency Council, said Iran was willing to set aside its concerns about the American attacks on Afghanistan and work with the United States in its war on terrorism, perhaps including the sharing of intelligence, The Financial Times reported today. "If the Americans get trapped in the swamp of Afghanistan, they will definitely need Iran," Mr. Rezai said in an interview with the newspaper.
While one European intelligence service has reported that Iran may be ready to reduce its support for Hezbollah and Hamas, a senior European official said, American officials say there is no evidence to support that assertion.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ECONOMY; 
Afghans Left in Kabul Are Reported to Be Selling Their Belongings to Buy Food

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: RAHMONKHEL, Afghanistan Oct. 14 

 BODY:
Refugees who have fled Kabul, the Afghan capital, said today that a growing number of families there were struggling to be able to pay for food.
 The food supply is adequate, said these refugees, who have reached rebel-controlled areas in the north. But the already weak Afghan economy has been in a free fall since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. 
 Even before bombs began to fall, the Taliban government, which controls most of the country, stopped paying its workers, they said. The sealing of the borders with Iran and Pakistan and a collapsing exchange rate brought economic activity to standstill. The savings of middle class families are evaporating, they said, and the poor are resorting to an old tactic -- selling their household belongings. 
"Most of the people who live in Kabul now are selling their belongings to get food," said Shirjan, an unemployed former government worker who arrived here today with his family. Asked why he fled the city, he answered, "Because of the food and the war."
The price of bread, rice and other foods has remained stable in Kabul, apparently because a substantial percentage of the residents have left. But those left in the city have less money to buy it with.
It was impossible to confirm the refugees' accounts, and they said that at this point few people in Kabul were close to starvation. But the growing desperation there is an indication of the impact of the bombing on civilians. 
It is also unclear whether or not the number of refugees is increasing. Merchants along the route today said the figure has remained constant at 50 to 100 people a day. 
During times of crisis, Kabul's poor have often resorted to selling household belongings, like mattresses or pans. What is different now, the refugees said, is that the practice is spreading to a much larger group of people -- both to buy food and to raise money to leave the city. 
The economic problems plaguing Kabul range from the obvious to the unexpected.
Many people who were once considered secure are struggling, the refugees said. One byproduct of the crisis has been a radically altered exchange rate. Workers for foreign aid groups and traders who had done business with Iran and Pakistan have found that their savings in foreign currencies -- American dollars, Pakistani rupees and Iranian rials -- have shrunk by 50 percent.
That has happened because money traders in Kabul assume that if the Taliban fall, the country will be flooded with dollars and other foreign currency. Each time the BBC or Voice of America broadcasts a report about the possibility of a new government, refugees said, the money traders drop the value of the dollar and other foreign currencies as compared with the afghani, the local currency people use to buy food.
"The foreign monies are decreasing against the afghani," said Abdul Hasrat, who fled to rebel-controlled territory here on Sunday. "If a person has savings, they use it, otherwise they spend their days and nights hungry." 
Thousands of families that rely on the earnings of Afghans abroad are finding that the dollars they receive from their relatives are worth less and less. 
Those fleeing the city say that people are beginning to run out of money after four weeks of economic stagnation. Business has been at a standstill since Sept. 11. After the attacks in America, foreign aid groups that employed thousands of Afghans, for instance, evacuated their foreign staff and curtailed operations. Activity at trucking companies also ground to a halt.
"There are no jobs for the people," said Shirjan, the former government worker who fled the city today.
Masjady Haidari, a 25-year-old vegetable trader who arrived here today with his wife and daughter, said that Kabul's poor were trapped and that even selling their belongings was no longer a guaranteed source of cash.
"There is difficulty selling things," he said. "People don't want to buy anything."
No one in Kabul wants household goods, the refugees said. They want food or money to get out.

HEADLINE: Loan Losses At Big Bank Lead to Drop InEarnings 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Bank of America Corporation said yesterday that its third-quarter profit dropped 54 percent as it put aside money as protection against bad loans and took a $1.25 billion charge to get out of troubled businesses.
 Banks' loan losses are rising as borrowers struggle to repay debts in a slowing economy. More loans are at risk after the terrorist attacks sapped the desire of many people to shop and travel, cutting further into companies' revenue and leading to layoffs of workers. 
 The economic fallout from the attacks has also dimmed the bank's near-term earnings prospects, the chief financial officer, James Hance Jr., told analysts in a conference call yesterday.
Bank of America, a holding company based in Charlotte, N.C., reported net income of $841 million, or 51 cents a share, compared with $1.83 billion, or $1.10 a share, in the period a year earlier.
Excluding a charge for the costs of leaving the auto-leasing and subprime real estate-lending business -- the latter involving home loans to people with poor credit histories -- earnings were $2.09 billion, or $1.28 a share. That compared with $2.18 billion, or $1.31 a share excluding one-time items in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 5 percent, to $8.72 billion, as low interest rates spurred loan growth.
Wall Street analysts had expected the company to earn $1.25 a share, according to Thomson Financial/ First Call.
"The results looked pretty good," said Andrew Collins of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "They are shoring up their balance sheet quite nicely, margins are up and the reserves look healthy."
In trading yesterday, shares of Bank of America rose $2.54, or 4.8 percent, to $55.55. 
Net charge-offs, or loans for which the company does not expect repayment, rose to $1.5 billion from $435 million a year earlier. The latest figures included $635 million in charge-offs related to the subprime real estate business, along with $135 million in disposing of problem commercial and consumer loans.

HEADLINE: Business Inventories in U.S. Fell Only 0.1% During August 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
Business inventories fell 0.1 percent in August, the smallest drop in seven months, government figures showed today, suggesting retailers were preparing for improved sales before the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 pushed the economy toward recession.
 The drop in stockpiles, which came after a 0.5 percent decrease in July, brought their value to $1.18 trillion, the Commerce Department said. It was the smallest decrease since January, when inventories rose. Companies have been struggling to reduce excess supplies this year after consumer spending slowed and business investment in new equipment fell. 
 The pressure on businesses to trim stockpiles has grown since the attacks, the deadliest and most destructive terrorist violence in history. Retail sales slumped last month, the government reported last week. Many economists say the nation is in a recession.
"Falling sales mean that the drawdown of inventories will be less than expected and industrial production may not rebound quickly," said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin Kubik Stephens & Thompson.
Combined sales by manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers rose 0.1 percent in August after a 0.4 percent increase in July, the Commerce Department reported. Even so, total business sales in August were 1.8 percent smaller than they were in August 2000.
Inventories at retailers alone, reported for the first time today, rose 0.6 percent in August, reflecting increases at department stores, building materials outlets and motor vehicles and parts dealers. Sales at retailers rose 0.3 percent in August after rising 0.2 percent in July.
Stockpiles at manufacturers, which account for about 40 percent of the report, fell 0.7 percent in August after falling 0.8 percent the month before. Sales fell 0.5 percent after rising 0.4 percent in July.
In other categories, wholesale inventories, which make up about one-fourth of the business inventories report, fell 0.1 percent in August after declining 0.9 percent in July. Sales rose 0.6 percent after rising 0.7 percent a month earlier.

HEADLINE: Arthur D. Little in Talks to Sell Majority Stake 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Arthur D. Little, a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass., has entered into exclusive negotiations to sell a majority stake in the firm to a group of private investors.
 Terms of a potential transaction were not disclosed; the firm is privately held. 
 The investors, led by Whitney & Company, a venture capital firm in Stamford, Conn., and Safeguard International Fund, a private equity fund with offices in Philadelphia and Frankfurt, would provide the consulting firm, which has annual revenues of $600 million, with a much needed infusion of capital. Arthur D. Little has carried about $55 million in debt as a result of the costs of a failed effort to spin off its telecommunications consulting practice through a public stock offering. 
"The resources made available through the transaction will reinforce our widely recognized ability to help organizations from a broad range of industries," Pamela McNamara, the firm's chief executive, said in a statement to be released today. 
Arthur D. Little, or A.D.L. as it is known, is something of an anomaly in the consulting business because of its age -- it was founded in 1886 -- and its focus on research and development, said Jack Sweeney, an editor with Kennedy Information, which follows the industry. 
"There are a lot of good things that can come out of" the research and development spending, Mr. Sweeney said, citing as an example the firm's announcement in June that it had received $3.8 million to develop fuel-cell technologies for the Energy Department.
A.D.L., which employs just under 3,000 consultants, has suffered through the current slowdown along with most of the industry and has shed more than 200 jobs over the last year. The firm also has new leadership. Ms. McNamara took over as acting chief executive last January, and under her A.D.L. has reduced its operating costs by nearly $20 million, according to the firm.
A.D.L. has been looking for potential transaction partners for several months, and the investment will provide it with additional funds, a spokesman said.
"Safeguard has a history of investing in consulting firms," Mr. Sweeney said. With the investment and under Ms. McNamara, the firm may be in a better position to weather the current tough economy, he said.
"Two months ago, she told us that they had a backlog," he said. "We thought that they might have been getting back on the right track with her, and perhaps they are."

HEADLINE: Ford Denies Top Executive Will Leave byYear's End 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
Jacques A. Nasser, the chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, will probably be out of a job by the end of the year, according to a person close to the company.
 Ford officials dismissed that suggestion, however. 
 "We wouldn't speculate on bogus speculation," said Jason Vines, Ford's communications director, adding that during Mr. Nasser's tenure there had been frequent suggestions of when and how he will depart, suggestions that have yet to be borne out. 
"Ten years from now, when Jacques decides to retire, some will say, 'I told you so,' " Mr. Vines added. 
Other officials close to the company's operations did not discount the possibility of Mr. Nasser's departure, though none would confirm it. The suggestion was first posted last night on Forbes.com, the Web site for Forbes magazine.
Whether or not it is true, there is no doubt that Mr. Nasser, 53, has been under intense pressure as Ford's struggles have intensified. He has led one of the bitterest corporate battles in memory, a feud with the Bridgestone/Firestone Company over the part Firestone tires played in rollovers of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. The problems led Ford to replace millions of tires on its Explorers, and Mr. Nasser appeared in television ads to defend the company's reputation. 
More recently, Ford's sales and its market share have continued to erode as the economy has weakened and the company, like the other members of the Big Three, has come under pressure from foreign automakers. In September Ford's car sales fell 11.1 percent from the month a year earlier, and its light truck sales declined 9.2 percent -- even though the Ford F-series pickup trucks were the best-selling vehicles in the country.
Over all, auto sales fell last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.8 million, the lowest rate in more than two years.
New interest-free financing deals offered by all of Detroit's big automakers to increase slumping sales after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon further cut into profits. Ford is expected to post a loss of 28 cents a share for the third quarter, according to the consensus estimate of analysts complied by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Shares of Ford have declined steadily in the last few months. They were as high as $31.3574 on April 17. They closed at $17.73 yesterday.
The zero-financing deals did help General Motors regain some of its lost market share from foreign automakers in September, but Ford and the Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, continue to lose share. 
Last week, Ford's board voted to cut the dividend in half for both its Class B and common shares, the first dividend cut in a decade. The dividend reduction hits the incomes of an important constituency for Mr. Nasser -- Ford family members, who control 40 percent of the voting shares of the company. The board next meets in November.
Yesterday, Ford took another hit when its credit rating was lowered by Standard & Poor's, which also downgraded G.M., citing falling profits and intensified competition on pricing. 
In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, Ford said it had cut its production by 110,000 to 120,000 vehicles for the remainder of the third quarter. The company had already said earlier in the year that it would reduce its white-collar work force by 5,000 workers, and difficulties in the car rental industry related to the slump in air travel have sharply cut profits at Hertz, a Ford unit.
If all that was not bad enough, a large group of Ford dealers were sharply critical of Mr. Nasser in a recent survey that was made public; most said change at the company needed to start at the top. 
Mr. Nasser's power has already been hemmed in. In July, William Clay Ford Jr., the 44-year-old chairman of the company and great-grandson of Henry Ford, assumed a greater role in day-to-day operations when he created an office of the chairman and chief executive. And after a board meeting in August, Nicholas V. Scheele, 57, was moved from his post as head of Ford's European operations and installed under Mr. Nasser as head of Ford's North American operations.
Mr. Scheele is currently leading a turnaround effort for the company's North American operations. Both he and Mr. Ford would probably be candidates to replace Mr. Nasser if, indeed, he leaves his job.
Certainly, speculation on the palace intrigue at Ford -- the relationships of Mr. Nasser with Mr. Ford and Mr. Scheele -- is a frequent sport in Detroit. The top item yesterday on the Web site of Automotive News, an industry newspaper, asked the question, "How long can C.E.O. Jacques Nasser keep his job?"

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
Is a U.S. Force The Safest Bet For Airports?

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
POLITICIANS in Washington can't say enough good things about our Fire and Police Departments' ability to deal with a catastrophe, but even our own senators don't trust local officials to handle routine security at airports. Last week, the Senate voted unanimously to create a federal airport security force.
 Why does putting a federal security force in New York airports make any more sense than putting federal firefighters or federal police officers in our streets? Some senators said the new national force was needed to bring American aviation security up to the standards of Israel and Europe. But officials in those countries have tried and abandoned the federal model. 
 Israel, the great model of security, replaced national government employees with private ones under contract to the Ben Gurion Airport Authority near Tel Aviv. In Israel, as is common in Europe, the national government sets and enforces standards for security, but the airport operator is in charge of operations -- and accountable for mistakes.
Security has been lax at American airports because no one was accountable and most people thought of terrorism as a foreign problem. Voters and politicians didn't demand that the Federal Aviation Administration enforce rigid security standards; passengers didn't insist on better performance by the airports and airlines that shared responsibility with the F.A.A.
But now that Al Qaeda is promising to bring down more planes, everyone's paying attention. If airport operators were given the same responsibility as their counterparts overseas, they'd be under pressure to provide the same level of security. They'd probably hire the same companies now providing well-trained, well-paid workers to those overseas airports. 
To protect their reputations and avoid fines, airport managers would fire incompetent workers (try that with federal employees) and experiment with different techniques and equipment. The successful innovations would spread, just as innovations spread among local police and fire departments. When New York's crime rate plummeted, police departments in other cities rushed to match New York by copying its computerized system of tracking crimes. A single large federal bureaucracy doesn't benefit from that sort of competition and innovation.
So why create it? One reason is that a large new group of public employees appeals to Democrats, who are now fighting for the federal security force against opposition from Republicans controlling the White House and the House of Representatives.
But other Republicans (including the entire Senate contingent) insist that only a federal force will reassure the public in this crisis, and they have some historical evidence in their favor. You can find it in Robert Higgs's book, "Crisis and Leviathan" (Oxford University Press, 1987).
DR. HIGGS, an economist at the Independent Institute in Oakland, Calif., traces most of the federal government's growth in the last century to a few crises, notably the Depression and the world wars. Each crisis causes a growth spurt, and when the crisis is over the government doesn't shrink back to its former size. "Newly entrenched interests press for the retention of certain crisis policies, and the government always continues to exercise some of the new or expanded powers," Dr. Higgs said yesterday.
By now, people are so used to big government that they automatically turn to Washington in a crisis even when it's not likely to be helpful, he said. "Airport security, in particular, would seem to be a task that demands the kind of local knowledge and particular expertise that a federal one-size-fits-all system would lack," he said.
"Nor would a federal administrator have the same incentive to do a good job. If a local airport-security manager fails, everyone knows whom to hold accountable. If a federal administrator should fail in one or two major cases, in contrast, he can always claim to have done a good job because 'the system worked for 99 percent of the airports.' "
If a new federal force failed, would the United States follow the lead of Israel and other countries relying on individual airport administrators and private companies for security? "Our history shows that once a job is federalized, it's very hard to change," Dr. Higgs said. "You'd think we'd be considering alternatives to the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. after their massive failure to anticipate the events of Sept. 11, but the public can't even imagine a good alternative. At the very least, heads should be rolling at those agencies, but no one ever seems to be held accountable."

HEADLINE: Balkan Instability Could Create a Terrorist Haven 

BYLINE:  By Misha Glenny; Misha Glenny is author of "The Balkans: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers, 1804-1999."

DATELINE: BRIGHTON, England 

 BODY:
For 10 years, the Balkans have presented Europe and America with one of their greatest foreign policy challenges. The aftermath of four violent conflicts has consumed billions of taxpayers' dollars in aid. In March 1999, the Balkans triggered the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's first war, almost 50 years to the day after the alliance was founded. And bitter disputes over Balkan policy occasionally threatened the foundations of America's relations with Europe and, indeed, harmony within Europe.
 That is quite a record for a single decade. After Sept. 11, however, nobody can afford the luxury of a fractious Balkans. The United States and Europe feel compelled to divert political, military and financial resources away from the region and into their struggle against terrorism. 
 The Balkan countries have a simple choice. All aspire to membership in the European Union, but unless they cooperate among themselves to stabilize the region, they will be moving in the opposite direction. Just wishing for concord among the Balkan nations will not make it happen. The problems they face are very real and very dangerous. The former Yugoslavia is a jumble of chronically weak states and quasi-protectorates run by the international community's ill-disciplined army of acronyms -- SFOR, KFOR and the rest.
The greatest beneficiaries of this disorganization are criminal mafias, that have constructed huge networks based on the trade in illegal immigrants, prostitutes, weapons, drugs and, above all, cigarettes. These mafias do not recognize national boundaries. The Serbian underworld cooperates as happily with Albanian gangsters as it does with Bosnian or Croat tough guys. So influential has this web of crime become that the Sicilian mafia has retreated from its operations in central and northern Italy, which are now dominated by Balkan gangs.
The NATO secretary general, Lord Robertson, hit the nail on the head earlier this week when he said that the Balkans must not become another "black hole" of terrorism like Afghanistan.
Mr. Robertson did not mean that the Muslims of the region would take up the anti-American cause. You will not find more committed pro-American communities anywhere in Europe than the two Muslim nations of the Balkans: the Albanians and the Bosnians. But in a region where $30 buys you not just a counterfeit passport but a real one, that is not the issue.
When guns and the black market form the backbone of society, they attract all sorts of dubious characters who can easily avoid the attention of the state's overstretched police forces. It is easy for terrorists to hide. And given the Balkans' proximity to Western Europe, it is a very handy place to plot.
So although the Balkan states are no longer a primary foreign policy consideration, they cannot be ignored. The international community and the Balkan powers have to shape up. The former must learn within the next few weeks to speak with one voice. Until now, its members have often spoken with so many tongues as to be unintelligible. In Macedonia, for example, until last May American and European policies were hopelessly out of step with one another. Extremists on both the Macedonian and the Albanian sides exploited this.
Washington and Brussels now agree broadly that the European Union should be primarily responsible for developing a coherent political and economic strategy to assist the Balkans. Chris Patten and Javier Solana, the E.U.'s foreign policy chiefs, need to establish a small, tightly knit unit to create policy, to talk to the regional governments, to cooperate closely with America and to maintain a dialogue with the Russians. If policy is not streamlined, failure is inevitable.
Of course, Balkan countries have to pull their weight, too. They need to articulate their long-term needs more effectively. Governments have to quit the debilitating habit of seeking short-term benefits from the West.
Here, they can learn from each other. For beyond the narrow, inefficient central governments, there has grown a rich and vigorous Balkan civil society that is breaking down barriers and offering solutions. Think tanks joined in the Southeast European Policy Institute Network, refugee support groups and other charities, and independent newspaper and television and radio stations (particularly the members of Anem, the Association of Independent Media) are showing the way toward cooperation across borders and ethnic lines. There are encouraging signs that governments wish to follow that path. If they do, the politics of identity may at last yield to the politics of interests.
Time is short. Macedonia is still in crisis. Kosovo is a mess. In the southern Balkans, Slav-Albanian relations threaten almost everywhere to collapse into conflict. A monumental effort is needed to prevent the Balkans from turning into a black hole of terrorism, but that effort can and must be made.

HEADLINE: EMI Group's Top Executive for Recorded Music Quits 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
In an admission that attempts to rebuild its presence in the United States had fallen flat, the EMI Group said today that Ken Berry, its well-known head of recorded music and its highest paid executive, had left the company.
 Alain Levy, 55, best known for turning PolyGram into the world's largest music company before it was sold in 1998 to Seagram, now part of Vivendi Universal, will succeed Mr. Berry as chief executive of recorded music. And David Munns, 50, another former PolyGram executive, will return to EMI, where he spent the first 15 years of his career, in the newly created post of vice chairman of the division. 
 The management shake-up was necessary after Mr. Berry, who is highly regarded in the music industry, failed to stem EMI's decline in the United States, the world's largest music market, analysts said. The recorded music division -- home to the Rolling Stones and the Spice Girls -- accounts for four-fifths of EMI's sales, with the remainder coming from its music-publishing arm.
But investors, worried that new executives alone would not solve EMI's problems, sold the stock, which declined 4.6 percent, to $:2.65 ($3.85) in London trading today.
"It is a big step and not a decision they've taken lightly," Helen Snell, an analyst with ABN Amro, said. "But Ken has to be held accountable to some degree for the underperformance of the recorded music division."
Since Mr. Berry became head of EMI's recorded music division in May 1997, its market share in the United States has slumped to 10.6 percent from 12.6 percent, Ms. Snell said. Although it had risen slightly this year, with the release of the Beatles' "1," a collection of the band's No. 1 hits, those gains are unlikely to offset a slide in pretax profit, which EMI has warned might fall this year by a fifth.
EMI, which is based here, is not alone in feeling the pinch of a slowing economy and stagnant music sales. But it is one of the smaller players, ranked fifth in the United States, making it difficult to compete on a global stage dominated by increasingly larger rivals, like the Universal Music Group, part of Vivendi Universal, and the Warner Music Group, part of AOL Time Warner. EMI has also been distracted by a string of failed merger attempts, most recently with Warner Music and Bertelsmann, the German media company.
In turning to Mr. Levy, Eric Nicoli, the chairman of EMI, is betting that the former PolyGram executive can replicate a strategy of increasing profits by gaining market share. In his nine years at PolyGram, Mr. Levy oversaw the acquisitions of Island Records and A & M Records that brought with them acts like U2 and Sting -- and later Def Jam Records, home to LL Cool J.
Mr. Berry, who earned an annual salary of nearly $3 million, was known for signing big stars, but was criticized for paying too much for talent.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
With consumers concerned about unexpected mail, direct marketers will try new approaches.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE direct-marketing industry, which sold about $528 billion worth of goods and services through the mail last year, is worried it may face a crisis resulting from the nationwide increase in cases of people being exposed to anthrax through letters.
 Though the chances of contracting anthrax through the mail are infinitesimal, consumers and businesses are growing increasingly concerned about unfamiliar letters and packages -- a particular problem for direct marketers that often mask their identities to prevent recipients from dismissing a pitch out of hand as junk mail. Those fears, unfounded or otherwise, threaten to hobble the industry, whose fortunes rise and fall with the response to the rivers of mail that flow daily into the nation's mailboxes. 
 "The hardest thing we have to do as direct marketers is getting someone to open the envelope," said Howard Draft, chairman and chief executive at Draft Worldwide in Chicago, the largest direct marketing agency. 
"Until this passes, I think we'll have somewhat of a lowering in response rates clients will see," he added. Draft is a division of the Partnership unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
The difficulties generated by the anxieties over mystery mail are likely to make a challenging period even tougher for the industry, which was already grappling with an economic slowdown at its most important time of the year, the start of the holiday shopping season.
"The last time I talked to the mail people, they told me Sept. 11 had really cut into their response rates," particularly for credit card solicitations and magazine subscription renewals, said Robert J. Coen, the longtime predictor of advertising spending, who is senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of Interpublic.
"And this may carry over into 2002," he added. "A lot of marketers are going to be worried." Mr. Coen had estimated that marketers would spend $46.6 billion on advertising mail this year, compared with $44.6 billion in 2000.
"We're going to have to be creative in finding ways to give consumers the confidence that they don't have to be concerned" about opening their mail, said Carla Hendra, president for the North American operations of another large direct marketing agency, OgilvyOne Worldwide, part of the Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide division of the WPP Group.
"It's the same as putting yourself on an airplane," she added. "It's necessary to reconsider every aspect of that."
Indeed, the Direct Marketing Association, the industry trade organization, began yesterday to distribute -- through e-mail messages -- wide-ranging guidelines to its 5,000 member companies, suggesting responses to security issues.
The 13 suggestions include advice to "avoid using plain envelopes," to "use a clear and identifiable return address" and to "temporarily consider briefly delaying" mailings to businesses "because of potential logjams in receiving mailrooms."
"While there doesn't appear to be a widespread campaign to disperse anthrax through the mail," said H. Robert Wientzen, president and chief executive at the association in New York, "clearly we are concerned about what appears to be overreaction and the impact it could have."
"The panic is inappropriate," he added, "but we still are likely to see a temporary" effect on the response rates to direct-mail appeals.
The guidelines were developed by the association after discussions with representatives of the Postal Service and consultants on security and biohazards, Mr. Wientzen said, adding that many were based on "common sense, but are worth reminding people."
Among them: consider notifying recipients by telephone or e-mail message that the mail is being sent,; print a toll-free telephone number or Web site address on envelopes as a reassurance; and add more elements of personalization so mail will seem less odd or unusual.
Companies that send advertising mail "have to be concerned about things they've historically done," said Larry Kimmel, chairman and chief executive at Grey Direct in New York, a large direct marketing agency that is part of the Grey Global Group.
"Envelopes without logos have classically increased 'open' rates tremendously," Mr. Kimmel said, because people are eager to learn the identity of the senders of such mailings, known as blind-outers. "But you can't do that anymore or now they will be discarded."
Another ploy now likely to be problematic, he added, are "fat letters, which do incredibly well," meaning envelopes containing additional inducements besides letters like trinkets, gifts and other premiums.
At Time Inc., the giant magazine publishing house that is part of AOL Time Warner, reassessment of its billions of pieces of mail is already under way.
"We're not going to stop mailing," said Jeremy Koch, senior vice president for consumer marketing at Time Inc. in New York, "but we're looking at all of our packages with a critical eye."
"The question is, 'Is this a package, if I were nervous, I might hesitate to open?' " he added. "
"Blind-outers are pretty harmless looking," he added, "but now it may be something that makes a recipient a little bit nervous."
So, too, may envelopes containing small, unsolicited gifts like refrigerator magnets, Mr. Koch said, especially "if they say 'Do not bend, merchandise inside.' "'
"Once upon a time, it was an innocent device," he added. "But current concerns about the mail may change this."
The worries over direct mail may stimulate growth for alternatives like e-mail messages sent to consumers who provide their e-mail addresses, known as permission-based e-mail marketing, and direct response television, the program-length commercials known as infomercials, which typically involves sending mail to only those consumers who requested it.
"We're looking to migrate some customer communications from direct mail to e-mail," said Mr. Kimmel of Grey Direct, "which can cost as little as half a cent to deliver."
"E-mail is a good solution, but it's not a be-all and end-all," he added. "A poorly crafted permission-based e-mail program could have large opt-out rates," referring to the number of recipients who ask to be removed from e-mail mailing lists.
As for infomercials, "it's too early to tell" whether interest among marketers will increase, said Hugh Allspaugh, senior vice president for client services at Tyee Euro RSCG in Portland, Ore., an agency specializing in program-length commercials that is part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas Advertising.
"One thing's for sure," he added, "people are watching more television" -- presumably to learn more about the safety of mail.

HEADLINE: La Courneuve Journal; 
In Suburban Squalor Near Paris, Echoes of Jihad

BYLINE:  By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: LA COURNEUVE, France 

 BODY:
La Cite des 4,000 is a slate-gray housing project where many Muslim immigrants live in apartments with windows closed off by cement blocks, trash spills down stairwells, gangs openly deal cocaine and hashish, and the burned-out hulks of cars lie in parking lots.
 Like many pockets of poor Muslim immigrants, La Cite is a world unto itself, where young men are caught in a profound and disturbing identity crisis, suffer the sting of racism and the plague of unemployment. Some have come to see in Osama bin Laden, the man America is trying to bomb into submission, as a savior. 
 It does not take long in La Cite des 4,000, nicknamed the Bronx because of the high crime rate, to understand why France's four million Muslims constitute a social and political powder keg. France has expressed strong support for America's war on terrorism, but the government is clearly concerned about containing Muslim anger at home. 
That anger was evident on Oct. 6 when, for the first time since Algeria's bitter war for independence from France, the two countries played a soccer match. French-born Muslims hooted and whistled during the French national anthem. The crowd chanted "Bin Laden! Bin Laden! Bin Laden!" and pelted two French ministers, both women, with bottles.
When it was clear that the Algerian team would lose, the Algerian fans stormed the field waving Algerian flags and stopped the match. 
The turmoil was striking not least because France's relationship with its large Muslim population appeared to have improved after France won the World Cup soccer tournament in 1998 with a team that included immigrants and the children of immigrants. The star of the team was Zinedine Zidane, a brilliant player of Algerian descent.
That progress now seems to have evaporated. At La Cite, it seems clear that Mr. bin Laden has contrived to express the rage of many dispossessed Muslims.
"You want us to weep for the Americans when they bomb and kill Palestinians and Iraqis every day?" said Mohaam Abak, 21, a Moroccan immigrant who sat with two friends on a bench. "We want more Americans to die so they can begin to see what it feels like." 
All the tensions between France's Muslims, most from North Africa, and the rest of French society have bubbled into the open in the last month in the sprawling "banlieue," the working-class suburbs populated by ethnic minorities that surround most French cities.
La Cite des 4,000 -- named because it had 4,000 public housing apartments at the time of its construction -- is the most notorious. Heavily armed policemen, since Sept. 11, have become more visible, where they patrol past huge spray-painted slogans that denounce the French government as fascist.
Moroccan and Algerian flags hang from windows, placed there the day the bombing strikes on Afghanistan began. When news of the attack on the World Trade Center reached the projects, young men streamed onto the cracked cement courtyards outside the 15-story apartment blocks to clap, whistle, cheer and shout in Arabic, "God is great!" 
"America declared war on Muslims a long time ago," said Laala Teula, 66, an Algerian immigrant who worked for many years as a mechanic for the railroad. "This is just the response."
Evidently concerned, the government has appealed for the integration of Muslims. "Young people, whatever their origin, are at home in here," said the French interior minister, Daniel Vaillant, this past Saturday, "but they must behave as French who desire peace and national cohesion."
In this bleak suburban environment, such appeals have little impact. Claudette Dana, 47, waits for the elevator to her seventh-floor apartment. In the foyer outside, seven young men, all of North African descent and members of one of the three major gangs that dominate the projects, stand waiting. They throw rocks at the reporter she is speaking with, curse the United States and begin, like many who saw someone new visiting the projects, to chant "Osama bin Laden! Osama bin Laden! Osama bin Laden!" Mrs. Dana, whose husband is a firefighter and who lives on a disability check after two bouts with cancer, says that in the 30 years she has lived in the projects she has never seen such anger.
When the elevator door opens on the seventh floor, she points to a freshly painted white swath on the wall. Mrs. Dana, one of the few Jews in the projects, came home a few days ago to find the words "Death to the Jews" scrawled next to her door.
"I had to paint that slogan out," she says. "It scared my two sons. They want us to move."
The French government has plans to tear down the dreary blocks, standing northeast of Paris and built in the 1960's, which are now run down and beyond repair.
One 15-story block, home to 1,200 people, was demolished a year ago, and Mrs. Dana said her building would go, as soon as the government finds a place to move everyone. But the eradication of the buildings will probably do little to bridge the chasm between those of North African descent and the rest of European society.
French Ministry of Interior officials who direct the battle against the cells linked with Mr. bin Laden's network have arrested 30 Muslims in recent days suspected of plotting attacks, including four who they say planned an attack during the France-Algeria soccer match.
Several members of armed terrorist cells, including two who in 1994 machine-gunned the lobby of a hotel in Marrakesh, killing two Spanish tourists and seriously wounding a third, came from La Cite des 4,000. At least two dozen young men from the projects received training in camps in Afghanistan, French officials said.
"There is little in their lives that validates them," said a French Ministry of Interior official. "They find in radical Islam a cause."

HEADLINE: 2 Airlines to Resume Concorde Flights NextMonth 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
The Concorde will return to the skies early next month, Air France and British Airways announced yesterday, but travelers said that the sluggish economy and post-Sept. 11 safety concerns might quell enthusiasm for the expensive swanlike supersonic jets.
 The two airlines grounded the plane in July 2000, when an Air France Concorde burst into flames after hitting a piece of metal on a runway during takeoff at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris. The fire killed 113 people, including all 109 passengers and crew members and four others on the ground. 
 The planes have been refurbished, with new wiring, fuel-tank linings made from the same material used in bulletproof vests, and sturdier tires. And on British Airways, at least, they will come with something the airline has never offered before: cut-price tickets. 
From today through next Monday, round-trip tickets between New York and London will cost $4,999, a discount of about 59 percent, for travel between Nov. 9 and Jan. 31, 2002, British Airways said. The fare applies to every seat on its six flights a week in each direction. 
Air France, which charges $10,404 for a round-trip ticket between New York and Paris, does not plan any promotions. It will offer six weekly flights in each direction. 
Spokesmen for both British Airways and Air France said the airlines, in the wake of Sept. 11, planned tight security for their Concorde flights, though they would not elaborate. But the reception that the revived supersonic service receives may have more to do with the finances of its mainly business clientele than with security worries. 
"My issue is not whether I will feel safe on the airplane, as much as the fact that we, like any other business in the United States, are watching expenses very carefully," said Mel Immergut, chairman of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, the big Manhattan law firm, who was a frequent Concorde flier before last year. 
"I am going to have to justify in my own mind if spending the extra money the Concorde costs is still worth it," Mr. Immergut said. "A year ago, it was. But like everything else, with us and with all of our clients, we are looking carefully at decisions like this." 
Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, a lobbying group based in Radnor, Pa., predicted that before long, the Concorde's regular users would return to it. In part, he said, that is because traveling overseas on a non-United States carrier appeared safer to some people concerned about terrorism. 
Still, he added, "there's going to be a ramp-up period to get back to the levels the Concorde once enjoyed." 
John Lampl, a spokesman for British Airways, said that the airline's first two Concorde flights, to New York on Nov. 7 and back to London on Nov. 8, would be filled with what he called "a group of guests." The airline's Nov. 9 flight from London to New York will be the first open to paying customers. An Air France spokeswoman said tickets had already been sold for that airline's Nov. 7 flight from Paris to New York.
"Obviously it's not the best time for the industry, or for their target clients," said Rick Sapp, a managing director for Goldman, Sachs in London who frequently took the Concorde from London to New York. "They will have to adjust their pricing to attract people in this kind of environment." 
Some former Concorde fliers may have switched to using corporate jets, Mr. Sapp noted, both for safety and for convenience. "The question is: How does the Concorde compete against that alternative?" he said. "It is definitely faster. But on a corporate jet, you know everybody on your plane. You don't have to take any risks with other passengers."
Raoul Felder, a Manhattan divorce lawyer who used to be a regular on the New York-to-London route, said the Concorde would be flying without him next month.
"I was in London last week, just overnight, and it was very hard to do without the Concorde," he said. "But it's a question of safety. The plane is like a little aluminum tube hurtling through the sky at supersonic speeds, and we now know it's fallible. I just don't want to be the guinea pig anymore." Besides, he added, "they don't even have movies." 
British Airways has been staying in touch with its old Concorde customers through mailings and special meetings. At one such event in London this spring, customers were invited to put questions to the company's chief pilot and chief executive. They also got to put their heads inside a refurbished fuel tank to examine the improvements, Mr. Lampl said. 
Air France, in a nod to civilized travel, planned to bolster the selection of wines poured on its Concorde flights, adding, among others, a 1993 Dom Perignon.

Intel and 2 Smaller Rivals Plan New Energy-Saving Chip Lines

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
As demand for computer chips continues to slow, the Intel Corporation and smaller rivals yesterday showed off prototypes of several new technologies intended to make chips run faster and use less electricity.
 The chip makers, which also included Advanced Micro Devices and Transmeta, gathered at an industry conference in San Jose, Calif., to seek early support for future generations of chips. Most of these will begin appearing in computers and small devices beginning next year. 
 Even in an economic downturn, "we're continuing to push our new designs full speed," said Mark K. Allen, president and chief executive of Transmeta, whose shares rose 16.6 percent after it announced plans to begin selling an innovative chip in the second half of next year.
Transmeta said the Crusoe TM6000 combined four chips into one, occupying one-third the space of the current line of Crusoe chips. The company, a technological leader in mobile-chip design that has fallen far behind Intel in market share, said the chips would run new generations of small yet powerful computers and hand-held devices. Its shares rose 32 cents yesterday, to $2.25; the 52-week high was $50.88.
Intel, the world's largest chip maker, gave updates on future versions of chips for laptops, desktop PC's and high-powered server systems that run data centers. Intel engineers said a new mobile chip, known today by the code name Banias and expected in 2003, would save energy by temporarily turning off parts of the chip that are not in use. The company also announced a future member of its Xeon chip family for servers, expected in 2003 as well.
Advanced Micro said it would soon begin selling a new version of its server chips, the Athlon MP, following a recently announced plan for labeling chips. It will market and price its 1.5 gigahertz Athlon MP 1800+ chip to compete with Intel's 1.7 gigahertz Xeon. The company also released technical details on its next generation of chips, known as the Hammer family.
Shares of Intel, which is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings today, fell 64 cents, to $24.38. Advanced Micro, which reports earnings tomorrow, fell 17 cents, to $10.23.

Anthrax Anxiety at Home, Signs of Progress Abroad

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
An anthrax-laced letter mailed to the Senate majority leader sent new waves of disquiet yesterday through Washington and the nation, and enforced the sense that the war with terrorists was being fought on two distinct fronts.
 On the military front, 10 days of bombing and missile attacks on Afghanistan appeared to be achieving their desired effect. A senior Taliban official surfaced in Pakistan appealing for a pause in the raids to allow moderate Taliban leaders to persuade Mullah Muhammad Omar, the hard-line supreme chief, to surrender Osama bin Laden. 

DANGER IN THE MAIL: The news on the home front was less reassuring. The letter to Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, was postmarked Trenton, N.J., as had been the letter sent to Tom Brokaw of NBC News that infected one of his aides. Mr. Daschle never touched the letter; aides who may have been exposed to it were being tested.
In the evening, the president of ABC News announced that a child of a freelance producer had been infected with skin anthrax. Yet there was still no clear evidence of who was behind the attacks -- or even if they were linked.
The administration seemed torn between trying to reassure an anxious public and issuing information promptly. Either way, it had little to go on.
That was reflected in the varying answers given to the question of whether terrorists were behind the letters with anthrax. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary: "I'm not going to engage in guesswork." President Bush: "I wouldn't put it past him," that is, Mr. bin Laden, "but we don't have hard evidence yet." Vice President Dick Cheney: "I think the only responsible thing for us to do is proceed on the basis that they could be linked."
If the information was sketchy, the fear was tangible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was kept busy not only with samples that tested positive, but also with many samples sent in from around the country by jittery recipients. Postal workers in many cities began wearing rubber gloves, and corporate mail rooms began taking precautions.
Cipro, an antibiotic specifically approved to treat anthrax, was suddenly in huge demand. Prescriptions in some communities were up 80 percent from six weeks ago and were certain to grow. That raised a new danger -- that patients who needed the drug for other ailments might not find any.
Bayer, the German company that holds the patent on Cipro through 2003, said the factory in Connecticut that produces the drug was working around the clock and had converted other machines to Cipro production. "The demand is changing by the minute," said Karen Dawes, senior vice president for marketing and sales for Bayer's United States division.
But the company would not reveal how much Cipro it produces. And the government had yet to ask Bayer to step up production, because it had yet to formally request more money to increase emergency stockpiles.

A PLEA: The reports from the war front were a potpourri of raids, intrigue and diplomacy.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrived in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, for talks with Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf. Also there, though not meeting with General Powell, was Mullah Abdul Wakil Muttawakil, the foreign minister of the Taliban, and representatives of the Northern Alliance fighting the Taliban.
According to Pakistani officials, Mullah Muttawakil came to argue for a bombing pause so that he and other purportedly moderate leaders could persuade the militants led by Mullah Omar to turn over Mr. bin Laden. The plea was relayed to General Powell, who had no immediate comment.
It was far from clear whether anyone could change Mullah Omar's mind -- and if they did, whether the Taliban could catch Mr. bin Laden, who commands formidable armed forces and has many hideouts.
But Pakistani officials say General Musharraf would like to encourage a split in the Taliban, so that if Mullah Omar is killed, there will be a faction that could be included in a coalition government.
In fact, Mullah Omar has been a primary target of the American and British bombing campaign, which has included a strike on his compound. Washington has made no secret about the efforts to eliminate him, arguing that he is the leader of an enemy army, and therefore not protected under the presidential order banning political assassinations.
Pentagon officials said daylight raids had increased significantly since Friday, with further evidence that the Taliban's air defenses had been seriously damaged. The officials said the bombing campaign was being extended past the original estimate of a week by the discovery of troops on the move, and the identification of new targets.
Refugees fleeing Kabul described an economy, weak in the best of times, now in a free-fall. Though there was food, there was no money to buy it with, the refugees said, and people were selling off their belongings to eat. SERGE SCHMEMANN

HEADLINE: Debt Downgrade For Ford, G.M. 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Standard & Poor's lowered the credit ratings of the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company as competition from overseas rivals reduced profit. 
 The Toyota Motor Corporation, the Nissan Motor Company and some other Asian automakers have followed the United States companies and have begun offering no-interest loans to encourage sales. 
 Standard & Poor's reduced long-term ratings on General Motors for the first time since 1993; S.& P. last took similar action involving Ford in April 2000.
Each automaker's grades were cut two levels, to BBB+ from A on a combined $318.4 billion in debt.
The automakers are offering interest-free loans to stem a drop in sales that accelerated after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, making it harder for Ford to rebound from two quarterly losses and General Motors to recover from a 65 percent profit decline.
Toyota, the third-largest automaker worldwide, began offering no-interest loans this month on 2001 and 2002 Corolla compact cars, 4Runner sport-utility vehicles and Tundra pickup trucks, a spokeswoman, Julie Alfonso, said. Nissan last week introduced similar terms on 2002 Sentra compacts and Frontier pickups.

Demand Outpaces Supply Of Drug to Treat Anthrax
As fear of anthrax increases and demand for the antibiotic Cipro skyrockets, Bayer, the German company that makes the drug in the United States, will probably take several months to produce the drug in the quantities the government wants.
 But public health officials warned that the soaring demand threatened to leave hospitals and drugstores without a drug that is also needed to treat other ailments. Page A1.

'Spokesmen' for Al Qaeda Issue New Threat via CNN

BYLINE:  By BILL CARTER and JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
In what appeared to be the first contact since the beginning of American attacks on Afghanistan between a reporter from an American news organization and representatives of the Al Qaeda organization of Osama bin Laden, a CNN correspondent, Nic Robertson, reported yesterday that he had met with two men identifying themselves as representatives of the group. 
 He said they carried new threats from Mr. bin Laden against both the United States and Britain. 
 At least one other news organization reached by a man claiming to be a representative of Al Qaeda declined to report their comments yesterday, saying it had reason to doubt the man's credibility.
Mr. Robertson and representatives of other Western news organizations, including The Associated Press, were escorted into Taliban- controlled territory last weekend, after accepting invitations from Taliban members to tour the sites of American bombing. 
Along with his account of what he had seen on the tour, Mr. Robertson filed several reports about a meeting that he held in a hotel in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, early yesterday morning. 
If the men were who they claimed to be, the meeting would be the first on record for an interview between an American television news organization and representatives of Al Qaeda since the Sept. 11 attacks. . The interview could be interpreted as a new step in the effort by Mr. Bin Laden and his organization to reach American news media, without going through an Arabic-language news network, Al Jazeera. Previously, Mr. bin Laden's statements have reached American television through videotapes delivered to the Al Jazeera office.
In his report, Mr. Robertson said the men saying they were representatives of Al Qaeda had a "special message" for the United States and Britain from Mr. bin Laden, that "if Afghanistan civilian houses were attacked by United States's bombers and any other allied bombers, there would be serious consequences."
CNN executives said Mr. Robertson had paraphrased the exact wording of the message from the men and had disguised some details of the meeting. American television news organizations have been increasingly cautious about reporting the words of Mr. bin Laden and his representatives, after a meeting last week among senior network executives and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser.
In his report, Mr. Robertson said the Al Qaeda representatives said they were winning the war and damaging American economic interests. He said the two men had been "presented to me by an individual whom I have met before on previous trips to Afghanistan."
The deputy international editor of The Associated Press, Nick Tatro, said the agency's reporter on the tour, Kathy Gannon, had a discussion at the hotel with at least one person who was "going around to the press representing themselves as a member of, or a spokesman for, a representative of Al Qaeda."
Mr. Tatro said: "She talked to the guy and asked him some questions, and it really didn't sound to her like it could be verified that this guy really was who he purported to be. So we decided to stay away from it."
Mr. Tatro could not say whether there was any connection between that man and the men who spoke with CNN.
The CNN report could leave the network open to criticism that it was being used as a mouthpiece for Mr. bin Laden. A senior executive at a competing network said, "There's a danger that you'll be seen as their messenger."
Among the American television news organizations, just CNN was invited by Taliban leaders to tour Afghan territory. "They pick and choose their friends," the senior executive at the competitor said.
But CNN's competitors said they would have gone on the tour had they been invited.
"Would I have wanted our correspondent to go in there?" asked John Moody, senior vice president of the Fox News Channel. "Yes. But of course you have to emphasize that you're never left alone and only getting to see what they want you to see."
Mr. Robertson did include qualifying comments in both his reports from inside Afghanistan. In his account of the scene of the American bomb attacks, he cautioned that he was only showing what the Taliban let him show. In his report on Mr. bin Laden's threat, he said, "There is no way to independently verify" the men's identities.
CNN executives said Mr. Robertson was among the network's most seasoned foreign correspondents, having worked in Afghanistan before Sept. 11. They said they were assured by Mr. Robertson that he had confidence in the contact who had introduced him to the men.
Mr. Robertson returned yesterday to Peshawar, Pakistan.
In his report Mr. Robertson said that the men "certainly seemed to be able to speak very clearly and precisely on bin Laden's part."
"And," he added, "they were convincing in telling me they had seen him in the last few days."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE MULLAHS; 
Taliban Envoy Talks of a Deal Over bin Laden

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
At secret talks in Pakistan today, a senior Taliban leader appealed for an American bombing pause in Afghanistan while moderates in the Taliban government sought to persuade the supreme Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, to agree to a formula for the handover of Osama bin Laden, officials in Pakistan disclosed tonight.
 The talks between Mullah Abdul Wakil Muttawakil, the Taliban's foreign minister, and senior Pakistani officials were held as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrived for a one-day visit here. The presence of Mullah Muttawakil, apparently without the approval of Mullah Omar, suggested that intensive American bombing, now entering its 10th day, has caused a policy split in the Taliban leadership. 
 The Afghan official's plea for a bombing pause was relayed tonight to Secretary Powell, Pakistani officials said. Upon arrival here, the secretary of state went almost immediately to a two-hour dinner at the American ambassador's residence with Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. Page B3. 
The account of the secret contacts came after reports circulated in Pakistan all day that Mullah Muttawakil had defected, and might not be returning to Afghanistan. Although Pakistani officials would not confirm that, they said his presence in Pakistan, and his call for a bombing pause, reflected a severe split developing in the ranks of senior Taliban officials as the impact of the bombing deepened. 
In his talks in Islamabad, the Taliban envoy suggested that the moderate Taliban camp he represents might be able to turn Taliban policy around if it had a period of calm, without American bombing, to rally other Taliban officials.
But after the talks here, it was not clear if the moderates intended to openly challenge Mullah Omar, who has steadfastly refused to hand over Mr. bin Laden, or if their proposal was part of an attempt to confuse the situation and get the bombing stopped without any definite progress on Mr. Bin Laden. 
Other reports indicated that Mullah Muttawakil's initiative had reached beyond Pakistan to the Arab states in the Persian Gulf. A report by a pro-government news agency in the gulf state of Dubai said that Mullah Muttwakil had "shown interest in securing the support of Muslim states" in the region to intercede with the United States on behalf of the Taliban. But Pakistan officials said another report, that Mullah Muttawakil had left Pakistan and defected to Dubai, appeared to be premature.
Secretary Powell's arrival completed an extraordinary gathering here of almost all the main players in the crisis that began with the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11. Their presence reflects a pressing need to define the political and diplomatic policy behind the bombing. At present no agreement exists on what sort of government might come to power if the radical Islamic Taliban were ousted. Ending the Taliban government has become a clear American war objective, but Pakistan opposes replacing it with the main rebel group, the Northern Alliance.
Officials in Pakistan said tonight that they hoped Secretary Powell's visit here might "compress" the political process, accelerating steps to form a post-Taliban government, and therefore clearing the way for American military commanders to pound Taliban front-line troops into disarray, defection or disintegration.
In addition to Secretary Powell and General Musharraf, a crucial ally of Washington's because of Pakistan's 1,400-mile border with Afghanistan, the cast gathered included Mullah Muttawakil, representatives of at least one faction of the Northern Alliance that has fought a protracted civil war with the Taliban, and a delegation representing the former Afghan king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, who now lives in Rome.
Whether the secret intrigue and high-level diplomacy would move the crisis closer to a resolution remained highly doubtful, American and Pakistani officials said.
One reason is that President Bush has said repeatedly that he will not negotiate, or even discuss, terms for the handover of Mr. bin Laden, who has been identified by the United States, along with his Al Qaeda terrorist organization, as the "prime suspect" in the Sept. 11 attacks.
A bombing pause, even one that allowed moderates to argue for Mr. bin Laden's handover, could be seen as compromise or weakness by the United States, those officials said.
Beyond that, the officials said, there were major reasons to doubt whether Mullah Muttawakil could shift Mullah Omar on the issue of handing over Mr. bin Laden, even assuming that the plea for a bombing pause was sincere.
Although Mullah Muttawakil, in his 30's, has long been considered one of the more worldly of the Islamic clerics who control the Taliban, specialists on the Taliban said he is not in Mullah Omar's inner circle of a half-dozen or so clerics, most of whom make their headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar. Mullah Muttawakil, although a Kandahari, oversees the foreign ministry from Kabul, the capital, 300 miles to the northeast.
It is not clear that even Mullah Omar or a successor as leader of the Taliban could hand over Mr. bin Laden if they decided to try.
The Saudi-born dissident has hundreds and possibly thousands of well-trained Arab fighters under his control inside Afghanistan, and, American officials believe, numerous, as yet unknown hideouts in Afghanistan's mountains. The Taliban have a core of hardened fighters who would likely continue to protect Mr. bin Laden even if ordered to seize him and hand him over.
Pakistan kept the visit of Mullah Muttawakil secret, but the officials who disclosed his presence said General Musharraf himself had passed on the call for a bombing pause to Mr. Powell.
They added that Pakistan's military ruler had not thrown his "full weight" behind the proposal because of President Bush's oft-repeated opposition to any negotiation over the demand for the surrender of Mr. bin Laden and others in Al Qaeda.
From the outset of the crisis, the Musharraf government, although sympathetic to the Taliban, has had its eye firmly fixed on the chance to revive Pakistan's traditional but recently frayed relationship with the United States, with all the economic, political and military benefits that would bestow.
Against this desire for a rapprochement with the United States, the military government has had to weigh the fact of extensive local support for the Taliban and anger at the bombing of a Muslim country. For those reasons, General Musharraf has made clear that he favors an early end to the bombing. The longer it goes on, the harder the domestic upheaval may be to control.
Officials familiar with the secret talks said that Mullah Muttawakil had met for 90 minutes earlier today with the head of Pakistan's military intelligence directorate, Lt. Gen. Ehsan ul-Haq.
The Afghan official argued that a bombing pause of at least two or three days was necessary if the Taliban moderates, mostly based in Kabul, were to be able to reach Kandahar.
Mullah Omar and most members of the Taliban's ruling council, or shura, are based in Kandahar, or were until Mullah Omar narrowly escaped a bombing raid that destroyed his home and reportedly killed at least two members of his family in the first night of the American attacks on Oct. 7.
Since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 1996, there have been many signs that the Islamic clerics who hold senior government posts in the capital are more moderate, or more worldly, than the clerics who form Mullah Omar's secluded inner circle in Kandahar.
The officials said Mullah Muttawakil had told General Ehsan , the Pakistani intelligence chief, that the American bombing had cut all communications between Kabul and Kandahar, and made driving or flying by helicopter between the two cities too dangerous.
Accounts of the bombing raids have suggested that American reconnaissance planes, including unmanned drones flying at low level, have picked up convoys of Taliban officials moving by road, exposing them to air attacks.

HEADLINE: Bush Administration Says G.O.P. Tax Cut Bill Goes Too Far 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
The Bush administration signaled today that it would not support the full package of tax cuts that Republicans will bring to the House floor this week as their plan for giving a boost to the weakened economy.
 Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said the tax cuts in the bill -- which would total nearly $100 billion for the current fiscal year and $159 billion over 10 years -- were more than the administration was seeking. 
 President Bush has called for tax cuts and spending of $60 billion to $75 billion for the current year, with most devoted to tax cuts. 
The House bill would provide more than $70 billion in tax cuts to companies this year, and nearly $29 billion to individuals. It has none of the Democratic spending proposals to help the unemployed or create jobs.
Speaking to FedEx employees in Memphis, Mr. O'Neill seemed to distance the administration from the bill and suggested that it represented a bit of political posturing by members of the president's own party.
He said the approval of the Republican-sponsored bill by the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday along partisan lines reflected a desire by lawmakers to vote for provisions popular with their constituents, knowing that not all of those provisions would make it into law.
"Part of what you saw on Friday last week was show business," Mr. O'Neill said. After Mr. O'Neill's statement was reported by news agencies, a Treasury Department spokesman said that Mr. O'Neill had been "very pleased with the process" started by the Ways and Means Committee last week. 
Like the administration, Republicans in Congress want any stimulus plan to focus on tax cuts. But administration officials have also said they want to keep the package within limits set out by Mr. Bush and to win bipartisan support. Democrats said last week that Republicans had endangered the prospects of a compromise by pushing ahead on their own. 
In his remarks today, Mr. O'Neill suggested that the administration viewed the House bill largely as an effort by House Republicans to set out a negotiating position with the Democratic-controlled Senate and the White House.
"By my reckoning, what they did is more than we'd like," said Mr. O'Neill, referring to the House bill. "So we have some work to do."
Among the administration's tasks is to restart bipartisan negotiations in the Senate.
Democrats are demanding that any stimulus package focus on helping people who lost their jobs after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.

HEADLINE: Tightening of Border Pinches Local Economy 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

DATELINE: SAN YSIDRO, Calif., Oct. 15 

 BODY:
Tight new security restrictions at crossings with Mexico are choking the economic life out of border towns in California and the Southwest, congressmen from the region say.
 Some lawmakers have begun pleading with the Bush administration for low-interest loans or grants until the crisis subsides, calling the situation a "state of emergency" comparable to that posed by a hurricane or an earthquake. 
 Since the Immigration and Naturalization Service bolstered its presence on the border after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the crowds managing to cross, in the face of long waits, have thinned so much that business in some California border towns has fallen by 60 percent, local officials say. 
That has been devastating to small-business owners in places like San Ysidro, home of the busiest border crossing in the world. Many stores here previously earned 90 percent of their income from the tens of thousands of Tijuana residents who once visited every day, searching for the sneakers, suits and blue jeans that are often harder to find at home. 
"Sure, let's be careful at the border, but let's not kill off the border economy," said United States Representative Bob Filner, a San Diego Democrat. "Nobody thought through the implications of all this security, but there are incredible ripple effects."
In a letter to President Bush late last week, members of Congress from California, Texas and Arizona said they recognized a need for strict scrutiny at the border, but challenged the wisdom of imposing it without enough inspectors to keep traffic flowing.
"Those who live and work along our international borders are feeling the change in our way of life like no other Americans," the letter said. "Our border communities are suffering and need help now."
Just a few months ago, towns dotting California's border cheered the tighter enforcement that accompanied an I.N.S. crackdown on illegal immigration, happy for the peace and calm it brought to an area long frustrated with throngs of migrant workers.
Now many businesses have the opposite complaint, and grumble that the border has been battened down so tightly that legal immigrants are being turned away in large numbers or simply never try to venture across.
Before Sept. 11, border officials had whittled the wait to enter the United States to 20 minutes or so, less time than it often takes to catch a bus in San Diego or Los Angeles. Little more than a month later, the wait has grown to three hours or more, and looks likely to remain that way now that the immigration service has begun running background checks on all pedestrians. Hoping to speed things up, the I.N.S. has reassigned officers who usually investigate expired visas or hunt down criminals to stand in traffic, peering into cars that slowly creep up to customs checkpoints.
I.N.S. officials privately worry that shifting these investigators, already in short supply, could impede the agency's ability to track down immigrants who, much as some of the suspected Sept. 11 hijackers did, violate the terms of their visas.
The reassignment is temporary, the I.N.S. says, lasting only until the agency can obtain more money from Congress to triple the number of border inspectors. Congressmen from California to Texas support that financing request as a way of expediting crossings. But should it fail, immigration officials say, they have no intention of softening security for the sake of easing traffic.
"We will continue to keep the border as our focus," said Kimberly Weissman, an I.N.S. spokeswoman.
Hours before dawn, as car fumes mix with the morning mist, the lines already stretch back more than a mile here in San Ysidro. Where once there were hardly ever any bicycles, now there are more than 1,000 a day, cutting through the congestion in a morning ritual that immigration officials have dubbed the "Tour de France."
Those who brave the waits, I.N.S. officials say, do so because they have to: they are parents shuttling their children to and from school, for example, or workers with a clock to punch.
Even illegal immigrants have virtually stopped trying to get across, hidden in car trunks. At the start of September, the I.N.S. caught dozens each day here. Now that word of the thorough inspections has spread, no more than a few each week are found.
The difficult border crossings have made for an economic experience unlike that elsewhere in the nation. Although retailers everywhere worried that consumers, fearful of venturing outside and lacking confidence in the economy, would rein in their shopping habits after Sept. 11, that has largely not been the case.
On average, chain stores have seen their business drop by less than 1 percent, analysts say, and traffic in the nation's malls has fallen about 5 percent -- a worry for stock watchers but wishful thinking for many businesses in California border towns.
In the 39 years since it opened, Raya's Clothing store, only a few miles from Mexico in Chula Vista, has been used to having dozens of customers a day. Today it had only one. "Thank God he bought something," said Rosemary Raya, the owner's sister. "Everybody's hurting."
Tony McCune, who sells, fixes and stocks parts for cars in National City, a 10-minute drive from the border, considers himself lucky because his business has dropped only 30 percent in the last month. Still, about a quarter of his employees live in Mexico and set out to cross the border every day, hoping to make it into work before their shifts end, much less before they begin.
"It's just ridiculous," Mr. McCune said. "They want to come, they're used to coming, and we depend on them. And now they're having a huge amount of trouble."

HEADLINE: A Nation Challenged 

 BODY:
 The Anthrax Investigation

NEW CASES -- The nation's anthrax scare widened as a new infection was reported in New York City and a letter containing the deadly substance was opened on Capitol Hill. President Bush said there may be a link to Osama bin Laden or his allies. A1

THE DOMESTIC FRONT -- For the Bush administration, a week of bombing and missile attacks on Afghanistan have proceeded with dispatch and, at least so far, success. But the war at home has been much harder. A1

THE FOCUS SHIFTS -- In a significant shift in their thinking, federal authorities say they are now investigating the possibility that followers of Osama bin Laden were behind the anthrax cases around the nation. B5

Coping With the Threat

MAKING THE ANTIBIOTIC -- As demand for the antibiotic Cipro skyrockets, Bayer, the German company that makes the drug in the United States, says it has only begun to increase its production and will probably take months to produce the drug in the quantities the government wants. A1

THE REACTION -- Most of the country now knows that Cipro is one of the drugs that can be used to treat people infected with anthrax. This has led to the wildest run on pharmacies since Viagra. B10

MAIL SLOWED -- The mail moved more gingerly than usual as postal workers and private companies adjusted their work habits and mail handlers demonstrated a higher degree of caution and concern. B1

THE POST OFFICE -- Health authorities in Florida said they had found anthrax spores in the main post office of Boca Raton, which serves the company where an employee died of the disease earlier this month. It is the first time anthrax has been discovered in the postal system. B7

THE FIRST VICTIM -- Neighbors in Florida remember Robert Stevens, who died of anthrax 10 days ago, as a man who repaired children's bicycles and rescued feral cats. B7

DEALING WITH FEAR -- Whoever has been sending anthrax through the mails presumably was trying to sow fear around the country. In Louisville, Ky., the results are mixed. B6

SCARE IN BERLIN -- The offices of the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, were sealed off after a letter containing suspicious white powder was delivered. B6

GERMAN POLITICS -- Chancellor Schroder's coalition looked a little shakier, after a senior Green Party official called on the United States to interrupt its bombing of Afghanistan so food could be sent there. A10

CHILD INFECTED -- A seven-month-old son of an ABC News producer in New York has been infected with anthrax, symptoms of which showed up last month after a birthday party. B1

The Diplomatic Effort

SECRET TALKS -- A Taliban leader said at secret talks in Pakistan that moderates in the Afghan government would try to negotiate the handover of Osama bin Laden if the United States stopped bombing for two or three days, officials in Pakistan said. A1

POWELL IN PAKISTAN -- Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrived in the Pakistan capital, Islamabad, as the Bush administration undertakes its first high-level discussions with South Asian leaders on the political future of Afghanistan. B3

TENSIONS MOUNT -- Indian forces pounded Pakistani posts across the dividing line in Jammu and Kashmir, a land both countries claim, with heavy mortar, rocket and machine-gun fire. B3

MESSAGE FROM IRAN -- In a sign of growing cooperation with the United States in its war against Afghanistan, Iran has sent a secret message to the Bush administration agreeing to rescue any American military personnel in distress in its territory. B1

The Doomed Flights

THE TAPES -- Transcripts of the communications between the hijackers of American Airlines Flight 11 and controllers on the ground reveal the the first hint of the horror of Sept. 11. A1

In the Cross Hairs

SPECIAL FORCES -- The Pentagon, acknowledging for the first time that special operations forces have been dispatched for combat in the war on terror, ordered the AC-130 gunship used by those forces into the skies over Afghanistan. B4

TALIBAN LEADER -- Since its air campaign began, the Pentagon has been trying to strike Mullah Muhammad Omar, American officials and leaders of the Afghan regime said. A1

THE OPPOSITION -- The deputy defense minister of the Northern Alliance says that rebel troops have advanced to the outskirts of the strategic city of Mazar-i-Sharif, setting the stage for a decisive battle for control of northern Afghanistan. B4

LATEST WEAPON -- An American bomber dropped Washington's latest weapon against Afghanistan's radicalized Taliban leadership: leaflets. B4

THE MONEY TRAIL -- A 33-year-old immigrant who has emerged as a key suspect in the terror attacks received $15,000 in unexplained money transfers from Germany in August. B8

THE MEDIA -- A CNN correspondent reported that two men identifying themselves as representatives of the Al Qaede organization carried new threats from Osama bin Laden against the United States and Britain. B10

THE REFUGEES -- People who have fled the Afghan capital, Kabul, say a growing number of families are struggling to pay for food. B2

MIDEAST PEACE -- Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, meeting in London, said that the terror attacks last month made the pursuit of a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians more urgent. A8

Business

INSURANCE PROPOSAL -- The Bush administration proposed to pay the vast majority of losses to the insurance industry from any terrorist attacks next year and to cap the industry's liability at $12 billion. C1

CALL AHEAD -- Responding to lower passenger demand since the terror attacks, United Airlines is carrying out the biggest overhaul it has ever made in its flight schedule. C1

INDUSTRY SUFFERS -- The direct-marketing industry, which sold about $528 billion worth of goods and services through the mail last year, is worried it may face a crisis resulting from the nationwide increase in cases of anthrax exposure through letters. C4

HEADLINE: Recruiters Fawn Over Ex-Airline Employees 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS

 BODY:
When Traci McCoy, a former flight attendant for Continental Airlines, walked into a company-sponsored job fair for former employees this month in Newark, she braced herself for rejection. Instead, she encountered prospective employers so eager to meet with her that one practically ripped her resume out of her hands.
 "I didn't know what the job market would be like for someone like me," said Ms. McCoy, who is based in San Antonio and took a voluntary leave of absence in September after three years with the company. "I mean, who, outside of the airline industry, is looking to hire a flight attendant?" 
 Plenty of people, it seems. Although unemployment is creeping up as the economy dips into a recession, companies in some industries that still suffer from labor shortages, including health care, financial services and waste management, are desperately seeking talent among the more than 100,000 airline employees expected to be laid off after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
At the Newark job fair, Ms. McCoy fielded offers for interviews from a representative of Primerica, a financial services company looking for financial planners, and a health care company with openings for home health aides.
Although their job hunts are just beginning, laid-off workers have every reason to be upbeat, specialists say. "These folks are literally being hunted down by employers in fields that have shortages," said Robert Morgan, president of the Human Capital Consulting Group at Spherion, a staffing concern in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "There are a lot of people with college degrees in the airline industry who have great customer service skills and are looking to change careers. That makes them hot prospects."
One employer eager to tap into this new pool of workers is David McClain, a recruiter for Ford Motor, who said he was "salivating" at the prospect of hiring former airline mechanics and retraining them to become automotive technicians. 
"The perception is that auto mechanics are just a bunch of grease monkeys, but that's not what we're looking for at all," said Mr. McClain, who estimated that the auto industry had a shortage of about 60,000 technicians. "Vehicles today are very complex, and it takes someone with a significant amount of aptitude to work on them."
Mr. McClain says airline mechanics have many of the same diagnostic skills as those who work on automobiles, and they already have their own tools, otherwise a major expense. With six months of training, he says, they "could be up and running."
Former airline mechanics and flight attendants are not the only workers in demand. At the Continental job fair, which was attended by more than 50 prospective employers outside of the airline industry, one recruiter, P.H.C. Services Ltd., a home health care company in Cliffside Park, N.J., was seeking laid-off ramp agents, security workers and ticket agents for positions as health aides. "Most airline workers already have good instincts with people, which is something we're desperate for," said Mary Ellen Weinel, a P.H.C. office manager.
The labor shortage in home health care, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics says is one of the 10 fastest-growing fields in the country, is what is prompting Nancy Roof, a ticket agent for Midway Airlines, to consider falling back on her former career as a licensed practical nurse. Ms. Roof, of Morrisville, N.C., lost her job when the airline shut down on Sept. 12. She is sending her resume to several health care companies, including one in Durham that is seeking medical assistants to perform health evaluations on plasma donors. "I haven't worked in a hospital since the 1960's," said Ms. Roof, who wants to take a refresher course in practical nursing. "But the job opportunities in this area are just too good to ignore."
Another Midway employee, David Ramesh, is receiving job offers in North Carolina's restaurant industry, which is courting workers laid off not only by the airlines but also by dot-coms and textile makers.
Mr. Ramesh, a former hub manager for the airline who has been in the travel industry since 1990, said he was "panicked" when he lost his job last month. He and his wife are now without health insurance and are expecting a baby in December. But because of a surge in openings of chain restaurants in the Raleigh-Durham area, he says, he has been inundated with offers and is considering management positions at a Shoney's and a Pizza Hut. "They might not be glamorous, but they're hiring," he said.
Another fast-growing industry, waste hauling, is also taking notice of the new talent pool. Jimmy LaValley, a recruiter for Waste Management in Houston, says he has attended two airline-sponsored job fairs in Houston so far this month. "We brought back 400 resumes, and we're wading through them right now," he said.
Some airline workers are not looking back. Ms. McCoy said she knew it was time to switch careers when, on a flight from Newark to Toronto a week after the terrorist attacks, she sat in a serving galley contemplating what she would do in the event of a hijacking. "I was brewing hot coffee, and I imagined myself throwing it into someone's face," she said. "That got me a little freaked out."
And Kevin Mason, who worked at Continental for six and a half years, said he saw "a lot of jobs that were better than Continental" at the Newark job fair.
Other laid-off workers, though, say airplanes are in their blood and are hoping to find their way back into the industry. That might take a while, though. Cindy Colasurdo, a pilot based in Tom's River, N.J., who was laid off in September by Continental, plans to look for a sales clerk position at the local shopping center for the holidays.
But she hopes to be rehired as an airline pilot within the next few years. "I'm praying this is temporary," said Ms. Colasurdo, who obtained her pilot's license in 1993. "I was born to fly, not work in a mall."

HEADLINE: Ballet Theater Appoints New Director 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
The American Ballet Theater today named a veteran arts administrator as its new executive director after two years of board and staff resignations and backstage furor that rivaled any onstage drama.
 Appointed to the post is Wallace Chappell, 60, the director of the Hancher Auditorium at the University of Iowa since 1986, who has also held ranking staff positions with the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, the Alliance Theater in Atlanta and the Repertory Theater of St. Louis. 
 He replaces Louis G. Spisto, who resigned under pressure in July after completing two years of a three-year contract.
Gedalio Grinberg, the new chairman of the Ballet Theater board, who was one of four longtime board members who resigned in the last days of Mr. Spisto's tenure and returned with his departure, described Mr. Chappell as having "a very big dedication." 
"Wally understands the ballet very well," Mr. Grinberg said. "He seems very knowledgeable about how companies work, and as a presenter he has a good sense of how the numbers work. He also understood that working with the board -- with all the members -- was important." 
The board, Mr. Grinberg said, was united now. He added, "We have only one thing in mind: American Ballet Theater." He said that Mr. Chappell signed a three-year contract at a salary "slightly less" than the $259,000-a-year that Mr. Spisto received.
Mr. Chappell, who will work closely with the company's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, has discussed with Mr. McKenzie and the board the bruised feelings of many staff members after the tumult of the summer. "I haven't heard the word 'heal' used by the board and Kevin, but I have heard 'calm,' " he said. " 'Calm things down. Settle things down.' I sense that there isn't anything that can't be handled with very good, clear, direct, thorough, open-handed communication." 
Mr. Spisto's background was in orchestra management. Mr. Chappell, a finalist in Ballet Theater's search for a new executive director in 1999, has had extensive experience in dance, in building audiences and in organizing multi-institutional commissions that brought dances by established and new choreographers to Hancher and theaters around the country. The commissions included the Joffrey Ballet's controversial "Billboards" and its production of "The Nutcracker."
Mr. McKenzie said that Mr. Chappell's experience in commissioning as well as presenting dance had been a major reason for the choice of Mr. Chappell, a graduate of Dartmouth College with a master's degree in Asian dance and theater from the University of Hawaii. "Basically presenters have to deal with putting the show on and making sure it sells out," Mr. McKenzie said. "So they don't tend to be as adventurous as Wally." 
Mr. Chappell said that one focus at Ballet Theater would be to attempt to build the company's endowment of $4.3 million. "If I had a choice right now, that would be my first priority," he said. "I'm not sure we have that choice to make. I think the economy's going to be tough for a while." Donations and ticket-buying at the 2,500-seat Hancher Auditorium in Iowa City had been strong, he said, but were "very last-minute and very hard to predict" following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. 
Other important aspects of his new job, he said, would be to free Mr. McKenzie for creative work and to produce new dances, in part through establishment of a larger version of the national network he put together at Hancher. "I want to celebrate the classics, but I want to move ahead, too," said Mr. Chappell, whose favorite choreographers include William Forsythe and Jiri Kylian. "We're looking for new choreographers and exciting new work, particularly work that will attract a younger audience." 
Mr. Chappell, who will begin working full time at his new job in mid-November following Ballet Theater's season at City Center, said a major priority would be to address unhappiness at the company. Mr. Spisto left the organization in reasonably good financial health. Ballet Theater, whose annual budget is $28.5 million, has $13 million in assets, a $2.7 million cash reserve and a projected $50,000 surplus for this year. 
But Mr. Spisto's management style was perceived by many in the company as arbitrary. One longtime staff member lodged an age and sex discrimination complaint with New York State after she was fired in April. That complaint, not yet settled, brought public attention to the disarray at Ballet Theater, which eventually resulted in the departures or firings of 30 of the company's 40 staff members as well as dissension among members of the board.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
Reality Check, Please, For Cult Wines

BYLINE:  By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
RALPH HERSOM hasn't sold one in a month. Rocco DiSpirito doesn't order them any more. Tim Kopec sells them because, he says, he has to, and Piero Selvaggio said his sales have slowed to a crawl. 
 Has the California cult wine phenomenon run its course? 
 California cult wines are very good, extremely rare wines, almost all cabernet-based, produced by small wineries mostly in or near the Napa Valley. They sell -- or did until recently -- for as much as $2,000 a bottle. There is -- or was until recently -- a group of collectors, a very small group, fanatically eager to pay those prices. Since small groups of fanatics are often called cults, these wines came to be known as cult wines. 
Inflamed by the wines' ecstatic reviews, collectors bid their prices to dizzying heights, then bought them, not necessarily to drink but to own -- along with the bragging rights that went with them. The wines were, and still are, sold mostly by mail order. There are actually lists of people waiting to get on the cult wine mailing lists. A few bottles find their way into restaurants, which is about the only place other than auction houses where less fortunate wine fans will find them -- less fortunate but with deep pockets. Restaurants, too, pay through the nose for cult wines. That's the way it's been, but things are changing. 
Recent events have taken their toll on the greedy excesses of the 1990's. There is the faltering economy, of course. And there are the national tragedies that have unsettled everyone. Throwing money at wildly overpriced wines seems less exciting than it did only a few weeks ago.
Mr. Hersom is the wine director at Le Cirque 2000, Mr. DiSpirito is the chef and a co-owner at Union Pacific and Mr. Kopec is the wine director at Veritas, three prominent New York City restaurants all noted for their extensive wine lists. Mr. Selvaggio is the owner of Valentino, a Santa Monica, Calif., restaurant also known for its wines.
"They just haven't been selling," Mr. Hersom said. "People still want good wine, but they are going for lower prices and they are buying French wines." Mr. Hersom noted that he has exceptional California wines available at one-third the cost of the cult wines. He cited Chateau Montelena and Shafer Hillside Select, which he does not consider cult wines. "Interest in the cult wines dropped off with the collapse of the dot-coms," Mr. Selvaggio said. "Once the 25-year-old millionaires could no longer afford them, it was over." 
Noel Cullen is the wine director at Smith & Wollensky in Las Vegas, a popular wine destination. "We sell a ton of California wine," he said, "but when the high rollers come in to celebrate, they go for Bordeaux; Haut-Brion or Petrus."
Depending on what you read or whom you talk to, the number of cult wineries can go as high as 12. I'd put it at eight: Araujo, Bryant Family, Colgin, Dalla Valle, Grace Family, Harlan, Screaming Eagle, all in the Napa Valley, and Williams Selyem in Northern Sonoma. Others might include Marcassin, Dunn, Ridge and Shafer.
The Napa Valley wineries, including Dunn and Shafer, are known for their cabernet and cabernet blends. Williams Selyem is famous for pinot noir, and Marcassin, also in Sonoma, for its chardonnay. Ridge, whose most famous wine is Monte Bello cabernet, is south of San Francisco, near San Jose. 
Most of the cult wineries are newcomers, 10 years old or less. Araujo is 10 years old, but its signature wine comes from the famed Eisele Vineyard, which it owns. For a quarter of a century, Joseph Phelps Vineyards made its premium cabernet from Eisele grapes. Grace Family Vineyards has been making wine since 1985, and its grapes were used by Caymus Vineyards for several years before that.
California cult wines are rare because so little of them is made. Grace Family Vineyards makes less than 150 cases a year; Screaming Eagle makes about 500 cases, Araujo about 2,000, Bryant Family about 600.
Most of the cult wineries sell directly by mailing list, reserving a small quantity for restaurants and for the winery's own uses. While the mail-order prices have been climbing -- some to $175 a bottle -- they cannot compare with what the wines bring at auctions: four or five, even 10 times more.
Much of the cult wine that turns up in auctions comes directly from the mail-order customers, who are eager to unload the wine at inflated prices. Many keep one bottle for prestige and sell the rest to cover purchases of other more reasonably priced wines. The auction prices are said to reflect collector enthusiasm when, in fact, many of the auction buyers are restaurateurs and retailers looking to enhance their own stocks.
"It's the people in the middle who make money on these wines," Mr. Selvaggio said. "They are the ones driving the prices up." At Valentino, the 1995 Screaming Eagle is on the wine list for $1,900 a bottle and the 1996 Harlan Estate for $500. 
"We have to have these wines on our list," Mr. Kopec at Veritas said resignedly. "It's a question of prestige."
Mr. Hersom, who also feels compelled to offer them, is worried about their future. "With Bordeaux, you know what you're getting," he said. "You know what you'll have 5, 10, 20 years down the road. Buy two cases of Bryant Family -- if you can find them -- and no one knows how they are going to age. I buy when they are offered to me, but I wonder, should I be paying $2,500, $3,600 a case for some fancy cabernet or should I invest it in Bordeaux?"
At Le Cirque 2000, the 1994 Araujo, Eisele Vineyard, sells for $510; the Colgin, Herb Lamb Vineyard, goes for $600 and the 1993 Screaming Eagle for $1,910.
How much the cult wineries will be affected by the economic downturn is difficult to predict. Their prices are generally in line with larger producers of fine wine like Robert Mondavi Winery, Beringer and Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, which charge up to $125 for their top-of-the-line wines. In other words, casual buyers need not look for any notable price breaks. It remains to be seen, though, how many of their mail-order customers will remain loyal if they can no longer double or triple their investment at auctions or in private deals.
Old-timers in the wine trade liked to say that if you can't sell the stuff, you can always drink it. For many of the current crop of speculators, drinking their wine is not an option. Looking back on the excesses in the wine market in recent years, Danny Meyer, an owner of Union Square Cafe and other New York restaurants, compared the insecure new wine drinker of the 1990's with the insecure new restaurantgoer in the 1970's. "They both figured that the more expensive it was the better it was," he said. "Maybe we can get back to enjoying wine for the way it tastes and not for how much it costs."

HEADLINE: More Indications That W.T.O. Will Move Talks to Singapore 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Indications are growing quite strong that the World Trade Organization's conference in November, meant to start a new round of global trade talks and formally accept China as a member, will be relocated to Singapore from Doha, Qatar, because of fears about security in the Middle East.
 But because of political sensitivities, trade officials appear to be holding off announcing a move until the Qatar government can take the first step, by formally withdrawing its offer to play host to the conference. Qatar's cabinet will meet in Doha on Wednesday. 
 A report by the Kyodo news service in Tokyo, citing unnamed Japanese Foreign Ministry officials, said a move to Singapore was certain. Concerns have been raised repeatedly, but unofficially, by trade envoys since the Sept. 11 terror attacks.
The issue is so touchy that few want to address it publicly, least of all the United States, which uses military bases in Qatar. Today's session of the trade group's General Council avoided the topic until it was raised briefly in a question. Afterward, the Canadian envoy, Sergio Marchi, said, "It's fair to say that we'll see something in the days to come."
After the mass demonstrations and street violence at the W.T.O. conference in Seattle, Qatar was the only country to volunteer to play host this year. "There has to be a kind of face-saving for them," said one W.T.O. official, referring to Qatar. "Otherwise, we will have the whole Arab world against us."
Delegates to a lower-level gathering in Singapore last weekend discussed a move, and some envoys came away with the strong impression that American delegates would not be going to Doha. "Nobody wanted to pull the plug, but everyone is scared," one American official said.
Both Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, and Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner, have called for the meeting to go ahead on the scheduled dates, Nov. 9-13.

Terror, Excuses And Explanations

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein 

 BODY:
When Judith Rizzo, deputy chancellor of the New York City schools, said the terrorist attacks demonstrated the importance of teaching about Muslim cultures, she was denounced by Lynne Cheney, wife of the vice president. Ms. Cheney, former chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, charged Dr. Rizzo with implying that terrorism was America's fault, a result of our failure to understand Islam.
 And when some professors at a City College teach-in claimed that American foreign policy was responsible for the attacks, Matthew Goldstein, chancellor of the City University, denounced "those who seek to justify or make lame excuses" with arguments "based on ideological or historical circumstances." 
 Still, Dr. Goldstein and Ms. Cheney would surely agree that scholars should explore the ideological or historical context of the attacks. That is what we want our professors and teachers to do, especially in the heat of crisis. Not all scholars will be careful in their analyses, and some may be downright stupid. But that's the price paid for open debate.
If Dr. Goldstein's reaction, and that of Ms. Cheney, are interpreted (perhaps wrongly) as discouraging inquiry into the attackers' motivation, they will be of no help to our security, which ultimately depends on understanding terrorism's causes so we can know how to reduce its likelihood. Teachers and those who monitor them need to distinguish between excusing horrific acts and explaining them. That is not always easy, but we manage it in other contexts.
For example, history teachers explain that mistakes of America and its allies contributed to Nazism's rise after World War I, when the victorious powers insisted on reparations so onerous that Germany was left in ruins.
"American History" by Donald A. Ritchie, a textbook used by many eighth graders nationwide, says that "heavy war debts and rising unemployment caused great discontent among the German people and led directly to the rapid growth of two antidemocratic parties -- the Communist Party and the Nazi Party."
Nobody thinks such explanations excuse or justify Nazism. Indeed, analyses of earlier policy mistakes shaped American actions after World War II: the Marshall Plan for European economic recovery was intended to avoid repeating errors that contributed to, but did not excuse, Hitler's rise.
Teachers distinguish explanation from excuse in addressing domestic policy as well. In studying urban race riots of the 1960's, children learn that police brutality, unemployment and discrimination created conditions from which violence erupted. The "American History" text recalls that President Lyndon B. Johnson commissioned a report on urban violence that "laid responsibility for the ghettos at the feet of white society."
Having given that explanation, no teacher should be accused of suggesting that rioting ought to be tolerated or perpetrators left unpunished.
Young people have to learn to distinguish explanation from excuse in criminal justice policy, too. Experts know that victims of child abuse, for example, are more likely to abuse their own children. For most Americans, this implies not that child abusers should be treated with leniency, only that addressing the causes of abuse is needed to prevent it.
In the case of Hitler, or Osama bin Laden, the line between explaining and excusing should be apparent to all. So the last thing we should want is to inhibit professors and teachers from exploring Islamic fundamentalism, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the politics of oil, the role of authoritarianism in the Persian Gulf region, how American mass culture is marketed internationally or anything else that might help to understand and prevent recurring terrorism.
Ms. Cheney may be right in suggesting that there is no sense in which terrorism is "our fault." Perhaps there are no policies the nation has followed that we would want, upon reflection, to change. If, as some have said, the attackers reacted only to our culture and freedoms, then policy makers can get little help from academic inquiry into the motivation. But teachers should be encouraged to explore whether there are specific policies that may give rise to terrorism, without being accused of undermining patriotism and national unity. Students who are not taught to question our polices will be ill prepared as adults to improve on them.
In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair had a campaign slogan: "Tough on crime. Tough on the causes of crime." He meant that his government would be as determined to correct the social policy failures that contribute to crime as it would be to punish offenders.
That is a good model for discussing terrorism. The government should be tough on terrorism, but professors should explore how we can be equally tough on its causes. If they don't, it is unlikely that others will.

HEADLINE: Small Business, Badly Damaged 

BYLINE:  By Fred P. Hochberg; Fred P. Hochberg was deputy administrator and acting administrator of the Small Business Administration from 1998 to 2001.

 BODY:
Radiating out from Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan, thousands of offices and storefronts are still boarded up. Computer terminals and cash registers are silent; merchandise sits on shelves thick with dust. The city estimates that 14,632 businesses in the area close to the World Trade Center were destroyed, damaged or significantly disrupted by the terrorist destruction of Sept. 11. The financial loss to these businesses is in the billions.
 They are restaurants and clothing stores, legal offices, accounting and brokerage firms, businesses engaged in international trade. With the 50,000 people who worked in the World Trade Center no longer there as customers and clients, some of the owners may need to relocate. Others will want to stay on, becoming a part of the neighborhood's renewal. Some fear their livelihoods are lost forever. But too few, no matter what their plans, are aware of federal disaster-relief loans that may already be within reach. Not only these property owners, but state, city and federal officials, too, need to learn quickly about the government programs that could help, become aggressive in using them, and find ways to make them effective for New York. 
 Before Sept. 11, few enterprises had business-interruption insurance and many didn't know it exists; only a third of the small business losses are likely to be covered by private insurance. It is to help fill this gap that the Small Business Administration issues disaster-relief loans. But as of Oct. 15, only 1,800 businesses affected by the terrorist attack had sought S.B.A. loans, and only about 340 loans had been approved. Nearly 12,000 businesses that have requested applications have not even submitted them.
Part of the problem is the application process, which can take up to three weeks to complete -- far too long for a business on the brink. The process should be expedited.
Also, as New York's senators propose, the eligibility requirements for S.B.A. loans could be made more flexible, so that mid-sized firms, nonprofit organizations and companies involved with trading and banking could be covered. The requirement of a minimum of 250 employees in order to receive more than $1.5 million in disaster loans should be reconsidered, as well, to offset the uniquely high cost of doing business in Manhattan.
More could be done. Where the S.B.A. now asks recipients to begin repayment within five months, it might extend the grace period to one or two years, and it could reduce the interest rate to a negligible amount on the first $100,000 in loans.
Of course, it will require more than loans to get back to business as usual. New York also needs direct aid. The $75 billion economic stimulus package that President Bush has proposed may provide a needed boost to the national economy, helping New York along with all the other states. The $40 billion Congress has authorized in response to the attacks will include some unspecified amount for New York, as well as help for Virginia and Pennsylvania and about $20 billion for national security and military needs. But the economy of New York has been especially hard hit.
One way the federal government could provide more help is by directing more of the $200 billion worth of goods and services it buys each year to New York's struggling businesses -- from its garment manufacturers to its boutique financial service firms. Right now some 40 other states get more of these contracting dollars per resident than New York does. New York should move to the head of the line. In the bidding on federal contracts, the government already gives preference to disadvantaged areas across America; no one doubts that New York is one of those areas today. New York could also be designated a special zone for enterprise and development, directing millions of dollars to businesses throughout the city.
And the federal government could also lead the way in bringing visitors back to the city. Government agencies hold off-site conferences and training seminars for thousands of federal employees. Scheduling these events in New York would provide a strong stimulus to our ailing hospitality industry. Just as important, it would represent a powerful vote of confidence in our city.

HEADLINE: Production At Factories Declined 1% Last Month 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Industrial production fell 1 percent in September, the 12th consecutive monthly decline, the government said today. The series of declines is the longest since World War II.
 Many economists have said that the attacks of Sept. 11 pushed a slowing economy into recession as business was hurt by a halt in air travel and heightened security at borders and as consumers chose to stay home instead of go shopping. That forced manufacturers to idle plants after showing signs that their slump was close to an end. 
 "Prior to Sept. 11, it looked like manufacturers had gotten inventories back in line with sales," said Mark Vitner, an economist at First Union in Charlotte. "Now sales have weakened again, and that is leading to another round of cutbacks in orders and production."
The report today showed industry operated at 75.5 percent of capacity in September, down from 76.4 percent in August. September's rate was the lowest since 74.8 percent in June 1983, when the United States was coming out of recession.
The September decline in production at factories, mines and utilities followed a drop of 0.7 percent in August, the Federal Reserve said.
The string of declines is the longest since 1944 through 1945, when the manufacture of armaments dwindled with the close of World War II.
The Fed's report showed that manufacturing activity, which accounts for 90 percent of industrial production, fell 1.1 percent in September after a 0.9 percent decline in August. Production of autos and parts alone dropped 3.6 percent in September.
Production of business equipment, including computers, semiconductors and communications equipment, fell for the 11th time in 12 months. Home electronics production decreased 3 percent to a level that was 19 percent lower than it was a year ago.
Fed policy makers are likely to cut interest rates a 10th time this year when they meet three weeks from today.
"Monetary policy has been and will continue to be responsive to rapidly changing circumstances," the vice chairman of the Fed, Roger Ferguson, told the Bond Market Association in New York today.
Factories had cut production this year to reduce stockpiles after excess supplies that built up in mid-2000 showed few signs of dwindling. Before Sept. 11, their efforts appeared to pay off.
Inventories dropped to $1.18 trillion in August, the lowest level since May 2000, suggesting that factories had room to begin increasing production if demand held up.

HEADLINE: Banks' Profit Up On Lower Costs 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
The Bank One Corporation, Wells Fargo and Company and other banks had higher third-quarter profit as costs dropped and falling interest rates increased revenue from lending.
 Bank One recorded a 30 percent increase in net income, while profit at Wells Fargo increased 42 percent as profit margins on lending widened. 
 Net income at Bank One rose to $754 million, or 64 cents a share, from $581 million, or 50 cents, a year earlier. Expenses fell to $2.3 billion in the third quarter from $2.5 billion a year earlier.
Bank One, which is based in Chicago, said its nonperforming assets, most of which are loans considered not likely to be paid, rose $277 million, to $3.22 billion, from the second quarter and $1.09 billion compared with the quarter a year ago.
Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco, had net income of $1.16 billion, or 67 cents a share. Lower interest rates encouraged customers to take out new mortgages and made it cheaper for the bank to raise funds it used to lend money. 
Revenue increased 14 percent, to $5.5 billion, as net interest income, the money the bank makes on loans, rose 15 percent, to $3.22 billion.
Wells Fargo said it received a record $67 billion in mortgage applications during the quarter as the interest rate declines encouraged more customers to buy homes.

HEADLINE: Labor Leaders Say Trade Bill Threatens Bipartisanship 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Union leaders warned today that Congressional bipartisanship, already strained, could fall apart if the Bush administration and House Republican leaders pressed ahead with a trade promotion bill vigorously opposed by labor.
 The labor leaders asserted that the administration was unfairly seizing on the crisis created by the Sept. 11 attacks to rally support for trade legislation that labor has repeatedly opposed in recent years. 
 Representative Dick Armey, the House majority leader, said today that the trade bill might come up for a House vote as early as Friday. Mr. Armey, Republican of Texas, voiced confidence that the House would approve the bill, which is intended to make it easier for the president to negotiate trade deals, but labor leaders predicted that they could defeat the legislation. 
"They'd be making a big mistake if they push now on this because of what that would do to the bipartisan spirit," said the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, John J. Sweeney. "We will have to move as aggressively as we have in the past to oppose this."
The Bush administration has made the trade bill a top economic priority, saying that it is needed to lift the nation's sagging economy. But union leaders warn that the bill could speed the exodus of American jobs to low-wage countries overseas.
The legislation would make it easier for the president to negotiate trade deals, putting them on a "fast track," because it would bar Congress from amending such deals and require a straight yes or no vote. Many foreign trade ministers say it is hard to negotiate agreements with the United States knowing that Congress can revise them.
Union leaders have vowed to mount a campaign to stop the bill unless it requires the president to negotiate labor and environmental protections into trade agreements.
Many business leaders insist that labor will never support a trade promotion bill and will forever put forward new reasons to oppose it. 
William Morley, chief trade lobbyist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said many businesses were uncomfortable with the labor protections proposed by unions. Corporations, he said, would prefer that those protections be deleted entirely, but they recognize that some compromise is necessary.
He complained that the United States, which has not had fast-track trade legislation since 1994, was at an economic disadvantage because it has negotiated fewer free trade deals than many of its trading partners. 
"We have an economy that's definitely in need of stimulus," Mr. Morley said. "We cannot afford to sit on the sidelines and allow ourselves to be put at a competitive disadvantage."
Last week, in a 26-to-13 vote, the House Ways and Means Committee approved what Republican leaders said was a bipartisan trade bill. Two Democrats voted in favor of the measure, which calls on the president to seek to include labor and environmental protections in any free-trade agreements.
"This bill speaks to environmental and labor issues in good, practical ways," said Representative William J. Jefferson, a Louisiana Democrat who supports the bill. "We believe there has to be flexibility in this area. There can't be a sledgehammer approach. But it can't be completely toothless either. These have to be agreements that work, not ones where we insist on having everything our way."
Estimating that 30 House Republicans oppose the bill, Representative Jack Quinn of Buffalo, who heads a coalition of pro-labor Republicans, said the bill did not have enough votes for approval. In sharp contrast, Republican leaders forecast a victory, saying at least 20 centrist Democrats would support it.
Last week, the heads of the labor federations from California, New York, Florida and six other states traveled to Washington to lobby more than 30 members of Congress. At many workplaces, shop stewards are passing around cellphones, urging workers to call their House members to urge them to vote against the bill.
In addition, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is considering running broadcast spots in more than a dozen Congressional districts, as it did last July, to pressure wavering House members to vote no.
"This bill is the same old fast-track," said Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation. "There is some lip service that says labor protections. But it's all 'maybe,' not 'shall.' And we know that this president is far less inclined than the previous one to push hard to protect environmental interests and worker rights."
Union strategists see the trade bill as an opportunity to promote minimum worldwide labor standards and to make it harder for American companies to move operations overseas in search of the worst wages, working conditions and environmental standards. 
Labor leaders say they would consider supporting fast-track legislation only if it required the president to include two items in any trade agreements: first, a commitment from other countries to enforce their labor and environmental laws and not weaken them further and, second, a commitment to honor the four basic labor rights called for by the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency. Those standards are the right to form unions and bans on child labor, forced labor and discrimination.
Thea Lee, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s chief international economist, said unions wanted other changes in the bill, among them giving Congress a greater voice in trade talks and scaling back the extensive rights that trade agreements often give to investors.

Asia Gathering to Focus On Trade and Terrorism
Twenty-one Asian and Pacific Rim countries begin a series of high-level meetings in Shanghai today in what will be the largest gathering of government leaders since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. The attacks and subsequent American air strikes in Afghanistan have turned the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum from a good-will exercise into an effort by the United States to strengthen its anti-terrorism coalition in Asia. A9

An Unorthodox Palestinian View
Sari Nusseibeh, the new political representative of the Palestinians in East Jerusalem, told an Israeli crowd at Hebrew University that the Palestinian uprising was mired in bloodshed and asserted that a peace agreement could only be reached if the Palestinians abandoned a demand for the return of refugees to Israel. A7

A Palestinian militant was killed in an explosion at home, drawing vows of revenge from the Islamic group Hamas for the deaths of three of its members in the past three days. Hamas blamed Israel for the blast and said Prime Minister Ariel Sharon would "pay a very dear price." The Israeli Army said it knew nothing about the explosion. (Reuters)

South Africa Toll From AIDS
AIDS has become the leading cause of death in South Africa, and young adults are especially hard hit, with the overall death rate of women in their 20's now higher than that of women in their 60's, the country's leading scientific institute reported. The study by the Medical Research Council sharply contradicted recent statements by President Thabo Mbeki, who has asserted that violence and other diseases are bigger killers than AIDS. A5

Congo Talks Begin in Ethiopia
Long-awaited talks to end the civil war opened in Addis Ababa this week, but a number of issues, including disagreement over who was most responsible for violating a 1999 cease-fire, threatened to end the talks before they even got off the ground. A11
