HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The End of Pretending

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
In one bloody moment the hypocritical facade of President Clinton's empty policy on Bosnia crumbled. The mortar shell that killed 68 people as they shopped in Sarajevo's market Saturday brought an end to the pretense that America had a meaningful policy.
Mr. Clinton inherited a Bosnian horror from European appeasers and President Bush. After a weak show of wanting to act he essentially withdrew from the problem, hoping Americans would forget it. 
 From the lowest echelon of the State Department to near the highest, no one believed in the non-policy. How far the rot of official cynicism had gone was shown in a report given at the National War College last month by Richard Johnson, a department officer who formerly headed its Yugoslav desk. He titled the paper "The Pin-Stripe Approach to Genocide."
"Senior policy-makers have failed to level with the American people on the nature of the moral and security" challenges we face in the Balkans, Mr. Johnson said. He said officials had deliberately played down evidence that Serbian "ethnic cleansing" of Muslims in Bosnia amounted in law to genocide.
At a lunch last year, Mr. Johnson wrote, Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff said that he saw the moral issue in Bosnia but that a failed U.S. intervention "would destroy the American Presidency." Timothy Wirth, the department's counselor, said he agreed that the moral stakes were high but there were "even higher moral stakes at play: 'The survival of the fragile liberal coalition represented by this Presidency.' "
In short, officials knew what was right but did not have the courage to do it. Or more precisely, President Clinton did not. He gave the orders.
The political calculation in Washington, as in London and Paris, was that the Bosnian victims of aggression would eventually accept the division of their country, with most of it going to the Serbs and Croats. But the victims refused to go along. The mostly Muslim army of Bosnia fought on against the odds, and grew stronger.
France asked the Clinton Administration to join in pressing the Bosnian Government to give up and sign its dismemberment warrant. That was one thing the Administration would not do.
The Administration air-dropped food to the besieged Bosnian enclaves, but it did nothing to stop the aggression and genocide. The President's men said the situation was too complicated to intervene. In fact, it has become simpler. The necessary steps are plain.
1. The growing strength of the Bosnian Army means that no ground troops are needed from outside. What is needed is what President Clinton proposed and then abandoned: NATO air strikes against the aggressors and an end to the arms embargo on Bosnia.
2. The slaughter in the Sarajevo market underlines what should be the first air targets: the Serbian gun positions in the hills around Sarajevo and other Bosnian enclaves.
3. Planes should also be used to interdict the main-force Serbian and Croatian Army units now moving into Bosnia. That means taking out the Drina River bridges that link Serbia and Bosnia, and attacking the Croatian entry routes.
4. The United States has repeatedly warned President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia to keep his hands off Bosnia. It is time now to make Croatia pay a price, economic and political, for ignoring that warning.
The United Nations is seemingly prevented from acting effectively by its own bureaucracy and Russia's veto in the Security Council. Others must move.
NATO has the force. Lawyers have shown persuasively that the U.N. arms embargo is legally nonexistent. All that is required is leadership. That can come from only one man: President Clinton. If he leads, Europe will follow -- and so, I am convinced, will the American people.
On CNN last week Mr. Clinton's national security assistant, Anthony Lake, boasted that "Serb violence around Sarajevo has declined" since the NATO summit last month made another empty bombing threat.
Tell that to the parents of the six little girls killed by Serbian shells as they played in Sarajevo on Jan. 22. Or to the families of the 10 people killed by Serbian shells Feb. 4, or of the 68 on Feb. 5. They want action, not pretense. So should we.

HEADLINE: Accord Is Reported on Japanese Tax-Cut Package

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Feb. 8

 BODY:
The Government reportedly ended a week of turmoil this morning by agreeing on a $135 billion plan of temporary tax cuts and public works spending to revive the recession-bound economy and to satisfy one of the Clinton Administration's key demands in trade talks.
The battle over the economic plan has left the coalition Government badly divided, and today's deal, which has not yet been annnounced officially, is filled with compromises that might reduce its effectiveness. For instance, what had been proposed as a permanent reduction in income taxes will now be a one-year, $55 billion reduction because of a continuing dispute over how the Government will make up for the loss in revenues. 
 But the plan, which also includes large increases in public works spending and low-cost loans for businesses, will still be the largest economic stimulus plan Japan has ever initiated. It is intended to jolt the country out of its worst recession since World War II and, by quickening economic growth, pull in more imports and reduce Japan's yawning trade surplus.
The awkward agreement comes just two days before Prime Minister Hosokawa is scheduled to depart for Washington, where he will hold a critical summit meeting with President Clinton. The principal purpose of the trip is to review progress in a series of trade talks Japan and the United States agreed upon last summer.
In addition to demanding that Japan open a number of markets to more foreign-made goods, the Clinton Administration has also insisted that Japan take measures to reinvigorate the economy. With the talks in several of the sectors failing to make much headway, it had been hoped that the economic stimulus package would be the one clear area of concord between the two leaders.
The problem has been the question of how to pay for the tax cuts. Mr. Hosokawa had sided earlier with the conservatives in his Government, and in the Finance Ministry, by arguing that the Government would have to increase the national sales tax after a delay of three years. Their aim was to avoid long-running budget deficits.
Mr. Hosokawa had proposed increasing the sales tax, which has been highly unpopular since it was introduced five years ago, to 7 percent from 3 percent. That would have actually raised more revenues than the income tax reduction would have cost the Government.
The Socialists, the largest party in the coalition, had threatened to withdraw from the Cabinet and possibly bring down the Government if Mr. Hosokawa stuck by this proposal. The Socialists argued that the tax increase would fall most heavily on lower income workers.
Mr. Hosokawa was forced into the humiliating position of withdrawing his initial proposal a day after he presented it last week, but he still insisted the sales tax increase was needed.
That led to a political crisis that lasted throughout the weekend that jeopardized his meeting with President Clinton. If the trip goes badly, political analysts have said, it would take an enormous toll on Mr. Hosokawa's already shaky governing coalition.

HEADLINE: Hearing Opens Into Accusations of Fraud in Pennsylvania Election

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 7

 BODY:
A Federal judge began a hearing today on accusations of voter fraud in a State Senate race, a case the national Republican Party has called an "egregious voter fraud targeted at minority voters."
Judge Clarence C. Newcomer of Federal District Court decided to hear the case, brought by the Pennsylvania Republican Party, after state election officials and state courts rejected the Republicans' claims. 
 The dispute involves a special election last November to fill a state Senate seat in north Philadelphia made vacant by a Democratic senator's death. It was a crucial election because the party winning the seat could also gain control of the State Senate. Before the death it had 25 Democrats and 25 Republicans, and the deciding vote was held by the Lieutenant Governor, a Democrat.
The Republican candidate, Bruce S. Marks, a 36-year-old Philadelphia lawyer and former aide to United States Senator Arlen Specter, won 564 more votes at voting booths than his Democratic opponent. But the Democrat, William G. Stinson, a 49-year-old former assistant deputy mayor of Philadelphia, won the election by 461 votes after he obtained 80 percent of the 1,757 absentee ballots cast.
 
Quick Action by Democrats
 Before the polls closed, Mr. Marks had protested, contending that there had been widespread forgery and other abuse of absentee ballots in many parts of the district, which spans white, black and Hispanic neighborhoods.
Mr. Marks maintained that as many as 800 absentee ballots had been illegally cast for Mr. Stinson. He said they included ballots forged on behalf of Hispanic residents who had been misled, or people living permanently in Puerto Rico or serving time in prison. In one instance, the Republicans said, a dead person was listed as casting a ballot.
The Philadelphia Inquirer has identified about 330 absentee ballots that appear to have violated state election law.
But on Nov. 19, without considering the merits of the case, the Board of Elections here dismissed Mr. Marks's objections, citing procedural and jurisdictional flaws. Just minutes after the board, which has a Democratic majority, unanimously declared Mr. Stinson the winner, Senate Democratic leaders in Harrisburg administered the oath of office to him.
The Democrats' swift action complicated legal efforts by Republicans to challenge the election, and a half-dozen state courts, including the State Supreme Court, have dismissed Mr. Marks's case without considering its merits.
Mr. Marks maintained that he did not get a fair hearing because most judges and election commissioners in Pennsylvania were elected Democrats.
After finding no relief in state courts, he turned to the Federal courts.
Judge Newcomer, who was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon, took the unusual step of hearing the case even though state appeals were pending. The hearing is expected to last a week to two weeks.
In court today, Paul Rosen, a lawyer for the State Republican Committee, read a script that Democratic campaign workers used when telephoning Spanish-speaking voters. One question on the script, translated into English, says: "Do you know that you can elect your candidate without having to go to your voting place?" Campaign workers also delivered absentee applications and ballots, and the Democratic campaign paid the volunteer workers $1 for each completed form, according to testimony given today.
The Democrats have acknowledged that they put a major emphasis on collecting absentee ballots in the race. Even though they outnumber Republicans in the district, Democrats have had a harder time getting out the vote, particularly in predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods.
 
Telling of Legal Worries
 A Democratic campaign worker, William J. Jones, testified today that Democratic workers tried to make voting more convenient by encouraging people to use absentee ballots illegally. By state law, voters may vote by absentee ballots only if they are physically unable to go to the polls or are planning to be out of the county on Election Day.
Mr. Jones, an unemployed bank loan officer who worked as a volunteer for the Stinson campaign for about 10 weeks last summer, testified that he oversaw the processing of absentee ballot applications and ballots. He said that he had complained directly to Mr. Stinson last summer that campaign workers were violating the law by collecting absentee ballots from ineligible voters.
"If people didn't have a reason to vote absentee, they were told, 'Just say you'll be out of the county, and we'll mark the application "out of county," ' " Mr. Jones testified.
He also testified that he told Mr. Stinson on more than one occasion that a lot of ballots he handled "seemed phony." Mr. Jones said he quit the campaign because he was worried about breaking the law and denied that it was because he was not being paid, as lawyers for the Stinson campaign suggested today.
Mr. Stinson did not appear in court today. He has denied knowing of any illegal activities that may have been done on his behalf.
Ernest D. Preate Jr., a Republican who is the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, and the United States Justice Department began independent investigations into accusations of voter fraud last November. But both are focusing on accusations of criminal activities and not whether the election should be overturned.
In court today, Lillian Cruz, a 33-year-old resident of the district, testified that a Stinson campaign worker, Ramon Pratt, "told me this was a new law, a new way to vote." She added, "To tell you the truth, I don't even know who I voted for because he pointed out to me where I should make the X."
Mr. Pratt was identified by several witnesses as the man who went door-to-door soliciting absentee ballots last summer. Mr. Pratt took the stand, but said that on the advice of his lawyer, he would not answer any questions.

HEADLINE: Prospects Dim for U.S.-Japan Accord

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Just days before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is to meet President Clinton in Washington, prospects for meaningful new trade agreements seem to have grown dimmer.
But in one potentially hopeful sign, Mr. Hosokawa's cabinet reportedly agreed this morning on a plan to stimulate Japan's sputtering economy by increasing public works spending and reducing some taxes. That is something the United States has been pressing for. 
 The deadlock is in the talks over opening Japan's markets for automobiles, insurance and other sectors. The question is whether the agreements will include numerical goals for increasing access to Japan's market. At a news conference here on Friday, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said that Tsutomu Hata, Japan's Foreign Minister, had "neither accepted nor rejected" the American view about numerical goals.
 
 
Avoiding an Argument
 The Japanese, however, told Mr. Kantor last week that Japan would not accept targets and that it was time for Washington to modify its approach. If Mr. Hata did not speak up, they said, it was only to avoid an argument.
Leaving Tokyo on Friday after three days of high-level talks, Mr. Kantor warned that if no agreements were reached before the meeting, Washington might resort to "other options," an allusion to sanctions.
Still, both nations have a strong incentive to avoid injuring their relationship if the meeting does not go smoothly. In the past, seemingly hopeless negotiations have been rescued in a series of last-minute all- night sessions that produce a fuzzily worded document that both sides declare a victory. In this case as well, there seems to be some room for such a compromise.
There has also been some movement on more detailed issues, so that if the key question regarding targets is resolved, the rest of the negotiations can be concluded. Japan on Friday announced a new plan to change Government buying of equipment like computers. And the two nations have agreed to cooperate in areas like advanced transportation systems and AIDS research and prevention.
Mr. Kantor came here as President Clinton's special emissary to urge Japan's top politicians to take an interest in the trade negotiations and not leave everything to bureaucrats, who have less room to be flexible. At his news conference on Friday, Mr. Kantor said "a new structure has been set up at the political level" to conduct the negotiations, with Mr. Hata taking charge for Japan.
 
Reasons to Stand Firm
 On the issue of numerical targets, the United States has reasons to stand firm. History has shown that Japan has caved in under American pressure rather than face sanctions or hurt relations with its main ally and trading partner. This time Japan faces an additional threat: If there is no agreement, the yen is likely to rise again, choking the nation's automobile and electronics exports.
Moreover, while Japan now professes an ideological abhorrence to "managed trade," it has agreed on previous occasions, like the semiconductor negotiations, to goals, though not guarantees.
Japan says it will not do so again because the United States misinterprets such goals as commitments and punishes Japan when they are not met. This explanation suggests that Japan's objection is more to punishment than to goals themselves. It might agree to goals if there were some assurances that Washington would not resort to sanctions.
For its part, Japan also believes the United States will yield. Japanese officials say that many officials in the Clinton Administration, although they cannot speak out publicly, do not believe in targets. The President, they point out, said in a speech here in July that the United States is not seeking "so-called trade by the numbers." They also think Washington can be persuaded to trust Prime Minister Hosokawa, who has pledged to deregulate the economy.
One senior Japanese official said his Government was not worried that failure to agree to numerical goals would rupture bilateral relations. "The U.S-Japan relationship is not that fragile that it would collapse over that single problem," he said.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET: THE MILITARY;
Proposal Cuts Back on Some Weapons to Spend More on Personnel

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
President Clinton's military budget for the 1995 fiscal year puts Pentagon spending in a holding pattern, canceling some weapons to finance better training and higher pay for military personnel.
Military spending would rise $2.8 billion in the coming fiscal year under the Clinton plan. Taking inflation into account, that represents a decline of slightly less than 1 percent from the budget for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. The Administration plans a 5.9 percent cut for the 1996 fiscal year. 
 The $263.7 billion proposal submitted today has something for almost everyone to dislike. Some members of Congress want to cut more weapons programs to pay for social needs. Others fear the advent of a military unable to fight two major wars at once, a benchmark for Pentagon planners. A third faction sees the Pentagon's budget not only as the bulwark of military preparedness but also as a jobs supplier, from soldiering to shipbuilding to software manufacturing.
That is one reason that a huge peace dividend anticipated by many at the end of the cold war has not materialized. Instead, small reductions in spending have been achieved incrementally by cutting troop strength and dropping plans for a few major weapons.
The overall budget for buying new weapons is cut by $1.4 billion in the new proposal, compared with an $8.1 billion reduction in the procurement budget in the current fiscal year from the previous one. In the context of Pentagon spending, a cut of $1.4 billion represents little more than 0.5 percent of overall annual military spending.
Gone from the budget, for example, is money to build more F-16 fighter planes, long a mainstay of the American arsenal. The Administration would also cancel two fighter aircraft still on the drawing board: the Navy's A/F-X and the Air Force's multirole fighter.
Still in the works are multibillion-dollar proposals to build a new "stealth" fighter for the Air Force, a new attack helicopter for the Army, a new attack submarine and a new carrier for the Navy and the new Milstar satellite system for global communications in wartime. All have been attacked by Congressional critics as vestiges of the cold war.
 
A $22-a-Month Raise
 The proposed military budget for the coming fiscal year rose in large part because Congress ordered a 1.6 percent pay increase for every member of the shrinking military. For example, an Army sergeant with six years of experience, who now makes $1,401 a month, would get a raise of $22 a month under the Pentagon plan.
The number of active-duty troops would fall by 85,500, to 1.52 million, in the coming fiscal year. The Administration would also spend $2.8 billion to close bases as required by Congress and $5.7 billion to clean up environmental damage at military installations.
 
To Have or Have Not
 The budget battle in Congress will be waged between those who believe that the Pentagon can withstand a leaner budget, as does Representative Ronald V. Dellums, the California Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, and those who believe that the Pentagon may already have sacrificed enough, as does Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee.
A spokesman for Senator Nunn said he would withhold comment today on the President's budget. In the past year, Mr. Nunn has defended the Pentagon against spending cuts.
Mr. Dellums said that the main questions to be answered in the budget debate are: "Do we need the forces to fight and win two wars simultaneously on two fronts? Is that more a political statement than a military reality?"
"There can still be a peace dividend," Mr. Dellums said. "The question is whether we have the political will to do it."

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET: ANTI-DRUG EFFORT;
President Plans to Raise Drug Treatment Budget

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Following through on a campaign promise, President Clinton today proposed a sharp increase in spending for drug treatment and programs to prevent drug abuse.
Despite the spending increases for prevention and treatment, most of the $13.2 billion for anti-drug programs would go toward law enforcement. 
 Mr. Clinton budgeted $5.4 billion for drug prevention and treatment, up about 20 percent from the $4.5 billion approved by Congress last year. That increase would give prevention and treatment 41 percent of the budget.
Mr. Clinton also proposed increasing the spending for law enforcement to $7.8 billion, accounting for 59 percent of the budget.
Over all, the anti-drug budget would rise by 9 percent from the $12.1 billion approved by Congress for the current fiscal year.
 
'A Significant Move'
 In addition to the proposal for the anti-drug budget made public today, the Administration is asking for nearly $1 billion for drug treatment and education programs as part of an anti-crime package that would spend $22.3 billion over five years.
"This is a significant move toward putting resources where the need is greatest," said Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, who resigned as President George Bush's deputy directory of the National Drug Policy Office after his requests for such increases went unheeded. As the deputy director he was the chief aide for health and education.
Lee P. Brown, Mr. Clinton's principal aide on drug policy, said the increase in spending for treatment and prevention programs represented a "fundamental change in the way the nation responds to the drug problem."
But Mr. Brown emphasized that for the Clinton Administration, like the Bush and Reagan Administrations, law enforcement remained an important part of the country's drug strategy.
 
'A Good Strategic Move'
 "We're providing not only a significant increase in drug treatment capacity," Mr. Brown said in an afternoon briefing, "but also solid support for law-enforcement activity."
While Mr. Clinton proposed a 3 percent increase in spending for enforcement, his budget calls for reducing by about $100 million the $1.2 billion spent last year in trying to stop smugglers at the borders and on the seas and increasing by about the same amount, to a total of $400 million the amount spent on trying to counter drugs in the countries in Latin America and Asia that produce them.
"I think this is a good strategic move," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee. "The major thrust toward more emphasis on treatment and prevention is what we've been arguing we should be doing for the past four years."
The budget for the 1994 fiscal year, which Mr. Clinton proposed last March, varied little from the approach taken by his Republican predecessors; spending was to increase to $13 billion from $12.2 billion in the last budget submitted by President Bush for the 1993 fiscal year, but Congress approved only $12.1 billion.
 
Optimism Among Democrats
 This year, the Administration and some Democratic members of Congress are more optimistic.
"I think this year, with greater emphasis on crime and drugs, there is an understanding that while punishment is warranted, treatment has been terribly underfunded," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice. "And I think Congress will stick with these numbers."
Last October, Mr. Clinton said he intended to make drug prevention and treatment programs a hallmark of his Administration, with emphasis on heavy drug users who consume most of the illegal drugs and are responsible for much of drug-related crime.
But the President was criticized at the time for not spelling out how he would divide his budget to convert his goals into reality.
Today, Mr. Brown said Mr. Clinton's drug strategy promised "dramatic change, and that is reflected in the budget."
 
Limits to Expansion
 Some experts had been skeptical of Mr. Clinton's drug plan last fall, partly because he had followed President Bush so closely in drafting his first anti-drug budget. Moreover, Mr. Bush, like Mr. Clinton, often spoke of the importance of drug treatment but continued to spend much more for law enforcement.
Experts in drug treatment estimate that four million to six million Americans are heavy drug users. There are now programs to treat 1.4 million of them, but Mr. Clinton's drug budget would provide treatment for 74,000 more men and women. In addition, the crime bill would enable an additional 66,000 to enter treatment.
Peter Reuter, a drug expert who teaches public affairs and criminology at the University of Maryland, said the Administration might be expanding in these areas "as much as they responsibly can in one year."
"You can't double these programs overnight," Mr. Reuter said. "You can't pump that much money out efficiently in one year."

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET: THE NEW YORK REGION

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Under the budget President Clinton proposed today, the New York region would suffer deep cuts in programs, including grants that help poor people pay their home heating bills and operating subsidies for mass transit, while winning new money for Head Start, job training, AIDS care, services for the homeless and the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Station.
"It is a bad-news, good-news budget for New York," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn. "What we gain on education and training and mass-transit capital funds, we lose in housing and mass-transit operating subsidies." 
 Richard Munson, director of the Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition, a research organization financed by members of Congress in 18 states from Maine to Minnesota, said the budget appeared likely to hurt the New York region disproportionately in some important ways.
"It hurts," Mr. Munson said, "largely because some of those programs that the Administration has targeted for the largest cuts are programs that New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have especially depended on, like low-income home energy assistance, while the ones where they get increases are ones where they'll mostly just get their proportional share."
 
Steep Cuts for Housing
 Some of the loudest howls in the region came on the proposal to cut the low-income home energy assistance program about in half, to $92 million, from $182 million, according to an estimate by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's office here. New construction of public housing would also be sharply cut, along with rental assistance for the elderly, block housing grants to the states and other public housing programs.
The budget would trim mass-transit operating subsidies in New York State by about one-quarter, to $90 million, a cut that could translate into a 5-cent increase in the subway fare if the fare alone was used to make up the difference.
Senator Frank J. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said the cuts in the mass-transit operating subsidies "just don't make sense" and would have to be adjusted.
But at the same time, the budget would increase assistance for building projects for mass transit in the states by roughly $100 million, to $416 million, and would bring substantial increases in money for Head Start, public elementary schools in low-income districts, job training, care for AIDS patients and programs for the homeless. Community development block grants, a perennial target for cuts in the Reagan years, would be maintained at current levels.
The overall pattern of give and take left the region's state and city officials struggling to sum up the net effects and their political response to the President's proposal in the face of tight spending controls and few new programs. Those same officials often squealed through a decade of cuts in urban aid by Republican administrations in Washington.
 
Comparison to Nixon
 "It's something of a Nixon-in-China phenomenon, where a Democratic President has had some success in capping spending, and that causes some problems for the states," said Steve Hoffman, deputy director of Mr. Cuomo's office here. "The bad news is there's some pain; the good news is that they're serious about deficit reduction."
The New York office estimates that the state would receive $100 million under the President's proposal for community policing, but the precise amounts and distribution formulas for this are yet to be worked out in the crime bills in Congress, making the money somewhat less certain.
The Administration included money for a project long dear to New York's senior Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan: the transformation of the General Post Office opposite Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan into a new passenger rail terminal and retail complex. The project is intended to recapture some of the glamour of the station demolished in 1965. The President asked for authorization for $100 million for the redevelopment plan, with the first $10 million to come in supplemental money in the current year's budget.
But money for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor improvement project, which slices through the three-state New York metropolitan region, would be cut by $25 million, to $200 million.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
In Perry's First 100 Hours, What Could Possibly Go Wrong?

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
In his first 100 hours as Defense Secretary, William J. Perry weaved his way through a field of national security land mines, escaping slightly frazzled but unbloodied.
Sworn in late last Thursday to replace Les Aspin, Mr. Perry joined senior Administration officials at the White House the next day to tighten economic sanctions on Haiti's military government. Then, he hopped an Air Force jet for Munich to keep a long-scheduled date at a private conference on European security issues. 
 Some lawmakers and even Administration officials have raised doubts whether Mr. Perry, who made his name as a technocrat, not a diplomat, can handle foreign policy matters. But in Munich he sounded like a statesman -- though a bland one -- in urging European support for Russia's economic and political reforms, and in beckoning nations outside of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to join the Partnership for Peace program that seeks to bring nonmembers into closer relations with the alliance.
By Sunday, with the carnage from Saturday's attack on a Sarajevo marketplace dominating the news, Mr. Perry was finding his voice. Though he made some tentative statements initially, on Sunday he deplored the attack and urged a common approach to ending the strife. "He was precise and to the point," said Volker Ruhe, Germany's Defense Minister.
On the flight home Sunday, Mr. Perry only half-jokingly told reporters, "I don't know if I can stand another 72 hours like this." But the day was far from over. A few minutes later, one of the engines on his four-engine plane conked out, forcing the plane to land at Mildenhall air base, 70 miles north of London.
Mr. Perry took the detour in stride. He mingled with the troops at the officers' club until a second plane, full of lawmakers who also attended the conference, swung by to pick up the stranded Secretary and his entourage.
 
Secretary's New Clothes
 From the Dressed-for-Success Department: Mr. Perry told reporters traveling with him last weekend that one of his first Secretarial acts was to buy a new suit (off the rack at Nordstrom) for his formal swearing-in ceremony later this month.
Mr. Perry, of course, was referring to those critics who said Mr. Aspin didn't help his shambling image any by wearing rumpled, light tan, ill-fitting suits to work.
When asked what color he picked, Mr. Perry said beaming: "Dark blue, you bet. I learned my lesson well."
 
Back at the Pentagon
 When he returned to the Pentagon today, Mr. Perry had a new office. Over the weekend, workers had removed Mr. Aspin's belongings and moved in Mr. Perry's from his former office, just down the corridor on the outer ring of the third floor, which is synonomous with power in the building.
Officials have taken down photographs of Mr. Aspin, but new photos of Mr. Perry are still to come. For the next month or so, Mr. Aspin will have use of a small office in nearby Rosslyn, Va., a courtesy afforded to departing defense secretaries.
Mr. Perry immediately plunged into what is likely to be a major political issue on Capitol Hill this year: defending the Pentagon's budget for 1995. Many liberal Democrats are pressing Mr. Clinton to cut military spending deeper while many Republicans and conservative Democrats fear the Administration may already have cut too much, too fast.
In his first defense of the budget before Congress, Mr. Perry will testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.
 
A Numbers Game
 Mr. Perry, frequently identified as a former engineering professor with a Ph.D. in mathematics, has a reputation for bookishness he is eager to shed.
But he did not advance his own cause last weekend when someone interrupted the talk about peacekeeping, Ukrainian nuclear weapons and the Bosnia crisis to ask if he believed Fermat's last theorem had really been proven.
Suddenly, Mr. Perry's eyes lit up. Fermat's last theorem -- it says that xn + yn = zn is true when n equals the integer 2 and no other -- is one of the most enduring and difficult problems in mathematics. Fermat, a 17th-century French mathematician, wrote in the margin of one of his notebooks that he had proved it but that there was no room in the margin to write it out. Then he died, and mathematicians have been struggling with it ever since. A Princeton mathematics professor announced last year that he had discovered a proof.
Mr. Perry confided that off and on during a year of graduate school at Stanford he had tried to solve the 350-year-old problem -- unsuccessfully.
But that doesn't make him a scholarly type, he maintained. "Someone wrote that I was bookish," said Mr. Perry, who quoted the poets T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden in his speech to the conference on European security. "I haven't had a chance to read a book in six months."

HEADLINE: Illness Is Forcing Chancellor Of SUNY to Resign From Post

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
D. Bruce Johnstone, the Chancellor of the State University of New York, announced yesterday that he is stepping down, effective March 1, because he has cancer.
Trustees to the largest state university system in the country scheduled a special meeting in New York for today, reportedly to discuss a temporary replacement for Dr. Johnstone. But they are not expected to make a decision until their Feb. 24 meeting, at which time they will also outline the process for finding a permanent replacement for Dr. Johnstone. 
 His pancreatic cancer was diagnosed in September and he underwent extensive surgery. Dr. Johnstone, 53, returned to work in January, but said he made the decision to step down last week after consulting with his doctors and family.
"I've been seeing my physician in the last couple of weeks, and he has reaffirmed that the cancer has reoccurred," Dr. Johnstone said from his office in Albany. "I know that I can't continue being Chancellor for long. I wanted to give the trustees a chance to begin an immediate search for my successor."
 
Returning to Buffalo
 "I will also begin chemo- or radiation therapy soon, which will have some effect potentially on my level of energy," he said. "It's been a tough week."
During his return to work, Dr. Johnstone attended Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's State of the State message and was present at the Jan. 27 trustees meeting.
Dr. Johnstone was president of the State University College at Buffalo for seven years before he was appointed to the Chancellor's post in 1988.
After he leaves office, Dr. Johnstone plans to return to Buffalo, which he considers home, for treatment at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, where his wife, Gail, works as director of planning.
The SUNY system has 400,000 students and 64 campuses, including 30 community colleges, and an annual budget of $4.5 billion. Dr. Johnstone headed the sprawling system during the state's financial crisis. The university's budget was cut $200 million in a four-year period ending last year, and during Dr. Johnstone's tenure, tuition for full-time students increased to $2,650 from $1,350.
 
Holding Enrollment Steady
 But through it all, Dr. Johnstone was credited with trying to preserve the university's quality and its accessibility to all students who sought a public education. Enrollment remained steady even as the number of high school graduates in the state declined. Last year, the Legislature gave SUNY its first budget increase in three years.
Governor Cuomo said Dr. Johnstone has improved SUNY's financial standing and academic reputation by making inroads in expanding areas like technology.
"His management skills have made SUNY more efficient and accountable," the Governor said in a statement.
Dr. Johnstone, who is widely published and lectures often on higher education matters, said he was sorry to be leaving the educational scene at this time.
"I'll miss the chance to be a party to these kinds of major issues -- the challenges to higher education, the accessibility, quality and affordability to students, parents and taxpayers," he said. "It's always tough to leave an agenda unfinished."

HEADLINE: 44 Million Words Strong, Britannica to Join Internet

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Encyclopedia Britannica, the publisher of the nation's oldest and most prestigious reference work, said today that it would begin offering electronic distribution of its materials to universities and some public libraries via the Internet, the world's largest computer network.
The development is one of the clearest indications that traditional publishers realize the limitations of offering only hard-bound volumes -- and are concluding that the opportunities of on-line publishing outweigh the risks. 
 "Companies in the electronic publishing market are beginning to see they want the largest possible market," said Christopher Locke, general manager of Mecklermedia, a Westport, Conn., publishing and exhibition company. "They don't want to be trapped in markets that are Balkanized or private."
Several encyclopedias are already available on line, but the Encyclopedia Britannica is now the largest, with worldwide revenues of $550 million a year.
It also represents a significant move toward instant information and a milestone in miniaturization for the 32-volume reference work, which contains 44 million words and 23,000 illustrations and adorns the bookshelves of millions of libraries and homes.
"This is a blessing for every school kid," Paul Saffo, a researcher at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif., said. "We've all been there before, the night before we have a paper due in class."
The 225-year-old Encyclopedia Britannica, which is the oldest continuously published encyclopedia in the English language, will be made available initially to university faculty and students in the fall, using a variety of information-retrieval technologies that have been developed experimentally by Internet researchers and that are being quickly commercialized.
Encyclopedia Britannica executives said they were also planning to make their reference data base available to a larger commercial audience, but academic distribution would be a first step to insure that the electronic version of the encyclopedia was well tested.
"The whole development process has been an astonishing one for me," said Robert McHenry, editor in chief of the Britannica. "I've scrambled pretty hard just to keep up with the technical language."
The electronic version of the Encyclopedia Britannica, to be called Britannica Online, is now being tested by students and faculty at the University of California at San Diego. The on-line version includes "hypertext" links that cannot be matched by the traditional text version.
This technology makes it possible for each article in the encyclopedia to refer to other related works and illustrations. It also links the four components of the encyclopedia: the macropedia, which is the extended version; the micropedia, which is the condensed version; the index, and a broad outline of world knowledge called the propedia.
To organize more than 300 million characters of text and 2,000 illustrations, the Encyclopedia Britannica is using information retrieval software developed by WAIS Inc., a Menlo Park, Calif., software developer.
To search the electronic version, students use networked personal computers and work stations running a program known as Mosaic, developed at the National Center for Supercomputer Applications at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. The software displays documents and illustrations and highlights words and phrases that have links to other documents. By clicking on a highlighted block of text or illustration, it is possible to retrieve a related document automatically from the Encyclopedia Britannica database.
 
Pricing Plans Studied
 Encyclopedia Britannica executives said they would probably price the encyclopedia to universities on a subscription basis, depending on the number of students on campus. However, they said they were still considering a variety of pricing methods for general commercial distribution.
One possible plan may be to charge on a reference-by-reference basis. That is made possible by the WAIS and Mosaic software. Currently, on-line encyclopedias are provided as standard service by on-line publishers like Compuserve, America Online and Prodigy.
Encyclopedia Britannica executives said they had decided to become electronic publishers rather than align with an existing on-line service because of the economics.
"The main reason we're doing it ourselves is that you just can't make any money licensing your content," Joseph J. Esposito, president of Encyclopedia Britannica North America, said. "If you do believe that content is king, it's rather unfortunate that so many of the content providers have put themselves in a position where they're held hostage to the on-line services."
The Encyclopedia Britannica had an earlier experiment with on-line information delivery via the Mead Data Corporation but the agreement ended in 1985 when the two companies could not agree on development costs.
"We're creating a new market for content providers," said Larry Smarr, director of the National Center for Supercomputer Applications, which developed the Mosaic browser software. "Here is a whole world of people who are using cyberspace as their information stream. They are all potential customers for commercial information providers."

HEADLINE: European Stocks Plunge In Response to Fed Move

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
After enjoying a long run-up over the last year, share prices in Europe dropped sharply today in response to the Federal Reserve's decision last week to nudge up interest rates in the United States.
After declining sharply early in the day, stock markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris stabilized later in what analysts said was relatively light trading. In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares plunged more than 93 points during the morning but recovered to close down 56.30 at 3,419.10. 
 In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index lost 58.85 points to close at 2,079.40. In Paris, the CAC-40 index closed at 2,287.06, down 42.11 points.
 
Down From Record Highs
 Although important economies including Germany's and France's are still struggling to shake off the recession, the European markets have enjoyed a steady bull run, with the London and Paris exchanges hitting new highs last week and Frankfurt having hit one last month.
Much of the buying has been based on the assumption that interest rates in Germany and in other important European economies would continue to decline for much if not all of 1994. Lower rates make equities relatively more attractive than interest-sensitive investments like bonds or savings accounts, and the expectation of continued rate reductions has sent a huge flow of money into stock markets in search of better returns.
There has also been heavy buying of European stocks by investors from the United States, where stock market valuations are high by historical standards and interest rates are quite low.
 The rise in rates in the United States led to speculation in the European markets that the anticipated cuts in European rates would come more slowly than expected and that the flood of investment from the United States would be slowed or even reversed.
But many economists and analysts said that the market's fears today were overblown and that the fundamental outlook for the European economies -- and for the markets -- was little changed from last week. The European markets, they said, will probably stabilize within a day or two, just as Wall Street stabilized today after the 96-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday.
"It's a knee-jerk reaction," said Ros Lifton, an economist at Nomura Research in London, referring to the selling by European investors.
Peter Sullivan, a European equity strategist at Merrill Lynch in London, said that European interest rates should continue falling for some months at least, despite the modest rise in short-term rates in the United States. There is some danger, he said, that the dollar's rise against the German mark during the last two days would increase inflationary pressures in Germany. But he said that the effect should be negligible, and that the German central bank's basic strategy of measured rate reductions was very unlikely to change.
"We don't think this represents a top for the European markets," Mr. Sullivan said. "We believe they will go back above Friday's levels. This was the most expected surprise in years, and it doesn't change our view that interest rates are coming down and that we'll see strong cyclical recovery and strong earnings recovery."

HEADLINE: In This Fiscal Crisis, New York Must Rescue Itself

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
"If we stay where we are," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani declared last week as he presented his first budget plan for New York City, "we're headed for a disaster." To turn the city's economy around, the Mayor argued, nothing short of an immediate halt to the rising tax burden and a fundamental reorganization of public spending would do.
But will it work? Experts disagree sharply over whether cutting the budget, slashing the city's work force and reducing several local taxes -- all central elements of the Mayor's proposal -- will give the city's economy a much-needed shot in the arm. For all the disputes, however, they share at least one point: Mr. Giuliani has little choice but to try. 
 The fundamental reason, analysts say, is that New York City can no longer count on the stock market booms and office-building extravaganzas that bailed it out of earlier fiscal traumas. Because of a huge oversupply of empty office space and the fact that cuts in corporate employment have become an end in themselves, the city is not likely to be lifted as high as it once was by a national economic recovery. Nor can New York expect much help from the state or Federal governments.
 
No Third Recovery?
 "Can New York hope to grow its way out of its current troubles?" asked Charles R. Morris, an economic analyst who wrote "The Cost of Good Intentions," a detailed examination of the roots of New York's fiscal crisis of the 1970's. His answer: "Regrettably, no."
"The city has long been able to finance its largess from a vibrant Manhattan office-tower economy and its financial-services base," he added. "That is what fueled New York's last two recoveries, but I'm afraid it won't be much help this time."
While Wall Street has made money hand over fist in the last two or three years, that prosperity has made little difference to New York's lagging economy. Because of increased automation, the financial-services industry no longer requires as many people or as much office space in New York for the legions of people processing its transactions.
Given those circumstances, the city's critical need is to create or attract new businesses. So Mr. Giuliani is making the risky calculation that cuts in public jobs -- for all the pain to city employees and for all the political backlash -- are the only way over the long run to help ease the tax burden enough to lure private jobs back to New York.
New York has long provided tax abatements and other specific favors for large, prominent companies that threatened to leave. But with those corporate giants in decline, the challenge now facing Mr. Giuliani, analysts say, is to lessen the burden for small- and medium-sized businesses.
He must accomplish this without seriously degrading the level of public services that all employers and employees count on to make life tolerable in New York. That will not be easy. Dirtier streets, more crowded classrooms, worse traffic, more hectic commutes, all could do as much to drive companies out of the city as the taxes that now burden them.
 
Politics of Budget Cuts
 "The basic principle that the city's budget problems are having adverse economic consequences is absolutely sound," said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, which oversees the city's public spending. "What is unresolved is whether the politics of budget cutting" will do more harm than good, he said.
Mr. Giuliani's financial plan, in fact, includes a slowdown in capital spending for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a severe cut in the administrative staff of the Board of Education. But whether the Board of Education cuts will affect classroom instruction is a matter of some debate.
Current research suggests that high state and local taxes play a significant role in harming almost every aspect of economic performance, from inducing companies to leave for greener pastures to discouraging new business startups and hindering the creation of jobs. Until the last few years, the common academic wisdom was that local taxes didn't matter much.
The penalty for being a high-tax area appears to be rising, because telecommunications and other innovations make it easier for businesses to pick up stakes and operate elsewhere. That is particularly worrisome for New York City, where the overall state and local tax burden is about 40 percent above the national average.
"Companies have become much more footloose," said Timothy J. Bartik, senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich.
The overwhelming advantages of Manhattan as a financial and cultural center once outweighed the adverse effects of its high tax rates -- and the city banked on that. Now, even though New York is starting to develop an expanded role as a nexus for global business, many companies are no longer willing to pay as much of a premium simply for the privilege of doing business in New York.
 
'Out of Line'
 "It's O.K. to be above the national average in taxes, but New York got a little too much out of line," said Howard Chernick, a public finance expert at Hunter College.
But while Dr. Chernick agrees with Giuliani supporters that New York needs to curb some of the extra social benefits that only New York City provides, he says the city will nevertheless pay a price.
"At most, there will be some modest increase in the economic base," he said. "But it will be at the cost of a meaner life for the poor."
Even under the best of circumstances, said Frank J. Mauro, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-supported research group in Albany, New York City cannot solve its fiscal problems alone.
Two-fifths of the state's residents live in the city, yet three-fifths of those in poverty reside here. New York City educates 37 percent of the state's public-school students, but receives only 34 percent of state aid, Mr. Mauro says. The city is receiving $242 million less in state support, he said, than it was five years ago.
Mr. Giuliani is counting on an extra $355 million in state aid in the next fiscal year and another $333 million in Federal support. But the Mayor will be lucky if he gets anywhere close to that amount.
 
Immigrants as the Future
 That's just one more reason, analysts say, why the city can no longer count on its past saviors but must look to new sources of local strength.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Issues Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
With traders still jittery after the Federal Reserve's sudden increase in short-term interest Friday, prices of Treasury securities slipped lower yesterday.
But prices did manage to bounce off their lows of the day, aided in part by a slide in commodity prices and, traders said, good investor demand in yesterday's three- and six-month Treasury bill auctions. The February gold contract on the Commodity Exchange fell $7.70, to $378.90 an ounce, while the March contract for light crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 38 cents, to $15.25 a barrel. 
 Gerald A Guild, senior manager of the fixed-income department at Advest Inc., said yesterday's market action was a continuation of the Friday selloff. "There is still alot of uncertainty in the minds of many investors," he said, adding that traders are also worried about how well the market will react to the Treasury's quarterly auction this week of 3-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. Even when the market is calm this big auction can upset the apple cart.
But Mr. Guild believes that over the long term the bond market will benefit from the rise in short-term rates that the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, announced last week. "The bond market will survive," he said, "and if Alan Greenspan is right about nipping inflation it should be favorable for long-term interest rates."
 
Traders and Investors Worried
 But even if the Fed move is taken as a positive, traders and investors are still worried about another interest rate rise by the Fed and when it will come. Many analysts expect the Fed to make one or two additional short-term interest rate increases this year, which may be a factor that will keep the bond market from rebounding too much.
In trading late in the day, the price of the 30-year bond was down 13/32 of a point, to yield 6.39 percent, up from 6.36 percent on Friday. A five-year intermediate note was down 9/32 , to yield 5.35 percent, up from 5.30 percent at the end of last week.
At The Treasury bill auction, the discount rate of a new three-month bill rose to 3.24 percent, from 2.99 percent last week, while the rate for a six-month maturity was 3.40 percent, up from 3.16 percent. While the increase in the rates were steep, they just mirror the quarter of a percentage point rise in short-term interest rates that the Fed engineered Friday.
Traders said the shorter-maturity bill market was often regarded as a haven in periods of uncertainty when the markets were buffeted by unfavorable economic news. Longer maturities are much riskier because there is a greater drop in the price if interest rates rise. This rush to shorter maturities, traders said, is one reason that the rates at the Treasury bill auction did not move higher.
Today the Treasury will begin its $40 billion quarterly auction with the sale of $17 billion in new three-year notes. The three-day Government sale also includes the sale of $12 billion in 10-year notes tomorrow and $11 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday. Mr. Guild says the 3-year securities usually do well at the auction, with some trouble on the 10-year sales. This auction will feature the first 30-year bond auction in six months and therefore should attract good demand, some traders said.
The following are the results of yesterday's three- and six-month bill auctions:

HEADLINE: Borrowing Rises 11.2%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing rose in December as holiday shopping helped to spur a surge in credit expansion at the end of 1993.
Borrowing climbed at an annual rate of 11.2 percent in December, after a revised increase of 10.7 percent in November, the Federal Reserve said today. The November increase was originally estimated at 10.6 percent. 
 The latest rise, the seventh in a row, brought outstanding debt to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $789.8 billion.
The buying binge in stores and auto showrooms was spurred by low interest rates that encouraged consumers to finance purchases of cars and items for the home like furniture and appliances.
It was the third straight double-digit increase in borrowing, coinciding with a 5.9 percent growth rate in the economy for the fourth quarter of 1993 -- the biggest expansion in six years.
Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. Many economists expect spending to level off in the early months of 1994.
By category, auto loans increased in December at a 6.4 percent annual rate, to $278.3 billion, after rising 13 percent in November.
Revolving credit, which includes credit cards, rose at a 10.4 percent rate in December, to $281.7 billion, on the heels of a 9.3 percent jump in November.
Other kinds of consumer loans rose 17.9 percent, to $229.8 billion, after increasing 9.4 percent in November.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Precious Metal Prices Hit By Waves of Profit Taking

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metal prices were pounded by profit taking yesterday as investment funds fled the market in a continuing reaction to Friday's increase in short-term interest rates.
Gold for April delivery, the most actively traded futures contract, fell $7.60, to $380.70 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. And March silver lost 18.7 cents, to $5.24 an ounce. 
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, April platinum dropped $6.10, to $391.40 a ounce.
 
Reaction to Stock Market
 About half of the drop in gold prices occurred at the opening, as the metals market caught up with Friday's plunge in the stock market, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 96.24 points.
The precious metals absorbed a second round of selling late in yesterday's session. Paradoxically, analysts said the stock market's recovery yesterday -- the Dow rose 34.90 points -- was a key factor.
Lower stocks typically push gold down initially. But if stocks continue falling, investors usually turn to gold for its safety, pushing the metal's price higher, Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst with Prudential Securities Inc., said. "This has not occurred and may not occur if the stock market continues to firm," she said.
The Federal Reserve's action on Friday to raise a key short-term interest rate for the first time in five years initially reduced demand for gold as an inflation hedge because higher rates act as a brake on economic growth. But the size of the increase -- to 3.25 percent from 3 percent in the interest that banks charge each other for overnight loans -- was considered marginal.
The bottom line, according to Jon Nadler, a vice president at Bank of America, is that little has changed.
"There is really no change in the big picture, namely a stronger economy," he said, adding that economic growth "is supportive for precious metals in general."
Mr. Nadler said gold historically has made seasonal lows in midwinter and early summer. A recovery, beginning in March, is likely, he said.
"I don't think the forecasters overall have tempered their bullish outlook. The mid-$400's are talked about more and more often," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Has Mixed Showing Amid Caution After Rally

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed yesterday after surging on Friday after the Federal Reserve surprised the markets by pushing up short-term interest rates.
Foreign exchange dealers said the currency markets were still recovering from Friday's bruising session in which the Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates caused the dollar to soar 3 pfennigs to trade at a intraday high of 1.7640 German marks, its highest in two and a half years. 
 Higher interest rates in the United States make dollar-based assets relatively more attractive than foreign investments.
 "Obviously some people made money on Friday, but a lot got hurt," said Tom Moore, senior director at the American Express Bank.
"There wasn't anything to grab onto and the market was moving so quickly," he said of Friday's trading.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.7590 German marks, unchanged from Friday's close.
Dealers said they were wary of taking the dollar much higher on fears that the Bundesbank of Germany would sell dollars to keep the dollar from rising too quickly against the mark.
 The dollar firmed slightly after the Bundesbank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, speaking in his role as president of the Group of 10 central bank chiefs, said the group was not very concerned about the situation of currency markets after the Fed's move.
 But Mr. Moore said dealers were not soothed by these assurances, noting that "too many people got hit Friday by taking the signals wrong."
The timing of the Federal Reserve's action on Friday caught many traders off guard, since the Commerce Department early in the day had reported modest jobs growth for January. The sign of sluggish growth was expected to forestall higher interest rates.
The dollar eased further against the Japanese yen yesterday ahead of this week's talks between President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Preparatory talks on trade issues have shown no real signs of progress.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 108.56 yen, down from 109.30 yen on Friday. Many traders fear the United States will seek to depreciate the dollar to encourage sales of American goods to Japan if other ways to narrow the trade gap fail.
The British pound rose in New York yesterday to $1.4830 from $1.4765 late Friday.

HEADLINE: Record Japan Trade Surplus

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Japan's current account surplus ballooned 12 percent in 1993, to a record $131.35 billion, the Finance Ministry announced today.
The current account is a broad measure of a nation's international financial flow, which includes merchandise trade, services and tourism. The surplus grew from $117.55 billion in 1992. Japan's huge trade surplus continues to be a source of tension between Japan and its trading partners, particularly the United States. 
 In dollar terms, imports and exports rose in 1993 as Japan's economy faltered into recession. Imports grew 5.7 percent, to $209.85 billion, as exports swelled 6.2 percent, to $351.28 billion.
When expressed in yen, however, the current account surplus fell 2 percent, to 14.602 trillion yen, the ministry said. In 1992, it jumped 53 percent, to 14.902 trillion yen.

HEADLINE: 4% Rise Sought in Science Budget

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Continuing earlier priority given to research and technology, the budget proposed today by the Clinton Administration calls for more spending for research on computers and communications, environmental sciences, manufacturing sciences and diseases like AIDS and breast cancer.
The budget proposal generally spares science the deep spending cuts affecting other parts of Government and increases financing for technology that could have a future economic impact on the nation, officials said. 
 The Administration asked for more than $71 billion in the fiscal year 1995, which will begin Oct. 1, for all Federal research and development, an increase of about 4 percent, or $2.5 billion more than the current year. Of that amount, spending on civilian research and development would increase by about $1 billion, to $32 billion.
Dr. John Gibbons, the President's science adviser, said Mr. Clinton was trying to continue his commitments to science and technology as an investment in the country's future, but had to reserve support for some programs that the Administration would have wanted. "The increases we make have to come at the cost of other things," Dr. Gibbons said at a briefing.
 
Funds for Medical Research
 The White House proposed increases in spending for medical research, including a 4.7 percent rise in money for the National Institutes of Health. Under the proposal, the institutes would get $11.5 billion, about $500 million more than this year, that would include a 6 percent increase in spending on AIDS research and 28 percent more for breast cancer studies.
The National Science Foundation, which supports more than half of the nonmedical basic research at colleges and universities, would receive a 6 percent budget increase to $3.2 billion under the proposal, including an 8.3 percent rise in direct research spending. Funds for research into global climate changes would rise 46 percent to $207 million, while funds for high-performance computing and communications research would rise by 23 percent to $329 million, officials said.
Computing and communications research, much of it connected with the so-called information superhighway advocated by Vice President Al Gore, would also get added support through increases for several other agencies. The Defense Department's budget in that area would rise by $56 million, to $397 million. Increases are also proposed for computer research projects in the budgets of the Energy Department, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies. Governmentwide, the computer-communications initiative would get a proposed $1.2 billion, an increase of 23 percent over this year.
The Administration said it would ask for $14.3 billion for the space program in 1995, a cut of more than $200 million from this year, but would continue support at current or higher levels for the international space station and aeronautical research that would help keep American industry competitive with overseas rivals. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it would spend slightly less than the $2.1 billion cap it had agreed to maintain on space station work, including money to promote Russian participation in the program.
Although the space agency said it would reduce spending by cutting costs on the space shuttle program by more than $50 million and with other economies, the agency said it would increase spending on environmental research from space and even proposed to start a new program.

HEADLINE: Small Budget Steps, Right Direction

 BODY:
What's the difference in budgetary emphasis between President Bill Clinton and President George Bush? Try $14 billion. That's the amount the Clinton Administration has found in a very tight budget to pay for its investment initiatives.
It is tempting to dismiss the redirection of $14 billion in a $1.5 trillion budget as tinkering. But the Administration deserves more credit than the raw numbers suggest. 
 Last year's budget law, which Mr. Clinton rammed through Congress, was needed to bring the Federal deficit down to responsible levels. But it imposed tight constraints on spending. It virtually froze discretionary programs -- everything from defense to border patrols. By 1998 civilian discretionary spending will fall to the lowest levels, relative to the size of the economy, since 1962.
There was little choice but to hammer the discretionary programs because the chief factor driving budget deficits -- the rapid increases in entitlements programs like Medicare and Medicaid -- can't be reined in without reforming the entire health care system. Under the 1993 budget law, Federal spending is expected to rise over the next four years by about $250 billion. But of that total, discretionary spending explains a minuscule $20 billion; entitlements, primarily Medicaid and Medicare, account for $230 billion.
The near freeze on discretionary spending forced the Administration to propose one dollar of cuts in existing programs -- thereby inviting instant opposition in Congress -- for every dollar it wanted to spend on its investments. So it is no surprise this budget proposes nothing bold.
Carving out even small sums for education, training, science and technology was hard. The Administration proposes eliminating more than 100 programs -- saving $3.2 billion -- and cutting an additional $20 billion or so out of several hundred other programs. Some of the cuts -- for oilseed export subsidies and tree planting -- are perennial suggestions, perennially defeated by Congress. Other proposed cuts take on sacred cows, including social programs the Administration concludes are not effective.
Mr. Clinton proposes cutting subsidies that help poor families heat their homes, on the reasonable grounds that he wants Congress to target aid on the truly needy. He proposes cutting money for public housing because there is unused money for this purpose sitting idle. And he proposes cutting money for grants under the Job Training Partnership Act for low-income youth because they do not work well. He also proposes cutting agriculture, space and energy programs.
The cuts are needed to meet the budget caps and to allow $14 billion for his new investment initiatives. He proposes modest increases in science and technology ($1.5 billion), infrastructure construction ($1 billion), and education and training ($3.3 billion).
The last figure allows Mr. Clinton to begin a long-promised school-to-work program that combines classroom instruction with on-the-job training for high school students who are not college bound. Mr. Clinton also plans to improve training and job-locating assistance for dislocated workers.
Other increases are for housing vouchers for the poor, assistance for the homeless, AIDS treatment, environmental protection, nutrition programs for poor mothers and community policing.
Mr. Clinton's budget makes small steps in the right direction. Though they are not enough to make a big impact this year or next, that is not the proper test. If Mr. Clinton succeeds in tilting Federal spending toward investment and away from consumption, this year's small steps could be repeated year after year. Before long, the Federal budget would then target aid to the needy and raise the productivity of everyone.

HEADLINE: Sarajevo: The Right Response

 BODY:
The mortar shell that turned Sarajevo's main market into a killing field Saturday afternoon heightens pressure on NATO leaders, President Clinton included, to find a way to hasten the end of the 22-month-old Bosnia war. But it would be perverse indeed if this latest Serbian atrocity became the occasion for Mr. Clinton to abandon his long and principled resistance to French and British pressure to impose an unjust and unenforceable settlement on the Bosnian Government.
European governments have been playing a cynical game. Until Serbian gunners pushed matters too far last weekend, the Europeans were perfectly willing to use the shelling of Sarajevo and other cities to pressure the Bosnian Government to accept a bad partition plan that denied them vital territory and transit routes. 
 If they now agree to endorse NATO air strikes against the siege guns, they fully expect Washington, in return, to join in their diplomatic gang-up, at the very moment the Bosnian Government has begun to gain military strength, even reversing some of its earlier losses.
Mr. Clinton must tell the Europeans no deal. Instead, he should call on them to lift the one-sided United Nations arms embargo so that the Bosnians can properly defend themselves. In that context, and in that context alone, NATO air strikes, with European as well as American planes participating, could speed a decent end to the conflict.
What has held up air strikes until now is a joint United Nations-European Union strategy based not on stopping aggression but on forcing a negotiated peace. While diplomacy is generally preferable to warfare, the flaw in this strategy has been the false moral equality it has applied to the Serbian and Croatian aggressors and their Muslim victims.
An arms embargo theoretically applied to all sides has until recently disarmed only the landlocked Bosnian defenders, not the Serbian and Croatian attackers who manage to produce or smuggle in all the guns they need. Pressure on the Serbs has consisted of economic sanctions that have grown increasingly porous; the Croats have received little more than words of warning. Meanwhile the Bosnians have been pressured to accept a truncated share of territory by the siege guns shelling Sarajevo and other government-controlled cities.
In the name of this "evenhanded" strategy, European and U.N. officials left that artillery unmolested, despite Security Council resolutions proclaiming those cities protected safe havens and NATO resolutions threatening air strikes unless the Serbs lifted the sieges.
The callous amorality of this "evenhandedness" rightly repelled the Clinton Administration, which, though it had no clear strategy of its own, refused to endorse the efforts of its allies to let the Serbian siege artillery batter the Bosnians into accepting an unjust peace. Not only principle is at stake. Given the bitterness of this conflict, a peace imposed at the bargaining table is guaranteed to be resisted in the forests, mountains and cities of Bosnia. Any international force deployed to enforce or even monitor such a sullen peace is likely to become a target for all sides.
Now the carnage inflicted by the Serbian artillery may be more than any democratically accountable government can abide. But as the Europeans soften their opposition to punitive air strikes, the Clinton Administration must stand firm on the principle of not imposing an unjust peace.

HEADLINE: The Fed Goes For Overkill

BYLINE: By James K. Galbraith; James K. Galbraith, who teaches economics at the University of Texas at Austin, is co-author (with William Darity Jr.) of a textbook, "Macro economics."

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
For years, economists and financial experts and the politicians who take them seriously -- have preached a simple creed. Cut the deficit, they tell us, and interest rates will fall, raising investment, productivity and economic growth.
In 1993, a new Administration took office and acted on this wisdom. One year later, the deficit is billions below earlier predictions and is about to fall even further in the tough new budget cuts that the Administration promises. Yet interest rates are rising. 
 Hey, Congress! Remember those increased taxes and reduced services and benefits you agreed to last year? Remember the jobs and public investment programs you gave up? It was for nothing. You got the deficit down -- and interest rates are going up anyway.
What is the justification for the quarter-point rise in short-term rates announced by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, last week? The stunning fact: there is none. He warned for months about the threat of rising inflation, yet each monthly price index report undercut his predictions. So now we have a pre-emptive strike -- a rise in rates to forestall an inflationary threat that all agree has not appeared. Why not instead cut rates to prevent a rise in unemployment, for which, equally, no evidence exists?
Better still, why not just stand fast? If you can't have low interest rates when budget deficits and inflation are both falling, when can you have them? With a firm commitment to stable and low short-term rates, and with falling inflation alongside slow but steady growth, long-term rates were bound to fall. Now they won't.
Instead, Mr. Greenspan's move will kick off speculative anticipation of higher interest rates, short and long.
President Clinton's reaction has been to offer the lame hope that long-term rates, on which investment is said to depend, will not rise. Of course they will rise once a trend to higher short-term rates is established. And higher interest rates, falling investment and slower economic growth will undercut progress toward smaller budget deficits.
Is politics behind the Fed's move to lock in a high-interest slow-growth policy? With two seats suddenly open, does Mr. Greenspan fear that the consensus behind his policies will soon evaporate? Whatever his motive, Mr. Greenspan has changed direction and, oddly, the Administration is going along with him.
The future of the Clinton Presidency may well depend on steady growth and falling deficits -- and is now possibly on the line. Confronted with this brazen act by the Fed, President Clinton wounds himself by seeming to welcome it.
Congress has two important Federal Reserve reform measures before it. One would give the President power to appoint the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks, whose votes in the monetary Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, can be crucial. The other would simply deny the regional presidents their present vote on the committee, raising the clout of the Presidentially appointed members of the Federal Reserve Board.
Both bills would encourage greater openness at the Fed and help restore policy coordination with the Administration without destroying the Fed's independence. Congress should find a middle ground between these reforms and begin a movement toward passage this year.
President Clinton, for his part, should not wait for the worst -- still-higher rates and an economic slowdown -- and then return to the vocal but ineffective Fed-bashing of the Bush Administration. Rather, he should quickly fill his two seats on the board. He might place a seasoned economist in one and a responsible proponent of a more open and accountable Fed policy in the other.
Then the President could quietly signal to Congress a new receptiveness to Federal Reserve reform. The sooner the Fed feels heat and returns to a responsible and cooperative policy of stable interest rates, the better for us all.

HEADLINE: Bond Rating Agency Takes Better View of State Finances

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 7

 BODY:
New York State's fiscal managers received a vote of confidence today from a major Wall Street credit rating agency, which changed its long-term ratings outlook on the state's general obligation bonds to positive from stable.
The revision by the rating agency, the Standard & Poor's Corporation, does not constitute an upgrading of the state's bond rating, which remains at A-, the lowest of any state. 
 But the change in the long-term outlook, which the agency classifies as negative, stable or positive, suggests that an upgrading is possible if the state maintains its current course, said Vladimir Y. Stadnyk, managing director of Standard & Poor's.
"An outlook change says that over the medium term -- say over the next two or three years -- if life continues like the last two years, a ratings change upward will be in the offing," Mr. Stadnyk said.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo released a statement saying he was gratified by the change.
The Governor would love to see the state's ratings rise this year, when he is running for re-election to a fourth four-year term. Downgradings the state received in the early 1990's were used by Mr. Cuomo's opponents as powerful symbols of his handling of the budget, which was often balanced with nonrecurring sources of revenue and fiscal devices widely seen as gimmicks. The Governor could similarly use an upgrading as an important affirmation of an improvement in the state's financial condition.
But Mr. Stadnyk said Standard & Poor's was not concerned with Mr. Cuomo's timetable. "This doesn't mean that it couldn't happen this year, but it doesn't mean that it will either," he said.
 
Explaining the Change
 Standard & Poor's said in a prepared release that the factors contributing to the revision include "an economy that has begun to record positive albeit slight growth, an operating surplus in fiscal 1993, a projected operating surplus in fiscal 1994, two years of timely budget passage, a realistically based 1995 executive budget that is expected to be passed on time, the projected elimination of the state's annual spring cash flow borrowing for fiscal 1995, and continued attempts at debt reform."
A second ratings agency, Moody's Investors Service Inc., has not changed its rating of the state's general obligation bonds since 1990, when it was lowered to A from A1. Only Louisiana has a lower Moody's rating. Moody's and Standard & Poor's use different rating scales.
Standard & Poor's lowered New York's rating to A from AA- in 1990 and then to A- in 1992. The agency started assigning a long-term ratings outlook in 1991, when New York was given a negative outlook. The outlook was changed to stable last April.
Dennis J. Tompkins, a spokesman for State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, said today's change might lead to a minor reduction in the interest paid by the state when it sells bonds. "It will help, but we can't quantify it," he said. "An actual upgrading of our credit rating would definitely make a difference."
The state's next sale of general obligation bonds is expected to be a refinancing of about $800 million in existing debt. Mr. McCall is awaiting approval from the Legislature to proceed with the sale.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 9, 1994, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about New York State's general obligation bonds referred incompletely to the state's bond rating in some copies. Standard & Poor's lowered New York's rating in 1990 to A from AA-. In 1992, it was dropped to A-, where it remains, the lowest rating of any state.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET;
Who Wins, Who Loses

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

 BODY:
President Clinton's 1995 budget makes changes largely at Government's edge. Its cuts and additions -- a billion here, a few hundred million there -- are dwarfed by the total spending proposal of $1.5 trillion. But the tinkering does follow themes, and some areas will fare better, or worse, than others. Here are some examples. Dollar figures show what the Administration seeks from Congress for each program, not what may be spent in the 1995 fiscal year.
 
WINNERS
 
Technology
 
Just about any program whose title boasts the words "computer" or "research" gains money. Some big winners: the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, once known only for winding the national clock but now a grantor for private research; information "superhighway" research. Still, the total Federal research and development budget, up 4 per cent to $72 billion for 1995, only slightly beats inflation.

 	 	 	 	Program	1994 spending	1995 spending	Increase or		in millions	in mill-prop.	decrease-per.	National Institute of	 	 	 	Standards and Technology	$520	$935	80%	Information highway grants	26	100	285%	Human genome project	128.7	152	18.1%	
 
Education and Training
 
George Bush substantially boosted Head Start funding, but Mr. Clinton goes him several better: he would raise Head Start spending again; sharply increase Federal aid to schools in poor neighborhoods, and pour new money into retraining laid-off workers, among other initiatives.

 	 	 	 	Chapter I programs	 	 	 	for low-income schools	$6,912	$7,579	10%	Safe and Drug-free schools	472	660	40%	"Dislocated" workers	1,118	1,465	31%	
 
Health
 
Mr. Clinton's health plan aside, the budget envisions large spending increases for a select series of preventive care and drug-rehabilitation programs. Spending in the 1995 fiscal year for the National Institutes of Health's many units -- the National Cancer Institute, National Institute for Mental Health, and so on -- would rise a little over 7 per cent, to $11 billion.

 	 	 	 	Childhood immunization	$528	$588	68%	Ryan White Act: AIDS	579	672	16%	Childhood immunizations	755	1,040	68%	
 
Crime-Fighting
 
Law enforcement is basically a state and local responsibility; only 10 percent of the money spent here comes from Washington. But with crime atop the list of public concerns in polls, the new budget mirrors political reality, and seeks big increases for more police and for prosecuting and jailing wrongdoers. A caveat: much funding relies on passage of the crime bill now before Congress.

Public Works
 
One area where the Clinton Administration differs from its Republican predecessors is in its support for construction projects. Democrats believe economic growth flows directly from investments in highways and mass transportation. But even here, the Administration is selective: for example, grants for operating expenses of mass transit systems (13 percent of which is spent in metropolitan New York) would be cut to $600 million from $800 million.

LOSERS
 
Foreign Affairs
 
The State Department would take it on the nose, losing a bigger share of its budget than any other Cabinet agency. Total foreign affairs funding, which includes items like Pentagon military aid and export loans, stays stable but loses ground to inflation. Aid to Israel ($3 billion) and Egypt ($1.8 billion) would not change. A growth area: aid to the United Nations for troops in foreign war zones, up 33 per cent.

Weapons
 
The Administration wants to stretch out contracts for some ships, tanks and planes and to cancel others outright. Energy Department stockpiles of nuclear materials would be drawn down. One weapon prospers: the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice, beloved by the National Rifle Association and despised by liberals, rises $61,000 to $2.54 million. It sells ammunition and trains youngsters to shoot.

 	 	 	 	B-2 Bomber	1,543	800	48%	F-18 Fighter	1,520	1,032	32%	Bradley Armored Vehicle	71	14	80%	
 
Agriculture
 
Long a treasure chest of subsidies to farm interests, the Agriculture Department is ripe for cuts in tight fiscal times, and its budget would drop next year by 5.5 per cent -- before inflation. In trouble: foreign food aid, oilseed subsidies, the Rural Electrification Administration, the Commodity Credit Corporation (which makes loans for farm exports) and a raft of others.

 	 	 	 	Foreign food assistance	1,412	1,245	11.8%	Wool subsidies	193	133.7	30.7%	Electric, telephone loan subsidies	70	19	73%	
 
Public Housing
 
Funding for HUD rises a bit in the budget, by $1 billion to $26.1 billion. But traditional public-housing monies dry up: new construction funding plummets, as does money for renovating old units. Officials say enough money is in the pipeline to keep such programs going; some of the savings would be spent on a Republican idea, housing vouchers, for the poor and homeless.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET: The Overview;
Administration Offers Budget Priorities in Lean Times

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
President Clinton today sent Congress a $1.52 trillion budget that reflected the Government's fiscal constraints, combining spending cuts with modest new initiatives to promote technology, fight crime and expand educational opportunity.
Administration officials said the proposal represented a reordering of the nation's priorities. But there is little sweeping or grand in the Administration's budget for the 1995 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1. The 1994 fiscal year budget is $1.48 trillion. 
 Instead, Mr. Clinton and his fiscal advisers have produced a budget that is permeated with the bitter reality facing a Democratic President who came to office with grand ideas but with little money to pay for them.
White House officials said the new budget, which would reduce appropriations for 7 of the 14 Cabinet-level departments and cut the deficit to $176 billion from the $302 billion that was projected for 1995 a year ago, would set the nation on the correct path.
 
A Decreasing Deficit
 The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the deficit will sink even lower, to $171 billion.
"If the Congress adopts it, it will keep the deficit coming down, it will keep interest rates down, it will send a clear signal to the Fed and to the rest of the world that we mean business and that the investment climate will continue," Mr. Clinton told a business group in Houston today. "These lower interest rates, if they can be maintained, will save over $20 billion in deficit in next year's budget alone and over $150 billion in the next five years."
The Administration predicted a health economy during this calendar year: growth of 3 percent, a 6.4 percent unemployment rate in the last quarter of the year, a 3 percent rate of inflation and short-term interest rates averaging 3.4 percent. The Federal Reserve nudged short-term interest rates up to 3.25 percent on Friday.
Working within the narrow confines imposed by deficit reduction efforts and the strict limits placed on the portion of Federal spending that is not mandatory, Administration officials said the President's proposed budget is designed to lay the groundwork for the battles to come over the health care plan by demonstrating that the Administration is capable of fiscal discipline.
"It seems to me that we have to stop focusing so much on yesterday's labels and focus more on tomorrow's goals," Mr. Clinton said. "The issue isn't whether we go left or right. It's whether we can go forward. And if we don't go forward, it doesn't matter whether we're stuck left or right."
 
Dole Calls Plan Misleading
 The plan is subject to any number of changes by Congress, where some members said today that the proposal did not go far enough in spending cuts. More quietly, others are sure to work to restore money for programs important in their districts.
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, said the Clinton budget was misleading because it did not contain the money the Administration would be forced to come up with to pay for two major initiatives, overhauls of the welfare and health care systems.
He said Federal spending would still rise over all and that the cuts Mr. Clinton had suggested represented only "about one-fifth of one percent of the Federal budget."
Other Republicans asserted that taxes that were approved last year will take effect this year, resulting in a steeper tax burden that is not reflected in the 1995 budget.

 
About $25 Billion Shifted
 In briefings and speeches today, Mr. Clinton and his aides emphasized that the decline in the projected deficit represented the first time the deficit has dropped in three consecutive years since Harry S. Truman was President.
But Leon Panetta, the White House budget director, said the deficit can continue to shrink only if the fastest-growing areas of the budget -- including health care -- are brought under control through more cuts or changes.
"If we want to stay on the deficit-reduction track that we're now embarked on, we've got to begin to address these areas, particularly health care, because health care is the largest culprit in the entitlement programs right now in terms of being out of control," Mr. Panetta said.
Administration officials emphasized the pain of cutting the budget, including actions they said would redirect money from operating subsidies for mass transit, heating aid for the poor and public housing to more efficient programs that serve the same needs.
Mr. Panetta said that about $25 billion of the Government spending that falls beneath the tight spending caps for discretionary programs are simply being shifted from one area to another.
This demonstrated determination to stick to the limits imposed by law, he said, should address the concerns raised in Congress by proponents of a balanced budget amendment that the Administration vigorously opposes.
"While there will always be those who will say: 'Gee, why can't we do more? Why can't we cut someplace else?' and will ultimately vote no because it's always the safe vote to vote no," Mr. Panetta said, "the challenge to them is 'Where do you want to cut?' "
 
'No New Cuts Here'
 George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to the President, said that the budget proposal would take some steam out of the balanced budget drive because the cuts Mr. Clinton has proposed "show how difficult it is to reach the caps as they are now."
But Rep. Timothy J. Penny, the Minnesota Democrat who sponsored a measure that would have slashed an additional $90 billion from the Clinton Administration's five-year budget package, said today that the new budget did not go far enough because it did nothing to restrain mandatory entitlement spending.
"I don't think their budget is the last word on deficit reduction," Mr. Penny said. "This is phase two of last year's budget. There are no new cuts here. They just have new spending that can only be accommodated if they implemented these cuts."
The Administration has also been attempting to derail a balanced budget amendment sponsored by Senators Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, and Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. Proponents of that approach said today they were disappopinted by the Clinton budget.
"It will take more than health care reform to balance the Federal budget," said Warren B. Rudman, a former Republican senator from New Hampshire who is co-chairman of The Concord Coalition, a deficit-reduction group he founded with former Senator Paul E.Tsongas, a former Democratic Senator.
 
Cuts for Federal Work Force
 The Clinton budget also contains about $13.7 billion in spending for programs ranging from Head Start and community policing to drug treatment and job training.
Financing for major policy goals like overhauling health care and welfare will either be proposed later or presented, for accounting purposes, as separate from the budget.
Missing from Mr. Clinton's package this year are the proposals for changes in the income tax structure that overshadowed the President's other initiatives last year. But the Administration has still quietly included a number of excise taxes and fees that will affect smokers, gun dealers and tax deadbeats.
"I hope that you will encourage the members of your delegation, especially this year, when we're not having this contentious fight over the tax issue, to vote for this budget," Mr. Clinton said to the business people in Houston. "Because if we don't do it, we cannot keep the economy recovery going. And if we do it, we can keep the recovery going."
The budget contains a mixed bag for Federal agencies. Mr. Clinton has proposed shrinking the Federal work force by 118,000, increasing Pentagon spending by $3 billion and increasing spending for the homeless by 85 percent.
Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, lawmakers who represent urban areas and a number of special interest groups have already announced that they will challenge much of Mr. Clinton's proposals.
Even stalwart Clinton supporters like the Children's Defense Fund, which praised the Administration's commitment to Head Start and job training programs, offered little support for other areas of the budget.
"It makes no sense that while spending caps squeeze essential investments in children and slash supports for low-income Americans, we maintain Cold War-levels of defense spending in a post-Cold War era," said Sharon Daly, the defense fund's community affairs director. "We can make better choices."
White House officials are already apologetic.
"The reality of getting things passed is tough," said Gene Sperling, an economic policy assistant to the President. "You try to be as bold as you can be and still get things done."

A chart on Tuesday listing programs that would gain or lose money under President Clinton's 1995 budget proposal misstated the amount by which fees for Smokey Bear and Woodsy Owl, characters licensed by the Agriculture Department, would rise. They will rise by $11,000, to a total of $127,000 if the budget proposal is enacted -- not by $9 million, to a total of $127 million.

HEADLINE: Richard M. Bissell, 84, Is Dead; Helped Plan Bay of Pigs Invasion

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Richard M. Bissell Jr., the senior Government official who took responsibility for the Central Intelligence Agency's failed attempt to topple the Castro Government at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba in April 1961, died today at his home in Farmington, Conn. He was 84.
 Mr. Bissell had heart problems, said his aide, Frances T. Pudlo. 
While his role as a principal architect of what became a disaster for the newly installed Kennedy Administration is widely remembered, Mr. Bissell had already made great, largely unsung contributions in other fields of Government service during and after World War II.
 As a special assistant and later the deputy director of plans for Allen Dulles, the C.I.A. chief, he guided the clandestine program for building the high-flying U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, as well as its supersonic successor, the SR-71, and the first orbiting spy satellite, Corona. For this, he became known in aviation circles as a pioneer of aerial reconnaissance.
 
Formed Assassination Team
 Recalling that Mr. Bissell "helped design and develop the specifications for the U-2," Richard Helms, a former Director of Central Intelligence, said today that he would "be remembered in the intelligence community as one of the fathers of high-altitude photographic reconnaissance, which, as it developed, did much to improve intelligence during the cold war."
 As head of clandestine operations, Mr. Bissell was also responsible for the C.I.A.'s creation -- at Kennedy's request after the Bay of Pigs -- of a top-secret assassination project whose target was Fidel Castro, who was then Prime Minister of Cuba.
Mr. Bissell remained in charge of covert operations until Feb. 28, 1962, when his resignation was accepted; he had submitted it nearly 10 months earlier, shortly after the Bay of Pigs operation. On the first anniversary of that failed invasion, Kennedy awarded him the National Security Medal, calling his achievements on behalf of American intelligence "unique."
 
Oversaw Wartime Logistics
 Little in his previous life appeared to point him toward intelligence work, much less clandestine activity.
 He had studied at Yale University and taught economics there in the 1930's. World War II drew him to Washington, where he became the executive director of maritime shipping, supervising the operation to supply American and allied forces around the world.
 In 1946 he went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to teach economics, but with the onset of the cold war, he was lured back to Washington two years later, this time to help run the Truman Administration's program to blunt Soviet advances in Europe with a vast economic recovery effort.
 Mr. Pudlo, who assisted Mr. Bissell with his memoirs for more than two years, said Mr. Bissell was called to the capital from M.I.T. one April afternoon in 1948 to work on the Marshall Plan; he packed, caught the next train and spent the four years as a senior executive of the Economic Cooperation Administration and its successor, the Mutual Security Agency. On his first day he signed authorizations for $35 million in economic aid to Western Europe.
 Richard Mervin Bissell Jr. was born to New England wealth and prominence. His father was president of Hartford Fire Insurance. He attended the Groton School, Yale and the London School of Economics.
 
Forever Linked to a Fiasco
 Though recalled by a friend as "desperately shy," the bespectacled Mr. Bissell was also fiercely independent and sought out challenging jobs.
 His name will always be linked to the Bay of Pigs fiasco, in which a few hundred Cuban exiles who had been trained and armed by the C.I.A. were landed on the Cuban coast without air cover and left to be crushed by Mr. Castro's far superior forces.
 Before the Bay of Pigs, Mr. Bissell had been slated to succeed Mr. Dulles as Director of Central Intelligence. Afterward, Kennedy told him that both he and Mr. Dulles would have to go.
 A C.I.A. review directed by Lyman B. Kirkpatrick in his capacity as inspector general and completed several months after the Cuban operation put most of the blame for the invasion's failure on Mr. Bissell. While Mr. Bissell never complained in public, in 1987 a historian, Jack B. Pfeiffer, accused Mr. Kirkpatrick of having "deliberately distorted" Mr. Bissell's responsibility.
 In an interview with the capital's Evening Star in 1965, Mr. Bissell said the operation had been subjected to "progressive moderations" that changed the invasion's landing site and eliminated the use of air or sea power by United States armed forces.
 "We can be criticized for allowing this chipping away to go on without insisting on the whole plan or on cancellation," he said. "Because we were so involved in seeing it go ahead, we did not insist on as great freedom of action as we needed."
 Mr. Bissell also noted that the Kennedy Administration had made a terrible miscalculation in expecting that the invasion plan could be kept secret. The fact that Cuban exiles were training in Guatemala to invade their homeland was disclosed in The New York Times three months before the actual landing.
 Mr. Bissell said that in retrospect it was an illusion that the Administration would be able to disclaim "plausibly" American involvement in the invasion.
 He is survived by his wife of 53 years, the former Ann Cornelia Bushnell; four sons, Richard M. 3d, of Bangor, Me., Winthrop B., of New Britain, Conn., William G., of Middletown, Conn., Thomas E., of New Britain, and a daughter, Ann H., of Washington.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 23, 1994, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Feb. 8 about Rich ard M. Bissell Jr., a former senior official at the Central Intelligence Agency, connected President Ken nedy with the creation of "a top- secret assassination project whose target was Fidel Castro." The article said that Mr. Bissell was responsible for the project, and that it was creat ed at President Kennedy's request after the failed 1961 invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs.
The obituary should have made it clear that accounts differ on the President's role. A C.I.A. document quotes Mr. Bissell as saying the White House urged the creation of a unit capable of carrying out assassi nations, and Mr. Bissell testified be fore a Senate committee in 1975 that he had no reason to challenge the document's accuracy. But he later testified before the committee that there was no White House urging for such a project.
 There exists no proof of involve ment by President Kennedy.

HEADLINE: 'Awakened' Peasant Farmers Overrunning Mexican Towns

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEOPISCA, Mexico, Feb. 8

 BODY:
With its neatly kept plaza, well-stocked shops and brightly painted homes, this market town in the southern state of Chiapas seems remarkably distant from the peasant uprising that has torn through the highlands and the rain forest not far away.
"Until yesterday, Teopisca was the calmest town in the state," the Mayor, Hector Alvarez Gordillo, said today. 
 On Monday, hundreds of angry peasants poured into Teopisca from outlying farms, seized the town hall and demanded the removal of Mr. Alvarez, the latest in an unbroken and unopposed line of mayors from the Institutional Revolutionary Party of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. And they were not alone.
 
Other Town Halls Seized
 Around the state, peasants in at least a dozen other villages and towns who were apparently inspired by, but not part of, the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army were reported by newspapers and television stations to be demanding the removal of the local authorities. In at least four, the protesters were said to have taken over their town halls in the last 48 hours.
"By grace, the Zapatistas have opened our eyes," said Miguel Hernandez, 36, a Teopisca corn farmer who said he was a stalwart member of the governing party. "We do not know them, but we must thank them. Before, we did not have the valor to do this."
The protests are among the political aftershocks that have hit Chiapas and other parts of Mexico even as a cease-fire between Government and rebel troops nears the end of its fourth week.
In Mexico City and other cities, protesters have held rallies and marches to press the Government to answer the Zapatistas' demands for economic aid, the redistribution of land and better treatment for the country's Indians. Opposition parties have echoed the rebels' call for democratic reforms to the political system, growing more vocal despite promises by governing party leaders that further changes will be made before presidential elections scheduled for Aug. 21.
In Chiapas, nonviolent peasant groups that the Government had hoped to balance against the Zapatistas have instead come out more and more forcefully on the insurgents' side.
The drive against town officials of the governing party appears in at least some instances to be a settling of old scores and local disputes. But among many of the peasants of Teopisca, where Mayor Alvarez was accused of offenses ranging from corruption to sloth, the Zapatista rebellion appears to have set a deeper example.
Today, as hundreds of farmers in straw cowboy hats and scores of their wives and children milled around the central square, the word they used again and again was "awakened." That was what the Zapatistas, they said, had done to them.
"It has been 60 or 65 years that the authorities have been tricking us," said Felipe Oseguera, a 56-year-old corn farmer.
"They have gotten us very accustomed to the lies," he continued. " 'I will give you roads. I will give you land. I will give you everything, but you have to vote for me.' When they get into the office, they forget us, and we continue more wretched than ever. The campesinos have awakened now. Things are no longer as they were before."
As far back as any of the men could remember, there had been only one political party in Teopisca, the one known by its Spanish initials as the PRI. Several farmers recalled the closest they had ever come to supporting an opposition candidate: the time in 1985 when scores of them surrounded men from the town's 10 most powerful families as they met at the Lion's Club to choose the PRI candidate for that year's mayoral election.
The farmers opposed Mario Urbina, an accountant, and instead supported the owner of the local hardware store, another member of one of the powerful families. But after a 16-hour standoff, the farmers said, scores of state policemen came in swinging clubs and rifle butts and drove them from the club. Mr. Urbina was duly elected. And when the hardware store owner, Mr. Alvarez, was finally chosen in 1991, he turned out to be just as bad, they said.
"There was a fear before that we would be stopped by the authorities, and maybe we never had the mentality of defending our rights," said Braulio Gutierrez, 35, a teacher who began to organize the town's first opposition group, a chapter of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, in 1988.
Mr. Gutierrez said that after almost six years he had managed to recruit only about 200 people to the party from the entire municipality of 18,160 residents. But with a few leaders of a large semicollective farm, the Ejido Teopisca, he said he had begun thinking in the days after the Zapatista uprising that something new must be tried.
"We do not support their method of violence, but we are in favor of their demands," Raimundo Gonzalez Vazquez, 39, the elected leader of the ejido, said of the rebels.
 
Mayor Denies Most Charges
 Mayor Alvarez sat only a few dozen feet away, telephoning potential supporters. He roundly denied most of the accusations against him: that he had never distributed promised food and medicines, that he had lied about patching up a dirt road and that he had botched a project to improve the town's water system.
Among people who lived in the town itself there was some support for the Mayor. But among the peasants, there seemed to be almost none.
"This was like a plant that had never died but never grew, either," said Mauricia Velazquez, a nun at the local Roman Catholic church. "Now the earth beneath them has moved, and the plant is growing."

HEADLINE: 2 Bills to Bolster School Methods Clear the Senate

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
The Senate today passed two bills that the Clinton Administration hopes will create a better-educated work force to face increasing global competition: one would stress educational achievement, and the other would link schools to businesses.
Relatively little money has been budgeted for either measure. Both are rather vague. And both rely heavily on the ingenuity and commitment of individual states and school districts to work. In fact, some people have criticized them as empty promises to reach unattainable goals. 
 Yet, both are popular among lawmakers. The bill on raising educational achievement levels, known as Goals 2000, was passed 71 to 25; the bill focusing on job skills, known as the School-to-Work Transition Act, was passed 62 to 31. Both measures have already cleared the House and President Clinton endorsed them in the State of the Union Message.
At a news conference before the vote on Goals 2000, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, called the bills a down payment toward real change, and Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, said they were a solid beginning after a decade of debate.
 
Doubt on Targets
 But on the Senate floor on Friday, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, criticized the Goal 2000 targets in particular as unreasonable within the time frame allowed. But he voted for the bill.
The Goals 2000 legislation earmarks $422 million to establish voluntary national educational goals and sets the year 2000 as the date by which American students should be first in the world in math and science, among other achievements.
The school-to-work legislation, which was jointly written by the departments of Labor and Education, is intended to blend schoolwork and work skills. It is backed by $300 million in 1995 and would be financed in diminishing amounts in coming years.
Both bills try to address educational failures from kindergarten through high school.
Noting that half the nation's students never attend college and only 20 percent receive college degrees, Senator Kennedy quoted from a Government Accounting Office study that shows that Federal aid for each student -- including grants to the students and to the schools -- averages $15,200 a year for college graduates, compared with $1,460 for young people who do not go to college.
 
Gap Between Students
 That gap, he said in comments on the Senate floor, has left about 75 percent of all the nation's students at a disadvantage. "For those who are not college-bound," he said, "we offer pitifully little."
A series of studies have shown that American high school students performing poorly in comparison with those in other industrialized nations in subjects like math, science and history. And Labor Department statistics show a growing income gap between students who receive college degrees and those who do not.
Those facts, taken together, have convinced many educators that high schools must be radically improved lest America fall behind economic competitors in Asia and Europe.
"The United States has one of the best systems of higher education in the world," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said. "But among the industrial nations we have one of the worst systems for getting people from school to work."
Under the school-to-work measure, local programs would be set up at the district level to mix work skills with academic studies. Some programs following that model already combine traditional classroom work with programs that pair students with professionals in local businesses or have reoriented schoolwork to incorporate work issues. For example, students studying math might be taught fractions by an architect, or other students might use the stock market as a way to look at the concept of percentages.
 
Praise for Passage
 William M. Bloomfield, the executive director of a policy group that has been setting up such programs through foundation grants and contributions from private businesses for eight years cheered the passage of the bill as critical for essential changes in the way young Americans are taught. "The school-to-work legislation is exactly what we are doing," he said. "It's chock full of all the right stuff."
The legislation will set up a system of grants to help small programs start. "The idea," Mr. Reich said, "is to get this started and then leave it to be taken on by the states."
The Goals 2000 legislation, in contrast, includes increased Federal money for school districts over several years to help them adopt broad goals that will include meeting national standards in core subjects, helping up to 90 percent of all high school students get their diplomas and insuring that every student starting school is ready to learn.

HEADLINE: California Cuts Early Estimate Of Quake Costs

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 8

 BODY:
California officials said today that the destruction caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake and its aftershocks would be far less costly than they previously estimated.
The state's estimate of total damage -- including homes, buildings and public property like highways and schools -- now ranges from $13 billion to $20 billion, said Dick Andrews, director of the Governor's Office of Emergency Services in Sacramento. Previous state damage estimates, based on a computer model, ranged from $15 billion to $30 billion. 
 If the revised figures hold up, the quake will be the nation's second most expensive natural disaster after Hurricane Andrew, which caused about $30 billion in damage in 1992.
State officials said their initial evaluation of the quake's economic damage had been made in the first 24 hours after the quake and was based on a computer model that had used figures from past earthquakes and information about population density and construction.
 
One of the Costliest Disasters
 The estimates were then updated as state engineers and seismic experts surveyed affected areas and provided a more accurate assessment of the damage, the officials said.
"The impact and severity of this earthquake has not changed with these numbers," Mr. Andrews said. "It is still clearly among the most costliest disasters in United States history, and we were simply using the best models available in deterring its price tag."
The officials noted that the latest damage estimates were preliminary and likely to change as they learned more about the toll of the earthquake, which registered 6.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion.
 
Dwellings the Chief Casualties
 Houses and other small buildings were hardest hit. State officials said today that they expected residences to account for 42 percent of the damage. They said damage to slifeline services like transportation, like bridges, freeways and other roads, as well as water, power and communications would account for 29 percent of the destruction. Damage to industries was 18 percent of the total; commercial buildings made up 10 percent, while government structures, including schools, represented only 1 percent, the state said.
The bulk of damage from the earthquake will be paid for by the Federal, state and local governments, state finance officials said today at a news conference in Sacramento. Russell S. Gould, director of the state finance department, said the cost of the earthquake to government agencies had been estimated at $11.6 billion.
The Federal Government's share of these costs is $9.5 billion, the state's share is $1.9 billion, and local agencies' share is $135 million, Mr. Gould said. The breakdown of what each government entity was expected to pay was based on the $8.6 billion emergency aid bill that the House passed last week. The Federal Government has already disbursed about $900 million for emergency aid and repairs.
 
$2.5 Billion in Insurance Losses
 The Senate was expected to consider the measure on Wednesday, and Congressional leaders hoped to have it on President Clinton's desk by the end of the week.
In addition to the Federal aid, insurance industry executives said Monday that they expected to pay out about $2.5 billion for damages to residential and commercial property from the earthquake. Because of the high cost of insurance, only about 25 percent of California homeowners have earthquake coverage, the executives said.
But it remained unclear exactly how the state and local agencies would finance their part of the earthquake tab. Indeed, with the total damage estimate from $13 billion to $20 billion, there is likely to be a big gap that has to be covered by individuals, businesses and state and local government.
 
How to Pay for It?
 Mr. Gould of the state finance department said that the state was considering several options to raise its $1.9 billion, including bond issues, income taxes and cuts in services. "It's a huge cost to use in a very difficult budget year," Mr. Gould said. "It becomes one more pressure among many."
Willie Brown, the Speaker of the California Assembly, has proposed a quarter-cent sales tax increase to finance California's part of the bill. The sales tax increase would raise an estimated $1.5 billion, but Gov. Pete Wilson has said he thought the proposal was premature.
"Although he hasn't ruled it out, the Governor's initial reaction is not to favor a tax increase, given the state of the economy in California," said Paul Kranhold, a spokesman. "Now that we know what the bill is, we have to sit down and figure out how to pay for it."

HEADLINE: Home Prices In 3.4% Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Home prices for many Americans were rising faster than inflation at the end of last year and the outlook is for more of the same this year, a real estate trade group said today.
The National Association of Realtors predicted that mortgage rates would remain low in 1994. 
 Prices for previously owned homes nationally were up 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993, compared with the final three months of 1992, the association said. Inflation rose 2.7 percent for 1993.
"All the factors are there -- low rates, an improving economy, an ample supply of housing and willing consumers," said Robert H. Elrod, the president of the association. "The timing has been perfect for both buyers and sellers."
The association is forecasting an increase of 3.6 percent in home prices nationally this year.
Its latest figures are based on a survey of sales of previously owned single-family detached and attached homes in 131 metropolitan areas.
All sections of the nation showed gains. The price gain for the Midwest was 4 percent, followed by 3.6 percent in the South, 1.7 percent in the Northeast and eight-tenths of a percent in the West. Prices ranged from $360,000 in Honolulu to $52,500 in Waterloo-Cedar Falls, Iowa.

HEADLINE: U.S. Calls Japanese Economic Stimulus Insufficient

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration gave a cool reception yesterday to the Japanese Government's economic stimulus program, saying it was probably too short in duration to produce the increase in Japanese purchases of American goods needed to shrink Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States.
The downbeat American response to the Japanese tax cuts, coupled with the lack of progress in the negotiations between Japan and the Clinton Administration for opening certain Japanese markets, is making it increasingly likely that the summit meeting on Friday in Washington between President Clinton and the Japanese Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, is going to be confrontational. 
 American officials are still hoping for a last-minute compromise by Japan, but so far there is no sign of that, as Mr. Hosokawa's Government is engulfed in political turmoil.
 
Trying to Placate Washington
 It was partly in an effort to have something to take to Washington to placate the Americans that Mr. Hosokawa put together a $140 billion package of temporary tax cuts and public works programs, intended to lift Japan out of its two-year-old recession and help shrink its huge trade surplus by stimulating Japanese consumer purchases.
To get the package through his Parliament, Mr. Hosokawa had to make concessions to opponents of the tax cuts by agreeing that the 20 percent income tax reduction at the heart of his plan would be for only one year.
"I am concerned that it is only for one year," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in a telephone interview. Because it is only for one year, he added, it leaves the prospect for a long-term stimulus "indefinite."
Mr. Bentsen said the American experience had been that "when people see a short-term stimulus they usually save rather than spend," and that therefore there was no long-term change in buying habits or real, sustainable surge in imports.
Both are essential if Japan's $50 billion trade surplus with the United States is to be reduced.
By his public reaction, Mr. Bentsen seems to be trying to send the Japanese a last-minute signal that if this is all Prime Minister Hosokawa can take to Washington for his meeting with President Clinton, this summit meeting may be in trouble.
 
Six Months of Negotiations
 Mr. Hosokawa is going to Washington to review the last six months of negotiations between the Clinton Administration and Japan, which have been aimed at shrinking Japan's trade surplus with the United States.
The Japanese stimulus package is half of what the United States was looking for from Tokyo. The other half was concrete Japanese agreements to open their markets in the areas of automobiles and auto parts and Government procurement of medical equipment, telecommunications and insurance.
Progress in these market access talks has been virtually nonexistent, or as Mr. Bentsen put it, "I don't see a breakthrough happening yet." He said that where the Japanese Government could really decide to make a breakthrough quickly, if it wanted, was in Government procurement, but that so far there had been little movement.
Clinton Administration officials say that they believe they are in a win-win situation when it comes to the summit meeting: either Mr. Hosokawa will make some last-minute concessions and Mr. Clinton will be able to hold up the results as a victory, or the President will take a publicly very harsh line with the Japanese, which officials believe will play well with the American people.
For that strategy to pay off in the long run, though, Mr. Clinton needs some unilateral means to open Japanese markets, and it is not at all clear that he has such weapons in his trade arsenal.
 
Japan's Largest Stimulus
 Mr. Hosokawa's stimulus plan, the fourth economic rescue operation the Japanese Government has mounted in the last two years, is the largest ever proposed in Japan.
It includes a nearly $55 billion one-time income tax rebate and unusual plans to revive the battered Japanese real estate market, where prices have tumbled more than 50 percent in the last four years. It also provides for helping commercial banks manage a mountain of bad loans left over from the reckless boom of the 1980's.
But several key compromises watered down the plan. Because the 20 percent income tax reduction will be for just one year, the plan will do less than many analysts in Japan had hoped to lift the economy out of recession.
The governing Hosokawa coalition decided not to extend the reduction for additional years because it could not agree on how to finance it. The Socialists, the largest party in the coalition, have proposed issuing Government bonds, while conservatives have insisted that some other source of revenue must be found to avoid an increase in the Government's budget deficits.
Economists in Tokyo have said the new plan should make the difference between the Japanese economy's shrinking again this year or posting modest growth of 1 percent or less.
The chaotic process of compiling the huge stimulus package, and the internecine fighting over its contents, took a heavy toll on Mr. Hosokawa's once-sparkling reputation.
His coalition partners objected to the fact that Mr. Hosokawa had initially proposed an income tax cut, and then a big increase in the national sales tax after a three-year delay to cover the loss in revenues. An embarrassed Mr. Hosokawa said today, "I apologize for giving the impression that the tax proposal was hastily put together."

HEADLINE: SOUTH KOREA TRIES TO SOOTHE NORTH

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Fearing that the invective from North Korea has become increasingly ominous, South Korea's President, Kim Young Sam, convened the country's national security council today and then issued a series of conciliatory messages, saying "dialogue will be maintained as long as possible" over the inspection of the North's nuclear sites.
Mr. Kim's meeting came just before South Korea's Foreign Minister, Han Sung Joo, headed to Washington in an effort to come up with a new strategy to persuade the North to relent on inspections before the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors meets in Vienna on Feb. 21. Unless North Korea has permitted a thorough inspection by that time, the agency is expected to refer the issue to the United Nations Security Council for the imposition of sanctions. 
 In a telephone interview today, Mr. Han said, "There needs to be a calming down on both sides."
The meeting and Mr. Han's trip underscored what appears to be a growing anxiety in South Korea that United Nations sanctions against the North are now almost inevitable. Seoul does not share Washington's view that with negotiations having produced no progress so far, it is time to increase the pressure on North Korea.
 
Fear of Losing Options
 "We can always go the Security Council route," a South Korean official said recently, "but it will be difficult to turn back from it once we start. So we have to explore every avenue first."
South Korean and Japanese officials say they are particularly concerned that several recent moves by Washington, including the announcement of plans to deploy Patriot anti-missile units in South Korea, have created an atmosphere in which the North Korean leaders feel that they cannot gracefully back down and allow inspectors into the nuclear sites at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang.
Meanwhile, the United States is moving to insure that it is prepared in case the North Korean Government of Kim Il Sung tries to carry through on its vague threats of military action in response to economic sanctions. A small team of supervisors from the Central Intelligence Agency was recently sent to Seoul to beef up the agency's station there and to step up monitoring of North Korean troop movements.

HEADLINE: For National G.O.P., a Mayor as a Poster Boy;
Schundler, an Unabashed Conservative, Wants to Use Image to Help Jersey City

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

 BODY:
A new Republican Party flier features photographs of Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole, Margaret Thatcher and Bret Schundler.
Bret Schundler?
"I looked at it and just started laughing," said Mr. Schundler, whose claim to fame is that he was elected Mayor of Jersey City last year. 
 But in national Republican circles, no one is laughing. The party is marketing the 35-year-old political neophyte as if he were its savior. Not since the elephant has the party trumpeted a symbol so loudly.
The appeal of Mr. Schundler, an unabashed conservative and a onetime Democrat, lies in what he preaches: a gospel of lower taxes, less government and more police that has found an unlikely home in Jersey City, long a stronghold of Democratic machine politics. How, or whether, that gospel will transform a working-class city plagued by crime, drugs and general urban despair will not be clear until Mr. Schundler has been in office longer.
 
An 'Exciting' Mayor
 In virtually every major speech, the party's national chairman, Haley Barbour, cites Mr. Schundler, who runs the 67th largest city in the United States, certainly more often than he mentions the two Republican Mayors who won election last year in the first and second largest cities, Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles.
Mr. Schundler has no shortage of other promoters.
Representative Newt Gingrich, the No. 2 House Republican, calls him "the most exciting Republican in the country." And Jack F. Kemp, a former Federal Housing Secretary and a Republican Presidential hopeful, puts it this way, "He is the gold standard when it comes to political leadership in America today."
All the fuss over Mr. Schundler is not over what he has accomplished. Though he has reduced city spending, lowered taxes and proposed an economic plan that would make Jersey City look like one big enterprise zone, he has had little time to make his mark.
The attention comes out of the shock that Mr. Schundler was elected in the first place. Though his initial victory was as much a result of odd political circumstances as his own popularity, he is living proof that a political party criticized for rejecting minorities and the problems of inner cities can have one of its own elected from a poor city with a large minority population.
 
First in a Field of 19
 After Mr. Schundler's predecessor, Gerald McCann, was sent to prison after being convicted on Federal fraud charges, Mr. Schundler narrowly won a special election in November 1992, finishing first in a field of 19 candidates. Six months later, he won a full term with 68 percent of the vote.
"We've taken a beating for years for not being able to have a significant number of black Americans support us," said Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., a former Republican national chairman. "So when you have someone who is successful, it's something that we're very very pleased with. He is a conservative and doesn't run away from that."
Republicans have the statistics committed to memory: Mr. Schundler triumphed in a city where only 6 percent of the population is registered Republican, where no Republican had won since 1917. This came in a city that is 30 percent black, 25 percent Hispanic and 10 percent Asian-American -- not the natural habitat for Republicans. Part of Mr. Schundler's appeal is that while he is a conservative, his approach is not conventional. He has taken a different tack in trying to draw working-class voters. Besides campaigning for lower taxes, less spending and more police, he emphasized less traditional ideas like enterprise zones and privatizing government services. But his top priority -- one that he pushes on the Sunday interview programs in Washington and on the lecture circuit -- is turning Jersey City's schools, which the state took over five years ago, into a national model with a system of education vouchers.
Less a self-promoter than an earnest, sometimes pedantic, elected official, Mr. Schundler likes to talk at length about his plans. But perhaps because of all the attention, he sees his mission in historic terms. "I don't think many people remember the Continental Congress," he said in a recent Washington interview after appearing with Senator Dole as a featured guest in the premiere of a new Republican television program available by satellite.
"So I don't think holding office per se means diddly. But I would love Jersey City to be thought of as a place where another revolution occurred, a revolution to help urban America have a chance again."
 
Looking at His Goals
 Still learning his way around City Hall, Mr. Schundler is wise enough to laugh off those who say he should run for a higher office. His prominence as a Republican poster boy, he said, only encourages him as Mayor.
"Some of the people in Jersey City say, 'Do you think about running for higher office?' " he said. "I say, 'No, no, no, no.' What I want to do is be remembered in history someday for doing school choice in Jersey City. Let's see a poor child in Jersey City literally look at the best public schools in America and choose between them. And do it without increasing taxes by one penny."
Some Republicans snicker at attempts by party leaders to use Mr. Schundler as their new symbol. They say the leaders seized on him because they are desperate to prove that the party can appeal to minority voters.
 
'Their Weak Link'
 "That has been their weak link," said Christopher Mobley, a professor of political science at De Paul University in Chicago. "Republicans are thinking that he might assist them in providing a compelling alternative that appeals to African-American voters."
One reason Mr. Schundler knows how to appeal to a Democratic constituency is because of his own past as a Democrat. A 1981 graduate of Harvard University, he plunged into politics as a New Jersey coordinator for former Senator Gary Hart, who was running for the 1984 Democratic Presidential nomination. Then he went to work on Wall Street for Salomon Brothers, the huge investment banking house. He changed his party registration to Republican in 1991 to make an unsuccessful run for one of Hudson County's three State Senate seats. His election to City Hall was his first successful bid for elective office.
With all the other Republican success stories last year -- the victories of Mayors Giuliani and Riordan and Govs. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and George F. Allen in Virginia -- it still may seem confounding that so many Republican leaders want to be seen with Mr. Schundler.
The answer, perhaps, is that he is young enough to be seen as a politician with a long future. And he is a fresh face who is reasonably well liked. And, unlike Mr. Giuliani or Mrs. Whitman, he did not make powerful enemies from bruising campaigns.
Another explanation may be that while Mr. Schundler eagerly identifies himself with the Republican Party, other newly elected mayors are taking pains not to play up their partisan identities. Advisers to Mr. Riordan and Mr. Giuliani said it might hurt those mayors to be featured at Republican events.
But Mr. Kemp, who spoke at Mr. Schundler's swearing in and sees him as something of a protege, said he thought the new Mayor had fresher ideas than his colleagues from bigger cities -- ideas, it turns out, that Mr. Kemp has himself expounded.
 
'Heart and Soul'
 "With all due respect, I've been pleased with Rudy Giuliani's appointments and the steps he's taken, and so I wouldn't in any way criticize him," Mr. Kemp said. "But when it comes to school choice and enterprise zones, issues that touch the heart and soul of the inner cities, Schundler is closer to the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the times, than some of the mayors of larger cities."
The risk for Mr. Schundler is that rising stars do not always live up to the praise. He is white, but could risk the fate of Alan Keyes, who is black. Mr. Keyes, who served in the Bush and Reagan Administrations, was touted as the Republican Party's shining example of a leader who could appeal to minority voters. But in 1988 he was clobbered in his bid to unseat Senator Paul Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat. By 1992, Mr. Keyes was openly criticizing the Republican Party of racial bias.
Mindful that the favorable publicity could come to haunt him, Mr. Schundler says he feels the pressure.
"At the end of four years, if Jersey City isn't a safer and cleaner city, if we don't have better schools, better recreational opportunities for our kids, and if we don't have lower taxes and more jobs," he said, "I'm going to be awfully embarrassed."

HEADLINE: Stocks Are Stable as Dow Dips a Fraction

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Wall Street stepped back a bit yesterday from Monday's aggressive purchases, with stock prices barely moving off dead center. Still, the market was seemingly stable despite a drop in the bond market that normally would have led to a fall in stocks.
Market watchers leaned on favorite Wall Street cliches like "consolidation" and "taking a breather" to describe the market action, as investors seemed to have completed their purchase of suddenly cheaper brand-name stocks in the wake of Friday's nearly 100-point drop in the Dow and Monday's surprising 35-point rally. 
 But to many analysts, the real test will be whether portfolio managers, who control billions of dollars of stocks for pension funds and mutual funds, will bolt from the market.
Although the Dow has risen about 4 percent so far this year, portfolio managers have become nervous since Friday's steep plunge in stock prices. With short-term interest rates rising, some might be tempted to move their funds further into cash by putting some money in Treasury bills and other short-term money market investments.
"You have to get into the mind of a portfolio manager who doesn't want to lose his job," said Anthony F. Dwyer, chief market strategist for Sherwood Research Group. "If the weakness in the market increases, I'm going to look stupid if cash outperforms me."
Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.29 of a point, to 3,906.03, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 0.71 of a point, to 471.05. The Nasdaq composite index was the better performer, with a 3.5-point rise, to 782.70.
"Today was a housekeeping day," said David D. Holt, vice president for market research at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "It was a little bit more like a normal day before last Friday -- extremely selective, lots of volume, but a fairly narrow trading range."
Investors are paying attention to this week's $40 billion refunding for Treasury bills and notes that is sure to influence the Federal Reserve Board's decision on whether to further raise interest rates later this year.
But they do not seem to be taking action even though United States bond yields rose to a six-month high yesterday, increasing corporate borrowing costs. The benchmark 30-year bond rose to 6.44 percent, from 6.39 percent Monday. Mr. Holt said investors were focusing, if a bit tentatively, on corporate earnings, which have been favorable so far. "As long as more profits are coming in, it's going to outbalance the higher cost of borrowing," he said.
On the New York Stock Exchange, almost six stocks rose for every five that fell. The N.Y.S.E. composite index fell 0.05 point, to 261.96. Trading volume, kept relatively light by a snowstorm in New York City, totaled 318.2 million shares, down from Monday's 348.3 million.
Spectrum Information Technologies, the troubled company thrown into further turmoil by the resignation of John Sculley, its chief executive, was again the most actively traded stock yesterday. Its share price rose 5/16 , to 29/16 .
Sears, Roebuck, which reported disappointing earnings, and Procter & Gamble, which reported no news that might affect its stock, were the two largest declining stocks in the 30-stock Dow Jones average. They accounted for a more than 10-point drag in the Dow. Sears fell 3 1/4, to 47 3/4, while P.& G. lost 1 1/4, to 57.
Still, price increases at cyclical stocks like Caterpillar largely offset the declines in Sears and P.& G. Caterpillar gained 2 3/4, to 108.
Cyclical stocks are thought to rise and fall with the economy, and with evidence of an expanding economy investors tend to buy these shares.

HEADLINE: Rising Tory Politician Found Dead Mysteriously

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Prime Minister John Major's Government faced more problems today after a promising Conservative Member of Parliament was found dead mysteriously.
The death of the 45-year-old legislator, Stephen Milligan, who was well known from a career in journalism and had been regarded as a politician with a future since his election in 1992, filled the front pages of newspapers today. 
 He was found dead on Monday afternoon in his London apartment, naked except for women's stockings and garter belt and was said to have a plastic bag around his head and an electric cord wrapped around his neck.
Pending results of an autopsy, the police could not rule it a suicide, a murder or an accidental death during sex with or without a partner. A preliminary postmortem was "inconclusive," Scotland Yard said today.
But whatever the finding, the case promises to embarrass the Tories and hurt them politically, coming as it does after a month of scandals.
The stream of lurid headlines about ministers having affairs and fathering children out of wedlock has made a mockery of Mr. Major's attempts to get his party back on the tracks by a campaign he calls "back to basics."
First unveiled at the Conservative Party Congress in October as a philosophy that might bind the party together, it was intended as a battle cry for a return to family values, a strengthening of basic education and high standards of public service.
Conservative leaders now assert that "back to basics" was never intended as a statement of moral rectitude. They suggest that the private life of a politician should not be splashed in the press. But Mr. Milligan's death seems likely to test both assertions.
The bad news comes just as Mr. Major has embarked on an effort to improve his image and give it the tint of a decisive and tough leader. Last week he dealt with a delegation of rebellious Tory back-benchers who had leaked their plans to demand a Cabinet shake-up by dismissing them after a meeting that lasted only two minutes. His move was praised by some as a "no more Mr. Nice Guy" stance that would win him points with the voters.
The Prime Minister has sunk to the bottom in the polls, with the latest showing Labor ahead by 20 points. The parties are facing local elections on May 5 and then elections to the European Parliament on June 9. A bad showing in both would undoubtedly prompt a challenge to Mr. Major's leadership, politicians agree.
An Oxford graduate and former journalist who worked as a reporter and editor for The Economist, as the Washington correspondent and foreign editor for The Sunday Times and as a broadcaster for the British Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Milligan was a member of Britain's inner circle. A bachelor, he was hard-working and serious. In a move that usually portends a Cabinet post, he had been appointed parliamentary private secretary to the arms procurement minister, Jonathan Aitken, in the Defense Ministry.
Government officials said today that Mr. Milligan did not have access to classified information in the ministry and asserted there was "no security angle" to his death. The reassurance seemed designed to pre-empt comparisons to the 1960's scandal centering on Defense Minister John Profumo, who was forced to resign after denying a liaison with a prostitute whose clients included a Soviet military attache.
Mr. Milligan's death reduces the Conservative majority in the House of Commons to 18, with three by-elections for vacant seats to be held soon. Two of the seats are in districts that usually go to Labor. The third is Mr. Milligan's in Eastleigh in Hampshire, which he won by 17,702 votes. A swing of only 11.6 percent would give the seat to the opposition Liberal Democrats, who won by-elections in nearby constituencies by larger margins in May and July.
The scandals that have dogged Mr. Major began after Christmas when the Environment Minister, Tim Yeo, who is married, was forced to admit that he had fathered a child by a Tory local councilor. In January he was forced to resign by a constituents group. It then emerged that years ago as a 22-year-old student he had also fathered an illegitimate child.

HEADLINE: LARGE TAX BURDEN IS SEEN FOR YOUNG

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Deep in the four-volume Federal budget President Clinton released on Monday is a detailed analysis of some bad news that Government officials don't usually draw attention to: if present trends continue, today's toddlers are likely to pay in taxes half of what they earn in their entire lives, and children yet unborn will probably have it even worse.
The idea that the Federal Government is shifting wealth between generations had been discussed for years before becoming a prominent political issue during the 1992 Presidential campaign, when Ross Perot warned that by allowing persistent budget deficits, Americans were effectively spending their children's inheritance. 
 But the most detailed Government examination yet of the issue appears in a section of Mr. Clinton's budget that examines the extent to which today's budget deficit imposes a financial burden on young Americans.
Administration officials say that one reason for pointing all this out is to help build the case for the President's health package, which they see as the key to holding down the long-term growth of Federal spending. Another reason is to illustrate that without last year's budget, which cut this year's deficit, the burden on future generations would have been even greater.
 
Seeking Short-Term Sacrifice
 The analysis builds its forecasts on the assumption that nothing is changed, in the hope of building support for policies of short-term sacrifice for long-term benefit.
"We were placing such a huge burden on future generations that we needed to ask today's generation, as well as those who benefit from Federal programs, to sacrifice a little bit," said Barry J. Toive, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget.
The budget estimates that as health care and Social Security costs continue to rise, young Americans in general will pay significantly more of their lifetime income as Federal, state and local taxes than their parents and grandparents did. These taxes are rising even if Government payments to individuals, like Social Security checks, are deducted.
"This is really a catastrophe that we're preparing for our kids," said Laurence J. Kotlikoff, a Boston University economics professor who helped the White House's Office of Management and Budget prepare the figures.
So-called net taxes, calculated by subtracting Government payments to individuals from taxes paid, will total 36.9 percent of lifetime income for today's teen-agers, according to the Clinton proposal. This compares with 33.2 percent for Americans born in 1950 and 23.6 percent for those born in 1900.
In its last two years, the Bush Administration began reckoning the lifetime tax burdens of the budget deficit, but buried the results even more deeply than the Clinton Administration, and the figures were little noticed.
In a more speculative calculation, the Administration forecast that the average net tax rate for future generations would eventually reach 82 percent of their lifetime earnings. Without last year's budget package, the burden would be 93.7 percent, the budget document said, while passage now of the President's health care plan would lower the burden to 66.5 percent.
These calculations of income distribution among generations, known as generational accounting, have become increasingly popular in academic circles and among politicians who want to balance the budget, because it highlights the long-term consequences of continued deficit spending.
 
Leery of Calculations
 But some economists maintain strong reservations about these forecasts. "This is a very useful procedure for use in an academic setting," said Henry J. Aaron, the director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "It's not good enough for government work."
Mr. Aaron said that the tiniest changes in the initial assumptions could result in huge changes in the final results. Because these changes are hard to spot, and because Government officials may have a strong incentive to tilt the final results, the results are not reliable enough to be used in Federal policymaking, he said.
Alan J. Auerbach, a University of Pennsylvania economist who joined Mr. Kotlikoff and Jagadeesh Gokhale, an economist at the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank, in helping the Office of Management and Budget prepare its forecast, said that such criticisms were misleading. Generational accounting is based on current laws and demographics, and these do not change quickly, he said, adding, "It's pretty predictable that a 45-year-old today is going to be a 65-year-old 20 years from now."
Still, the techniques sometimes produce odd results. For example, the Clinton budget does not forecast that each generation of living Americans will face a higher net lifetime tax rate than the previous generation. Instead, it estimates that Americans born in 1980 will face a peak rate of 36.9 percent, while for babies born in 1992, the net rate dips slightly to 36.3 percent.
The reason is that the model assumes continued, unrestricted growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending, Mr. Kotlikoff said. So today's toddlers would be paying a lot of taxes but would eventually receive a large chunk of the money back from the Government as their medical bills in old age become enormous.


GRAPHIC: The President's 1995 budget includes the first Federal estimates of the average tax burden that different generations pay over the course of their lives, minus payments like Social Security that people get back from the Federal Government. The rates are rising with successive generations, partly because the Federal Government handles more activities now and partly because it is borrowing money on which later generations must pay the interest.

Little Respect for Former Capitol Star

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Not so long ago, the submission of the President's budget to Congress was one of the big news events of the year. Big surprises were the rule: sometimes vast new programs or sometimes radical changes in the way the Government does business.
The details of the Great Society were revealed in a Lyndon B. Johnson budget. Richard M. Nixon once proposed in a budget to combine all the Cabinet departments into four giant agencies. Ronald Reagan explained in his first budget how he would slash taxes, build up the military and balance the budget with one hand tied behind his back. 
 In those days, budget documents were distributed to reporters and Congressional staffs on a Friday with the understanding that they would not be written about or discussed publicly until the next Monday. No one complained. It gave reporters and editors the weekend to digest complicated material and lawmakers time to think about how they wanted to respond.
How times have changed!
When President Clinton presented his budget on Monday, "it was about as exciting a time as Ground Hog Day," said Stanley E. Collender, director of Federal budget policy at Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm.
"I do a lot of work with people in the bond market," Mr. Collender said today. "Those guys just didn't want to hear about the budget yesterday. They said, 'O.K., thanks, but we're paying attention to other things now.' "
One reason Presidents' budgets are less compelling nowadays is that Congress no longer accepts them uncritically.
In part, that is a consequence of so many years of divided Government, with Republicans in the White House and Democrats controlling Congress. But it is even more the result of Congressional budget procedures set up 20 years ago.
Before the mid-1970's, Congress had no mechanism for considering the budget systematically. But then the budget committees and the Congressional Budget Office were established. Gradually, Congress began to assert the power of the purse granted it by the Constitution. For the last decade at least, the big budget news has come off Capitol Hill, not out of the White House.
A second reason why budgets create less of a splash is that they were treated so cynically during the Bush Administration. They have always been primarily political documents. But recognizing that his proposals stood no chance in Congress, the impresario of Bush budgets, Richard G. Darman, turned them into polemics with rhetorical flourishes and ludicrous forecasts.
Four years ago, for example, Mr. Darman wrote a didactic introduction about "the ultimate cookie monster" and "hidden Pac-Men." That budget estimated that the deficit in the 1991 fiscal year would be $64.7 billion. It was slightly optimistic. The deficit turned out to be $269.5 billion.
This year, the Democrats in Congress will probably pass Mr. Clinton's budget more or less intact. And the President seems to have presented an honest accounting of what programs will cost and what the deficit will be.
But in terms of stirring up interest in his budget, Mr. Clinton ran head-long into the third reason why budgets deserve so much less attention than they used to: There is precious little money to fool around with.
So Mr. Clinton tinkered, adding a little money here for education and training, a little there for drug treatment. But in the first full-scale budget by a Democratic President in 13 years, he proposed nothing bold, nothing likely to make the history books.
The biggest initiatives he plans for this year, overhauling the health and welfare systems, were hardly mentioned in the budget. In the case of health, that was because even if the Clinton plan is enacted this year, little of it will be in effect in the 1995 fiscal year. As for welfare, the Administration argues, to the disbelief of most students of the subject, that millions of Americans can be moved off welfare and into jobs without costing the Government any extra money.
One of the President's pride and joys, the national service program, which is supposed to allow all students to work off their college loans by serving their communities, was budgeted for only $850 million. That is enough for only 33,000 students, approximately the enrollment at New York University alone.
"We can't do what we'd ultimately like to do," conceded Gene Sperling, a Clinton economic adviser. "We're constrained by the deficit."

Long Bond Yield at 6-Month High

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The yield on the 30-year bond jumped to 6.44 percent yesterday, its highest level in six months, as dealers pushed rates up at the beginning of the Treasury's $40 billion quarterly borrowing.
Yields in the government securities market often rise during the Treasury's debt auctions because traders are hoping to make the new securities cheaper so they are attractive to investors and thus sell quickly. 
 But because yields have moved higher since the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates on Friday, traders are not able to say whether the yield on the 30-year bond will decline after the auction on Thursday, or whether the Fed move will keep long-term yields up.
"You're going to find that investors want a little more of a premium before buying Treasuries in a market where there is still a lot of uncertainty about the Fed's next move," said Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist at CS First Boston.
 
Further Rate Rise Seen
 Market participants expecting a further rise in short-term interest rates over the next few months said they saw a signal of such a move in comments from John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve Board governor. He told reporters that the quarter of a percentage point jump to 3.25 percent in the rate charged on overnight loans between banks might not be sufficient to cool the economy and prevent inflation from reviving.
Another factor lifting interest rates is concern about the approach of new inflation data. It was concern about inflation that prompted the Fed's interest rate move. On Friday the Labor Department releases the January producer price data. The bond market is concerned that a strong inflation number could lead eventually to a second increase in short-term interest rates by the Fed, which would be likely to push long-term interest rates higher, at least immediately.
"If the number shows a significant rise in inflation, it could cause yields to rise," Mr. Alexy added. "So in essence what the Fed did last week by raising interest rates was put the market on an inflation watch."
The rise in yields yesterday came as bond prices, which move in the opposite direction, fell yesterday for the fourth consecutive session, as the Treasury sold more than $17 billion in new three-year notes, the first leg of the three-part quarterly borrowing. In late trading the price of the 30-year bond was off 12/32 , to 9713/32 , or down about $7.50 per $1,000 invested. The yield was up from 6.39 percent on Monday.
Analysts see the three-day auction as an important test of investor sentiment. While many traders expect a relatively successful Treasury auction, some suspect it will come at a cost.
 
3-Year Yield Rises
 At yesterday's auction of three-year notes the average yield was 4.83 percent, the highest auction level since the 5.17 percent in November 1992. The average at auction was 39 basis points higher than the last three-year note auction on Nov. 9, 1993. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Today the Treasury will sell $12 billion of 10-year notes followed tomorrow by the auction of $11 billion more of the current 6.25 percent 30-year bond due August 2023. The Treasury is issuing more of the current 30-year bond, which is called reopening the issue, in an effort to alleviate a shortage of the bond.
Many analysts have suggested that the current bond is trading at a distortedly high price and low yield because the Treasury cut its scheduled annual sales of long bonds in August by about 40 percent in an attempt to reduce borrowing costs. In addition to reducing the number of 30-year bonds sold, the Treasury also shifted to just two long bond auctions a year instead of four. The borrowing done in the past with 30-year bonds has been shifted to shorter-term, lower-interest Treasury notes and bills.
In when-issued trading for the two remaining maturities of the three-part government sale, the 10-year note being auctioned today was offered at a price to yield 5.95 percent, up from 5.90 percent on Monday, while the 30-year bond going on sale Thursday was offered at a price to yield 6.45 percent, up from 6.39 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's three-year Treasury note auction:

British Rate Cut Strengthens Traders' Demand for Dollars

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar advanced yesterday to its highest level against the German mark in more than two and a half years, as a reduction in British interest rates bolstered it against most European currencies.
The dollar hit a high for the day of 1.7686 marks after the Bank of England set a minimum lending rate at 5.25 percent, implying a quarter-point cut in base lending rates. The dollar finished at 1.7644 marks in New York trading, up from 1.7590 on Monday. 
 The British rate cut spurred selling of British pounds for dollars and other currencies. Traders were particularly eager to buy dollars in light of the Federal Reserve's move last Friday to lift interest rates one-quarter point, touching off an immediate surge in the United States currency.
"It was a follow-through from Friday's rally," Rob Pasqua, vice president at Banque Francaise, said of the dollar's advance.
The British pound fell in New York to $1.4670, from $1.4830 late Monday.
 
Dollar at 108.90 Yen in New York
 In other trading, the dollar posted a small gain against the Japanese yen after moving in a narrow range. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 108.90 yen, up from 108.56 yen on Monday.
The currency market had an unexpectedly muted reaction to the Japanese Government's announcement of a fiscal stimulus package, which included a major tax cut.
Traders had been anxiously awaiting the package, which some said could help pare the huge Japan trade surplus with the United States by spurring demand for American exports.
But now, traders said, the market has turned its attention to Friday's meeting between President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan, where they will discuss trade.
"The stimulus package is an issue that's done and over with," Belal Khan, senior customer dealer at Bank of Tokyo, said. "Now, people are focusing on trade."
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those late Monday, included: 1.4803 Swiss francs, up from 1.4682; 5.9820 French francs, up from 5.9645; $1.3428 (Canadian), down from $1.3441 (Canadian), and 1,698 Italian lire, up from 1,696.

HEADLINE: Productivity Up by 4.2% In the Last Quarter of '93

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Led by manufacturing industries, the productivity of American workers rose 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter last year, the Labor Department said today.
That was up from 4 percent in the third quarter and the strongest since a 4.2 percent rate 12 months earlier in the last quarter of 1992. Productivity increased 1.6 percent for the year, the Labor Department said. 
 Productivity is a measure of how efficiently businesses produce goods and is formally defined as output per number of hours worked. In the fourth quarter last year many industries, but especially automobiles, speeded up production schedules and added work shifts.
Manufacturing industries' productivity advanced at a 7.8 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, more than double the 3.1 percent rate in the third quarter.
 
Annualized Calculation
 The burst of manufacturing activity helped propel total goods and services output, measured by the gross domestic product, at a 5.9 percent annual rate in the quarter.
Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of Manufacturers, said that meant American manufacturing companies were outproducing competitors in Japan and most of Western Europe. "Productivity growth rates have been extremely high in the goods-producing industries that make up the bulk of international trade," he said. "These figures provide evidence that the United States will achieve high productivity in traded-goods sectors during the 1990's."
Separately, the Commerce Department reported lower wholesale sales in December, and as a consequence, an increase in the supplies of unsold goods.
 
Drop in Sales
 Sales fell six-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $161.03 billion after a revised four-tenths of 1 percent rise in November that had previously been reported as a much stronger 1 percent increase. Sales in October had also risen four-tenths of 1 percent.
Wholesale inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted $217 billion after a five-tenths of 1 percent increase in November, the Commerce Department said. Inventories had fallen in October by one-tenth of 1 percent.
Some goods were still selling briskly in December, notably lumber, which was up 7.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $7.49 billion, as starts of new homes kept rising. Furniture sales were also up strongly from November.
Among categories of goods where sales fell were clothing, down 7.1 percent in December to $6.15 billion, and motor vehicles, off three-tenths of 1 percent, to $14.5 billion.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
NEC, Faltering, to Get New President

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Tadahiro Sekimoto, who presided over the NEC Corporation as it grew into one of the world's most successful electronics companies, and then as it fell into trouble, announced today that he would step down in June.
The new president will be Hisashi Kaneko, the executive vice president in charge of international operations. Dr. Kaneko headed NEC's American operations until last August and is viewed as a protege of Dr. Sekimoto's. 
 The change in leadership comes as NEC is struggling to regain profitability after suffering a consolidated net loss of 45.2 billion yen, or nearly $420 million, in its last fiscal year.
During Dr. Sekimoto's 14-year tenure as president, NEC moved swiftly to capture more than half the personal computer market in Japan. The company also became the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer until it was passed by the Intel Corporation. Total sales exceed $30 billion.
Still, that record has been somewhat marred by the troubles of the last two years and Dr. Sekimoto, 67, has been criticized for not moving fast enough to deal with NEC's problems.
 
'Fresh Perspective' Needed
 "Personally, I think he stayed a bit too long," said Steven Myers, electronics analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. "The company does need a fresh perspective."
NEC's personal computer business, once the company's main source of profits, has been buffeted by a price war sparked by the entrance into the Japanese market of American companies like Compaq and Dell Computer.
Dr. Sekimoto initially dismissed the American computers, saying they were as ill suited to the Japanese culture as American cars with the steering wheel on the wrong side. But while Compaq and Dell remain small players in the market here, all Japanese vendors have since adopted the same operating system as the American companies, posing a threat to the dominance of the NEC standard.
Meanwhile, NEC's mainframe computer business is suffering from the shift to smaller computers and from Japan's recession. NEC's consumer electronics business, never a strong point, has lost money for years. And while NEC's motto has long been "computers and communications," the company has not become a leader in multimedia or other areas in which computers and communications are merging.
Still, some cost-cutting has occurred and the company is projecting a slight profit for the fiscal year that ends in March, giving Dr. Sekimoto a chance to retire on a positive note. He will become chairman.
 
New Course Uncertain
 How or whether Dr. Kaneko, the next president, will change things is unclear. During a news conference today, he sat quietly by Dr. Sekimoto's side and declined to discuss his ideas, saying he had been informed about his promotion only yesterday.
Dr. Sekimoto said he had chosen Dr. Kaneko because his experience in research and in the United States matched two of the main themes for NEC in the future -- globalization and multimedia.
Dr. Kaneko, 60, earned a master's degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in 1962 and worked at Bell Laboratories from 1968 to 1970.
From 1989 to 1993 he was based in Melville, L.I., as president of NEC U.S.A., the parent company of NEC's American operations, and as president of NEC America, the telecommunications subsidiary. During his tenure, the telecommunications business had some difficult times and Dr. Kaneko consolidated some operations in Texas and Oregon.
Dr. Kaneko's career path closely mirrors that of Dr. Sekimoto. Both earned doctorates in engineering from the University of Tokyo and worked their way up through NEC's telecommunications business. Both were managers in the central research lab and served as general managers of the transmission division.

HEADLINE: Stocks Up in Europe After British Rate Cut

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Britain shaved its base lending rate by a quarter of a point today to its lowest level in 22 years, giving a boost of confidence to investors and signaling that rates in Europe would continue to move down even as they tick up in the United States.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said he was reducing the base rate to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent because Britain's modest economic recovery had so far created no significant inflationary pressures. Inflation in December was 1.9 percent, and the Government and the Bank of England have set a goal of keeping it below 4 percent.
 
Rebound in Stocks
 "Inflation has been lower than expected," Mr. Clarke said. "Looking ahead, inflationary pressures appear subdued." 
 The move helped send share prices up on the London Stock Exchange, one day after the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares fell 56.3 points on worries about rising interest rates in the United States. The index closed up 21.1 points today at 3,440.2.
Other European markets also rebounded from their tumbles on Monday. In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index rose 27.81 to close at 2,107.21. In Paris, the CAC-40 index closed at 2,299.85, up 12.79 points.
Britain had been widely expected to cut interest rates before April, when a package of tax increases will take effect, potentially taking some of the steam out of the recovery.
Today's move suggested that Britain saw no reason to reassess its interest-rate policy in light of the Federal Reserve's decision on Friday to raise short-term rates in the United States by a quarter of a point, to 3.25 percent. The United States economy is growing strongly and is at risk of generating inflation. But Britain is still very early in its recovery, and most of the rest of Europe is still emerging from recession.
Germany is expected to continue its policy of rate reductions in an attempt to stimulate its struggling economy. The Bundesbank may be concerned about the potential inflationary pressures from the weakening of the German mark against the dollar, economists said, but those concerns are almost certain to be outweighed by other economic problems. The Bonn Government reported today that unemployment in western Germany rose from 8.1 percent in December to 8.8 percent in January, its highest level since 1985.
"Given the U.S. move on Friday, today's reduction does highlight the differing positions of the U.S. and the U.K. and to an even greater extent the Continental European countries in terms of the economic cycle," said Matthew Merritt, a global strategist at NatWest Markets in London. "You're going to see their interest rates moving in different directions in 1994."

HEADLINE: Stiglitz, Idea Man Among the Economic Advisers

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
When Joseph Stiglitz was invited to join the President's Council of Economic Advisers, many wondered whether the ivory-tower theorist from Stanford University could possibly navigate the currents of real world policy-making. The council's role, played mostly behind the scenes, is to inject as much economic rationality into Administration proposals as politics allow.
Mr. Stiglitz, 51, had written hundreds of papers on the economics of information, public finance and economic development, won the prestigious John Bates Clark medal in 1979 and was widely expected to collect a Nobel someday. He was also the quintessential absent-minded professor, who has dashed into class and lectured on the wrong subject, and often turned up with his tie or shirt collar seriously askew.
 
Repairing Markets
 In fact, as the council's chairwoman, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, must have recognized when she chose Professor Stiglitz, he and Washington circa 1993 were made for each other. He has spent his professional life focused on the idea that markets are imperfect and need to be repaired. "What ends up in the Government's portfolio are the things where the market is having problems," Mr. Stiglitz said, "Government can make a major difference for the good if you structure policies appropriately." 
That sentiment is in keeping with everything that the Administration has done, or is thinking about, whether it is overhauling the nation's health care, ushering in the electronic information age or reducing the country's emissions of greenhouse gases. And while economists -- including the ones who work for the White House -- rarely have the last word on policy, many of those who have worked with him say that Mr. Stiglitz is having an impact by suggesting creative solutions to complicated problems.
"What he brings to the table is a fountain of ideas," said Alan Blinder, the third member of the economic council.
Take a recent contribution to the nuts and bolts of the Administration's environmental policy, the new plan to reform the Superfund. The Government's program to get companies to clean up polluted industrial sites has practically become synonymous with government waste and inefficiency. It was Mr. Stiglitz's idea to replace part of the current system of liability -- which encourages costly legal suits more than cleanups -- with a system of arbitration and a set of economic incentives to encourage companies to stay out of court.
Mr. Stiglitz sold his contribution to the lawyers on the interagency task force that crafted the Administration proposal partly by the cogency of his arguments and partly by his ability to suggest compromises and alternatives when the discussion seemed to be heading for a stalemate.
"He always brings a new idea and perpetual good humor," said Alicia Munnell, Assistant Treasury Secretary for economic policy. "He always has another notion of how this deal could be worked."
Mr. Stiglitz is also helping shape the Administration's thinking on ways to help politically powerful but economically weak states like California and New York without playing havoc with the budget agreement.
Although Mr. Stiglitz sometimes compares himself to the greatest economists of all time, from Adam Smith to Paul Samuelson, many in Washington are disarmed by his tendency not to take himself too seriously -- he played an elaborate practical joke on the council staff soon after arriving and showed up at the C.E.A. Christmas party dressed as Santa -- his ability to listen and his genuine enthusiasm for other people's ideas.
 
No Sign of Arrogance
 "Joe brings a lot of intellectual power to problems," Ms. Tyson said, "but how you bring it matters as much as what you bring, and Joe doesn't bring even the slightest trace of arrogance."
Of course, Presidents rarely do what their economists tell them. Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economist, recalls that he had to threaten to quit to get an interview with his boss at the height of the recession. President Reagan wanted to disband the Council of Economic Advisers. President Clinton uses the council, among other things, to help with Chelsea's homework.
But it is completely characteristic of Professor Stiglitz, a born can-do optimist, not to dwell on the half-empty cup of his influence. Twinkly eyed, smiling and comfortably rotund, he is simply having too much fun munching his way through "the smorgasbord of interesting problems" that wind up on the council's agenda. "I have the greatest job in Washington," he said. The biggest surprise, he added, is the fact that Washington isn't populated by a bunch of back-stabbers.
"When a decision is informed, when we've had an intelligent discussion," he said, "I don't feel bad when people don't go along with our recommendations."
Endless meetings don't exhaust him. Instead, he says, he's invigorated. And he still has energy to spare for playing with his two young children, Siobhan and Michael, and his dog, Woofie; making feasts for friends, and taking an occasional expedition to California, though his frequent and far-flung travels ("Joe is the person you'd be most likely to meet at the head of the Amazon," a friend said ) have temporarily been put on hold.
 
The Perks of Office
 "He was tickled when Clinton walked over to us and said, 'Hi, Joe,' " said Jane Hannaway, his wife, who added that her husband relished the chance to eat at the White House mess and take out-of-town guests to the President's box at Kennedy Center. "But he couldn't exist on that," she continued. "For most people in Washington, a good problem is something Congress will pass. To Joe, it's one that's interesting,"
The work Professor Stiglitz has done in the past gives important clues to advice he'll give in the future.
His analysis of insurance markets concludes that such markets frequently break down because it is impossible for insurance companies to know as much as individuals do about their true health status. His solution? Universal coverage.
His theories about credit markets suggests that high rates may not ease credit crunches because they attract poor credit risks. And his analysis of labor markets suggests that discrimination can be self-reinforcing, not self-correcting as conventional economic models imply.
 
Shifting the Paradigm
 "What I've tried to do for first time is to shift the paradigm," Mr. Stiglitz said. "The key to economics is problems of information -- who knows what -- and these problems of information are core to our understanding of all our institutions."
George Ackerloff, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, said: "The old-style economics is the standard story of perfect competition. The new style of economics makes you focus very heavily on imperfections in markets and their consequences."
Some other economists question whether market breakdowns in theory are pervasive enough in reality to warrant an entirely new economic paradigm. "Markets get the wrong answer. That's a logical pass that can't be ruled out," said Robert Lucas an economist at the University of Chicago "But he never turned the corner into quantitative research. It doesn't give you a prescriptive apparatus either."
Others worry that Mr. Stiglitzis is too ready to believe that government intervention will work as benignly as intended.
 
Overcoming Naivete
 John Taylor, a close friend at Stanford and a member of the economics council under President Bush, added that he, for one, was confident that a spell in Washington would remedy any such naivete. Professor Stiglitz's recently published introductory economics text -- some call it a potential rival for the Samuelson classic -- contains hundreds of pages on market failures, but just a couple on government foul-ups. "There will be more stories about government failures in the second edition," he said.
Perhaps. What's certain is that the sojourn in Washington is not likely to tarnish his reputation as an absent-minded professor.
Twenty minutes into a recent meeting of the Administration's economic team, for example, the budget director, Leon Panetta, who had been staring at Professor Stiglitz, jumped up, exclaimed, "I can't stand it any more!" and walked over behind the economist, grabbed the latter's tie and put it in its rightful place. Professor Stiglitz -- and not, his colleagues say, for the first time -- had tied the tie on top of his collar instead of underneath it.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Franklin Resources' shares gain favor as a mutual fund play.

BYLINE: By Leslie Wayne

 BODY:
THERE are more ways than one to invest in mutual funds. One is to buy the stocks of publicly traded mutual fund companies. Several analysts are looking favorably at Franklin Resources of San Mateo, Calif., the world's largest publicly traded asset manager.
"It's a buy," said James Hanbury, an analyst for Wertheim Schroder. "It's a well-run, well-positioned company." 
 But Franklin is a buy only for those willing to bet on the overall market, because the stock is vulnerable in a sharp downturn. During the market plunge on Friday, Franklin's stock dropped $3, or 6 percent, although the shares regained $1.125 on Monday and $1.625 yesterday to close at $48.625.
Charles F. Gunther, an analyst at Van Kasper & Company, said he was more cautious on Franklin than some of his fellow analysts. He said he thought that Franklin's stock was "reasonably fully priced," but that it was a good long-term buy.
"Franklin's discipline is marvelous, and they have surprisingly strong earnings," Mr. Gunther said. "The quality of their investments is first rate. And the long-term potential is fabulous. It's a classic example of buying a good stock and sticking with it. I'd start buying if it came down a bit."
Franklin benefited from its purchase in October 1992 of Templeton funds, a 78-fund global firm headed by the legendary investor John Templeton. The price of $913 million was the highest paid for a mutual fund company; the Mellon bank is planning to top that with a $1.85 billion deal for Dreyfus.
The Templeton acquisition has helped Franklin's earnings, and the arrangement was not so bad for Mr. Templeton either, who does his stock-picking from the Bahamas: He and his sons owned 70 percent of the Templeton fund's voting shares.
 The acquisition has allowed Franklin to ride the boom in international investing, while providing it diversification from its mainstay fixed-income funds. In retrospect, analysts say, the Templeton merger looks cheap. Franklin's assets have grown by 14 percent annually since the merger, and analysts say that Franklin could hardly have found an alternative investment with such strong growth.
During 1993, money poured into international mutual funds at an ever-increasing rate that peaked at more than $7.2 billion in new cash inflows in December alone. This has made foreign stock funds the fastest growth area of this fast-growing industry. The Templeton acquisition has pushed up Franklin's assets to $114 billion, from $75 billion before the merger. And mutual fund company economics are simple: The more money under management, the more earned through fees.
Mr. Hanbury estimated that the company, which earned $2.10 a share last year, would earn $2.85 a share in 1994 and $3.30 a share in 1995. The company is trading at 21 times earnings, and at those estimates, the stock could reach $60 to $65 a share in the next year or so, Mr. Hanbury said.
One possible cloud for Franklin is that it is sold only through brokers at a time when more of its competitors are beginning to use alternative distributors, like banks. There are worries that the investment houses that sell Franklin funds, like Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter, may push their own funds over those of Franklin. And there is concern that bond funds could come under pressure from low-cost rivals like Vanguard, whose funds are sold with rock-bottom expenses.
Such concerns have not fazed some analysts. "Franklin has simple and elegant product ideas," said John Keefe, president of Keefe Worldwide Information Services, a consulting firm. "They offer basic products that people need. And the Templeton name is a Cadillac."
Steve Eisman of Oppenheimer & Company recommends the stock because of the name recognition. "There's a lot of mutual fund companies," he said, "but few with a brand-name presence."

HEADLINE: Job Losses At a High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Despite statistics saying that the United States economy is recovering, job cutbacks announced last month by companies reached their highest level in at least five years, a survey released yesterday showed.
Companies announced 108,946 job reductions in January, more than four times the number announced in December, the survey by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement consulting firm, said. 
 James E. Challenger, president of the Chicago-based company, said the figure was the highest since monthly records of layoff announcements were first compiled in 1989.
The biggest job reductions came from the communications industry, with four companies saying they planned to eliminate 44,314 jobs. The GTE Corporation announced the most cuts: 17,000 jobs spread over three years.
Companies based in Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania accounted for more than 60 percent of the jobs to be lost, the firm said. But the positions eliminated were not all in those states.
"Although consumer confidence is reportedly at record levels," Mr. Challenger said, "America's work force continues to be subjected to a steady stream of cutback announcements by employers every day."
He added that the true number of workers laid off was probably larger than the numbers his firm compiled, since some companies do not announce job reductions.

HEADLINE: Searching the Soul Of French Cuisine

BYLINE: By PIERRE FRANEY

 BODY:
LAST summer, I returned to my native France with a single-minded journalistic mission. There has been much discussion recently suggesting that French cuisine is in the doldrums, bereft of new ideas. On this nostalgic journey I set out to determine: where is French cuisine today? And, equally important, where is it heading? After three months, 10,000 miles and 60 restaurants, the answers were palpable, though not simple.
In short, French cooking, from Nice to Normandy, is going through another of its periodic revolutions, only this time it is more subtle. And it is a somewhat contradictory movement, with leading chefs taking one step forward and one step backward at the same time. I'll try to explain. First, a little background. 
 As a chef who earned his culinary stripes in the 1930's under the wings of Escoffier's lieutenants, I have always had the gastronomic creed "flavor first, everything else second." In the 1970's, with the rise of nouvelle cuisine, everything changed. Histrionics were put on the front burner as chefs competed for visual appeal with all manner of culinary sleight-of-hand. Flavor was almost accidental, at least in the hands of less skilled practitioners.
This approach never made sense to me, and fortunately nouvelle cuisine ran its course and was tossed aside.
In the 1980's, many of France's top chefs, including Paul Bocuse, Roger Verge, the Troigros brothers and Michel Guerard, to name a few, aimed their culinary rudders back toward the shores of traditional cuisine -- but with a contemporary outlook. Less butter, less cream, more olive oil, more vegetables, more steaming and broiling -- all gained currency in the name of lightness and health.
Then came the international recession of the late 1980's. In a funny way, this difficult period had a beneficial effect on cooking, in both Europe and the United States. In order to save money, chefs started experimenting with cheaper cuts of meat and underused species of fish. They re-examined regional home cooking, for example, the onion soup burgundy-style and crayfish fricassee that I knew growing up near Chablis.
About the same time, France expanded its vocational schooling system, which gives youngsters the chance to attend two years of cooking school, which includes apprenticeships in the kitchens of various restaurants and stints in the dining room.
This opportunity, as much as anything else, accounts for the astounding number of young people flooding into the restaurant business these days.
I encountered them everywhere in my journey, in all regions of France. Some were rising fast in the ranks of larger urban kitchens, others had already opened their own places in the countryside.
In the enchanting village of Biot, on the Cote d'Azur near Antibes, I was dazzled by the food and hospitality of Christian and Brigitte Metral, who own the restaurant L'Auberge du Jarrier. The establishment is at the end of a little passage in the heart of this Provencal village, which is known for its distinctive pottery (Jarrier refers to ceramic pots in the local dialect). Mr. Metral, who is in his early 30's, exemplifies the new style of updated traditional cooking, with sunny, generous Provencal fare that is attractive but never fussy-looking (Mrs. Metral tends to the dining room). My favorite dish there was his fillet of fish with potato scales, garnished with an a la minute sauce of tomatoes, garlic, lemon and nicoise olives.
In Chablis, which is about a half-hour's drive from my village, St. Vinnemer, I cooked with Michel Vignaud, who, with his wife, Sylvie, owns the Hostellerie des Clos, a renovated ancient hospital in the heart of Chablis village. His cooking blends much of the traditional food I recall from my youth in Burgundy, but with a distinctive modern accent.
His contemporary interpretations include a wonderful fricassee of crayfish served with blanched fresh peas and fava beans. I was particularly interested in this dish because, as a boy, I went to a nearby river and caught fresh crayfish. We would make a bundle of thorned twigs from a prunelle bush and hide chicken necks in them as bait; the crayfish would enter the twig bundle but could not get out. We'd boil them right there, with a bit of thyme, bay leaf and salt, let them cool to lukewarm and eat them with mayonnaise. Since then I have had a special fondness for crayfish.
Mr. Vignaud made a court bouillon with crayfish heads (there is really no substitute) and reduced the liquid way down rather than thickening it with cream. The finished dish, explosive with flavors and colors, is souplike in consistency -- but what a soup!
I have known Michel Chabran for more than a dozen years and have watched him progress into one of the most respected chefs of the Rhone valley. His luxuriant auberge and restaurant in Pont-de-l'Isere, north of Valence, is in the sun-drenched center of France's productive fruit region.
Mr. Chabran is a vibrant, athletic man -- aside from cooking, his passions are tennis and race-car driving -- and his cooking reflects this vitality. Because Mr. Chabran is in an area between Lyons and Provence, he finds himself cooking with the butter and cream of the former and the olive oil and garlic of the latter -- and often mixing them together. I find that melange appealing, from both health and flavor perspectives.
One of the recipes I brought back from Mr. Chabran is his extraordinary mashed potatoes blended with olive oil, cream and milk. The consistency is very loose, not at all like American-style mashed potatoes. The flavor is sublime. Another dish is a simple but delicious roasted monkfish (he sometimes uses sandre, a freshwater fish not generally available in the United States) roasted on the bone with a pan sauce of olive oil, carrots, onions, garlic, white wine and fish broth. It is meant to be served with the mashed potatoes.
Most of the monkfish in shops in the United States is sold as fillets; Mr. Chabran much prefers to cook it on the bone, which he feels adds flavor. If you would like to prepare it this way, it may require a special request at the store.
My travels also took me to Normandy, the lush, emerald-green land known for its butter, cream, cheese, cider, Calvados and much more. I wanted to visit a young chef whose reputation had spread far beyond this sea-swept region. In the town of Rouen I met Gilles Tournadre, who trained in Paris before returning and eventually opening Restaurant Gill. Mr. Tournadre, who is ably aided by his wife, Sylvie, is known for a lighter, herb-infused style of Norman cooking. Extensive use of fresh herbs is not something I had associated with Norman cooking, but it can be magnificent, as evidenced by his updated classic of duck with turnips.
In classical French cooking, a cut-up duck is browned and a dark sauce is made. Turnips are browned in butter and added to the braised duck at the last minute. Mr. Tournadre's version, to my taste, has almost an Indonesian flair, using magret (the breast of a fattened duck) that is blanched and then roasted with cloves, coriander, cumin, honey, vinegar and cider. It is an exciting, complex flavor sensation. Magret of duck is available in many markets and by mail order from D'Artagnan, 399-419 St. Paul Avenue, Jersey City, N.J., 07306; (800) 327-8246.
Many miles to the south, along the coast near La Rochelle, in the southwest of France, I visited some amazing mussel farms. The mussels there are cultivated on poles for 12 miles or so along the coast, about a half-mile out to sea. In little more than a year, the small (compared to those in the United States), plump, yellow-fleshed mussels are harvested -- and they are grit-free because they never touch the sand.
One of the best mussel dishes I tried was in the old port section of La Rochelle in a restaurant named after its chef, Richard Coutanceau. It was a version of mouclade, which in classic French cuisine means steamed mussels with shallots, white wine and cream, always based on a roux. Mr. Coutanceau follows the traditional recipe but adds curry and fresh thyme to the sauce, which is a lovely match to the sweet mussels.
They say all roads lead to Paris, and so did my long journey across France. Rather than visit the famed three-star establishments, I sought out new talent, restaurateurs who represented the trend I had discovered in the countryside. There were many: Andre Genin at Chez Pauline near the old Opera, Jacques Paul of the rustic and raucous A la Tour de Monthlhery in Les Halles, Gabriel Biscay of Laperouse, and Michel Rostang, who has a two-star luxury restaurant near the Arc de Triomphe, as well as two earthy bistros.
One that particularly impressed me was the wildly popular new Bistro La Regalade, in the Montparnasse neighborhood. The chef, Yves Candelaborde, serves up a robust menu of dishes from the southwest of France, replete with all of my favorite foods: tripe, andouillettes, chunky country terrines and pates, cured Bayonne hams, game and more.
One of the most heartening developments I noticed during my extraordinary journey was the number of bright, amiable young couples who are opening restaurants. Cooking, ultimately, is a family enterprise, and the scores of delightful young people I met along the road gave me reason for optimism that French cuisine, and France itself, is on a rebound.

Curried Mussels
(Adapted from Richard Coutanceau)
Total time: 40 minutes

 1 cup heavy cream
 1 tablespoon mild curry powder
 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
 3 tablespoons butter
 1/4 cup shallots sliced thin
 4 sprigs thyme
 1 bay leaf
 1 cup dry white wine
 9 cups mussels, cleaned (about 3 pounds)
 2 tablespoons flour
 Salt to taste.
1. Combine the cream, curry powder and lemon juice in a small bowl, and mix well. This step enables the curry flavor to develop.
2. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large pot over high heat, and add the shallots, thyme and bay leaf. Stir until wilted. Add the white wine and bring to a simmer. Add the mussels, cover and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or just until the mussels open. Stir from time to time to assure even cooking. As soon as the mussels are opened, remove them from heat, and strain cooking liquid through a fine sieve into a bowl. Reserve 2 cups of the juice.
3. Remove the top shell from each mussel and discard it, leaving the mussel meat attached to its bottom shell. Arrange decoratively on a serving platter, and keep warm.
4. In a large saucepan, over medium heat, melt the remaining butter, and whisk in the flour, stirring until the mixture is smooth. Cook briefly; do not brown. Slowly add the 2 cups of reserved cooking juice, whisking constantly. Bring to a rolling boil. Add the cream-and-curry mixture, and combine well. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve. Add salt, and check for seasoning. Ladle the sauce over the mussels, and serve immediately.

 1/2 cup peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped tomato
 1 cup white Chablis wine.
 
Assembling the dish:
 
 4 tablespoons butter
 1 tablespoon finely chopped sweet red pepper
 1/4 cup diced carrots
 1/4 cup diced celery
 1/2 cup Chablis white wine
 4 tablespoons fresh peas, blanched
 4 tablespoons fava beans, blanched and skinned
 Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
 4 sprigs fresh tarragon for garnish.
1. Prepare the court bouillon. In a large pot, place the onions, carrots, celery, shallots, bouquet garni, peppercorns, vinegar, salt and 12 cups of water. Bring to a boil and simmer about 5 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, to prepare crayfish, take them, one-by-one, in the palm of your hand, belly up. With the thumb and forefinger of the other hand, remove the middle, fanlike appendage at the end of the tail, which is connected to the intestines. Pulling it out gently will remove the bitter, black intestine.
3. Add the crayfish to the simmering court bouillon. Cover, and bring the liquid back to a boil. Remove the crayfish from the bouillon immediately. Allow them to cool briefly so that they can be handled for shelling.
4. Reserve 4 whole crayfish with shells on for decoration. To shell the rest, gently separate the head section from the tail section. Reserve heads for the sauce. Remove the tail meat in one piece from its casing by squeezing the shell gently to loosen it and then gently pulling away each ring of the tail shell, one by one.
5. To make the sauce, crush reserved crayfish heads using a kitchen mallet.
6. In a large saucepan melt the butter, and add the carrots, leeks, chopped celery and tomato. Cook, stirring, over medium heat. Add the crayfish heads, and continue to cook about 5 minutes. Add the wine, 2 cups water and the 2 celery ribs. Simmer for 15 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve and reserve.
7. To assemble the dish, heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium-size saucepan and add the sweet red pepper, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring, over medium heat, about 3 minutes. Add wine, and continue to cook until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the crayfish sauce, and cook until the liquid is reduced by half. Whisk in the remaining butter over medium heat, being careful not to let the sauce return to a boil.
8. Add peas and fava beans, and continue to cook only until ingredients are heated through. Check for seasoning, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
9. Divide shelled crayfish evenly among 4 warmed soup plates. Pour sauce over them. Top each serving with a whole crayfish in the shell, and decorate with a sprig of tarragon.

 Duck Breasts With Turnips
And Eastern Spices
(Adapted from Gilles Tournadre)
Total time: 40 minutes

 2 medium, round white turnips, about 1/3 pound each
 2 duck breasts, like magret, skin on, about 6 ounces each
 2 tablespoons coriander seeds
 2 whole cloves
 2 teaspoons cumin seeds
 Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
 4 tablespoons natural honey
 3 tablespoons white vinegar
 1 cup hard cider, or 1/2 cup dry white wine
 1 cup fresh chicken broth or good canned version
 2 sprigs flat leaf parsley.
1. Trim the ends of the turnips and peel them. Cut into 1/4-inch slices.
2. Place the duck breasts and the turnips in a large saucepan, and cover with boiling water. Cook, simmering, over low heat for one minute. Remove the duck breast, and cook the turnips two minutes longer. Remove the turnips, and place the duck breasts and the turnips into an ice-water bath to prevent them from cooking further. When cool, remove the duck and the turnips. Pat the duck dry with a paper towel. Using a sharp knife, remove the thick, excess fat, leaving a thin layer of fat underneath. Score the surface of the fat diagonally.
3. Grind the coriander, clove and cumin by placing them on a cutting board and crushing them with a heavy sauce pan. This can also be done in a spice mill, but be careful not yo grind them too finely -- you want a crunchy texture to the spice crust.
4. Meanwhile, season the duck breast with salt and pepper. Place in a skillet over medium-high heat, skin side down, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the turnips, turning them from time to time, and continue cooking another 2 minutes. Remove the duck and turnips from the skillet, and pour off the fat. Pat the skin of the duck with paper towels to absorb any excess fat.
5. In the same skillet, combine the honey and white vinegar. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to caramelize lightly and evenly. Add the ground spices while stirring. Be careful not to burn. Remove the skillet from the heat. Return duck breasts to the skillet, fatty side down. Move them around in the pan to coat them with the spice mixture. Remove the duck, and keep warm.
6. Return the skillet to medium-high heat, and add the cider. Cook, scraping the side and bottom of the pan, until all the brown particles are dissolved. Add the chicken broth, and bring to a simmer. Add the duck breasts, fatty side up, and place the turnips around them. Simmer for about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the duck and keep warm. The meat should be pink in the center.
7. Bring the sauce and the turnips to a boil and cook until reduced by more than half, until the sauce has thickened to a syrupy consistency.
8. Cut the breasts on a bias into thin slices. Arrange the slices of the breasts in a fan shape in the center of a warm serving plate. Garnish with turnip slices, and spoon the sauce around. Garnish with parsley.
Yield: 2 servings.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Yankees Are Shut Out As Olson Picks Braves

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
If Gregg Olson returns to form as a superb closer, if he overcomes a troubling right elbow injury and performs splendidly for the Atlanta Braves this season, the Yankees will remember the frigid day in February when he auditioned for them at Yankee Stadium. And they will wince.
The Yankees' chance to make Olson a possible cure for their bullpen woes vanished yesterday when the Braves proved more appealing and signed the right-hander to a one-year, incentive-laden contract that could be worth as much as $3.5 million. 
 The Yankees had made a two-year offer loaded with incentives, but Olson chose Atlanta over New York, Toronto and California because with the Braves he will be the primary closer on a pennant-contending team. That was important for Olson because he also set himself up to become a free agent after the 1994 season.
"At this stage of his career, he and I feel that changing to a new team in a different league is appropriate," said Jeff Moorad, Olson's agent. "In the end, we focused on the opportunity of joining the Braves over the economics of it."
Although Moorad would not divulge the specifics of New York's offer, he conceded it included a low base salary and several incentives, which is what Olson accepted from Atlanta on a one-year basis.
Olson, who earned $2.3 million while saving 29 games for Baltimore last season, will receive $500,000 for signing with the three-time National League Western Division champions, $1 million more if he makes the Braves and could earn another $2 million in bonuses based on appearances. Olson would receive $25,000 for each of his first 40 appearances and $50,000 each for appearances 41 to 60. If the 27-year-old Olson matches his average of 62 appearances over the last five years, he will make the $3.5 million.
Not only that, but if Olson pitches often enough to cash in all his incentives, the doubts about the strained elbow that bothered him for the final two months of 1993 also would be erased and he would be quite attractive as a free agent.
Olson, the only relief pitcher to have 20 or more saves in his first five major league seasons, could make the Yankees rue their decision.
"I won't dwell on not getting him," said Manager Buck Showalter. "I think everybody knows he's a good pitcher if he's healthy. But that's a big question. It's quite a risk for a team."
 
Farr's Hopes Rise
 By waiting three days after Olson tested his elbow for them last Friday before they made an offer, it is obvious the Yankees were somewhat reluctant to take the risk. Now, Olson's signing with Atlanta should reopen the clubhouse door in the Bronx for 37-year-old Steve Farr, who became a free agent when the Yankees did not offer him arbitration five days after the World Series and who would not be as expensive as Olson.
But Steve Fehr, one of Farr's representatives, said yesterday that the Yankees had not made any new contact regarding his client. General Manager Gene Michael did not return telephone messages for comment on Farr's possible re-signing, and said through a subordinate, "There's nothing going on."
Olson was the American League rookie of the year with Baltimore in 1989, when he had a 1.69 earned run average and 27 saves. A year later, he had 37 saves, and over all, he has a 2.26 e.r.a. with 160 saves in 191 opportunities.
No matter. After making a out of unsuccessfully pursuing starting pitchers this off season, the Yankees added a twist by failing to secure a relief pitcher.
The Yankees were moderately interested in Tim Belcher before he signed with Detroit on Monday, then lost out on Olson yesterday.
"Maybe George will see this and do something," Showlater said, referring to owner George Steinbrenner. "Or maybe he'll just say we should go with what we have."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 KEVIN MAAS , the first baseman-designated hitter for whom there does not seem to be a roster spot, lost his arbitration case yesterday and must settle for a salary of $425,000. Maas, who made $255,000 last year while batting .205 in 151 times up, with 9 home runs and 25 runs batted in, had been seeking $490,000. . . . Second baseman PAT KELLY is the only Yankee left in arbitration and his case will be heard next Monday.

HEADLINE: China's Bad Report Card

 BODY:
The State Department's annual review of human rights paints a grim picture of China's police state, documenting torture, forced confessions and long imprisonment for ideological "crimes." The White House must decide this spring on China's continued access to low American tariffs; the report is a reminder of how far Beijing still has to go to meet the conditions President Clinton set down in an executive order last May.
That order set only two firm conditions: that China ease restrictions on emigration and comply with its own promises to stop exporting goods made by enslaved prisoners. It also called on Beijing to demonstrate significant progress on releasing political prisoners, ending forced abortion and sterilization, easing religious persecution, allowing medical treatment for prisoners, protecting Tibet's cultural heritage and stopping the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts. 
 For the Administration, and for most human rights activists, renewal of trade privileges is the goal, but not if Beijing makes a mockery of reasonable U.S. conditions. The Administration's final decision will most likely hinge on three things: the fate of some 100 political prisoners about whom Washington has expressed special concern; negotiations for Red Cross inspections of Chinese prison camps, and China's follow-through on its agreement to allow U.S. inspection of sites where the production of slave labor exports has been alleged.
Beijing has made some promising human rights gestures in the early weeks of this year, so it is reasonable to hope that renewal will be possible, though probably some conditions will still need to be attached.
Some argue -- correctly -- that China's continued economic contact with the West has a positive influence on human rights, and that to end China's trade privileges would isolate further those Chinese who are struggling for democracy.
However, the U.S. now buys one-third of China's exports and provides Beijing with its only significant hard currency. To lose trade privileges would be a severe blow for Beijing; America has a lot more leverage over China than it ever exercised in the years of George Bush's Presidency.
The challenge for President Clinton is to balance America's humane values with legitimate U.S. business and strategic interests, including the need for Chinese cooperation in discouraging North Korea from developing nuclear weapons. The best way to achieve that balance is to keep human rights demands modest and achievable. Mr. Clinton's 1993 executive order did that. The rest is up to Beijing.

HEADLINE: More Is the Pity at the Pentagon

 BODY:
With all the talk about budget cuts, the Pentagon is actually scheduled to get more money next year. The Clinton Administration is seeking $264 billion in defense spending authority for 1995, up $2.8 billion from 1994.
Advocates of higher defense spending explain away the rise as reflecting a military pay increase voted by Congress. But the sadder truth is that the Administration refused to reduce Pentagon programs enough, despite the end of the cold war. By preparing to wage two regional wars simultaneously, the Administration is still setting force requirements too high. That will put upward pressure on the budget for many years to come. 
 President Clinton is admittedly in a bind. If he cuts defense too much, he will trigger a fight with Congressional hawks at a time when he needs their support on more urgent domestic issues. And if he further cuts the flow of funds to defense contractors, he could plunge California deeper into recession, jeopardizing his electoral chances in that pivotal state. But with civilian investment desperately short of money, Mr. Clinton needs to prune more out of the bloated defense budget.
The Administration says that spending on new weapons will go down $1.4 billion next year. But that reduction is less than it seems. Few new weapons systems were canceled outright -- the notable exceptions are the Navy's A/F-X aircraft, the Air Force's multirole fighter and a few of the many helicopter programs. Instead, procurements have been postponed or stretched out, which will only increase the price per weapon.
The new Secretary of Defense, William Perry, says flatly, "There are no cold war relics in the budget." But that is flat wrong. Another Seawolf attack submarine will be built, a cold war relic if there ever was one. The purpose of attack submarines once was to protect against Soviet ships and submarines so that American reinforcements could be shipped to Europe in the event of war. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, who is left to challenge U.S. naval supremacy?
The biggest cold war relic of all is the excessive size of American forces. The U.S. still has 19 divisions of ground troops -- 10 active-duty and 5 reserve in the Army, 3 active and 1 reserve in the Marines. It still has 35 air wings in the Air Force, Navy and Marines, 26 of them on active duty. And it still has 12 aircraft carriers -- one of them for training. These force levels differ little from those set by the Bush Administration in 1990 -- before the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
A new aircraft carrier, which will cost $4.5 billion to build and billions more to equip and man, is also a cold war relic of sorts. If the Navy were appropriately reduced to 9 or 10 carrier battle groups, it would be retiring old carriers instead of building new ones.
The Administration is planning to spend nearly as much on defense next year as the rest of the world combined. If it maintains all its current programs, it will face pressure to spend even more on them in the future. Unless Mr. Clinton finds the courage to trim defense, he will be forced to shortchange domestic investment for years to come.

HEADLINE: Crown Heights Coalition Has Done Much to Heal Community

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Crown Hts. Tension Persists Despite Healing Effort" (news article, Jan. 27) does a disservice to efforts to heal Brooklyn's Crown Heights community. Minimizing the work of the Crown Heights Coalition adds fuel to those who seek to foment unrest. 
 In the wake of the summer 1991 unrest, the coalition of African-American, Caribbean-American and Hasidic community leaders was the first group to investigate the causes of violence. They recommended improvements in police-community relations, cultural understanding, youth services and economic opportunities.
The coalition lobbied City Hall for programs and services outlined in "Crown Heights: A Strategy for the Future," a comprehensive report. Coalition initiatives, which have resulted in measurable improvements in public safety, employment and recreation for Crown Heights, have been lauded by former Mayor David Dinkins and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
As a result of the coalition's work, the 71st Precinct received its full complement of community policing officers three years ahead of schedule. Crown Heights police officers receive additional cultural diversity and anti-bias training. "Safe corridors" have been established to protect high school students traveling to and from school. The Department of Employment has started a new Testing Assessment and Placement Center in the area. The St. John's Recreation Center has reopened with many new programs.
It is difficult to understand why anyone would want to dismiss these and other valuable programs that have been implemented at the coalition's strong urging. The coalition is working with the next generation -- our youth -- to eradicate and avoid precisely this type of cynical attitude.
The coalition remains a strong and forceful entity in Crown Heights. It meets regularly to deal with divisive issues in the community.
For example, the coalition, which early called for a Federal investigation of the Yankel Rosenbaum murder, continues to monitor the case. Bringing the murderers to justice is a priority for the entire community.
The coalition is also working to resolve a dispute raised over this year's West Indian-American Day Parade and the Jewish observance of the eve of Rosh ha-Shanah, the Jewish New Year, which coincide on Labor Day. That the coalition has not yet told the press about these efforts does not mean that it is not addressing the problem.

HEADLINE: In Bomb Plot Trial: A Blizzard of Evidence

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
After more than four months of testimony, the Government rested its case yesterday against the four defendants in the World Trade Center trial. Given the 207 witnesses the prosecution called to the stand and the 1,003 exhibits presented to the jury, it is clear what the prosecutors have attempted to do: they have produced an avalanche of circumstantial evidence with which they have tried to bury the defendants.
But the Government's avalanche has seemed uneven, crushingly thick and heavy in many places, thin in others, and weighing differently on each defendant. 
 Over all, the prosecution has attempted to narrate the story of a bomb plot that started with the arrival in this country of a mysterious Iraqi named Ramzi Ahmed Yousef on Sept. 1, 1992. According to the prosecution, Mr. Yousef brought with him the plans to carry out what has since been called the single most devastating terror attack ever committed on American soil.
While officially a defendant in the case, Mr. Yousef left the country the very day of the trade center explosion and was not on trial. But, the prosecution's long and sometimes tedious parade of witnesses delivered seemingly damaging information about the four men who are.
It appeared to establish, despite defense lawyers' unwillingness to concede the point, that the explosion that ripped through the six underground floors of the World Trade Center, killing six people and injuring more than 1,000, was caused by a bomb. And it seemed to show that the explosive was carried into the trade center in a yellow Ryder van that was rented by the lead defendant in the case, Mohammad A. Salameh, who appears to have acted in close association with Mr. Yousef.
Witnesses have also given powerful testimony that Mr. Salameh rented a storage locker at 69 Mallory Avenue in Jersey City where two other defendants, one of them Mr. Yousef, had chemicals delivered in the months before the trade center blast that could have been used to make the explosive.
But, in attempting to create a plausible bombing plot, the Government's lawyers have run into difficulties. The biggest problem has been what they do not have: a witness who could place the defendants in the trade center at the time of the blast. Beyond that, some witnesses did not come through with unambiguous identifications.
Perhaps more important, prosecutors never found a way to establish a critical link in the case: Its witnesses were unable to say exactly what caused the explosion on Feb. 26, and thus witnesses could only infer that the chemicals found in Mr. Salameh's storage locker were the same as those used to make the trade center bomb.
Yesterday, as the defendants' lawyers cross-examined the Government's final witness, David R. Williams, an F.B.I. bomb expert, they wasted no time in making that point.
"You realize that there was an expert chemist who testified that he cannot determine the cause of the explosion?" Hassen Ibn Abdellah, the lawyer for Mahmud Abouhalima, asked Mr. Williams.
"Yes," Mr. Williams replied.
"So you're trying to draw an inference that because these items were found at 69 Mallory Avenue that they must have been the items that were used in the World Trade Center?"
"They could have been used," Mr. Williams said.
 
Overlapping Evidence
 The prosecution's carefully constructed case seems intended to overcome any weaknesses by producing a huge volume of overlapping evidence, so that even if any single point is subject to doubt, the avalanche will prevent any of the defendants from wriggling free. It seems that in the case against some defendants, the closing arguments that will be made by both prosecutors and defense lawyers in the next week or so may prove decisive. These, meanwhile, are the main elements in the prosecution's case against each of the four men on trial.
 
Mohammad A. Salameh
 Much of the Government's case has centered on the activities of this 26-year-old Palestinian immigrant, against whom prosecutors have managed to compile the heaviest layer of circumstantial evidence. Mr. Salameh was the first to be mentioned in the Government's case, as the renter of the yellow Ford Econoline van whose shattered remains were found in the trade center wreckage.
He also rented an apartment at 40 Pamrapo Avenue in Jersey City, where, according to several witnesses, chemicals that could have been used to make the bomb were mixed, leaving telltale blue stains on what had been white walls. Mr. Salameh also rented the locker at the Space Station Self Storage Company where similar chemicals were delivered. Two workers at the Space Station testified that they saw Mr. Salameh accept delivery of three hydrogen tanks of exactly the sort that were found, in fragments, after the explosion.
 
Bought Chemicals
 Mr. Salameh's fingerprints were found on a World Trade Center parking stub dated Feb. 24, two days before the explosion. He was often seen in the presence of Mr. Yousef, who has emerged in testimony as the apparent on-the-scene mastermind of the bombing plot. Mr. Yousef, the testimony has shown, helped to buy chemicals for the Space Station locker and was often seen there.
He was said to have have lived with Mr. Salameh at the apartment on Pamrapo Avenue. He was in an accident in a car that Mr. Salameh was driving and that had been rented by another defendant, Nidal A. Ayyad. Finally, Mr. Salameh was identified by one witness as having bought gas for the yellow Ryder van nine hours before the trade center explosion, and several hours after Mr. Salameh reported the same van stolen.
In cross-examination, Mr. Salameh's lawyer, Robert E. Precht, has tried to remove the sting from the evidence by suggesting that Mr. Salameh may have done the things he is alleged to have done because somebody else asked him to do them, suggesting that he may not have known the purpose. For example, Mr. Salameh says that he rented the Ryder van to help a friend move some furniture, but then reported it stolen the night before prosecutors say it appeared, loaded with a 1,200- to 1,600-pound bomb, in the World Trade Center's underground parking garage.
Was the van really stolen, or was Mr. Salameh's report faked to provide an alibi? Could he have rented the Space Station locker and taken delivery of chemicals without knowing what they were for? Does the presence of explosive chemicals in the locker mean that those same chemicals were used to make the bomb that blew up in the trade center, a bomb whose components could not be ascertained by investigators? Those are the questions for the jury.
 
Nidal A. Ayyad
 In many ways, this 27-year-old naturalized American citizen of Palestinian origin had the most to lose. He had married and had a child shortly before the explosion. He had earned a degree in chemistry from Rutgers University and embarked on a promising career at the Allied Signal Corporation in Morristown, N.J. He supported a younger brother and his mother, who lived with him at 60 Boyden Avenue in Woodbridge, N.J.
Mr. Ayyad's lawyer, Atiq Ahmed, stressed these facets of Mr. Ayyad's life in his cross-examination, arguing that his client was not a likely terrorist. But the prosecution has presented some apparently devastating testimony.
Several witnesses identified Mr. Ayyad as the man who bought, or tried to buy, chemicals of the sort later delivered to the Space Station. One chemical company owner said that he twice saw Mr. Ayyad pick up orders of lead nitrate, an ingredient in the making of lead azide, often used to initiate explosive charges. Two witnesses said that Mr. Ayyad tried to buy explosives even after the trade center bombing, suggesting that he had already embarked on another unspecified bomb plot.
Then there were telephone calls and letters taking credit for the bombing, which, testimony suggested, appeared to have come from Mr. Ayyad. One witness said he was sure that it was Mr. Ayyad's voice that was recorded in such a call made to The Daily News the day after the explosion. A DNA analysis of saliva found on an envelope mailed to The New York Times with a similar claim matched Mr. Ayyad's saliva, though it could have also matched the saliva of many other people.
Investigators found in Mr. Ayyad's computer at Allied Signal the text of still another message warning that more bombings would be committed "if our demands are not met."
 
Mahmud Abouhalima
 The Government probably ended up with more questions than it could have anticipated in its case against this Egyptian-born limousine driver. That is largely because Mr. Abouhalima, accused of helping to mix the explosives and transport the bomb, was supposed to have been identified in court by a gas station attendant who told investigators that he saw Mr. Abouhalima, Mr. Salameh and the fugitive defendant, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, together just hours before the explosion. The witness, Willie Hernandez Moosh, said that the three men came in a dark Lincoln Town Car and the Ryder rental van to get gasoline early on the morning of Feb. 26.
But Mr. Moosh provided the trial with its most bizarrely funny moment when, instead of picking out the red-haired Mr. Abouhalima as the man he had seen that night, he pointed to a red-haired juror. Then, asked whether he recognized another man, the man driving the van that night, whom he had indicated was Mr. Salameh, he picked out a second juror. Only later, when Mr. Moosh's testimony continued the next day, did he say that he had made a mistake, and pointed to both Mr. Abouhalima and Mr. Salameh as the men he saw that night. The question is whether his later identifications will be believed by jurors who saw him make clear mistakes only one day before.
Still, Mr. Abouhalima was identified by two other witnesses in other contexts. One said that he came to visit Mr. Salameh and Mr. Yousef in an apartment that they had rented at 34 Kensington Avenue in Jersey City. The driver of a tow truck also identified Mr. Abouhalima as the man who picked up Mr. Salameh's car at a garage after Mr. Salameh and Mr. Yousef were in a traffic accident.
Other witnesses, while they did not point to Mr. Abouhalima in court, said they saw "a big guy" with red hair carrying large buckets and other things from the Pamrapo Avenue apartment. Finally, investigators found sulfuric acid burns on a shoe discovered in a carton in the basement of Mr. Abouhalima's home. Sulfuric acid was one of the chemicals presumably used by the bomb makers.
Mr. Abouhalima's defense lawyers have touched on two points in their cross-examinations: one, that knowing Mr. Salameh and Mr. Yousef does not prove that Mr. Abouhalima participated in any plot together with them; second, sulfuric acid can end up on a shoe if you spill the liquid from a car battery, and Mr. Abouhalima made his living as a limousine driver. Finally, even though Mr. Moosh eventually, on his second day, did point out Mr. Abouhalima, would the jury be willing to send a man to life in prison based on a shaky identification?
 
Ahmad A. Ajaj
 The case against Mr. Ajaj, a Palestinian who has applied for political asylum, seems weakest, if only because he was in prison for the six months immediately before the bomb exploded, after he tried to enter the country on a return trip from Pakistan with an altered Swedish passport.
Yet the prosecution has kicked up a swirl of suspicion around Mr. Salameh. When he entered the country on Sept. 1, 1992, he was carrying four passports under four different names, along with several other fake identity cards. He had six volumes of military manuals that showed how to make a bomb using the same materials that were later found by investigators in the Space Station locker. On some pages in two of the manuals, Mr. Yousef's fingerprints were found. Mr. Ajaj also had two videotapes made by something called the International Islamic Resistance that showed how to make bombs.
But do these things show, as the prosecution claims, that Mr. Ajaj came to this country intending to participate in the trade center bombing? Mr. Ajaj's lawyer, Austin Campriello, is expected to try to show that Mr. Ajaj was an Islamic militant involved in the conflict in Afghanistan, but not in the trade center bomb plot. The jury would be asked to decide if that explanation is plausible.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 10, 1994, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the prosecution's case in the World Trade Center bombing trial misidentified a defendant at one point. It was Ahmad A. Ajaj, not Mohammad A. Salameh, who was arrested when he entered the country on Sept. 1, 1992, carrying four passports under different names.

HEADLINE: Taste of Middle-Class Pay for Welfare Mothers

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 9

 BODY:
At 4:30 in the morning, when no one is up but the drug dealers, Charlene Franklin is pulling herself out of bed. In the darkness of her South Side housing project, she puts on her grimy brogans and yellow hard hat, kisses her six sleeping children goodbye and braves bullets and envy to earn a paycheck beyond a welfare mother's wildest dreams.
For $13.52 an hour, Mrs. Franklin paints, plumbs, plasters, scrapes, scrubs, sweeps, hangs doors and lays tile to make abandoned public housing units, stripped by vandals and gang members, habitable again. It is the first real job she has ever had.
 
Power of a Consumer
 She works with a team of other former welfare recipients in a pilot project, Step Up, which uses Federal housing rehabilitation money to train poor residents in construction jobs. 
 Now that she is making more money than just about anyone else in the neighborhood and has come to accept the inevitability of taxes and the high cost of breakfast cereal, she has come to the conclusion of just about every employee in America: "The more you make, the more you need," she said.
While Congress and the White House prepare to wrangle over ways to put welfare recipients to work, the Step Up program is quietly transforming the lives of a small group of housing residents in Chicago and elsewhere, who the program's officials have discovered will work for the same incentive other people do: money.
The program is in the very earliest stages, and it is not yet clear how easily it can be duplicated. Also, the program's primary goal of moving trainees into private jobs is limited by the market for construction workers in general.
But would-be workers appear desperate to get on someone's payroll. When the Chicago Housing Authority held a jobs call in the fall of 1992, 1,200 residents, many of them high school dropouts and welfare recipients who had never worked before, showed up for 300 training slots. To be hired, they had to pass a drug test, be able to read at sixth-grade level and show that they were on a public housing lease.
To make the program possible, the Department of Housing and Urban Development established a new job category to satisfy Federal restrictions on who can work on Federal job sites. It also had to persuade trade unions to cooperate with housing authorities, with inducements being an agreement to hire union members to train residents and the idea that unions could add to their numbers.
The Chicago Housing Authority made sure that the trainees did not lose their Medicaid benefits and that their rents did not go up. The participants receive no other public assistance while in the program.
The trainees went to work in late 1992, carrying out renovations that were part of the housing agency's regular program to repair vacant apartments. They have completed 1,551apartments in half a dozen housing projects in the last 16 months.
 
Lessons for Losers, Too
 In that time, some of the trainees have gotten their high school equivalency diplomas. Some women have started fixing themselves up, wearing makeup instead of rollers so they look like people who earn $13.52 an hour. Some of the men have teamed up with journeymen to work private jobs on weekends. Some now have credit cards, new curtains and dinette tables and a whole new set of problems: relatives wanting money and resentful neighbors who no longer speak to them.
But a third of the trainees never adjusted to the rigors of work and were dismissed, mostly for absenteeism. Some still call or show up begging in vain to get their jobs back. Even they, program officials insist, have learned a valuable lesson about life in the real world.
The program is being duplicated on a smaller scale in Baltimore, Phoenix and Huntington, W. Va.
To get residents to have middle-class dreams in the ambitious Chicago program, Vincent Lane, the chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority, decided to pay the trainees middle-class salaries. Mr. Lane said he needed to extend as big a carrot as possible to change the residents' way of thinking.
"Five dollars an hour is no incentive," Mr. Lane said. "They need to know what it tastes like to be able to put some money in the bank, to get beyond just surviving."
The work is hard and the conditions often dangerous. There have been times when Mrs. Franklin and her co-workers have had to stay at work late, not because their team was running behind, but because gang members were shooting outside the building.
 
A Natural for Public Housing
 Such incidents do not keep Mrs. Franklin from work. A grandmother at 31, she is her family's sole breadwinner and one of the few residents at the Robert Taylor Homes who gets a paycheck instead of food stamps. The unemployment rate there is 96 percent. Everyone in her family knows when pay day comes. "Soon as I get home, the hands are out," she said.
In many ways, Step Up is a natural job-training program for public housing, officials say. There are thousands of abandoned units around the country, millions of tenants with no skills or chance of getting them, and $3 billion in Federal rehabilitation money to pay whoever does the work.
One problem is the jobs are not permanent, because the housing authority wants to open slots for new trainees. The agency is trying to place the current trainees in formal union apprenticeships before taking on new participants. But there are no guarantees.
"If this is their only shot and they get 18 months of these wages and are back on public aid, it's a hard fall," said Doug Dobmeyer, executive director of the Public Welfare Coalition, an Illinois welfare advocacy group.
 
Vision of Better Things
 But even if the jobs do not prove permanent, Mr. Dobmeyer and others argue that with money, as with love, it is better to have had a taste than none at all. Kate Williams, executive director of Women for Economic Security, an advocacy group for women on welfare, said, "It will give all of them a vision of how things could be."
The goal, Mr. Lane said, is to entice the trainees into independence from the housing authority.
The money and dignity have indeed been seductive. Stephanie Stewart started paying her rent three months ahead of time and finally got a telephone. Melinda Powell got a car, a 1983 Oldsmobile. Jocelyn Denton bought a yellow floral sofa that no one in the family can sit on because it is for company. Mrs. Franklin bought a washing machine. And almost all of the trainees have fixed up their apartments, plastering walls and replacing sinks, now that they know how.
Mrs. Denton, the mother of five, has not missed a day at work and makes it her business to arrive half an hour early. There have been times when she has not felt like working, days when she had a bad cold or when it was 20-below-zero and her children said, "Mama, it's so cold out there, you're going to freeze."
She is giddy these days with the sense of mastery. "I can cut doors, I can hang dry wall, I can change a receptacle," Mrs. Denton said, suddenly smiling and catching herself. "Oh, I'm sorry -- you call it an outlet."
 
Envy Is No Bother
 Mrs. Franklin's neighbors do not speak to her anymore. Envy, that's all, she said. "It don't bother me," she said. "I'm doing this for me. They're not going to feed my kids if I can't."
It was not always this way. The residents came in as raw recruits unaccustomed to taking directions or accounting for their whereabouts.
"We're teaching them not just a skill but how to be an employee," said Bettye Vance, the program's director. "We had to let them know that employers are not interested in where you live and what your problems are. You don't bring that to work."
The jobs corrupted some already shaky relationships as the rituals of welfare check day -- men waiting outside the projects to get money from the women -- began to play out every other Friday when Step Up women get paid. One woman's estranged husband moved back in with her after she got the Step Up job. When she became pregnant, he left again. She then dropped out of the program.
Of the original 298 trainees, 50 have finished the program and have been hired by the Chicago Housing Authority at $19 an hour to remove lead from the projects or as clerks with pay comparable to Step Up's or truck drivers at about $18 an hour. Eighteen are in training for union carpentry apprenticeships, which requires four years.
But twice that many people have been let go, including 64 who were dismissed for poor attendance. Eight were dismissed because they showed up for work drunk or high on drugs. Nine were dismissed for misconduct, usually for fighting on the job, while one was let go for taking a co-worker on a joy ride in the middle of the day.
The program graduates show its possibilities. Melinda Powell, who was on welfare for 14 years before enrolling in Step Up, is a tax-paying, card-carrying member of the Laborers' Union Local No. 1, making $19 an hour removing lead from public housing projects and now worrying about things like retirement savings and bank fees.
"Step Up kind of put a light on things," Ms. Powell said. "It was time to get off public aid, raise my kids, maybe send them off to college and meet my destiny."
The trainees are neither symbols nor window-dressing, the supervisors say. Some apartments needing renovation had been stripped to the studs, walls torn out between units by gang members so they could get to the stairwells more quickly, and everything from toilet pipes to switch-plates stripped by vandals for scrap metal.
The women do most of the work and the journeymen mostly watch, field supervisors say. The teams of trainees can renovate a gutted apartment in two or three days, compared with seven days for government contractors.
The other morning, Debra Webster was plastering a hallway wall. Mrs. Franklin was painting a bedroom. Dora Edwards was learning how to replace a sink. Gwendolyn Stanley was crouched on the floor, installing an electrical outlet near the kitchen, as Gary Anderson, a journeyman electrician, watched.
The journeymen say the trainees are as good as the professionals now. "She can wire my house any time," Mr. Anderson said of Ms. Stanley.
But the women have their own problems to worry about. For four months, Mrs. Edwards learned about painting from the painter and carpentry from the carpenter, but was going home to an apartment where she and her five children had to bathe in the dark with the bathroom door cracked open for light. The wires behind the light fixture were burned out and the authority's maintenance people never managed to get around to it.
Finally, Mrs. Edwards was assigned to work with the journeyman electrician, who taught her about electrical outlets. She went home that day to try out what she learned. Now there is light.

HEADLINE: Japanese Chief, Due in the U.S., Faces 'Impasse'

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 9

 BODY:
From the first time they met seven months ago, a new American President and Japan's most prominent reformer, Bill Clinton and Morihiro Hosokawa agreed that their countries needed a radically new way to deal with each other.
Neither Washington nor Tokyo could afford to continue the bickering, stonewalling and threats of retaliation, they said, that have gradually poisoned the trade relations between the two countries for a decade. Aides of both men kept talking enthusiastically about their special bond, two young Southern governors, both with a mandate for reform and a common outlook on the world. This time, everyone said, things would be different.
 
Everything at 'an Impasse'
 But just a day before Prime Minister Hosokawa flies off for his first trip to Washington -- the White House, Capitol Hill and Georgetown University in 36 hours -- very few are talking that way anymore. After three weeks of lurching from one crisis to another that threatened to oust him from office, Mr. Hosokawa admitted to Japanese reporters today that the negotiations over carrying out a broad new "framework" for trade relations between the two countries had gotten nowhere. 
 "Everything has come to an impasse," he said. The two sides have yet to move beyond a fundamental disagreement on how to measure progress -- an issue that was papered over in July, left for later resolution.
Later has arrived. In a frenzy of last minute activity, Mr. Hosokawa sent a secret envoy, Akitane Kiuchi, a former ambassador to several countries, to see President Clinton late Tuesday to plead for more time. His presence was disclosed by American officials. The Prime Minister's intentions are good, Mr. Kiuchi said, but his coalition Government is in such chaos than he cannot yet deliver.
American officials say the special envoy had been politely told by both Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore that six months of negotiations had been plenty of time for the Japanese Government to get its house in order. Mr. Kiuchi, a close friend and adviser of the Prime Minister's, rushed back to Tokyo early today in time to brief Mr. Hosokowa before he departs for Washington and the summit meeting Friday with Mr. Clinton.
American officials said that when Mr. Kiuchi first met with Mr. Gore on Monday and appealed for more time, Mr. Gore looked at his watch and responded with an innocent smile: "Why? He has four days."
Last night, Mr. Kiuchi was brought into the Oval Office for a meeting with Mr. Clinton. He told the President that Mr. Hosokawa "agrees with you" on the need to deregulate Japanese markets, provide more consumer choice, stimulate the Japanese economy and generally open markets to more competition.
 
Achievements Cited
 Mr. Kiuchi pointed out that Mr. Hosokawa had already opened Japan's previously closed rice market, begun political reform, opened the construction market and last week moved to stimulate the economy with a tax cut.
The envoy insisted that the Prime Minister "can only take on so many battles at once," according to an American official. Therefore, he appealed to Mr. Clinton not to turn the summit into a confrontation, or bring excessive pressure on Mr. Hosokawa, who is already sinking in popularity at home.
American officials said Mr. Clinton's response was that "sometimes in a great relationship you achieve more by disagreeing" and facing up to your disagreements than by papering them over. The President also argued that the Japanese leader should be aligning himself with the Japanese public, and indirectly with the United States, in pressing for sweeping change.
Mr. Kiuchi was politely sent packing, reminded that for months now Mr. Clinton has sent envoys of his own to Tokyo to urge the political leadership to get involved in the talks and overrule the country's powerful, turf-protecting bureaucrats. "They still didn't get the message," an American official here said.
 
Each Wants Concessions
 Both the Prime Minister and Mr. Clinton appear to be counting on a last-minute concession from the other that can keep the talks from becoming what editorial cartoonists here were picturing today as an impending train wreck. Mr. Hosokawa has already survived two near misses in a month, and has proven that he is the master of the last-minute compromise, an art that is highly valued in Japanese brinkmanship. But there are doubts among his advisers that he can sidestep this one.
Tonight, Mr. Hosokawa sent another envoy, Tsutomu Hata, the Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, in hopes that on Thursday he can patch something together.
But by Friday in Washington, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa will face a choice: to word their way around the disagreements, or face a confrontation with his most important ally and second-biggest trading partner. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has already said he would rather have no deal than a bad one. "We will not settle for anything cosmetic," he vowed during a visit here two weeks ago.
Already senior Japanese officials are urging the Administration to look at Mr. Hosokawa's intentions rather than his results so far. "He won't be able to say 'I have done this,' " a senior Japanese official said the other day. "Instead, he will have to say 'I tried.' "
 
Japan Cites Security Issues
 Fearful that the White House is focused exclusively on trade, Japanese officials are again warning of the need to give equal weight to security issues in Asia and the "global cooperation" programs between the two countries, in AIDS research, space and other scientific pursuits. A top official of the Japanese Foreign Ministry went so far the other day as to warn that a breach in the Japanese-American relationship would be the wrong signal to send North Korea, at a time of growing tension over nuclear inspections.
"It is important not to let the assessment of the framework agreement affect the other dimensions of the relationship," said Yukio Sato, who oversees the Government's relations with North America.
Efforts to change the subject have clearly frustrated the American Ambassador here, Walter F. Mondale. Mr. Mondale arrived in Tokyo brimming with ideas about how to get the two countries out of their rut of charge and countercharge, in which one trade barrier is eliminated and another magically pops to the surface. But after a few months of receiving promises from senior Japanese politicians that they would step in to overrule the bureaucrats, Mr. Mondale is still waiting.
"We get in there and they say there is no problem, their market is open," he said recently. "If that's the case, why are we negotiating?"
In word, if not yet in deed, Mr. Hosokawa has embraced an agenda once put forth by Japan's critics: He wants radical deregulation, a shift of power from producers to consumers, and a country that buys car parts and insurance and banking services on the basis of price and quality, rather than corporate or political relationships.
In practice, Mr. Hosokawa is greatly hamstrung. He has repeatedly backed down from his ambitious goals -- first on reforming the political system, then on a stimulus package to spur a recession-bound economy -- because of rebellions among the Socialists, the biggest party in his coalition. In the end he has been forced to ally himself with the Liberal Democrats or the bureaucrats, the forces he had vowed to defeat.
Mr. Hosokawa's first love, like Mr. Clinton's, seems to be domestic politics. Dealing with the country's $50 billion trade surplus is guaranteed to be a political nightmare at home, and he often seems detached from the details, leaving it to the trade negotiators.
The framework talks are the latest incarnation of an old idea: to find a comprehensive approach to bringing down the trade gap, mixing broad economic techniques -- mostly to encourage Japanese consumers to buy more imports -- with specific attention to key industries and markets. But the United States insisted from the start that they quantify the results, something that was missing from the last effort, the Bush Administration's awkwardly named "structural impediments initiative."
Japan rejected that idea, with an argument that makes perfect economic sense: One cannot set "targets" for America's share of the market without abandoning free-market principles. For days at the Tokyo summit meeting last summer there were heated arguments about how to set targets without managing trade. Mr. Miyazawa and Mr. Clinton retired to the sushi bar at the Hotel Okura.
 
'Objective Criteria' Undefined
 A few hours later, as Japanese bureaucrats still argued bitterly among themselves, the two countries announced a new system in which "objective criteria" would be used to measure progress in some key problem areas: autos and auto parts, which make up three-quarters of the trade deficit; insurance, intellectual property rights and government purchases of telecommunications equipment and medical technology. The agreement calls for a meeting every six months between the President and the Prime Minister, to insure that political pressure to make progress remains at a consistently high level.
The problem is that the "objective criteria" were never defined, and Japan and the United States have spent six months and untold millions of dollars arguing over what they mean.
Japan now says that agreement was a huge mistake it will never make again. Failure to meet even "informal" targets invite American threats of retaliation. The only acceptable indicators, the Japanese insist, are historical ones. How many right-hand drive cars did Detroit produce last year for Japanese roads? How many seminars did Japanese car makers hold for their American suppliers?
"That's how far the distrust has come," a senior Japanese official mused recently. "We're counting car bumpers."

HEADLINE: ISRAEL-P.L.O. DEAL SOLVES KEY ISSUES IN SELF-RULE PLAN

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Yasir Arafat and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel initialed an agreement tonight that removed many of the obstacles that have delayed putting into effect the accord to give the Palestinians limited self-rule. Mr. Peres said the agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which crowned weeks of intensive negotiations between the two sides, covered the main issues between them.
The two sides have been trying for months to work out the details of an agreement reached last September that provides for Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
 Mr. Peres said the two sides reached agreement on the question of the administration of border posts between Gaza and Egypt and between Jericho and Jordan.
The Israeli Foreign Minister, who has been directly involved in the negotiations, said the two negotiating teams had also signed a three-page accord that not only dealt with passage in and out of Jericho, but also with the role of the Palestinian civil administration in Jericho. He also said they had settled what he termed "the distribution of security."
 
Issue of Jericho's Extent
 A major question has been the actual size of Jericho -- whether the zone of Palestinian self-rule would be limited to the city, or would include the area around the city. Mr. Peres said the final boundaries of Jericho would be decided when Mr. Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel meet again. However, he said the limits had been all but agreed upon tonight.
"All the problems we had before us we solved either completely in detail, or in principle," Mr. Peres said. "Some details were left over for later."
Mr. Arafat said the agreement that the two leaders initialed was an important step toward carrying out the agreement, but cautioned that there was still work to be done.
 
Approval by Higher Bodies
 "It's a very important step towards translating the declaration of principles into a reality on the ground," he said, referring to last year's agreement, which was signed in Washington on Sept. 13. "We have agreed with Mr. Peres to continue work here in Cairo and in Paris."
A senior Egyptian official involved in the talks said that Mr. Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, would take the proposal back to Tunis for approval by his Executive Committee and Mr. Peres would present it to Mr. Rabin and the Cabinet. The Egyptian official also said that a compromise had been worked out on the size of Jericho, but did not give details, saying only that it would be between 55 and 70 square kilometers (21 and 27 square miles).
It was clear, however, that there were still details to be ironed out before the agreement would be carried out. Originally, the Israelis were supposed to start their withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho by Dec. 13, as part of a timetable leading to eventual Palestinian self-rule in the area.
Israeli officials said they still had to work out details on security issues, the transfer of civil powers to the Palestinians and economic arrangements.
"We have agreed with Mr. Peres to continue with the work on other issues so that we can overcome all our problems," Mr. Arafat said.
 
'A New Era for Our People'
 "We are sure we can create now a new era for our people," he said. "We can say that Palestine and the name of Palestine have returned to the map of the Middle East."
The agreement, which came after some half dozen meetings in 48 hours between Mr. Arafat and Mr. Peres, was the first tangible sign that they have bridged wide gaps delaying the Israeli withdrawal. Mr. Peres was in constant contact with Mr. Rabin throughout the sessions, an Israeli official said.
"Occasionally it was not simple," Mr. Peres said, "because what we call security the Palestinians call dignity, and what we call dignity they call security."
Mr. Arafat and Mr. Peres initialed one three-page document on principles, to be called The Cairo Document, and a separate eight-page agreement on details. They also initialed maps and shook hands to scattered applause at the Al-Itahidiya Presidential Palace. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt was host for the brief ceremony and spoke with Mr. Rabin late last night.
Mr. Rabin told the Egyptian leader there was still a lot to be done, an official from the Prime Minister's office said.
 
A Final Meeting
 Mr. Arafat and Mr. Peres met for about one hour before the signing ceremony to overcome last-minute problems, Israeli officials said.
A Palestinian negotiator, Nabil Shaath, said agreement was reached on separate Israeli and Palestinian entry routes at the border with Egypt and Jordan. He said it was still unclear what authority the Palestinian Government would have over travelers to the self-rule area.
"It's all about sovereignty," Mr. Shaath said, referring to the self-rule area. "They are trying too remind us at every step that it is not an independent state, that it's only an interim stage."
The Israel-P.L.O. accord is the initial phase of a five-year interim period of limited Palestinian self-rule. A final settlement will be negotiated during the interim period.
 
Palestinian Police Unit
 A 15,000-member Palestinian police force will take over security duties inside the self-rule area.
The Israeli withdrawal from the area became bogged down when the two sides failed to agree on the boundaries of Palestinian self-rule in Jericho, control of border crossings from Gaza to Egypt and Jericho to Jordan, and how the Israeli Army would protect Jewish settlers.
The Israeli Prime Minister said on Tuesday that even if there was an agreement, more issues would have to be resolved in talks before the withdrawal could start.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Agrees to Avert Cuts For Arts With Donation Plan

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
A week after proposing budget cuts for the arts in New York City, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced an agreement yesterday in which the city would restore the cuts and provide even more money -- but only after the city's cultural institutions raised matching contributions from private sources.
The goals of the new plan, announced by the Mayor and leaders of some of the city's most prestigious arts institutions, are to increase overall financing for the arts, which Mr. Giuliani hopes will help the city's economy, and to encourage arts groups to raise more private money and become less dependent on city subsidies. 
 The Mayor also held up the proposal as a model of the kinds of public-private partnerships that he hopes to encourage throughout government as a way of reducing the city's financial obligations and huge budget shortfall. Under the plan Mr. Giuliani said the city would offer $5 million in the fiscal year that begins in July and ask the state to do the same, to match the $10 million in private contributions that the arts institutions pledged to raise. Also, he said, if the private money is raised, the administration will restore the nearly $4.2 million he proposed cutting from the $86.6 million the city would grant in the next fiscal year to arts groups, large and small.
It was not clear, however, whether Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Legislature would approve the state's $5 million share at a time when the state faces a projected gap of $3 billion in its own budget.
While the city provides financing for more than 400 cultural groups, including the 31 major institutions on city property, any group or artistic program would be eligible to apply for the matching grants for any new contributions.
No single group could receive more than $750,000 in the grants, and the larger institutions whose annual budgets exceed $1 million would have to show that the grants would be used to improve the public's access to the arts -- for example, by extending hours at a museum.
While the program, if successful, would increase the city's spending on the arts by $9.2 million above the $82.2 million proposed in Mr. Giuliani's preliminary budget last week, the Mayor made no guarantee that the increase would be repeated next year.
Appearing with the Mayor at City Hall were Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the co-chairman of the New-York Historical Society; Martin E. Segal, the chairman of the New York International Festival of the Arts, and leaders of other institutions. In addition to their pledge to raise $10 million, they said they would form a partnership to help the city's smaller museums, theaters and other arts groups raise money, perhaps by holding a benefit on their behalf.
The plan puts an extra burden on the smaller cultural organizations to raise money, since most have less established fund-raising mechanisms than the larger institutions, like the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the New-York Historical Society.
Curt Dempster, the director of the Ensemble Studio Theater in Manhattan, which received a grant of $8,116 from the city this fiscal year, expressed initial support for the plan as a welcome enticement to raise money. He added, however, that questions remained and that some smaller groups could be put at a disadvantage.
"It's a little bit like saying to somebody in the poverty cycle, 'Get out and get a job and we'll match it,' " said Mr. Dempster, whose organization presents a variety of new productions or experimental plays. "Some of these groups cannot just get out of poverty."
The plan grew out of negotiations over the last month between the city's cultural and arts establishment and one of the Mayor's deputies, John S. Dyson, who caused a furor after Mr. Giuliani's election when he suggested that the city might benefit more if it focused its cultural budget on the institutions that attracted tourists.
Mr. Giuliani, who has maintained that he never intended to cut money for smaller groups at the expense of the major institutions, said that the new plan offered a way to increase money for all the arts in cooperation with private foundations or individuals.
Emphasizing that the arts leaders would work with the Department of Cultural Affairs to teach smaller, less established groups how to raise money, the Mayor added that the city's arts groups could not simply rely on government grants.
"The way in which they are going to survive and grow and expand," he said, "is if they develop the expertise to do their own fund raising and develop a constituency in essence of their own."
Some questions still remained unanswered. It was not clear how exactly the matching grants would be distributed or whether the program would prevent only a handful of large institutions, raising $750,000 each, from absorbing all the matching grants.
As for the state's role, Charles F. Porcari, a spokesman for the Governor, said that Mr. Cuomo had not seen the proposal but that he "appreciated the interests in the arts" and would consider it as he negotiates his budget with the State Legislature by April. "We can consider this along with the $275 million in other requests from New York City," Mr. Porcari said.
In making their announcement, the Mayor and the arts leaders said the fund raising would begin once the city and state committed the matching grants of $5 million each.
The city's Cultural Affairs Department, whose new head is Schuyler G. Chapin, a former manager of the Metropolitan Opera and dean of Columbia University's School of the Arts, would oversee the program in conjunction with its private sponsors, headed by Mr. Ross and Mr. Segal. A meeting is planned next week to begin to organize the details of the plan.
Mr. Segal said the coalition would hold at least one fund-raiser to benefit the smaller institutions, with the money to be divided by the Cultural Affairs Department.
"We hope to encourage people who give to the larger insitutions to consider donations to the smaller ones as well," he said.
But some representatives of the city's smaller institutions questioned how much benefit their less established programs would receive.
Stanley Cogan, president of the Queens Historical Society, which receives a major part of its budget from the city, including $71,914 this fiscal year, said fund raising had become extremely competitive. He said he worried that smaller groups would be at a distinct disadvantage competing for the grants and could be left with less in the end.
"Sure, we'd try it," Mr. Cogan said, "but it's a very dubious way to go."
But Mr. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor, said the intent was not to hurt art groups, large or small. Noting that the arts were vital to the city's economy, he said the plan would entice groups "to reach a new plateau" of financing by tempting them to compete for the grants.
"They could get a lot more money," Mr. Dyson said of the smaller groups. "It depends on how hard they work. That's part of the excitement of it. They can go to donors, even at $10, and say we can match that from the city and state."

HEADLINE: Clinton Health Plan: Testimony Reveals the Government's Hand

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Though President Clinton dismissed its conclusions as "a policy wonk deal," the Congressional Budget Office has put its finger on something the Administration was loath to acknowledge: Mr. Clinton's health plan depends heavily on the power of the Government to compel behavior that would not otherwise occur in the private market.
Such an exercise of Federal power may be good or bad, but it should be recognized for what it is, said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the budget office, who has testified before two Congressional committees this week. 
 In some ways, his statement underscored the obvious: the reason for any new governmental program is to produce results that would not otherwise occur. But in public remarks, the President has gone to great lengths to minimize the Government's role and to insist that his plan represents merely an expansion of the existing system of private health insurance, a more rational version of the market, not a vast new Federal enterprise.
 
Flexing 'Sovereign Power'
 In testimony on Tuesday and again today, however, Mr. Reischauer said the Clinton plan "would establish a universal entitlement to health insurance that would be largely financed by mandatory payments resulting from an exercise of sovereign power."
Under this plan, he said: "Federal law, rather than the employer, would determine the benefits and premiums. The transaction would no longer be voluntary. The employer could not drop or change the terms of the health insurance benefit."
Under the Clinton plan, most Americans would get coverage through insurance purchasing pools known as health alliances. The alliances "would operate primarily as agents of the Federal Government," not as private entities, Mr. Reischauer said, adding that by the year 2004 the alliances would get 30 percent of their money from the Federal Government.
"The health alliances would be more like Federal agencies than like state or private entities," and their spending should be included in the accounts of the Federal Government, where they would be subject to "a full accounting and some sort of control," Mr. Reischauer said.
 
Product of Policy Wonks
 The President brushed aside the significance of these recommendations, just as he minimized the criticism of his health plan last week by the Business Roundtable, a group of executives from about 200 of the nation's largest corporations. Referring to Mr. Reischauer's concerns, Mr. Clinton said: "We'll fix that. That's not a problem. That's a Washington policy wonk deal."
But the Clinton plan was devised by a small army of policy wonks. And they had just such concerns in mind -- as something to avoid. One such White House expert said today, "The concern that the alliances would be viewed as governmental agencies, collecting taxes, heavily influenced the design of our plan."
Under the President's proposal, premium payments would flow from consumers and employers to alliances, then to doctors and hospitals, without going through the Federal Treasury.
A major reason for the complexity of Mr. Clinton's plan, with its premiums and subsidies, is that he was determined to avoid a payroll tax. Administration officials acknowledge that such a tax might have been simpler to administer, but they say it would have been politically unacceptable.
Mr. Reischauer said the premium payments should be treated as Government receipts. This conclusion reduces the political advantage that Mr. Clinton thought his plan had over the "single payer" bills sponsored by two Democrats in Congress, Representative Jim McDermott of Washington and Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, who explicitly propose new taxes to finance universal health care.
The Congressional Budget Office also said Mr. Clinton's health plan would increase the Federal budget deficit over the next decade, rather than reducing it as the President had predicted. And Mr. Reischauer said the premiums would have to be 15 percent higher than the White House estimated.
These were differences of degree -- Mr. Clinton had acknowledged an initial rise in the deficit -- and Mr. Reischauer called the disparities "small potatoes" in a world of trillion-dollar Federal budgets.
 
Some Findings Welcomed
 After consulting with the President today, Democratic Congressional leaders echoed the President's statement that the discrepancies were not very significant. Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said the budget office report was "not a problem." And House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington said that modest changes in Mr. Clinton's plans would remedy the problems identified by the Congressional Budget Office.
Supporters of the Clinton plan welcomed some of Mr. Reischauer's findings, particularly his conclusion that the plan would increase the range of health care choices "for the vast majority of Americans." In addition, Mr. Reischauer said the plan would slow the growth of health spending overall and probably reduce the total spent on health insurance by all businesses taken together.
But these predictions are based on Mr. Reischauer's assumption that the President's proposal to limit health insurance premiums would work as intended and would be completely effective.
Kathryn M. Langwell, director of health economics at the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick, said she was surprised at this assumption. Ms. Langwell, who supervised health research at the Congressional Budget Office from 1989 to 1993, said, "In previous cost estimates of health reform plans, the budget office did not assume that expenditure caps would be 100 percent effective, and I doubt whether they will be."

HEADLINE: Quake Bill Spurs Long Deficit Debate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
The Senate had every intention today of approving $9.7 billion in new deficit spending for the Pentagon and victims of recent earthquakes and floods, but instead it found itself snared in a nasty debate over whether cutting the deficit might be wiser than raising it again.
The lawmakers argued for about seven hours. In the end, it was no contest: the cuts were shelved, in a lopsided 65-to-31 vote. 
 Picking the fight was Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat who has lately made deficit reduction his personal cause, not to mention a pain for President Clinton.
Last fall, Mr. Kerrey very nearly sank Mr. Clinton's first budget by threatening until the last hour to oppose it as too fainthearted on cuts in spending. Today, as the Senate took up the earthquake-relief bill that the House passed last week, Mr. Kerrey sprang again, proposing an amendment to enact 56 spending cuts totaling $94.2 billion through 1998.
 
Debt Prompts Fears
 And once again he chided Mr. Clinton, saying the President "got his priorities wrong" by proposing new social and public-works programs in his latest budget instead of further reducing the deficit, now pegged at $176 billion in the 1995 fiscal year, which starts on Oct. 1. Just the interest payments on the overall Federal debt of $4 trillion-plus, the Senator noted, are expected to total $212 billion next year.
"It's difficult to look at these numbers; difficult to look at this accumulation of debt every single year and say we're doing the right thing," Mr. Kerrey said, "because we're not."
Mr. Kerrey and his Republican co-sponsor, Hank Brown of Colorado, echoed what fiscal conservatives and some economists have argued for years: that a continued rise in the Federal debt would soak the national savings, lower living standards and strip the Government of any money to address the nation's ills.
But that argument withered before a chorus of objections from colleagues who accused the two Senators of trying to cut favorite programs or rob money needed for fighting crime and changing health care.
 
Tough Words From Byrd
 Most pitiless was Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Democrat who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, which had voted to finance the programs that Mr. Kerrey sought to pare.
Mr. Byrd said that most of the proposed savings were illusory, and that much of the rest was irresponsible.
And he spoke about the political morality of passing big debts onto one's descendants as viewed by Thomas Jefferson, a President who opposed the notion but who borrowed $15 million to buy the Louisiana Territory anyway.
"He saddled the taxpayers of this country far beyond his Administration's ability to pay that debt," Mr. Byrd said of Jefferson. "If he had waited until he'd gotten the down payment, we'd never have gotten that territory. He did it -- Jefferson did it -- and I thank heaven that he did it."
Mr. Byrd then moved to table Mr. Kerrey's proposal and a second Republican one, by Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, that would have enacted a similar amount of cuts in Pentagon programs.
 
Cuts That Aren't Cuts
 Three of Mr. Kerrey's largest cuts, in truth, were not cuts at all, but increases in Medicare charges, mostly for better-off retirees. The Senate had already considered and rejected them last year as politically untenable.
Some others were hardy perennials in the attack on Federal excess. For example, Mr. Kerrey suggested that the Government stop awarding subsidies for college students to prison inmates. He asked the Senate to wipe out a Small Business Administration tree-planting program, shut down a Pentagon school for doctors that has long been criticized as hugely expensive and end subsidies to beekeepers.
He also asked Congress to cut its own pay by 5 percent, its budget by 7.5 percent and its fund for free mailings to constituents by 20 percent.
Lost amid all this was the earthquake bill, which now seems destined to be considered -- and, everyone agrees, passed -- on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Colombia's Leader Defends Presence of G.I.'s

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 9

 BODY:
President Cesar Gaviria today accused Colombia's highest administrative court of being politically motivated in asking the Congress to investigate him for allowing the presence of 150 United States Army engineers in the country.
The court, called the Council of State, contended that Mr. Gaviria was violating Colombia's Constitution by permitting armed foreign troops to enter the country without prior congressional approval. The ruling added fuel to a three-month public outcry led by the press and politicians who charge that the presence of the United States troops in Juanchaco Bay in southwest Colombia is illegal and that American labor is being used at the expense of unemployed Colombians. 
 In charging at a news conference today that the ruling by the court was politcally motivate, Mr. Gaviria questioned its interpretation of the Constitution. "This means that to permit the entry of any military attache we would need to ask Congress for permission," he said.
Mr. Gaviria added that American cooperation in Colombia also included radar and other technology used in antidrug efforts. He said that the United States and Colombia had been involved in military cooperation projects since the signing of a military cooperation treaty in 1952 and that Colombia could not renege on international agreements.
 
A $3 Million Project
 "I am surprised that Colombians demand more international cooperation in the fight against drugs and then criticize such operations," Mr. Gaviria said.
The Army engineers in Juanchaco Bay plan to build a school and roads in a $3 million project described by American and Colombian officials as an army exercise. Although Juanchaco Bay is just 50 miles west of Cali, home to a notorious drug cartel, United States and Colombian officials have denied that the operation involves antinarcotics activities.
Under the headline "North American Search Bloc," the Bogota daily La Prensa in December compared the United States Army contingent to the 3,000-man heavily armed police and military force that spent 17 months hunting for Pablo Escobar, the Medellin drug cartel leader.
Other reports have referred to the American troops as "marine," a term that for many Colombians conjures up images of a Yankee invasion.
Politicians who face elections this year wasted little time in profiting from what was for them a well-timed renewal of nationalist ferver, incorporated the controversy into campaigns otherwise starving for debate. The American troops were depicted as invaders, marines and Drug Enforcement Administration agents.
In December, Gustavo Alvarez, Mayor of Tulua, a city near Juanchaco known the activity of drug traffickers, said of the Army engineers, "Since the U.S. is not capable of winning battles in its own cities, it has come to make war in Colombia."
 
2 Missionaries Kidnapped
 In recent weeks guerrilla groups have stepped up attacks against American targets in what has been interpreted as a protest against the United States presence in Colombia.
Three weeks ago, two American missionaries stationed near the town of Villavicencio in western Colombia were kidnapped by a guerrilla group known by its Spanish acronym FARC. Last week, the police in Medellin said they had uncovered a rebel plan to bomb American multinational companies there.
Suggestions have been made that much of the criticism is influenced by the Cali cartel, which feels threatened by the nearby presence of American troops.
Amado Gutierrez, the Council of State president, denied that the court's decision was influenced by drug trafficker. But a fuming Mr. Gaviria suggested the drug barons were influencing the present debate.
"The real threat to our national soverignty is if we let drug traffickers and criminals overrun the country," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
U.S. Seeks To Expand Airwaves

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration will propose a broad, 10-year plan on Thursday to force the Pentagon and other Federal agencies to cede control of a big block of the nation's airwaves and make them available for new commercial technologies.
If adopted, the plan could ultimately force a wide range of military activities, from some long-range air defense radar systems to ground-based communication links, to move to different radio-frequency bands. Civilian programs like atmospheric monitoring would also be affected. 
 Administration officials said today that many services vital to national security or public safety -- like space communications and the air-traffic control system -- would not be moved.
The purpose is to relocate many disparate services in order to clear swaths of frequencies for new commercial services that might include satellite radio broadcasting or whatever other money-making activities that private industry might dream up.
 
 
Auctions Are Planned
 The Government intends to auction licenses for most of these airwaves, which might generate billions of dollars in Federal revenue over the next decade, because wireless communications represent one of the fastest-growing segments of the telecommunications industry.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said today that the plan marked an important attempt to speed the introduction of new commercial technologies and fits into a broader effort by the Administration to shift resources from military activities to the civilian world.
"It certainly fits in with our notion that our national security is inextricably tied to our economic security," Mr. Brown said in an interview. "We clearly had some goals, to promote some sensible use of the spectrum, that keeps our goal of sustained economic growth paramount."
The Administration's plan, a response to legislation passed by Congress last year to reallocate the public airwaves, comes on top of a large band of frequencies that are already being allocated for "personal communication services," -- a new family of offerings that will be available via wireless telephones, computers and palm-sized personal communicators. Licenses for these personal communications services are to be auctioned beginning later this year.
In the plan described today, the Administration took care to accommodate the military, proposing that many of its services be allowed to continue for periods ranging from 3 to 15 years. In addition, the first parcels of airspace that would be turned over to the civilian use are those involving very high frequencies that are more difficult to use than the lower-frequency portions of the bandwidth that will eventually become available.
As a result, the proposal is virtually certain to kick off intense lobbying that will find business and military interests on opposite sides. The Commerce Department is giving all parties about 90 days to comment on the proposals, and officials said they hoped to put the final plan in place exactly one year from now.
The agencies that would be most affected by the plan are the Defense and Energy Departments and the Coast Guard. But in a lengthy report to be released on Thursday, the Commerce Department proposed to protect a number of major activities. In general, it recommended against any changes for frequencies used in navigation, astronomy and space communications. And in other areas, the Commerce Department proposed stringent technical requirements on new commercial services to prevent them from interfering with important Federal activities on adjacent frequencies.
The recommendations thus far are essentially the product of months of internal wrangling between Federal agencies, as each department tried to preserve its own claims on the airwaves. But now the plan will be scrutinized by the public, particularly business groups, and they are likely to push for even more concessions from Federal agencies.
 
Infighting Is Seen
 "What you're seeing now is the result of infighting in the Federal bureaucracy," said a Congressional aide who helped draft the legislation that prompted the new effort. "When private interests take a look at it, and the timetable that's been proposed, it will undoubtedly change."
That view was echoed by Clarence L. Irving Jr., Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, who coordinated work on the plan. "We want to hear from people, both Government users, commercial users and the general public about how we can make the report better," Mr. Irving said.
 
Easing the Transition
 In programs that will be forced to change, the Commerce Department proposed a number of conditions to make the transition less painful.
Frequencies being shifted from long-range air defense radars, for example, would not be freed up for at least five years. Even after that, about 17 key military radar sites would be allowed to operate for another 10 years.
And commercial users who start using the bands would have to incorporate special equipment to keep them from interfering with radars that will continue to be permitted to use adjacent frequencies.
Likewise, the Commerce Department proposed that a radio band now used for tactical radio relay communications and aeronautical telemetry be reserved for the military for at least five years so the Pentagon could replace its current generation of equipment.

HEADLINE: Texaco Settles With Louisiana, Vowing More Investment

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Texaco said yesterday that it would settle a longstanding lawsuit with Louisiana by including an unusual promise to invest $152 million in the state's battered energy industry, a move expected to produce about 1,000 jobs.
"It's going to create some new jobs," Lauren C. Scott, an economist for Louisiana State University, said. "That's what they really need down here. It's a good deal for the state." 
 The dispute mainly concerned royalties Texaco, which is based in White Plains, paid to Louisiana from natural gas produced in fields leased from the state. The state filed the suit in 1988, seeking $387 million plus penalties and interest, charging that the company had underpaid on the royalties for years.
Alfred C. DeCrane, Jr., Texaco's chairman and chief executive, said the settlement, which also includes a payment to the state of $250 million in cash, cleared the way for the company to invest in the fields again and attempt to recover more oil and gas and drill new wells.
Mr. DeCrane said that Texaco had made the proposal for new investment knowing that Louisiana was under pressure to attract new money to develop its mature oil and gas fields.
Without a settlement, he said, it was unlikely that Texaco would have put more money into the fields, which have been producing for about 30 years. "We wanted something that was good for both of us," Mr. DeCrane said.
Richard Ieyoub, the Attorney General for Louisiana, which has lost more than 60,000 energy-related jobs in the last decade, said that the litigation had inhibited Texaco from investing more into many leased fields and from exploring undeveloped fields.
He said that the state had been prepared to take away the leases from Texaco, making it too risky for the oil company to invest.
"There's been acreage in our state that has been laying around for 50 years," Mr. Ieyoub said, referring to Louisiana's undeveloped tracts. "We felt that through the settlement there will now have to be aggressive development of these leases."
Mr. DeCrane said that "the prospects in the new fields are very good."
 
Attempt to Reverse Trend
 Texaco, as are most leading oil companies, has been cutting back on the development of domestic fields and shifting money for exploration overseas. Many areas of the United States have seen a decline in jobs and investment as a result and have been seeking ways to reverse the trend of overseas investment.
Mr. Scott said that much of the investment would benefit the state's Houma-Thibeaux region, which has lost about 27 percent of its jobs since the early 1980's.
As part of the settlement, Texaco also agreed to subcontract some work to companies in the state.
 Mr. Scott said that Texaco had also committed to using advanced technology in some drilling and recovery methods, which would help the state's energy industry remain competitive.

HEADLINE: IMPROVED TRAINING SOUGHT FOR PILOTS

BYLINE: By CARL H. LAVIN 

 BODY:
The Federal Aviation Administrator said yesterday that his agency wanted to increase safety training and standards for commuter airline pilots to the levels required of pilots for major airlines.
The Administrator, David R. Hinson, told the House aviation subcommittee that his agency was preparing rules requiring the single higher standard for all airline pilots. 
 "The commuter safety record has been improving," Mr. Hinson said, but he cited a December crash in Hibbing, Minn., which killed 18 people, and other fatal accidents as evidence that more needs to be done.
The number of hours flown by commuter planes grew to 2.4 million in 1993 from 1.3 million in 1978. In the same period, the accident rate dropped to .72 per 100,000 hours from 4.69 per 100,000 hours. But Government statistics show that commuter planes are still five times more likely to have an accident than larger airliners.
 
Every Six Months
 Under current rules, pilots who fly airliners with more than 30 seats must undergo rigorous training every six months. Typically, each pilot spends two or three days using computerized flight simulators to practice responding to a wide range of emergencies.
Pilots of smaller planes need to pass only a check ride every six months, an aviation official said. The proposed rule would require the same specified instruction periods as are now required for pilots of larger planes.
"It will make the most significant improvement in commuter airline safety that we can make by just changing regulations," Anthony J. Broderick, associate administrator of the F.A.A., said in a telephone interview.
After the agency studies projected costs, publishes the proposed rule, accepts comments, and adopts any modifications, the rule should go into effect in about 18 months, Mr. Broderick said.
 
Training in Teamwork
 New rules would also require all pilots, at commuter airlines as well as major airlines, to undergo training devoted to helping pilots work together in the cockpit, Mr. Broderick said. Many of the major airlines already emphasize teamwork in training, but the proposed rule would be the first to require this.
Several smaller airlines, including Atlantic Southeast and American Eagle, said they already trained all their pilots to the higher standards. And the president of the trade group of commuter airlines, Walter Coleman of the Regional Airline Association, who also testified before the Congressional panel, defended the safety of his group's airlines.
Many commuter airline officials said they did not oppose rules aimed at increasing pilot safety. "Should we continue our efforts to make them safer?" Mr. Coleman said. "The answer is yes."
Other airline officials said that the proposal would help make the flying public feel more comfortable flying in small planes. And they said the major cost would be in the purchase of the flight simulators, which can cost $10 million apiece.
 
Fare Increases Called Likely
 Still, Gary Risley, vice president of Mesa Airlines, which carried 4 million passengers last year, said he was surprised at yesterday's announcement. He also said any new costs would be passed on in fare increases.
"We knew the F.A.A. was considering it, but we are really taken aback," he said. "It will obviously raise the cost of training for pilots. This industry is so safety conscious, but you have to deal with the perception as much as the realities. And the perception is that it's unsafe. That's what is happening here.
"The length the F.A.A. has gone to is not necessary for safety. We are highly conscious as a company and as an industry. Besides the fact you are dealing with human lives, it is not good business to be unsafe. You do the best you can to maintain high safety standards and you do it as economically as you can. The cost will of course be translated to the passenger."
 
Crash in Minnesota
 Mr. Hinson and Mr. Broderick each referred to the crash Dec. 1 near Hibbing of a Northwest Airlink flight that killed everyone on board.
The Jetstream 31, a 19-seat plane, was operated by Express II Airlines under the Northwest name.
The plane did not have any mechanical problems and should have been able to pull out of a steep descent before crashing, Carl Vogt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said, according to an Associated Press report.
The plane's captain was angry with the airline and sometimes flew the plane roughly to jostle passengers or bullied his co-pilots, according to a preliminary report released by the safety board last week that was based on interviews with others at the airline.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Broadens Attack on Mismanagement and Waste

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Offering his Republican vision of leaner city government, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday delivered his first State of the City address, vowing a vigorous assault on bureaucracy, strong support of the police and a supply-side view of stimulating the city's economy.
In a speech in the City Council chamber of City Hall, Mr. Giuliani also made his most forceful attack yet on the bureaucracy of the city's educational system and pledged to appoint a fiscal monitor for education to audit the flow of money through the school system. 
 His remarks continued a volatile series of exchanges with Schools Chancellor Ramon Cortines over the budget and the extensive personnel cuts that the Mayor has proposed for the schools' administrative staff. Although the two have met at least twice in the last week to discuss the budget cuts, their public statements indicate a sharp disagreement over how far the cuts should go.
Another theme of Mr. Giuliani's speech was fighting crime. The Mayor said that next week he would set up the city's second "crime-free" zone around a school, this at a site in Queens that he did not identify. He also said he would put into effect new property forfeiture procedures aimed at drug dealers.
Many of the themes in the 58-minute address had been sounded previously. But yesterday's speech, before members of the predominantly Democratic City Council and a Democratic Public Advocate and Comptroller, was the strongest articulation of Mr. Giuliani's philosophy of government.
 
Still Seeking School Cuts
 At times, Mr. Giuliani's tone was apocalyptic. When discussing what he called the high level of crime, governmental waste and mismanagement, he said, "This state of the city has to end, because if it doesn't end, it will end our city as we have known it."
The speech covered a number of topics, from his need to reach out to Democratic legislators to his desire to protect programs aimed at the poor. But much of the Mayor's speech was devoted to the city schools, and he became particularly expressive and forceful when discussing that topic.
He repeated his call for eliminating 2,500 administrative positions from the Board of Education. "It is time for major surgery, to remove the blockage preventing our tax dollars from reaching our children," Mr. Giuliani said. Of the Board of Education's administrative staff, he said, "If it needs more cuts -- and it probably will -- we'll make them."
 
School Cuts at Issue
 Although the city school system depends on city funds, it is under the control of the Board of Education.
A reduction in the number of school administrators has been a point of contention between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Cortines. At a news conference earlier in the day, Mr. Giuliani was asked if tension had risen between them. "I can't really tell," the Mayor told reporters. "He says one thing to you and something different to me."
Robert H. Terte, a spokesman for the Chancellor, said that Mr. Cortines had targeted 1,000 positions to be cut. "He has indicated that as he finds additional positions to be eliminated he will. But he has also indicated it would be irresponsible to commit to some hypothetical number without first evaluating the impact those reductions would have on what is, in effect, an $8 billion business."
Mr. Giuliani talked of the disillusionment of some New Yorkers in Queens and other parts of the city with the municipal government. He added that he had asked Edward N. Costikyan, a seasoned Democrat and lawyer who served on Mr. Giuliani's transition committee, to work with borough presidents "to devise ways to share power and bring it closer to the people."
 
Seeking Council Backing
 The Mayor's State of the City address -- postponed by one day because of Tuesday's snowfall -- came one week after he unveiled his budget plan for the next fiscal year, including his strategy for closing a $2.3 billion shortfall.
In yesterday's speech, he referred to many of those plans and sought once again to enlist the support of members of the City Council. Indeed, he took great pains to portray himself as deeply committed to bipartisan government. "We haven't given in to partisan politics," he said. "I've appointed more members of the so-called opposition party than any mayor in history."
He also asked Democratic legislators for cooperation on a number of fronts, most notably in seeking more state funds for New York City's Medicaid costs from the state Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Mr. Giuliani, who in his first days faced conflicts between the police and worshipers at a mosque in Harlem and over the police shooting of a black Brooklyn teen-ager, reiterated his strong support of the police in his speech. "My standard is support for the police unless the evidence demonstrated that the police acted illegally or improperly," Mr. Giuliani said. "I believe it's the way to create a civilized society and respect for the law."
But he said that if there is evidence of illegal or improper behavior, "we must act strongly," adding that police officers "must be held to the highest standards."
Mr. Giuliani's speech drew varied reactions. Alan G. Hevesi, the city's Comptroller, said he considered it "very thoughtful, sober, serious, a good speech."
Mark J. Green, the Public Advocate, said he agreed that the city needed to shrink government, but said, "I fundamentally disagree with his economic premise that all job losses in this city in the last five years have been due to the bloated bureaucracy."
Stanley Hill, president of District 37, the city's largest municipal union, criticized Mr. Giuliani, saying, "He didn't talk about the workers and didn't give any credit to the workers and the role they have played."
Also yesterday, the Mayor appointed a new Commissioner for the city's Department of Buildings. His first choice, Frank A. Luzi, resigned two days ago amid questions about state and Federal investigations into companies in which he was involved.
The new commissioner, Joel A. Miele Sr., a member of the Planning Commission who has headed an engineering firm in Queens, had been a contender for the position Mr. Luzi ultimately received.

HEADLINE: Administration to Delay Proposals to Aid Labor

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
After promising to come up by mid-year with proposals to deal with some of the nation's thorniest labor issues -- including whether to strengthen unions, and how to regulate workers' councils -- the Clinton Administration has decided to wait until November, probably after the Congressional election.
The postponement is a setback for labor leaders who had hoped that the Administration would move forcefully to reverse labor's weakening position at the bargaining table. Seeking early action on this front, the President appointed a blue-ribbon commission last May to make policy recommendations in one year. 
 The commission sought an extension, arguing that its recommendations would be too contentious unless it had more time to sell its ideas. And the Administration agreed to the postponement last weekend, even though it has been deferring action on labor issues until the report is filed.

 Justifying the delay, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in an interview: "Worker-management relations today are very tense, given all the corporate downsizings, the increased litigation in the workplace, the technological changes and the enormous pressures on companies to cut costs."
The commission is headed by John T. Dunlop, a Harvard economist who was Secretary of Labor in the Ford Administration. Most of the nine other members are former labor secretaries or academicians.
Among the proposals the commission is considering are steps that would make forming a union easier or would force binding arbitration on management in labor disputes. To make such recommendations easier for corporate America to accept, the commission will issue only "findings of fact" in May.
 
Facts Before Solutions
 "The important thing is to draw a line between the process of finding facts and the process of what to do about them," Mr. Dunlop said. "I want people to be able to say these facts are right or wrong or they need to be amended, and then after the nation has confronted the facts, we can come up with solutions."
One finding of fact already decided upon, commission members say, concerns the fate of workers engaged in trying to organize a union. American companies over the last decade have discharged many more people for trying to organize unions than they did in the 1950's.
If this finding survives challenges from business, then the commission in November might propose policies to protect union organizing by making it easier and faster. One way to do this -- a method favored by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. -- would be to allow a union to represent a company's workers, if a majority signed membership cards. Labor law currently requires that workers go through the much longer and more complicated process of voting in a special election to be represented by a union.
 
Workers Councils on Agenda
 The commission will also consider the status of the workers councils that have appeared at many companies. These councils increasingly give workers control over their daily routines, and management has endorsed them as an effective way to improve efficiency. But some workers and some unions have charged that the councils are really management controlled, in violation of existing labor law.
Surprisingly, organized labor, which has the most to gain from the commission's proposals, agreed to the six-month postponement of the commission's report. "If it issued policy recommendations along with its findings of fact in May, that would be very difficult for Congress to swallow," said John Zalusky, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s specialist in collective bargaining. "In the current atmosphere, we need a public debate before someone comes out with a policy."
The National Association of Manufacturers, whose members employ most of the nation's unionized, private-sector workers, also endorsed the postponement. "The commission is not likely to come up with any finding in fact that suggests that sweeping labor law reform will be necessary," said Jerry Jasinowski, the association's president. "These findings are likely to focus on egregious cases, not widespread problems."

HEADLINE: Yale Law Dean Is Nominated To 2d Circuit Appeals Court

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Reaching out to his alma mater for a renowned legal scholar, President Clinton today nominated Guido Calabresi, dean of the Yale Law School, to be a Federal judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, a showcase court that hears cases from New York, Connecticut and Vermont and produces some of the country's most important decisions.
Mr. Clinton's choice had been rumored for several months, and both of Connecticut's Democratic United States Senators, Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph I. Lieberman, issued statements enthusiastically supporting it tonight. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Calabresi would replace Judge Thomas Meskill, who took senior status on the court, which is based in New York, last year. 
 Born in Milan in 1932, Mr. Calabresi fled Fascist Italy with his family at the age of 6 and came to New Haven. He was first in his undergraduate class at Yale, won a Rhodes scholarship, then was first in his class at Yale Law School and became the youngest full professor in its history at age 29. He has been dean of the school, often considered the most prestigious in the nation, since 1985.
 
'I'm Greatly Honored'
 While Mr. Clinton, a 1973 Yale law graduate, never took a class with Professor Calabresi, they have long been members of a mutual admiration society, along with the President's wife and classmate, Hillary. Dean Calabresi was an early backer of Mr. Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign.
"I'm greatly honored by this nomination," Dean Calabresi said in a statement issued in New Haven. "My family fled Fascism in Italy nearly 55 years ago. The United States of America took us in and gave us extraordinary opportunities. I am immensely grateful for that. If confirmed, I will do my best to maintain the laws that have made this country a haven and a beacon."
Senators Dodd and Lieberman had strongly backed another Yale-educated jurist, Jose Cabranes, chief of the Federal District Court in Connecticut, for the vacancy. Mr. Cabranes' appointment was also urged by Hispanic rights groups, but there is a strict state-by-state quota system on the 13-member court, so it seemed unlikely that two judges could be appointed from Connecticut at once.
Aides to both senators said tonight that their understanding from the White House was that Mr. Calabresi's nomination had not precluded Judge Cabranes's and that his possible nomination was still under review, perhaps as a candidate from New York, where he grew up in the Bronx.
Mr. Calabresi's 1970 book, "The Costs of Accidents: A Legal and Economic Analysis," was a seminal study in the modern law of torts. He is the author of three other books and scores of articles and is one of the most colorful, popular figures at Yale.
"He is one of the most thoughtful, innovative law professors of his generation," said Paul Brest, dean of the Stanford University Law School. He called the nomination "a brilliant appointment."

HEADLINE: Bar to Anti-Gay Laws Is Upheld

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SALEM, Ore., Feb. 9

 BODY:
A state judge has upheld an Oregon law that voids local measures barring homosexual rights ordinances.
"The issue of homosexual rights is such a substantive social issue that the Legislature may pre-empt" local governments, said the judge, Albin Nor blad of Marion County Circuit Court. 
 Five counties and 11 cities around the state have prohibited the protection of homosexuals from discrimination in hiring and elsewhere. In nearly every case, local courts have overturned the measures or officials have refused to enforce them because of the state law, which was passed last July.
In his decision, Judge Norblad cited a 1978 Oregon Supreme Court ruling that allows state lawmakers to take precedence in decisions on issues that have a "statewide substantive, social or economic or other regulatory objective."
 
Appeal Is Planned
 The judge's ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by the Oregon Citizens Alliance, a group that sponsored the local anti-homosexual initiatives. The alliance said the state law infringed upon the citizens' right under the Oregon Constitution to initiate laws.
Lon Mabon, the organization's chairman, said he would appeal Judge Nor blad's ruling to the state Court of Appeals.
The alliance's lawsuit is so far the only direct challenge to the state law, and the ruling on Tuesday takes precedence over any local court rulings, said Charles Hinkle, a lawyer who argued for the state law on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon.
"Nobody's rights should be put up for a popular vote," said Julie Davis, executive director of Support Our Communities, a group that supports the state law. "I think the judge's ruling is a reiteration of that point,"
Judge Norblad's ruling does not prevent continuing votes on local anti-homosexual measures, including ones in Marion County and Turner, a town of about 1,250 five miles south of Salem.

HEADLINE: Weicker Urges an End to Personal Property Tax

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 9

 BODY:
In his final State of the State message, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. proposed a plan today to phase out the widely disliked local tax on motor vehicles and business equipment, including computers, known as the personal property tax.
Connecticut is one of 25 states with such a tax, and Mr. Weicker's budget office said its elimination during the next 10 years would eventually save businesses and individuals more than $700 million a year. 
 The tax assessed on a private car can vary widely, depending on the value of a vehicle and its location. A car valued at $8,000, for example, is taxed $542 in Bridgeport, with its high tax rate, but only $108 in much wealthier Darien.
The General Assembly is sure to question the finances of Mr. Weicker's plan, which relies on projected state surpluses to reimburse towns and cities for their lost tax revenue. But revision of the property tax system has the support of both business groups and financially pressed cities, which have made it a priority in the legislative session that opened today.
In a state with a property-tax burden surpassed only by New Hampshire, New Jersey and Alaska, businesses complain that the tax is one more reason to leave Connecticut, while residents protest that the tax falls heaviest on those least able to afford it: homeowners in poor cities or on fixed incomes.
"The foremost issue should be reforming the property-tax system," the House Speaker, Thomas D. Ritter, a Democrat from Hartford, said as he opened the House of Representatives with a state of the state message of his own. "The system is antiquated, regressive and clearly inadequate for our times."
The personal property tax is a potent symbol of what many critics say is wrong with the entire property tax system, even though most of the revenue raised by towns and cities is through property taxes on houses, office buildings and other real estate.
For drivers, the tax on identical vehicles can swing wildly from town to town, based on the communities' relative wealth. For businesses, "It's a tax that employers in states like New York and Massachusetts don't pay at all," said Joseph F. Brennan, a vice president of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
Mr. Weicker, who won election in 1990 under the banner of "A Connecticut Party" but who is not seeking a second term, devoted much of his speech to defending his fiscal strategy during the state's recession, when he imposed a personal income tax to balance the state budget, while cutting business taxes to make Connecticut more competitive and aiding businesses with investments or loans to save or create jobs.
That strategy, he said, had succeeded in balancing the state's budget, and now allowed the General Assembly, in his final year as Governor, to begin cutting property taxes while also spending more to fight crime in the cities and to rescue the children endangered by violence and poverty.
"Mistakes were made in the 80's," he said. "We've paid the price -- all of us in Connecticut, a dollar price -- and recovery is under way. Now let's get on with life and make sure recovery works for everybody."
In many ways, the initiatives that Mr. Weicker stressed today were personal, returning to issues and convictions that have occupied him throughout his term, from the need to reduce the tax burden on businesses to the plight of children in Connecticut's poor cities.
Few of those proposals greatly affected the $9.09 billion budget itself, which was approved by the legislature last year under a new state law mandating two-year budgets. Working within a state law that caps the annual increase in spending, Mr. Weicker looked for ways to make an impact with a few million dollars here and there.
For $24.3 million in state spending, plus $16 million in bond funds, for example, the Governor's cabinet put together a youth initiative that would strengthen neighborhoods by keeping school buildings open before and after class, expand youth and family centers, improve health services for children, and create more job and college opportunities for children from poor families.
"I confess to you, I've never been so excited about anything as long as I've been Governor," Mr. Weicker said, in proposing a trust fund that would guarantee tuition and fees at a state college for any poor child who gained admission. The plan would take effect in five years, starting with children in seventh grade this year.
Strongly supporting a bill to toughen gun licensing and stiffen penalties for crimes involving guns, Mr. Weicker vowed to push for "a total constitutional ban on all concealed weapons" if the bill was weakened.
"There is no constitutional guarantee to kill in America," he said. "There is no constitutional guarantee to kill in Connecticut."
He also praised the Commission on Educational Excellence for Connecticut, a panel of business people, educators and others who recently submitted a plan for remaking public education in the state.
But as a third-party Governor in his last year, constrained by budget limits, Mr. Weicker could do little today to support his enthusiasms. His proposal to eliminate the personal property tax projects that goal nine years beyond his term of office. Despite his praise for the education commission, his budget included only a few of the panel's recommendations for $200 million in new spending.
Even the college trust fund would be started with only $7 million from the sale of bonds, and its growth would depend on private donations and the willingness of future legislatures to continue contributing.
Senate and House members were spare with their applause during his speech. In an election year with Republicans and Democrats preparing to do battle over every seat in the legislature, Mr. Weicker's speech was seen by some as his opportunity to put his term in perspective before others set to work.
"I thought it was a speech that lacked vision about where Connecticut should be in the 21st century," said the House minority leader, Edward C. Krawiecki Jr., a Republican from Bristol. "It was an attempt to rewrite the history of the state."
The main issue facing Connecticut, he said, was creating jobs to replace those lost in the recession. "That is the primary job for this legislature."
Senator John B. Larson, a Democrat who is the Senate president pro tem and one of seven declared candidates for Governor, has criticized Mr. Weicker's economic development efforts, saying the state's policy of lending money to businesses had made it the Connecticut Money Store without creating more jobs.
"The guy's been in public office for 31 years," Mr. Larson said of the Governor's address. "He was making the case for the last four years. Tomorrow the reality sets in, and the reality is the 200,000 jobs that have been lost here over the last four years."

Rates Slip After 10-Year Note Auction

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rates ended a four-day advance and turned modestly lower on good investor demand at yesterday's 10-year note auction. The small rally helped to ease market concern temporarily about inflation and the possibility of another jump in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
The price of the 30-year bond was up 14/32 , to 9728/32 , as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.41 percent, from 6.44 percent on Tuesday. 
 One sign that the 10-year note auction went well, according to Robert T. Falconer, a senior vice president at Aubrey G. Langston & Company, was that new notes rose in price in the afternoon on good investor demand.
The average yield at auction for the 10-year note was 5.92 percent, in line with market expectations. In the when-issued market late in the afternoon, the yield had fallen to 5.88 percent The average yield at the auction was the highest average yield since the note sale last May, when the average was 5.96 percent. A year ago, the average yield was 6.33 percent.
 
Awaiting Producer Price Figures
 Mr. Falconer said inflation and its impact on interest rates still concern traders and investors because the Government auction is ahead of the release tomorrow of the January producer-price data, a measure of prices at the producer level that will give the latest look at inflationary pressures.
"The data on Friday could give us a good clue as to whether the Government's quarterly sale was an ultimate success," Mr. Falconer said. If the increase in producer prices is small than expected,dealers would be able to sell the large amounts of Government securities they bought at the auction this week more easily. But if the number is bad, dealers could find themselves holding more issues than they would like, perhaps even forced to cut the price to raise the yield to a level more attractive to buyers.
Mr. Falconer said that one problem for analysts is that for the last several years, inflation data for the first few months of a year turned out to be distorted and left the impression that prices were rising at a much faster pace then they really were.
"Besides, quarterly borrowings are always difficult for the market," he added. "You have an avalanche of supply and a delicate balance of demand. And now we have a bond auction twice a year that generates a tremendous mountain of supply which suddenly enters the market and traders have to bid on it."
The market's concern is that a gain of four-tenths of 1 percent or more in the core Producer Price Index could force the Fed into another tightening that would push short-term interest rates higher. Economists surveyed by Reuters expect a rise of four- tenths of 1 percent in the overall Producer Price Index for January and a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in the core rate, which excludes food and energy prices.
Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist at CS First Boston, doubted the Fed would act after the release of the producer-price figures, but did not rule out another quarter-point rise in short rates following the release of January's Consumer Price Index next week.
Bond traders got some reassurance yesterday that inflation was not yet a problem, as oil prices fell. The price of crude oil for March delivery slid 61 cents, to $14.60 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 
30-Year Auction Today
 Today the market will contend with the final part of the Government debt offering when the Treasury sells 30-year bonds. In when-issued trading, the bond was being offered at a price to yield 6.42 percent, down from 6.45 percent on Tuesday.
Treasury bill rates are mixed, with a three-month bill rate unchanged at 3.23 percent and a six-month bill down three basis points, to 3.37 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The following are the results of yesterday's 10-year Treasury note auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Average Price . . . 99.664
Average Yield . . . 5.92%

HEADLINE: The Piggy Bank in the Real World

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Kids and cash have always constituted one of the more liquid economies. Children, after all, can get and spend with the best of them.
"I have something, then I have nothing," said Rasheda Edness, a 17-year-old Bedford-Stuyvesant victim of the consumer culture. "Except when I've got something stupid. I had $20 the other day. Then I had a $20 hat." 
 Reform, economic or otherwise, isn't a concept adolescents are eager to embrace. But in central Brooklyn, at the nexus of neighborhoods that include Bedford-Stuyvesant, Crown Heights and Prospect Heights, there is a movement to develop fiscal responsibility. The Central Brooklyn Youth Credit Union, one of 11 such projects awarded grants by the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, is coming into being.
The youth credit unions, including ones in Harlem and Hempstead, L.I., received an average of $15,000 in start-up funds early in 1993. The general goals are to infuse low-income minority children with concepts of ownership and to equip them with skills for jobs in the financial services industry. The new credit unions are modeled after the D. E. Wells Youth Credit Union in Springfield, Mass., which was formed in 1988 and has 1,000 members and $30,000 in assets.
 
About Feeling in Charge
 "The formation of these youth credit unions is a real example of a national effort to empower youth," said Carol Zippert, a board member for the national federation. "It's a very real, very significant way of allowing kids to feel in charge -- of their lives and of their communities."
The great equation that children from Brooklyn to Demopolis, Ala., will be asked to compute, according to organizers, is this: Money equals power equals democracy.
"I thought you had to be old to know how to manage money," said Akasa-Ra, an 11-year-old from Bedford-Stuyvesant who plans to be a charter member of the Brooklyn operation. "I'd get it and go to the store and spend it. I wasn't prepared for how to keep it, how to control it. Money, I know now, is very political."
And all politics is local, an axiom the adult organizers of the project have made explicit to the children. The youth credit union in Brooklyn, coordinated by the Central Brooklyn Partnership, a coalition of neighborhood development organizations and churches, will draw its membership from the area's children. Recruited from schools and church groups, the children, ages 8 to 18, will run it. They will deposit in it. They will own it.
"It's about a lot more than business," said Angela Riley, an officer with the partnership and an adviser to the youth credit union. "It's about what leadership means. It's about what it means to build an institution."
 
Workshop on Money
 The construction began in earnest last month, when about two dozen Brooklyn bankers of the future marched through freezing temperatures on a Saturday to an orientation workshop at Restoration Plaza in Bedford-Stuyvesant. A workshop exercise -- Reap and Loss: The Way Money Goes -- was played out.
The way money goes in neighborhoods like theirs isn't much of a mystery to the children. A lot goes out. Not much stays. Bank branches have closed with regularity over the last decade. The lines outside check-cashing establishments, whose numbers are double those of bank branches in the neighborhoods, seem to grow longer by the day. Many store owners sell, but don't live, in the neighborhood. According to a study commissioned last year by the Central Brooklyn Credit Union, for every dollar deposited in local banks, less than one penny is returned to their community in loans or other reinvestments.
"I see Brooklyn, and I see things that need to be changed," said Jason O'Connor, a 13-year-old who would like to be chairman of the credit union. "What are banks? Banks to me are a gang of people who want money and make money. We want to be more than that for kids. We want a chance to have power."
That chance was made real in Springfield by the D. E. Wells Youth Credit Union. There is an 11-member board, the credit union offers savings accounts and loans, and accepts deposits as modest as 5 cents. Graduates of the youth credit union -- 75 percent of whom have gone on to college, according to its executive director -- can invest in the adult credit union. And there has not been a single incident of delinquency with any of the 100 loans approved by the youngsters.
 
Need to Trust Adults
 "The difficult sell to the kids when we promoted the idea of the credit union was to get them to trust adults," said Carol Aranjo, the executive director of the D.E. Wells credit union. "We told the children that the institution would be theirs alone to own and run, and what I hear most from them now is how surprised they are that we kept our word."
Leone Baum is busy trying to keep her word to the children of Hempstead, where she expects to have the credit union, with about 300 members, in place later this year.
"We have children as young as 3 with their passbooks," said Ms. Baum. "They like to see the numbers. They especially like to see the numbers going up."
None of the children, though, seem to get too dizzy. One young girl in Springfield every week empties her tiny purse on the counter of the teller window, stares at her mother sternly enough to gain a moment of privacy and then always pulls back a handful of the coins. A 7-year-old in Hempstead spoke soberly during an orientation of debt-to-income ratios and how loans might be made for the purpose of buying a present for a mother -- but not a girlfriend -- one relationship evidently considered more stable than the other.
"They are not great lenders," agreed Ms. Aranjo. "I'd say 80 percent of the time the loan officers talk the members out of the loans. And they are not beyond laughing you out of the room. It happened to one 10-year-old who wanted to borrow $500 for a stereo. It took him a while to recover from the experience."
 
Recruiting in Churches
 Ms. Riley and others involved in the Brooklyn venture have reached out to church groups and schools in search of potential members and officers. She also enlisted as an adviser Errol Louis, the treasurer of the Central Brooklyn Credit Union, which started last winter and has more than 600 members and assets of $1.5 million. It will, with a sense of irony as well as opportunism, move its offices to the Chemical Bank branch nearby on Fulton Street upon the branch's closing this spring. The youth credit union will have its offices, and perhaps its miniature teller windows, at the new site.
"Consumption is soaked into these kids," said Mr. Louis. "I made a presentation to a group of them, and we talked about finances. They were a bit bewildered, but when I mentioned credit cards, they all wanted to talk.
"But there are also people in this community with cash and roots and a pathological fear of debt. There are parents who have brought their children into the main credit union and brought them right to the windows to join."
Mr. Louis said the "future officers" for his business could come from the ranks of the youth credit union. The first small Brooklyn platoon sat in a circle at the recent orientation, introducing one another to their small dreams. There was an 11-year-old point guard with ideas about directing deposits as well as fast breaks, a 17-year-old trying to figure out how to save for a driver's education course, a 13-year-old who confessed her slightly embarrassing but stubbornly enduring love for shopping.
"If other kids out there don't care, they should," Jason O'Connor said of the world of personal and community finances and the link between the two. "And if they don't get it, they will some day."

HEADLINE: Despite Violence, Colombia Surges

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia

 BODY:
Protected by high tariff walls as steep as its mountainous terrain, and inward-looking in its leadership, Colombia was once described by a former Colombian president as "the American Tibet."
But since 1990, like so much of Latin America, free-market policies and a lowering of trade barriers have produced solid growth, surging imports and swelling foreign investment. Today, business people predict that Colombia in the mid-1990's will increasingly look like the Southeast Asian "tigers" of Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. 
 "We are very positive on Colombia; we think they are making major strides to open the economy and to become world players," said Michael Tracy, president of Drummond Ltd., an Alabama coal company that plans to invest $50 million this year to build a private port to develop a coal mine near Colombia's Caribbean coast.
The coal project is part of an explosion in foreign investment in Colombia outside of its rich oil reserves, which have long attracted foreigners. From 1990 through last year, investment more than doubled to $475 million. This year, foreign investment is expected to double to $1 billion.
In the oil sector, foreign companies plan to also double investment rates, spending $5.5 billion through the end of the decade to develop Cusiana, the largest field discovered in the Western Hemisphere since Prudhoe Bay in Alaska.
Still, the nation's well-publicized violence remains a significant drawback to investment. Although drug terrorism appears to have abated after the death in December of Pablo Escobar, guerrilla violence is expected to be part of the landscape for many more years. Colombia's largely rural-based guerrillas started fighting to topple the Government in the early 1960's.
"The violence is costing us several growth points," Rudolf Hommes, Colombia's Finance Minister, wrote in January in Carta Financiera, a business magazine. Without the killings and kidnappings by guerrillas and drug traffickers, foreign investment in Colombia would be 25 percent higher, he estimated.
Colombia's new economic policies, known as the apertura, or opening, is the work of Colombia's President, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo. A technocrat who is short on charisma, Mr. Gaviria has an understanding of business that comes from his training as an economist.
Until Mr. Gaviria turned their world upside down, Colombian manufacturers had produced for years in a genteel environment protected by tariffs averaging 40 percent. Then, in 1990 the President started to cut them to their current level -- 11 percent.
In an audible rush, imports swept in the newly opened door.
In 1992, imports of American goods jumped 68 percent, to $3.3 billion, making Colombia the fastest-growing market worldwide for United States goods. According to President Gaviria, this import surge created 45,000 new jobs in the United States.
Over all, Colombia's imports nearly doubled in three years, from $7 billion in 1991 to $13 billion in 1993. Last year, for example, car sales doubled nationwide. Fueling imports, Colombia's currency, the peso, strengthened by 14 percent against the dollar last year.
Now, as Colombia moves decisively from state companies and protectionism, American companies are seizing opportunities. So far this decade, 70 percent of all new United States foreign investment has gone to Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the World Bank.
 
Selling Telephone Concessions
 Last month, Colombia got the attention of major American telecommunications companies. Chipping away at a state telephone monopoly, the Government sold three cellular telephone concessions to private investors for $624 million. The two largest concessions, for the Bogota region and for the Caribbean coast, are to be planned and operated by two American minority shareholders, McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. and LCC Inc. Calculating that there is an enormous repressed demand for cellular service in this capital city of seven million people, the winning consortium, Celumovil S.A., paid $23 per inhabitant for the 10-year concession, believed to be a world record.
This month, three more concessions are expected to be sold for about $600 million. In this round, the BellSouth Corporation is expected to have a chance as a minority partner in a consortium offering alternative service to Bogota.
In the banking sector last month, the Government auctioned off the nation's second-largest bank to private investors for $500 million.
"The change in Colombia is almost miraculous," said an American banker who has lived and worked here for more than 30 years. "Only 15 years ago they were 'Colombianizing' the banks. Today, they are raffling off the second-largest bank in Colombia, one called Banco de Colombia."
Abandoning vestiges of foreign exchange controls adopted in the 1960's, Colombia adapted in late January a policy of a free-floating exchange rate.
Opening another sector to foreign investment, Colombia plans this year to call for international bids on 20 highway repair projects, worth an estimated $1.5 billion. Construction companies are to be repaid through tolls.
 
Investments by Americans
 In Colombia's three stock markets, foreign mutual funds, largely American, made initial forays last year, quadrupling their holdings to $236 million by the end of the year. Trading volumes on the three exchanges surged 69 percent in 1993, hitting $13.2 billion.
Last year, the country recorded 5 percent growth, slightly above a 20-year average of 4.4 percent. Inflation maintained a four-year decline, hitting 23 percent, half the level of neighboring Venezuela. Flush with $8 billion in reserves, Colombia is trimming its foreign debt. Last year, Colombia prepaid $450 million in public sector foreign debt, reducing the debt to its current level of $13.8 billion.
Strong reserves helped Colombia to weather a wave of imports.
In Latin America, Colombia is rivaled only by Chile in its determination to negotiate free trade pacts. After signing free trade pacts with virtually all the Andean nations in the early 1990's, Colombia now plans to sign pacts this year with the common markets of Central America and the Caribbean and to enter into a three-way pact with Mexico and Venezuela.
"Virtually all our products can enter duty free into a world market of 800 million people," said Juan Manuel Tafurt-Rojas, an official with Coinvertir, a new public-private enterprise devoted to promoting foreign investment in Colombia.
 
Free Trade With U.S.
 Indeed, although Colombia eagerly wants to join the United States in an expanded version of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Colombia already enjoys many of the benefits. Under trade promotion agreements signed during the height of the war against cocaine in the early 1990's, most Colombian products enter the United States and Europe duty free.
A free trade pact with Venezuela proved to be wildly successful. From $500 million in 1991, trade between the countries more than tripled, hitting $1.8 billion in 1993. Reflecting strengthening business ties, the number of weekly flights between Bogota and Caracas increased in the last four years from 4 to 26. Today, Venezuela ranks second to the United States as Colombia's largest trading partner and foreign investor.
Although Colombia's macroeconomic indicators look good, not all boats are rising. The number of people living below the poverty line has increased by about one million since 1990, to include about half of Colombia's population of 33 million people. In 15 years, the gap between average rural and urban incomes doubled.
"Blind people believe that armed uprisings of the poor don't match the happy times in which we live: times of cellular telephones, of newspapers with pink pages just like The Financial Times, of privatizations and of free-trade treaties," Antonio Caballero, one of Colombia's most acerbic left-wing columnists, wrote in a news weekly, Cambio 16 Colombia.
"Our countries are countries of two floors: a penthouse built on a slum," he continued. "Neoliberalism has a simultaneous double effect: filling the penthouse with electronic goodies, including burglar alarms, while making the slum below ever more uninhabitable for the great majorities that live there."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
U.S.-Japanese Talks Sputter, And Dollar Closes Lower

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar eased against the yen yesterday on fear that a long-awaited meeting tomorrow between the American and Japanese leaders could end without a trade agreement.
Reports from both sides of the negotiating table were pessimistic. 
 The dollar tumbled in Tokyo after Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Japan's one-year tax cut would not sufficiently stimulate demand for imports. It took another blow when the Japanese Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, said the trade talks with the United States remained deadlocked.
The dollar's sharp fall aroused talk that the Japanese central bank was buying dollars for yen, or, at the very least, checking currency rates with dealers.
 
Suspicions of U.S. Mischief
 Many dealers believe that United States officials might turn to talking up the yen if other ways to trim Japan's trade surplus fail.
"The market was quite sensitive ahead of the U.S.-Japan summit, reacting to each piece of news related to the framework talks," a German bank dealer in Tokyo said.
The dollar trimmed its losses in New York during the afternoon when an American official repeated that the White House had no plans to try to drive the yen higher if the trade talks with Japan failed. The dollar was quoted at 108.30 yen, down from 108.90 yen on Tuesday, in late New York trading.
"The Administration's comments gave the dollar the boost it needed to get above 108 yen," said Michael McKeever, foreign exchange dealer at Fuji Bank in New York.
Gold prices rose yesterday. Gold for April delivery gained $1.60 to settle at $385.70 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
The dollar drifted against the mark in light profit taking. Persistent rumors that the German central bank was selling dollars for marks weighed on the American currency, dealers said, finishing at 1.7590 marks in New York trading, down from 1.7644 on Tuesday.
In Britain, political pressure on Prime Minister John Major's Conservative Party and the interest-rate cut there Tuesday pushed the pound down to $1.4605 in New York, from $1.4670 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Oil Prices Drop as Traders Signal the End of Winter

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Oil prices dropped sharply yesterday as the market sensed that the cold weather blanketing much of the country might not push up fuel demand for much longer.
Traders were also betting that prices may be heading to new five-year lows as oil supplies remain high. 
 Crude oil for March delivery fell a steep 61 cents to close at $14.60 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was above the five-year low of $13.75 reached in December, but well off the $20-a-barrel price at this time last year.
 
 
'Winter Has Come to an End'
 The price weakness affected March heating oil, which sank 1.17 cents to end at 49.40 cents a gallon. March unleaded gasoline was off 1.32 cents at 43.35 cents a gallon.
"The market is saying that the winter has come to an end," Peter Gignoux, head of the energy trading desk of Smith Barney Shearson in London, said.
Analysts said the lower price stemmed from Tuesday's report by the American Petroleum Institute on the nation's oil inventories.
The trade group said that in the latest week the nation's reserve of distillate -- the refined product from which heating oil is derived -- fell by a smaller-than-expected 4.21 million barrels. That compared with a bigger decline of 8.4 million barrels a week earlier.
Oil prices have been supported recently by rising demand for heating fuel in an extremely cold winter in the Northeast. As recently as last week, oil stood at 10-week high of $16.34.
But oil traders reckoned the cold weather was about to end, which could put prices on a collision course with December's lows. They cited talk of ample supplies of North Sea crude oil.
A survey found that Norway's oil output was close to setting a new record in January despite continued winter storms, reaching 2.48 million barrels a day from 2.43 million in December.
 
 
'Few Buyers'
 "There seems to be a lot of cargoes available and few buyers," Tom Bentz, energy analyst at Quantum Financial Services, said.
Meanwhile, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said yesterday that it would not decide on any production cuts before it meets on March 25, and even then a cut is not certain.
"Traders are looking past winter and to the end of March, and OPEC appears unwilling to reduce output," said Alan Struth, chief economist at Phillips Petroleum in Bartlesville, Okla. "You don't see the Saudis out there saying, 'We need to cut.' "

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Vietnam may be too poor to justify a big business incursion.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IT'S Coke vs. Pepsi and United Airlines vs. Northwest in the post-embargo battle to win the hearts and wallets of the Vietnamese. These and dozens of other American name brands are sure to be welcomed, both because Vietnam is aching to end its psychological isolation and because American businesses are positioned to sell what the country wants most.
But there is a real question of whether Vietnam can grow fast enough to justify an aggressive marketing effort. While David Dollar, an economist at the World Bank, is "cautiously optimistic" that Vietnam will soon break out of the pack of the world's poorest countries, the obstacles are formidable. 
 The most immediate problems are wretched physical infrastructure (trains, planes, telephones, power plants) along with an absence of free market institutions (banking, property rights, contract law). But Adam Fforde, an Australian consultant specializing in the Vietnamese economy, thinks the Government may lose control over budget and credit policies -- a weakness that dogs Russia and is casting a shadow over China's development.
And even if Vietnam has the discipline to complete the transition from socialism, it is far from clear that America will play a significant part in its immediate future. Irwin Robinson, head of the United States-Vietnam Chamber of Commerce in New York City, says that "the President's proclamation ending the embargo is a one-way street:" Unless the Administration also lifts the heavy tariffs on Vietnamese goods, they will be priced out of the American market.
The end of the embargo allows American companies to sell or invest virtually as they please in Vietnam. And that puts Americans in a better position than one might expect in light of the fact that they must play catch-up with established Japanese, Taiwan, French, German and Thai businesses.
For one thing, Mr. Dollar says, Vietnam's greatest needs are in things that America produces well and relatively cheaply: industrial machinery, telecommunications equipment, financial services. For another, Mr. Robinson says, the Vietnamese are eager to offset the regional influence of China and Japan with a strong American presence. Last but not least, the Vietnamese retain great (some would say exaggerated) respect for the technology of their former adversary.
The fly in the trade soup is that Vietnam does not have "most favored nation" status -- the automatic benefit of the generous tariff reductions negotiated by America and its trade partners since World War II. To be eligible, the President must certify that Vietnam permits open emigration, a delicate matter in view of the wish of many liberals to retain the option to deny the same trade status to China on human-rights grounds. But unless Washington bends, Vietnam will surely be tempted to buy from countries that permit easier access for Vietnamese goods.
In any event, Vietnam may not have much to sell to anyone, anytime soon. On the plus side, the country is blessed with an educated labor force, enough arable land and oil to be self-sufficient in food and energy at high levels of consumption and, miracle of miracles, state enterprises that make a profit.
What's more, it embarked on a successful regimen of economic "shock therapy" in 1989, wiping out price controls while clamping down on both budget deficits and bank credit. Inflation was contained, apparently without reducing national income, and exporters weathered the collapse of Soviet trade far better than their counterparts in more heavily industrialized Eastern Europe. "There is a lot of dynamism" in the economy, says John Whalley, a development economist at the University of Western Ontario. "I see a lot of parallels with South Korea in the 1950's," he added.
But it is easy to lose perspective. Income per person is still in the same league as the destitute nations of sub-Saharan Africa. And while the Vietnamese economy has performed magnificently in the last few years, the next few may prove tougher.
Mr. Fforde's primary concern is inflation driven by slippage in fiscal and banking discipline. The tax system, he notes, is primitive and ill equipped to deal with private enterprise. And the Government's revenue problems may soon be worsened by state-owned monopolies' waning power to charge enough prices to cover their bloated costs.
The Pacific Basin Research Institute, a Maryland research group, focuses on the strains on the expenditure side of the budget equation. Personal incomes are already twice as high in Ho Chi Minh City as in Hanoi, and four times as much as in the highlands. If this gap between the capitalist-minded south and the deeply impoverished, largely rural north should widen yet more, the Government may feel obliged to compensate the losers with inflationary loans or subsidies.
It is hard to find an analyst who is bearish on the long-term prospects for Vietnam's growth, or pessimistic about America's long-term chances of forging links of mutual economic interest. The operative question, though, is how long is long?

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Yankees Strengthen Rotation With Mulholland

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
After months of inactivity and frustration in their quest for another quality starting pitcher, the Yankees finally erased some of the lingering doubts about their rotation yesterday by acquiring Terry Mulholland from Philadelphia for reliever Bobby Munoz and two Class AA players.
Excluding the economics, it was a splendid deal for the Yankees because they made their rotation much more formidable by adding the left-handed Mulholland and because they did not sacrifice their prized Class AAA pitching prospects. 
 Although the Phillies had initially asked for Sterling Hitchcock, Mark Hutton or Bob Wickman with Munoz, the Yankees would not relinquish them and instead surrendered left-hander Ryan Karp and second baseman Kevin Jordan. Besides Mulholland, the Yankees also got a player to be specified later.
 
Packed With Potential
 Injecting Mulholland into a starting group that already includes left-handers Jimmy Key and Jim Abbott and right-hander Melido Perez gives the Yankees four pitchers with the potential to win at least 15 games each.
The deal also sets up a tussle for the fifth spot in the rotation between Scott Kamieniecki, Hutton, Hitchcock, Bob Ojeda and Sam Militello. And most important, the trade elevates the Yankees closer to Toronto in the American League East.
"The way I look at it, it improves us," said General Manager Gene Michael. "If you improved yourself, you closed the gap."
Now that the Yankees have obtained Mulholland, Michael might be wise to consider signing him to a multiyear contract. Mulholland, who turns 31 next month and earned $2.65 million last season, has an arbitration hearing scheduled for Feb. 18 in which he is seeking $4.05 million for 1994.
Now that the Yankees have assumed Philadelphia's counteroffer of $3.35 million, they must either sign Mulholland before then or argue against their newest player in arbitration.
"I'm assuming we can probably get a deal worked out," said Joe Bick, Mulholland's agent, who asked for a three-year deal with a no-trade clause from Philadelphia and was rebuffed because the Phillies want to trim their payroll. "I don't think Terry wants to be losing an arbitration case as he goes into a new situation and I don't think the Yankees want to lose one either."
Regarding a long-term contract, Bick was not as confident.
"If the Yankees are interested in talking about more than one year," Bick said, "we'll listen."
Michael, who obviously wants Mulholland for more than one year, was unsure about future negotiations.
"When you trade for Terry Mulholland, you don't know the condition of his thinking," Michael said. "You don't know if he's going to play one year or sign a three-year contract."
Even Mulholland said he does not know.
"Being as this is my first three hours with the Yankees, it's hard to say I'm looking toward finishing my playing career as a Yankee," he said yesterday.
Mulholland, who reached the majors with the San Francisco Giants in 1986 and has a 57-58 career record that includes a no-hitter against the Giants for Philadelphia in 1990, is a pitcher who relies on sliders, sinkers, precise control and changing speeds. He has maybe the best pickoff move in the majors and his acquisition is certain to pick up the Yankees in a division that has been improving all around them.
Mulholland gives the Yankees the chance to have four left-handed starters, which is a plus at Yankee Stadium and against the Blue Jays. Toronto was 22-25 against left-handed starters in 1993 and was beaten by Mulholland in Game 2 of the World Series last fall.
Mulholland, the starter for the National League in last year's All-Star Game, finished 12-9 with a 3.25 earned run average in helping the Phillies win the National League pennant.
 
News on the Road
 He learned about the trade yesterday from his brother in a call to his car telephone while he was preparing to leave for Clearwater, Fla., Philadelphia's spring-training site. After first thinking it was a prank, he called General Manager Lee Thomas of Philadelphia, who confirmed the news.
"There's a lot of relief," Mulholland said. "I know where I'll be driving my truck this week. I'll just have to drive a little further to Fort Lauderdale."
Thomas, who conceded that he would probably "take a lot of heat" for the trade, said he feared losing Mulholland to free agency after this season for a draft choice. Instead, the Phillies have obtained in Munoz a talented pitcher who started out impressively before slumping to a 3-3 record and a 5.32 e.r.a. last season, angering the Yankees along the way because of his excessive weight.
Jordan hit .283 with 16 homers and 87 runs batted in at Class AA, but his path to the majors with the Yankees was blocked by Pat Kelly. Karp was 16-3 with a 2.10 e.r.a. at Class AA and Class A, but he will be 24 years old in April and is considered a soft thrower.
 
INSIDE PITCH
 While the Yanks obtained a needed starter in TERRY MULHOLLAND , they might be losing out on some bullpen help because STEVE FARR is close to signing with another team. DICK MOSS , Farr's agent, said, "We'll be doing something in the next few days."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Inertia Worries Progressives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Jan. 27 Political Memo on the cold shoulder liberals are getting from Clinton Democrats conveys the depth of progressive misgivings about President Clinton, but not the content. Few liberals quibble with the importance of overhauling national policy concerning health care, crime and welfare. The question is: Do the Clinton proposals come close to addressing the real problems?
The Congressional Budget Office has shown that the only way to provide health care to the 37 million uninsured Americans and save money is through a single-payer, Canadian-style system. The biggest source of inefficiency is the private insurance industry, which consumes $1 of every $4 in health care (in Canada, Government administration costs only $1 of every $10). 
 Mr. Clinton's political judgment -- that it is better to raise taxes (an unpopular act) than to sacrifice the insurance industry (which no one likes) -- is bizarre. His proposals will probably give us a system that costs much more, still leaves millions of Americans uncovered, or both.
On crime, serious analysts know that Mr. Clinton's three-strikes-and-you're-out proposal is posturing. Our problem is not a shortage of prisons. We already have more prisoners per capita than any other country in the world. Crime is out of control because of the proliferation of guns and the persistence of deep poverty, about both of which the President is doing little. His signature on the Brady bill was a tiny step forward, but his embrace of National Rifle Association officials, rather than of proposals for comprehensive licensing and banning of all guns, is not encouraging.
As for poverty, the Administration's response is to toss welfare recipients off the dole in two years. But if there are no jobs for these 1.5 million to 2 million people (mostly single mothers), this will be the cruelest social policy in modern American history. Unfortunately for welfare recipients and for the 12 million Americans unemployed, there is no serious public jobs program on the table.
Mr. Clinton has no money to provide jobs or further poverty relief because he refuses to challenge the twin pillars of his Republican predecessors -- that taxes on the wealthy should not be raised and that the bloated military budget should not be cut. With the cold war over, the Pentagon budget is outrageous. Mr. Clinton argues that the military budget of $277 billion cannot be cut, though the next 10 largest military budgets in the world (nearly all allies) total $250 billion. Russia, arguably the most formidable potential threat, spends less than $40 billion.
Progressives worry not if this President is moving far or fast enough, but if he is moving forward at all.

HEADLINE: George Wallace Rues and Relishes the Past

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala.

 BODY:
His thoughts, he says, are more on the next world than this one, but as he lies beneath a brooding cloud of smoke from his Garcia y Vega cigars, George Corley Wallace is still hoping for redemption before death as well as after it.
"They all talking like me," he gasped, pushing out his words in short hoarse breaths. "Nixon. Reagan. Clinton. Welfare reform. Crime. Big government. Taxes on the middle class. They all saying now what I was saying then." 
 For those who remember him as the defiant voice of the segregated South in its death throes, there is little that appears familiar in the tired man in the wheelchair who spends most of his time with black aides and talks of his commitment to racial harmony.
 
Assassination Attempt
 But just over two decades after a gunman's bullets tore into his spine, ending his national political aspirations, Mr. Wallace lives on, a presence at once ghostly and eerily up to date, whose political legacy says as much about recent political history as it does about him.
And if his version of his own history is a predictably sanitized one, it is hard to dispute that Mr. Wallace's Presidential campaigns, in a particularly raw form, presaged much of the politics since.
He was the first politician of his generation to mobilize the blue-collar white voters who came to be known as Reagan Democrats, the first to tap into the angry disaffection with Washington that has come to dominate the nation's politics, and the first national figure to jab a cattle prod into issues like crime, race and welfare that still resonate in more polite forms a quarter-century later.
"It is difficult to conceive of what American politics of the 1960's, 70's and 80's would be like without George Wallace," said Dan Carter, a professor of history at Emory University who is writing a biography of Mr. Wallace. "I don't think there's a single issue that Nixon and Reagan talk of in terms of social issues that he doesn't get to first."
A new biography, "George Wallace: American Populist," (Addison-Wesley, 1994) by Stephan Lesher, comes to the same conclusion.
No fiction could surpass the morality play that has been the life of Mr. Wallace. First was the man who hissed into a cold January wind "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever." The year was 1963, and Mr. Wallace was delivering his first inaugural address as Governor of Alabama.
 
Presidential Campaigns
 Then came the razor-edged, right-wing populism of two Presidential campaigns in 1968 and 1972 when he lambasted "pointy-headed intellectuals," "loose-minded, high-livin' liberals" and "briefcase-totin' bureaucrats." Five bullets fired by Arthur H. Bremmer at a Laurel, Md., shopping center on May 15, 1972, ended it all, beginning a long, pained effort to make amends and find peace that continues still.
At the age of 74, Mr. Wallace is paralyzed from the waist down, in considerable pain and almost totally deaf. He suffers from Parkinson's disease and arthritis, and his taut features have long since given way to a jowly old age.
A year and a half ago, a blood infection almost killed him. But, after all the obituaries were prepared, he rallied and recovered. He now goes to his office at Troy State University in Montgomery two or three times a week and eats lunch most days at Morrison's Cafeteria or Martin's Cafeteria. Most weekends he is strapped down in his van and driven to his hometown of Clio, 63 miles southeast of Montgomery, stopping to eat at Wilson's Barbecue in Troy along the way.
A few months back, he attended the National Black Mayor's Conference in Tuskegee at the mayors' invitation.
 
'I Didn't Hate Anybody'
 But he rarely makes public appearances and communicates only by responding to written notes. Instead, he spends much of his time at home in an electrically adjustable hospital bed, lighting up his Garcia y Vega Gran Premios with a Wild Turkey lighter, watching CNN, either close-captioned or with the sound off, and brooding about his place in history.
"The New York Times, the Eastern establishment newspapers never did understand that segregation wasn't about hate," he said, his eyes watery but clear. "I didn't hate anybody. I don't hate the man who shot me. When I was young, I used to swim and play with blacks all the time. You find more hate in New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., than in all the Southern states put together."
It is a theme he has voiced for 30 years, and historians may forever debate how much of his defense of segregation reflected bigotry, how much was a cynical political gambit and how much reflected the rage that surged through the South at the specter of Northerners telling them how to run their society.
 
Stains of Racism
 Mr. Wallace maintains that he supported segregation not because of racism but because he believed -- incorrectly he now says -- it was best for whites and blacks. But just as it is indisputable that he inflamed ugly racial issues as few national politicians have, it is also true that he has spent the last two decades seeking redemption, appearing at black churches, forging political alliances with blacks and being elected to his fourth term as Governor in 1982 largely because of black support.
On some level he knows, as Mr. Lesher's book says, that "Like the imagined indelible bloodstain on Lady Macbeth's hands, the stains of racism on Wallace's reputation will never be washed away." Still, he argues his case.
One by one, he calls in his two black attendants, Eddie Holcey and Jimmy Dallas, and a black state trooper, Benjamin Hamilton, asking them if he hates blacks. They roll their eyes, partly at the question, partly at the tableau in which they are actors, and say no, no, he does not.
"Segregation was wrong," he said, as he has for much of his life since the shooting. "But I didn't bring segregation about. It was there when I got to the Governor's office. It's gone, and I'm glad it's gone. It's so much better to see people together the way they are now."
Even before his shooting, Mr. Wallace realized he had made a Faustian bargain with race. It added a visceral intensity that fueled his national candidacy, but it left him too far outside the political mainstream to be elected President. But aside from his stand on segregation and the air of raw menace that pervaded his national campaigns in 1968 and 1972, there is little in those races that is not strikingly contemporary.
"What are people going to worry about in the 70's?" he said in a 1970 interview with The New York Times in which he predicted a conservative backlash against liberal social policies and a national tax revolt. "Why, about the things in our program -- taxes, law and order, local control of government and other institutions."
Asked in a recent interview what his main issue would be today, he returned to a favorite theme and said, "Changing our asinine tax structure and stop taxing the middle class."
 
Views on Political Figures
 Asked about political figures, he is generally approving of Bill Clinton, less so of Ronald Reagan, whose economic policies he says are responsible for the high deficit. He prefers to keep his negative comments on Ross Perot private, saying on the record only, "He's O.K."
Not long ago, he made one of his few public appearances in recent years, appearing at a local mall with Mr. Lesher to autograph copies of the biographer's book.
He came bearing a prepared statement. On segregation, he was contrite: "I was wrong, and I'm sorry. I don't expect people to forget words and deeds that might have hurt them, but I ask that they try to remember actions designed to help them."
On race, he sounded like a New Democrat. "I'm frankly concerned that much of this country is turning away from trying to overcome our differences and is retreating to resegregation," he said. "If it was wrong when I was supporting it, it's no less wrong now."
He congratulated Mr. Clinton on his State of the Union Message, called on him to revive his economic stimulus program. "Even though I have always supported strong law-and-order measures and welfare reform, I have always believed that the ultimate answer was in better education and more realistic job opportunities."
The crowds came early and stayed until Mr. Wallace, after almost three hours of sitting upright and signing almost 700 books, slumped down in pain and was wheeled away.
There was Claude McClearen, known as Rooster, who used to give a defiant rooster crow at Mr. Wallace's campaign rallies, and is still fighting the Civil War. There was Sarah Norred, the Montgomery County Tax Collector, who, with the unerring ability to gloss over minor unpleasantries, sees Mr. Wallace as a political legend, and cannot imagine race's dimming his legacy. "He's a good man, and he stood up for Alabama," she said.
There was Alva Lambert, a Montgomery County Deputy District Attorney, who admires Mr. Wallace as a shot of 100 proof J. W. Dant Bourbon in an era of Chablis politics.
"He wasn't perfect," Mr. Lambert said, "but he was a genuine human being. Now they're all media-produced, mass-marketed, blow-dried and look like a guy selling Century 21 real estate."
 
'He's Changed'
 There was Donna Gunn, a black woman who brought her fourth-grade class to see the man who once stood in the door at the University of Alabama rather than integrate the campus. "I really and truly hated that man," she said, "but I see how he's changed, and it's changed my opinion of him."
Another black woman, Mattie Brinson, was shopping in the mall, only to look up in amazement and see the former Governor sitting in his wheelchair.
"I have to shake his hand," said Ms. Brinson, who is 76. "I can't afford no book, but I have to shake his hand."
Asked if she harbored any ill will toward Mr. Wallace, she waved her arm as if swatting the question away.
"We're all human," she said. "The Lord made us all. We're born in this world alike, and we'll all go to sleep alike, too."

HEADLINE: New York Hospitals Chief Calls Brooklyn Plan a Giant Failure

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Charging a decade of mismanagement and incompetence, the new chairman of New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation said yesterday that his agency had "completely screwed up" the planned billion-dollar reconstruction of Kings County Hospital, the city's largest public medical center.
In 1984 the agency embarked on what was then a $550 million project to build a new 1.4 million-square-foot public hospital for the largely impoverished neighborhood in central Brooklyn. "Ten years later," said Luis A. Miranda Jr., chairman of the corporation's board, "after having spent $119 million to date, we have only an administrative building, a food service building, a couple of holes in the ground, a few parking lots and some pictures of past mayors with hard hats claiming they have fulfilled a promise." 
 In addition, he said, "what we do have is an angry community and very little to show for it."
He laid the blame for the failure on his agency and its staff, the hospital's management and the project construction manager. "The absence of a team effort produced little or no project accountability, significant delays and a more costly project," Mr. Miranda said. "Because we have handled the management of the project so poorly, now it becomes everyone's and nobody's fault."
Following the lead of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who last week imposed a moratorium on the construction plan, Mr. Miranda called yesterday for a review of the project. That will mean yet another delay in the tortuous effort to replace a 62-year-old public hospital that is a virtual museum of an early-20th-century medical center. Almost all of its 1,200 beds are in large open wards, and the building makes do with balky window air-conditioners, broken elevators, frequent "brownouts" and an emergency room that cannot begin to meet the health needs of central Brooklyn's low-income residents.
 
An Angry Reaction
 The announcement of the review yesterday infuriated community leaders in central Brooklyn, who have spent years demanding that the hospital be replaced. Elected leaders in the largely black area, already angry at Mayor Giuliani's moratorium, suggested that yesterday's action might be an attempt to scale down or even kill the project.
Mr. Miranda's sharp criticism of his own agency's work under the Dinkins and Koch administrations is supported by interviews over the past week with city and hospital officials, as well as community leaders, who described a decade of legal problems, bureaucratic infighting and political wrangling that has stymied the rebuilding efforts.
The starting date for construction, originally set for early 1992, has been postponed several times, most recently until last month. At the moment, no one involved with the project knows when construction will actually begin.
Several hosptals corporation officials said that the agency staggered under the weight of a project far larger than any it had ever completed and that the logistical difficulties of building a huge new hospital next to an existing one proved far more difficult than either the agency or the contractor ever expected.
Mr. Miranda, who was appointed by Mayor Giuliani, acknowledged in an interview yesterday that the project might have been too much for the hospitals corporation, saying it was possible that the new hospital might have to be built by another government agency and then turned over to the hospitals agency to run.
"If we don't know how to build a billion-dollar project, then we need to figure out and find out who can build it with us," he said. "Our commitment should be, let's build a hospital and let's not have any preconceived ideas that we have to do it this way or the way we have been doing it."
Mr. Miranda mentioned the possibility of future construction being handled by the State Facilities Development Corporation, which built Lincoln and Woodhull Hospitals for the city in the late 1970's. But Woodhull, in northern Brooklyn, opened a decade late and tens of millions of dollars over budget because of problems attributed to mismanagement.
The city agency's admission of mismanagement drew outraged protests from black political leaders in central Brooklyn, who suggested that Mr. Miranda made the admission to justify the moratorium and eventually end the reconstruction project.
"One of the best ways to kill a project is to stop it, let it lay dormant for a while, and then never start it again because it looks too expensive," said Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., who represents the area in the State Assembly and is the Brooklyn Democratic leader. "This statement sounds to me like nonsense, a subterfuge for what they really want to do, which is kill it."
Mr. Norman and several City Council members from the area accused Mr. Giuliani of trying to kill the new hospital because much of the largely black section of central Brooklyn voted for Mayor David N. Dinkins in the November mayoral election.
 
To Review the Project
 But Mr. Miranda insisted yesterday that a new hospital would be built, though he declined to say whether it would be as large or fully equipped as residents have requested. He said the new hospitals corporation board would correct the management problems and proceed with the project, but he added that the construction manager, Turner/Santa Fe Joint Venture, might have to be replaced "if they are not up to the job." He appointed a senior director of the hospitals agency to review the project and recommend ways to get it started, and he said that from now on, the hospital would be the first item on the agenda of every meeting of the capital ommittee of the corporation's board.
Mr. Miranda did not specify the precise nature of the troubles afflicting the project, singling out only his agency and the staff of Turner/Santa Fe, which he criticized for not producing an independent audit of its work that was promised to the board 16 months ago. If the company does not produce the audit, he said, he "will ask the board to dump them."
Officials at Turner/Santa Fe, a joint venture of the Turner Construction Company and the Santa Fe Construction Company, did not return telephone messages yesterday.
But interviews with other city officials, as well as hospital and community leaders, described a decade of bureaucratic bungling and clashing political goals that virtually guaranteed the project would be delayed and over budget.
Two city officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that to begin with, the design of the project proved far more difficult than expected. The existing hospital buildings, most of which were completed in 1932, sit on an L-shaped 44-acre site at Clarkson and New York Avenues in Flatbush. Hospitals corporation planners and outside designers spent several years trying to find the right location for the new buildings, trying to work around ancient utility lines and support buildings.
 
Disputes Within Staff
 The pre-construction stage, planned for two years, grew to five. As part of this phase, the contractors had to build new space for the hospital's administrative staff and the food service department so that their existing buildings could be demolished for more construction. Those buildings, completed in 1991, were not occupied until a year later because of disputes within the staff over who would move into them, officials said.
Just before the initial excavation for the main building was scheduled in the spring of 1992, a lengthy dispute broke out over awarding of a contract to an excavation company after a rejected company sued the city. As a result, excavation on the main building never began.
Problems involving the construction manager, Turner/Santa Fe, first came to light in March 1992 when Coopers & Lybrand, an independent auditing firm, wrote the hospitals corporation that the contractor was not properly discharging its responsibilities. But despite the audit report, which warned the agency that the project was in jeopardy, the agency's board approved Turner/Santa Fe's request for $16 million on top of the $19 million it bid to be construction manager for the project.
Mr. Miranda, the agency chairman, said yesterday that the joint venture had recently requested $24 million more for the project, a request he said he did not intend to grant.
Several city officials said one reason for the delay and cost overruns was the area's insistence that much of the construction work go to small, minority-owned companies. Because many such companies were not large enough to be principal contractors in areas like air-conditioning, plumbing or electrical work for the entire building, the project was subdivided into scores of smaller jobs.
But hospital officials and community leaders said the additional contractors had nothing to do with the delays.
Councilwoman Una Clarke, who represents the hospital district, said residents had insisted on minority participation from the beginning.
"This is the first time in central Brooklyn that minority contractors have been able to help create some employment," she said. "The cost to the city will eventually be much higher if they can't create some economic stability in this area."

HEADLINE: Windfall Fees In Injury Cases Under Assault

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
On Sept. 21, 1989, a soft-drink delivery truck slammed into a school bus in Alton, Tex., killing 21 children and injuring dozens of others. Insurers for the bottling company and the bus manufacturer settled the claims of the victims' families quickly, for an estimated $122 million.
Notwithstanding that early resolution of a case that was never really in doubt, the families' lawyers received at least a third of the settlement in contingency fees. By the calculation of Prof. Lester Brickman of Benjamin Cardozo Law School, that sum was equal to at least $25,000 an hour to each plaintiff lawyer involved in the case, in exchange for what amounted to nothing more than routine legal services. 
 Such windfalls -- part of the $13 billion to $15 billion paid annually to American lawyers contingent on their winning a favorable verdict or, more frequently, a settlement -- have long been tolerated as the price of assuring access to court by those who cannot afford lawyers' hourly fees. But perhaps not much longer, given a new attack by a large group of legal scholars ranging along the philosophical spectrum from Erwin N. Griswold to Robert H. Bork.
 
'Simple, Ingenious' Innovation
 Professor Brickman and two other legal experts sponsored by the Manhattan Institute in Washington have devised a system of incentive for early settlements that Derek Bok, former president of Harvard University and onetime Harvard Law School dean, calls "a simple, ingenious way" to link fees to the degree of risk actually borne by injury lawyers. And the Manhattan Institute group is asking both the states' highest courts, through petitions filed by the authors' allies across the country, and the American Bar Association to give the proposal the force of authority.
Barry Nace, president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, dismisses the proposal as "something on the fringe." But it has won support in important quarters, and not just from backers of former Vice President Dan Quayle's longtime demand for broad tort reform.
More than two dozen of the nation's leading lawyers -- including Mr. Griswold, Solicitor General in the Johnson Administration and himself a former Harvard Law dean; Mr. Bork, whose tenure as a Federal appeals judge made him a darling of conservatives, and William P. Barr, Attorney General under President George Bush -- plan to issue a letter today endorsing the approach. The letter will ask the bar association's ethics committee to declare it unethical for lawyers to charge contingency fees on settlements that are virtually certain from the start.
 
Request to Courts as Well
 "It's no stretch to go from the current ethics code to more precise limits on contingency fees," said one lawyer who follows the work of the ethics committee closely and knows the current members well. "There's a good chance they'll accept the idea."
A nod from the committee would put great pressure on states to adopt the system as their own. "The ruling wouldn't be binding," Mr. Griswold said, "but I think it would be influential in many courts."
Meanwhile, the authors of the proposal are not waiting for the blessing of the bar association. They are going directly to state supreme courts, asking them to adopt the plan as a means of expediting justice and lowering its cost.
 
Workings of the Proposal
 The system would work this way:
Defendants in civil suits would be guaranteed a chance to make an early settlement offer -- say, within 60 days. If no offer was made, the plaintiffs' lawyers would be free to negotiate fees. But if an offer was made and accepted, the compensation to those lawyers would be limited to a reasonable hourly rate or a very modest share of the gross -- say, 10 percent. And if an early settlement offer was made and refused, the offer would become the rock on which contingency fees would be based.
The elegance of the approach, suggests Prof. Thomas Morgan, former dean of Emory University Law School and now an ethics specialist at George Washington University, is that the adversaries themselves would decide where routine accident claims processing ends and high-risk legal battles begin.
Suppose the defense offered $90,000, and the plaintiff declined. Suppose, too, that the case was later settled for $100,000. Then the most that the plaintiff's lawyer could charge would be a reasonable hourly fee for work done to the time of the first offer, plus a contingent percentage of the $10,000 -- the difference between the $90,000 offer and the $100,000 that the lawyer later won. In the Texas bus accident, the lawyers' cut would have been a small fraction of the $40 million they received.
 
Huge Cut in Injury Fees
 The team from the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy research organization, argues that by the same token, the early-offer dividing line would reduce defendants' incentive to wear down plaintiffs by stalling. An early offer of, say, $10,000 would yield perhaps $9,000 for the plaintiff, after attorney's fees. In the absence of an early offer, delivering the same $9,000 to the plaintiff later on, when his lawyer typically claims 40 percent of the payout, would cost the defense $15,000.
Containing contingency fees in this way would certainly shake the economic underpinnings of liability law. Professor Brickman and the proposal's other authors -- Jeffrey O'Connell of the University of Virginia Law School and Michael Horowitz, senior fellow of the Manhattan Institute -- estimate that the direct savings would run as high as a third of the $30 billion now spent annually on legal fees in personal injury cases.
Perhaps as important, it would speed payment to victims of negligence. "Defendants would have enormous incentives to make early and realistic settlement offers," Mr. Horowitz said.
 
How Large a Premium?
 The logic behind the current system that so frequently produces generous contingency fees is straightforward. As Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote in a 1987 Supreme Court opinion, "The premium added for contingency compensates for the risk of nonpayment if the suit does not succeed."
This, however, begs two questions: How much premium is warranted, and who should decide how much?
One answer is to leave the matter to lawyer and client. But to Mr. Horowitz, that seems fair only if the negotiation is between equals, a presumption he finds implausible. Lawyers, he says, "often possess a near-monopoly of information on what the risks of nonrecovery are."
An alternative is to set caps on contingency fees. Congress limits them in Federal courts to 25 percent. Most states cap them at 50 percent, and many -- among them New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- have sliding scales, the percentage declining as the amount of the settlement or judgment rises.
But caps only highlight the tensions in fee reform. In very risky cases, protecting consumers against high fees could mean poor representation, or none at all. On the other hand, even in cases where the circumstances virtually guarantee a generous settlement, the cap is all too often the standard percentage, effectively lending the court's authority to fee gouging.
 
Vast Abuse Seen
 Prof. George Priest of Yale Law School believes that the abuse of contingency fees is large, and growing. "Both the percentage of accident cases settled and the size of payouts are rising," he pointed out, and yet there is no evidence that lawyers are getting less because they bear less risk. Professor Brickman estimates that the hourly return on contingent fee cases is actually five to eight times greater today than a quarter-century ago, even after adjustment for inflation.
Judges do have the authority to police fees. Indeed, Philip Corboy, a very successful plaintiffs' lawyer in Chicago who has written passionately in defense of contingency fees, sees more aggressive intervention by judges as the way to curb the occasional abuse.
But Professor O'Connell, of the Manhattan Institute team, thinks this solution is no solution at all. "The courts are already overwhelmed," he said. "And keep in mind that judges are ex-lawyers who are reluctant to sanction their former fellows."
By contrast, the Brickman-Horowitz-O'Connell approach "is so simple, once you understand it you wonder why nobody thought of it before," Professor Morgan said.
 
'None of Their Business'
 Convincing scholars of the virtues of a contingency fee overhaul is one thing; selling it to the legal profession, which includes tens of thousands of personal injury lawyers whose livelihoods are on the line, is quite another. "It's none of their business how much clients pay me," Mr. Corboy said of the Manhattan Institute team.
For his part, Mr. Nace, of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, argues that hourly fees could never compensate him for his skills and experience. "If some defense attorney gets a letter from me," he said, "they are more likely to settle than if they get a letter from Joe Blow." Further, he says, successful trial lawyers use fat payouts to cover advocacy that is financially unrewarding. "The big cases," he said, "enable us to provide justice in the little cases."
Harry Wellington, dean of the New York Law School, acknowledges that "the plan might contain glitches." But he is convinced that it would be a "vast improvement" over the current contingency fee windfalls.
In any event, the Manhattan Institute group is not counting on winning converts among trial lawyers. The three legal scholars want the A.B.A.'s ethics committee to agree that since the association's code of behavior already cautions that contingency fees should be charged only where "the arrangement will be beneficial to the client," it follows that contingency fees are unethical unless an early settlement is considered.
A favorable ruling by the committee "would not carry the force of law," Dean Wellington notes, but would likely lead to similar directives by state bar associations and, in most jurisdictions, could be made binding by state supreme courts without legislation. Whether or not the bar association approves, Mr. Horowitz "hopes and expects" to sell the plan to supreme courts as a way to promote swifter and lower-cost justice.
The promise of the Brickman-Horowitz-O'Connell proposal is that it reconciles limits on legal fees with open access to courts. And it creates what Dean Wellington calls "a surrogate market" for matching fees to lawyers' efforts, a system that would not require the courts' micro-management.
The plaintiffs' bar will undoubtedly do its best to stop the guaranteed-early-offer approach, concludes Yale's Professor Priest. But, he said, "it's an idea that trial lawyers will have a great deal of difficulty countering."

"How Injured Claimants Fare"
Charts: "Backers of an Overhaul"
Although payments to people injured in negligence cases generally include claims for pain and suffering, the insurance industry says it is the claims of financial loss that most closely track the severity of the injury. Here is how auto-accident claimants with lawyers, who routinely charge by contingency fee in injury cases, fared in three broad categories in one study, as against those who proceeded without lawyers.
 Table shows met payments to claimants as a percentage of financial losses claimed:

 	 	 		CLAIMANTS	CLAIMANTS	INJURY	WITH LAWYERS	WITHOUT LAWYERS	 	 	 	MAJOR FRACTURE	139%	190%	MINOR FRACTURE	168%	206%	CONCUSSION	133%	137%

HEADLINE: Populist Challenge in California Race

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb. 10

 BODY:
Picking up where Ross Perot and Edmund G. Brown Jr. left off in the 1992 Presidential campaign, Tom Hayden is running for governor of California on what he calls a crusade against the influence of special interests in politics.
Mr. Hayden, whose political career started in the protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960's, said he was not in the race to win. But his announcement on Wednesday stunned politicians in this state capital and could significantly shift the dynamics of what is shaping up to be a hard-fought race in a big state. 
 Republicans here said Mr. Hayden's decision would help the Republican incumbent, Gov. Pete Wilson, by fragmenting Democratic voters in the primary on June 7, in which Mr. Hayden is taking on Kathleen Brown, the state Treasurer, and John Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner.
Mr. Hayden, a 54-year-old state senator from Santa Monica, said in an interview today that he was running because of a "tacit silence among Republicans and Democrats about campaign reform and lobbying reform." Mr. Hayden, wealthy since he won a large divorce settlement after splitting with the actress Jane Fonda in 1989, would not need to raise much money for a statewide campaign.
 
$94 Gift Limits
 Like Mr. Brown, a former governor of California and Ms. Brown's brother, Mr. Hayden said he would not run 30-second television commercials and would accept only small contributions -- no more than $94 a person ("94 for Reform" is his slogan).
Mr. Hayden has long challenged the establishment; before he married Ms. Fonda, he was a defendant in the Chicago Seven case arising from his protests at the Democratic convention in 1968.
In concentrating on political reform, Mr. Hayden already has plenty of ammunition: Ms. Brown, who announced her candidacy this week, has so far raised far more than $5 million; Mr. Garamendi has more than $1 million. The nominee of each party is expected to raise as much as $25 million.
"It's the ideal situation for Wilson," the House Speaker, Willie L. Brown, a Democrat, said today. He said Ms. Brown, as the front runner in the polls at this early stage, would be hurt because she would be forced to be more specific about her positions during the primary. "Whether it's a crime issue or a race issue," the Speaker said, "she's got to say it now." But others assert that Ms. Brown could benefit because the entry of the liberal Mr. Hayden in the race will make her appear more moderate.
Mr. Brown said in an interview that he was pleased to see Mr. Hayden in the race. "I'm glad he's putting the issue of political reform front and center." Mr. Brown declined to compare his Presidential quest to that of Mr. Hayden, saying he is curious about whether Mr. Hayden will tap his own money.
 
Noncommittal Brother
 Asked whether he would endorse his sister in the primary, Mr. Brown replied: "I'm staying out of the campaign. I'm certainly urging my sister to get out front on political reform."
Mr. Hayden in an interview on the Senate floor rejected any comparison to Mr. Perot or Mr. Brown. "I would ask voters to judge me on the merits and not let immediate stereotypes characterize me," he said. "I don't want to make comparisons. You may. My point is that I think that there's a message of reform that needs to be voiced, and the alternative is the suffocation of silence. If I can be a magnet that redirects debate to reform, my mission is satisfied."
Asked about how much money he planned to spend on a campaign or whether any of it would come from his personal fortune, Mr. Hayden said, "That's unknown."
He said he would rely on a grass-roots organization and a belief that "the free press still can reach as many people as television commercials." And he insisted that he did not see himself as a spoiler, saying, "I'm not trying to defeat them but to unleash a debate and a movement to which they respond."
In a speech on Wednesday, Mr. Hayden, who was elected to the State Assembly in 1982, said he decided to run on the night before the filing deadline on Wednesday because "the earthquake of Jan. 17 jolted me into a greater urgency."
 
Republican Questions
 Some Republicans questioned whether Mr. Hayden was a legitimate populist voice against big money in politics given his own fortune.
"It borders on hypocrisy -- running on taking no more than 94 bucks is all right if you've got plenty of your own money," said Kenneth L. Maddy, the state Senate Republican leader. "You can be holier than thou all you want. It's one thing to limit how much you receive, but the issue is how much you spend." But Mr. Maddy conceded that his colleague across the aisle would be "forcing the issue in a way that no one likes, even Wilson."
In his 1992 campaign for the State Senate, Mr. Hayden spent an estimated $750,000 in a three-way primary, a large amount for such a race.
Mr. Hayden said he would withdraw from the race if the other candidates speak out on his agenda, which includes public financing of campaigns and outlawing political action committees. But thus far, that is not happening. The Brown campaign issued a statement saying that Ms. Brown would continue to emphasize creating jobs, eliminating violence and reforming schools, "no matter who else joins the race." Mr. Garamendi was not much more forthcoming, saying, "I welcome a discussion of the issues raised by Tom Hayden."
Given voters' worries about the economy, the fallout from the earthquake and other matters, Herbert E. Alexander, a political science professor at the University of Southern California, questioned whether Mr. Hayden would succeed in making campaign reform an important issue. "He's trying to force this as an issue," Mr. Alexander said. "But I don't know that Brown or Garamendi will adopt it in a way that will make it a prime issue that would satisfy Hayden or his supporters."

HEADLINE: Senate Votes a Quake Relief Measure

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
The Senate tonight approved spending $10 billion, mostly for Los Angeles earthquake victims and military operations abroad, but only after California's agitated lawmakers -- and a looming snowstorm -- induced the senators to end a two-day feud over whether to cut other spending to pay for it.
After a string of attacks on parts of the bill that do not deal with disasters -- highway grants, World Bank contributions, military spending and obscure Federal programs -- the Senate voted 85 to 10 to add the measure's costs to the Federal deficit, as had been proposed in the first place. 
 The bill now goes to a House-Senate conference to resolve a $300 million difference between the Senate bill and the House version, passed last week.
The two versions are almost identical. Both declare an emergency, allowing the Government to increase the deficit by $7.7 billion to aid victims of the Los Angeles earthquake and $1.2 billion for Pentagon operations in Bosnia, Iraq, Somalia and Haiti.
 
Past Disaster an Issue
 The House version grants an additional $750 million for past disasters -- the Los Angeles fires and Midwest floods of last summer and for relocating a freeway damaged in the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco area. The Senate bill would spend about $1.05 billion on those disasters.
Also tucked away in the Senate bill is another emergency expense: $1 million to hire lawyers to defend senators who are accused by their staff members of civil rights violations or other types of violations.
As was true on Wednesday, the first day of debate on the relief bill, practically none of those expenses were debated today. In fact, save a debate on the Pentagon allotment and a gentlemanly protest by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, of the lawyers' expenses, everyone agreed that the measure should be passed intact as soon as possible.
What spurred disagreement, between a solid majority of the Senate and a small bloc of dissidents, was whether all the expenses in the bill were genuine emergencies and whether they should be financed by increasing the deficit in any case.
"There is no question these emergencies are legitimate and the need of relief is real," the Republican leader, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, said of the disaster provisions in the bill. "The question is simple: Are we going to ring up another $10 billion on Uncle Sam's credit card?"
Mr. Dole and several other Senators -- John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and John Kerry of Massachusetts and Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, both Democrats -- tried to persuade the Senate to cut back the deficit expense, either by paring the bill itself or by making other cuts in the budget.
Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat, had taken the same tack on Wednesday, without success.
The efforts today efforts were beaten back mostly through the acid oratory and parliamentary skills of the Democratic chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia.
Mr. Byrd, whose mastery of the Senate rules is well known, raised a procedural point to derail Mr. Dole's attempt to approve about $50 billion in cuts in spending over five years. And when Mr. McCain proposed to kill so-called highway demonstration projects with a price tag of $203 million -- widely derided, even within Congress, as political pork -- Mr. Byrd had another tactic. He produced two letters that Mr. McCain had sent to the Appropriations Committee in 1991, seeking highway grants for his home state. Mr. McCain's amendment failed, 72 to 23.
"I thought it would be good for the Senate to have this matter called to the attention of the Senate," Mr. Byrd said. Then addressing Mr. McCain, he added: "He is very considerate of the taxpayers when it comes to financing projects in other states, but he supports such projects in his own state."
That led Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, to leap to Mr. McCain's defense, noting that the demonstration projects that Mr. McCain wanted to cut included $26 million in Arizona.
"If the Senate voted this afternoon for building a cheese plant on the moon, I would no doubt vote against it," he said. "But if the Senate decided, in its collective lack of wisdom, to build a cheese factory on the moon, I would want a Texan to design that cheese factory." Mr. McCain, he argued, could rightly seek to eliminate a wasteful program even as he tried to snare some of its benefits for his constituents.
That was too much for Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, who had urged lawmakers with increasing urgency to stop debating and approve the earthquake aid for her state.
Pointing to poignant photographs of quake devastation on an easel beside her desk, she said: "We're now talking about cheese factories on the moon. I want to bring this back to the ground."

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Visit by Japanese Leader Could Turn Into Confrontation

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
As American and Japanese negotiators worked to try to reach agreement on opening Japanese markets, American officials said today that there was little progress and only a last-minute concession from Japan could prevent the meeting Friday between President Clinton and Prime Minster Morihiro Hosokawa from turning into a confrontation.
The gloomy mood sent the dollar down against the yen, as market speculators anticipated trade sanctions between the world's two richest economies. 
 Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who arrived hours before Prime Minister Hosokawa, spent the day trying to patch together an agreement in separate talks with Secretary of State Warren Christopher; Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen; United States Trade Representative Mickey Kantor; the national security adviser, Anthony Lake; Mr. Clinton's counselor, David Gergen, and the White House trade expert, Bowman Cutter.
Japanese officials said Mr. Hata was trying to meet with American foreign policy advisers in hopes of persuading them to soften the demands of American trade negotiators, cautioning that a Clinton-Hosokawa clash on trade could diminish Japan's willingness to cooperate with the United States on Russian aid, Korea and other global issues.
 
Japan Finds United Front
 The Japanese have always relied on the State Department and the Pentagon to soften the demands of the Commerce Department and the United States Trade Representative. But today they found a united front in Washington, demanding that Japan agree not only to open its markets but also to accept numerical indicators that would show whether Tokyo was really following through.
The numerical indicators are the key stumbling block. Japanese officials denounced such quantitative measures as an American tool to set specific import targets for different sectors of the Japanese economy, which they said is tantamount to "managing trade" between their two countries. American officials said that they must have numerical indicators to demonstrate whether Japan was really allowing the import of more foreign cars, insurance or medical equipment because 20 years of accepting general promises from Tokyo produced a trade deficit with Japan that has soared by 20 percent in just the last year and is nearing $60 billion.
It was Secretary of State Christopher who gave the bluntest assessment of the situation, making no effort to conceal the differences with Tokyo when he told reporters after his meeting with Mr. Hata, "Up to the present time there's been very scant progress."
Asked what would happen if there is no breakthrough before the Clinton-Hosokawa meeting in the White House on Friday, Mr. Christopher said: "The United States is determined that we would redress the great imbalance in our trade and we will seek in a determined way access for American businesses in the Japanese market." Translation: the United States will impose its own trade sanctions.
 
One Last Try
 After the morning meetings with Mr. Hata and his American counterparts, both sides agreed that it was worth one last push at the negotiating table. The lower-level trade negotiators from both countries then went to work on the different sectors being covered in the negotiations. Those are: access to Japan's insurance markets, autos and auto parts, telecommunications and medical equipment.
A senior American official said that after a day of talks "we're still nowhere." But, he added, "we've always believed that any Japanese concessions would come at the last minute, including right in the middle of the Clinton-Hosokawa meeting."
American officials said the Japanese had been hoping that the $140 billion economic stimulus program they announced last week -- to encourage the Japanese to import more -- would soften some of the American demands. But American officials said that they viewed the Japanese stimulus as woefully insufficient because it involved only a one-year tax cut, which is not enough to change spending patterns. As a result, this increased, rather than softened, the Clinton Administration's desire to have concrete, measurable market-opening agreements.
Senior political advisers to President Clinton insisted that the President would only accept a partial deal if it involved some concrete concessions from Japan. The domestic politics on this issue has changed in recent years, they argue. During the cold war, a President might be rebuked, or lose credibility, for creating a confrontation with Japan. Today, one Clinton aide said, "We gain credibility with the public the more we slam Hosokawa."
 
Changes in U.S.
 But a senior American official said, "the Japanese still just don't get it -- they just don't understand that we're not going to paper over our differences anymore."
What the Japanese leaders do not "get," said the senior American negotiator, is that some changes have taken place in the United States in recent years.
The first is the new Clinton budget for fiscal 1995. Because of the huge deficits in years past, and the caps on spending imposed last year, the Clinton budget underscores how few resources this Administration has for new discretionary spending programs to stimulate domestic investment and consumer spending.
That makes trade and export growth so much more important as a vehicle for stimulating the American economy. And no country could do more to stimulate growth in the United States than Japan, by opening its markets and buying more from abroad. Japan, with its $131 billion worldwide trade surplus now, "drains growth and jobs from the rest of the world," Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman said.
 
Old Solutions Don't Work
 "In the past, we could always fix domestic economic problems by priming the pump with some deficit spending, but Clinton can't do that anymore," said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., President of the Economic Strategy Institute, which closely monitors trade with Japan. "So the only place he can go is to the trade side. Clinton now has to deal with Japan to address his domestic problems. Stimulating demand there is now more important than ever for getting growth here."
The second difference that Mr. Hosokawa will find here, say American officials, is that after 20 years of trade negotiations with Japan, and some 30 different trade agreements, there is a now widespread consensus that accepting Japan's standard promises for opening its markets have not worked and it is time, as one official put it, "to go nuclear."
Influential business groups, such as the Business Roundtable and the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, have issued statements in the last two days urging the President to hang tough.
"After two decades we have come a long way and accomplished almost nothing," said Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Senate Finance subcommittee that overseas trade. "We have listened to a Niagara of words, scaled a Himalaya mountain range of summits and gotten virtually no results."

HEADLINE: Male, Educated and Falling Behind

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
For the first time since World War II, college-educated men in their late 40's and early 50's -- normally the prime earning years -- are suffering a steep decline in wages, finally getting caught in the downward mobility that has hit most other groups of male workers.
This is the generation that finished four years of college in the prosperous 1960's and entered corporate jobs confident of steady promotions and rising incomes into their mid-50's. Instead, those promotions and rising incomes have stopped. Much anecdotal evidence has documented this setback, particularly stories of middle-aged men forced out of managerial jobs and into lower-paid work, or unemployment. But only now is the extent of the damage to incomes showing up in Government data. 
 "This was the first generation to be widely educated in college," said Katherine Newman, a social anthropologist at Columbia University, who has studied their lives. "They followed the recommended path, but their education has failed to insulate them. And they are getting hurt just at the age when they had counted on rising incomes to educate their children and to save for retirement."
The group -- 2 percent of the labor force -- is composed of two million men, ages 45 to 54, with four years of college but not graduate study. The vast majority are white; only 150,000 are black or Hispanic men. From 1986 through 1992, the median income of men then in this age group fell by 17 percent, after adjustment for inflation, to $41,898, according to data collected by the Census Bureau. Most of the $8,800 fall came after 1989.
"The data clarifies what we mean by the white-collar recession of the 1990's," said Frank Levy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "The white-collar workers who have gotten hurt the most were these older, college-trained people."
The bureau does not tabulate or publish incomes by age groups. But two economists, Mr. Levy and Richard J. Murnane of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, spotted the trend in their own recent tabulations of the data. "We are finding that the standard pattern for educated labor, where wages rise with age, is not so true any more," Mr. Levy said.
Both the Census Bureau and the Labor Department have confirmed the findings. "These are middle managers and engineers whose wages have apparently grown beyond their contribution to their companies," said Thomas Plewes, an associate commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
By comparison, the million or so college-educated women in this age group have seen their median incomes, adjusted for inflation, rise slightly since 1988. But at $25,818, the median is still well below that of their male peers, although for many households, the women's earnings cushion the men's losses.
Mr. Levy was among the first economists a decade ago to spot the downturn in wages that hit workers with only a high school education. That a high school education is not enough to command a good wage in today's high-technology, labor-efficient workplaces is an axiom today in the American culture. But in the early 1980's, many economists argued that the problem would pass; that it grew out of recession and other temporary setbacks, and was not the first sighting of a permanent change.
Now the downturn in the wages of college-educated, middle-aged workers is beginning to produce similar discussion. There is the argument, for example, that men turning 45 in recent years entered middle age already earning less than men their age did a decade ago, and they have dragged down the median income. But Mr. Levy notes that most of the decline has come in just three years, which means that 70 percent of the men hurt had passed their 45th birthdays before their incomes fell.
 
Income Rebound Is Seen
 The doubters, in fact, don't question this point; they argue instead that the weak economy in recent years may be the chief cause of the decline, and the incomes of middle-aged men will rebound once the economy strengthens. "If those incomes don't come back by 1996, then something structural in the workplace may have changed," said Lawrence Katz, chief economist for the Labor Department.
Many of the middle-aged, college-educated workers have no doubts that there has been a structural change. Nor do the management firms and outplacement clinics that help them have doubts. They speak of the widespread phenomenon of older, college-trained men who have been laid off from well-paying jobs at large companies and, after months of job hunting, have taken work at lower pay, often at small companies. Or they try to regain their old incomes through self-employment.
Even when these men are not laid off, their incomes often suffer, said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. Some of his members, he said, have eliminated middle-manager jobs and transferred the occupants to other posts, freezing their pay just when the men counted on a spurt in income to save for retirement.
Other shifts are also contributing to the hard times for these middle-aged workers. The oldest baby boomers are now in their late 40's, and their numbers tend to depress wages, as they have in the past. The flood of new technologies enhances the earning power of younger college graduates, who are not only in closer touch with the latest improvements, but are also willing to accept wages that are lower than those of older workers.
"Perhaps in the past, there was a presumption that if you were older, you were worth more, you were more savvy, more experienced," said Susan Rowland, an executive at Towers Perrin, the management firm. "And I think these days the presumption is not necessarily there."
Perhaps most important, a wage structure that once paid the highest amounts to older workers served as an incentive for younger employees to remain loyal to their companies, said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
"The company says, 'We have so little knowledge of how our employees will be organized in the future or how many we will need that it is not worth structuring the pay system so that every worker we hire has the expectation of being on the payroll 30 years from now,' " Mr. Burtless said. "If companies are coming to that conclusion, then there is no reason to keep on older workers as role models. I don't say that the productivity of older workers is less than younger ones, but maybe their productivity is not going up as fast as the cost of their benefits and their wages."
 
College Still Counts
 College, of course, still counts. The college educated, at any age, are doing better than those with only high school degrees, whose incomes continue to deteriorate. But until the late 1980's, a college education had assured men who earned their degrees in the 1960's of steady raises until age 55, when they entered a decade in which they became increasingly eligible for retirement pensions.
The Census Bureau data outlining this trend have some limitations. The bureau changed the definition of a college education in 1991 from four years at a college to actually earning a bachelor's degree. And until 1988 the definition of income included not only wages and salaries but also income from other sources. These changes alone could skew the decline by 3 or 4 percent, economists say, making it 13 or 14 percent instead of 17 percent. But even that would constitute a precipitous drop in earnings for an age group that had virtually no setbacks in the past.
Now their median income, adjusted for inflation, has fallen to $41,898 in 1992 -- the last year for which figures are available -- from $50,678 in 1986. Most of the loss came after 1989, when the median income was $48,189.
 
An Absolute Drop
 The loss does not seem temporary. The Census Bureau data show that even when the unemployed are eliminated, there is still a sharp decline in the median wage, adjusted for inflation, of older, educated men who hold full-time jobs: a drop of 13 percent since 1989. Even without an inflation adjustment, the median pay fell by nearly $700 from 1989 through 1992.
John Veal is certainly earning less. He has gone through what Clint Glenn, president of BRG, an outplacement firm, calls an all-too-common experience for educated middle-aged workers who have been laid off. They spend months trying to find a job at their old pay, or more, and finally accept a job at less pay, Mr. Glenn said, "but with optimism that this will lead to a recovery of their old responsibility and income level later on."
Mr. Veal, 53, is caught in this crisis. For years, life had gone well for him. He graduated from the University of Toronto in 1964 with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, and soon found work at Boeing in Seattle, designing jet-engine mounts for a new supersonic jet, the SST. When that work was canceled, Mr. Veal, earning $17,000, was laid off.
Certain that he could get another job whenever he wished, he invested his savings in a 36-foot sailboat and cruised along the west coast, eventually resettling in the Los Angeles area. He quickly got a job, at his old salary, designing aircraft parts for an electronics company, and in 1978 he doubled his wage, to $34,000, by shifting to the hydraulics division of the Textron Corporation. For 13 years, Mr. Veal worked on space shuttle units, steadily rising to manager of several development programs, at a salary of $63,000.
 
Job Hunt Lasts a Year
 And then during Christmas of 1991, he was laid off. "They went from 1,800 to 700," Mr. Veal said, and for the first time in his life, he went job hunting and did not find one. He hunted for a year. For a while he worked under contract designing machinery.
"I put out many, many resumes and I got few if any responses, and that scared me," Mr. Veal said. Finally, he went back to school, to learn how to design with computers, a skill held by many younger people who earned less pay than Mr. Veal sought. "In my aerospace work, I had people who had done the computer manipulation for me," he said.
 He graduated last June and landed a job as an engineer, with health insurance, at Malco, a division of Microdot Inc., a manufacturer of computer connectors. His pay is $45,000, not enough, he says, to put his two sons through college (the oldest dropped out after three years and the other never entered). To help pay his mortgage, Mr. Veal rents one of the four rooms in his house.
Despite these burdens, he is happy with the new job. "You betcha," he said. "I was used to driving 10 miles to work, and now I have to commute 44 miles. But I smile all the way."

HEADLINE: Florida Opens New Front in Fight on Immigrant Policy

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Arguing that the Federal Government should bear the costs of illegal immigration, the State of Florida has begun denying foster care to immigrant children who are in the state illegally.
Since the Mariel boatlift of 1980, Florida, recently joined by California, Texas and New York, has been fighting with the Government over the cost of welfare, education, health care, housing and prison for immigrants. Estimating that Florida spends at least $739 million a year on such services to immigrants and political refugees, Gov. Lawton Chiles announced in late December that he was suing the Government to recoup those costs and reduce the flow of illegal immigrants. 
 But the state's decision to deny foster care to undocumented immigrant children opens a new front in that battle with Washington. Legal and immigration experts say this move, made with little fanfare late last year, symbolizes a new aggressiveness on the part of state officials faced with tight budgets and an issue that seems to have broad political appeal.
The state basically argues that it has no legal obligation to children who have been abandoned in a foreign country and wind up here. In the past, policies about providing social services to illegal immigrants have widely varied among the states.
Mr. Chiles, a populist Democrat who is running this year for a second four-year term, and other state officials argue that the Federal Government's refusal to shoulder its responsibility has penalized the 13.5 million residents of the fourth-most populous state.
 
Two Recent Cases
 As a result of the new policy, a shelter here for abandoned children recently sent a Guatemalan teen-ager to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which then began deportation proceedings. A second teen-ager, who fled Haiti after his father was killed in political violence there, was refused admittance to the same state-supported shelter last month until a court intervened and ordered he be granted temporary protection.
"I'm administering a state program for 9,000 foster kids, and we can barely provide a standard of living for children who are citizens," said Jim Towey, Secretary of the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, the state's principal social welfare agency. "We don't like to say no to anybody, because that's not why you go into social work, but I'm not going to lie to the people of Florida and say we can keep on watering down the soup."
In the past, the Federal Government has limited access to some of its social programs to immigrants who are able to prove that they have legal status in the United States, though it is often impossible to exclude illegal immigrants from services like emergency medical care. Immigration and child welfare specialists said it was highly unusual for a state to impose so restrictive and sweeping an eligibility test on social services.
 
Trend Developing
 "This is emerging as a critical issue over the last several months, and Florida is first out of the gate and out in front on this one," said Dag Ryen, executive editor of State Government News, a publication of the Council of State Governments, a nonpartisan research group based in Lexington, Ky.
Among actions by other states, a new California law that goes into effect on Mar. 1 will require drivers applying for their first license in the state to show proof of lawful status.
The State of New York requires immigrants to present evidence of legal status when they apply for programs like welfare, day care and home health care, said Terrence McGrath, a spokesman for the Department of Social Services. But in New York City, where the vast majority of the state's illegal immigrants reside, an executive order in effect since 1989 has the practical effect, state officials say, of allowing city social workers simply not to ask questions about legal status.
Legal Services of Greater Miami Inc., a nonprofit organization here that provides legal assistance to the poor, filed suit last month seeking to overturn the state's policy. Lawyers representing the Haitian and Guatemalan teen-agers said that the state was acting illegally and that the youths had a Constitutional right to receive foster care and other social services.
Christina Zawisza, director of the Children First project at Legal Services of Greater Miami, said that since 1990 her organization handled, without incident until recently, the cases of more than 100 immigrant children in state custody who were seeking permanent legal residency through special juvenile visas. "Now, all of a sudden we get these cases, and they are balking," she said.
But lawyers for the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services contend in papers filed at state Circuit Court here that it is the Immigration and Naturalization Service, not the state of Florida, which "is required to assume full and complete responsibility for the care and custody of this child or any minor undocumented alien until or unless he is returned to his home country." They are also arguing that state courts have no jurisdiction over the issue; a hearing on the case is scheduled for Friday.
Groups like the National Association of Social Workers and the Child Welfare League quickly condemned it. "It's totally outrageous and does no good for anyone, neither the children involved nor the greater community," said Luisa Lopez, who handles immigration issues for the National Association of Social Workers.
 
Mixed Motives
 Mr. Towey, however, said the tough new approach was motivated by concerns as much humanitarian as economic. He said he had deep misgivings about the potential magnet effect in the Caribbean and Latin America of a court ruling that would force Florida to provide foster care to all youthful immigrants who arrive here illegally.
"This would send a signal to parents in Cuba, Haiti, Guatemala and elsewhere that there exists a new right to foster care and a better life for their kids," he said. "If these kids are assured foster care as well as the right to an education, I'm worried about what lives will be risked at sea."
Since the late 1980's, thousands of Cubans and Haitians have arrived here after dangerous sea journeys aboard makeshift rafts or rickety wooden boats. Most young people who have made that trip did so in the company of their parents, but cases of unaccompanied minors are not unusual.
The Haitian teen-ager in the case here, who turned 16 on Jan. 29, was put on a boat to Florida by his mother in October 1992 after a year of hiding from the Government forces that killed his father and spent time with other refugee families in motels and on the streets before seeking refuge at the shelter last month.
The Guatemalan youth, who is believed to be 17, has an even more difficult past, according to papers filed by his lawyers. He never knew his father, and after his mother was killed in a guerrilla attack when he was 7, he fled to El Salvador and then Mexico, relying on the charity of sympathetic adults until entering the United States around 1989.
"I don't want to see these kids out on the streets," Mr. Towey said. "But I'm not going to have one or two compelling cases define our policy. We can only care as much as the money we are given."

California May Sue U.S.
 SACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb. 10 (AP) -- Gov. Pete Wilson said today that he would sue if the Federal Government failed to give California $3.1 billion for services for illegal immigrants.
In an interview taped for CNN's "Moneyline," Mr. Wilson, a Republican, said he was bitterly disappointed that President Clinton's budget did not contain the money.
Without Federal help, Mr. Wilson said, California will be forced to cut services to legal residents to pay for education, emergency medical care and other services required under Federal law for illegal immigrants.

HEADLINE: Auditors Find Many Problems in Day Care Centers

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Federal investigators say they have found widespread problems with day care centers, raising doubts about whether states can adequately protect the safety and health of many poor children who will need such care under welfare reform proposals.
The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, found that states were cutting the budgets and enforcement personnel of state agencies that license and inspect day care centers even as the demand for such care surges. 
 The investigators focused on state-licensed day care centers, not on the informal care provided by neighbors and relatives.
In testimony prepared for a Congressional hearing on Friday, Joseph F. Delfico, a supervisor at the accounting office, said states were already having difficulty enforcing child care standards. He warned that these difficulties would increase under proposals that require welfare recipients to get jobs or pursue education and training. Such proposals have become popular in many states and are expected to be in President Clinton's welfare plan.
Many states, he said, do not perform the recommended inspections of day care centers and do not screen the employees of such centers to see if they have criminal records or a history of child abuse.
June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, reported the results of unannounced inspections at child care centers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Nevada and Wisconsin.
She said Federal auditors found inoperable or unflushed toilets, raw sewage in play areas, roach infestation, locked or blocked fire exits, broken glass and sharp knives. In addition, she said, some children had access to toxic chemicals, bug spray, antifreeze, medications and alcoholic beverages.
 
Uncorrected Deficiencies
 In some cases, Ms. Brown said, deficiencies went uncorrected after they were identified. For example, she said, in one state, 27 child care centers had "110 repeated violations of the same standards (fire code violations, unprotected chemicals, missing employee records, etc.)." Mr. Delfico said that in licensing the centers, 17 states did not conduct criminal background checks on the centers' employees, and 19 did not check child abuse registries.
In North Carolina, Ms. Brown said, Federal auditors from the Department of Health and Human Services found child care employees who had been arrested on charges of prostitution, theft and possession of illicit drugs. An employee of one child care center had been arrested 14 times in eight years, she said.
She will present her findings at the hearing, to be held by the House Small Business Subcommittee on Regulation and Business Opportunities. Representative Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee, said the deficiencies exposed children to unacceptable risks and "may jeopardize Clinton Administration efforts to move millions of welfare recipients into self-supporting jobs."
"There are already thousands and thousands of people waiting in line for subsidized child care slots," Mr. Wyden said in an interview today. "With welfare reform, hundreds of thousands of parents will move into the labor force and will need slots. In many states, there is virtually no oversight of child care.
"We don't need a Federal child care commissar," the Congressman said. "But when Federal money goes out, it's important for the Federal Government to work with states to make sure there is better supervision."
In testimony prepared for the hearing, William J. Tobin, director of government relations at Child Care America, a trade association, contended that "child care centers are overregulated" by state and local governments. "This often impedes their ability economically to survive as small businesses," he said.
 
Report Termed 'Tilted'
 Mr. Tobin also asserted that the inspector general's report was "tilted toward finding deficiencies" and was not based on a representative sample of child care centers.
In 1990, when Congress established a program of Federal grants for child care, there was extended debate over whether to set Federal standards for the quality of care. Those arguing for Federal standards, including the Children's Defense Fund, then led by Hillary Rodham Clinton, basically lost the debate.
As a result, states are almost exclusively responsible for regulating the quality of child care. They set and enforce standards for smoke detectors and fire extinguishers, food sanitation, the training of child care workers and the immunization of children against infectious diseases.
But Mr. Delfico of the General Accounting Office said states were "struggling with their responsibility to protect children" because of bigger caseloads and smaller budgets. In the last few years, he added, at least 18 states have reduced the frequency of inspections.
 
Rising Demand for Child Care
 There has been a steady increase in the demand for child care in the last two decades as the number of working women soared. Almost 12 million children under 13 years of age receive care in day care centers or the homes of relatives and friends, Mr. Delfico said.
Ms. Brown, the inspector general, said she and her staff had found unsafe conditions at 29 percent of the 134 centers they visited. In addition, she said, they found unsanitary conditions at 25 percent.
"A primary reason for these deficiencies is that the workloads for the child care inspectors are much too large," Ms. Brown said. In one state, she said, 41 inspectors had to monitor 6,565 day care centers, so each inspector was responsible for about 160 centers. State officials said this was five or six times the appropriate caseload, Ms. Brown reported.
In conclusion, Ms. Brown said, states have to step up the supervision of child care centers, conduct more frequent inspections, impose penalties for violations and perform background checks on everyone who holds or applies for jobs at such centers.

HEADLINE: A.T.& T. Cutting Up to 15,000 Jobs to Trim Costs

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

 BODY:
With long-distance telephone companies battling to capture customers and cut costs, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company said yesterday that it would cut as many as 15,000 jobs, or 15 percent of the work force, in its core long-distance business during the next two years.
Though A.T.& T. had been expected to embark on a series of layoffs, the cuts were bigger than many analysts had predicted. The move comes as the nation's biggest long-distance carrier continues to lose market share to MCI and Sprint, and the industry exploits new technologies to cut costs. 
 The new round of cuts is intended to reduce management in a bid to trim A.T.& T.'s bureaucracy. All the cuts are in the long-distance business, and about half of them will be in the management ranks. Roughly a third of the people to be laid off work in and around the company's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J.
"It's my clear conviction that we will not grow at the industry rate unless we are cost competitive," said Alex J. Mandl, the newly installed chief executive of A.T.& T.'s Communications Services Group. "We have not been cost competitive."
During the last year, the long-distance revenues of the company increased by only about 1.5 percent, compared with the industry average of nearly 5 percent. The company's earnings and profit margins have remained healthy, in part because A.T.& T. has raised some of its prices.
But the competitive pressure is expected to increase during the next several years, particularly if Congress passes legislation that permits the regional Bell companies to enter the long-distance market. And new technologies are allowing long-distance telephone companies to operate with fewer people.
The company said it would save $900 million a year when the cuts were completed, though it also announced last year that future reductions in its work force would cost about $200 million.
A.T.& T. has steadily cut more than 100,000 jobs since its monopoly over long-distance service was broken by the Federal Government 10 years ago, and it is cutting 6,000 telephone operators and 7,500 workers at NCR, its computer subsidiary. A.T.& T. employs 309,000 people, of which 96,500 work in the long-distance business. The remainder are in manufacturing, research and other businesses.
While many of the reductions will be through voluntary departures, with some workers being offered up to two years in wages as severance, company officials said they would also impose involuntary layoffs. Company executives said they would begin to notify the company's departments about pending layoffs by March 1, and individuals in April. The first departures are to take place in June and proceed over the following 18 months.
 
A Series of Moves
 The reductions mark the biggest move since Mr. Mandl and his team took control of the long-distance business last July. Since then, the company has dismissed the advertising agency Ayer Inc., which designed its disastrous "i plan" campaign, added a raft of new marketing people and tried to react more swiftly to new marketing salvos from MCI.
News of the latest cutbacks stung the workers and prompted a harsh attack by the union that represents long-distance employees. "Here's another example of a healthy company playing to Wall Street and looking for a quick cost-cutting fix," said James Irvine, vice president of the Communications Workers of America. "A.T.& T. wants to dump the people who not only built its enormous revenues last year, but who are the bedrock of future growth."
But Wall Street applauded the retrenchment as a healthy step toward controlling its costs.
"It's very positive," said Michael Elling, a telecommunications analyst for Oppenheimer & Company. "By cutting their costs aggressively, they can send a message to MCI and Sprint that we'll drop prices and still be profitable. It's really the threat that they have the margins to attack aggressively."
Mr. Elling said A.T.& T.'s long-distance revenues per employee had been almost flat since 1990, fluctuating between $100,000 and $110,000 for each worker. While that is higher than the revenues per worker of MCI and Sprint, Mr. Elling said that because of A.T.& T.'s huge scale economies, the number demonstated that A.T.& T. had not capitalized on the efficiencies of the newer technology.
Local and long-distance companies have been cutting tens of thousands of workers during the last several years. Only two months ago, the GTE Corporation, which owns small local telephone companies around the country, announced that it would cut 17,000 jobs. MCI is the only long-distance company that has not cut jobs, but two months ago it announced a $115 million restructuring charge that could be used to finance layoffs.
Frank Governali, a telecommunications analyst at the CS First Boston Corporation, said the retrenchment announced by A.T.& T. yesterday was only slightly bigger than what many experts had been expecting and would serve in large part to streamline the company.
"Over half of these jobs are white collar, and a big chunk of them are in New Jersey at the various headquarter locations," Mr. Governali said. "This is an effort to de-bureaucratize."
 
Finances Quite Healthy
 Unlike the huge layoffs at many other companies, A.T.& T.'s move comes at a time when its financial condition is quite healthy and most experts say the company is well positioned to profit from the emerging markets in advanced video and data services.
But the company's problem is that competition is expected to increase sharply before the end of the decade. Legislation moving rapidly through Congress would enable the regional Bell companies, each of which has enormous financial resources, to enter certain parts of the long-distance market within three years.
Meanwhile, A.T.& T. faces stiffer competition from huge new global alliances. MCI has teamed up with British Telecom, and Sprint is known to be searching for a big foreign partner. In Europe, France Telecom and Deutschebundespost have teamed up to provide global networking services to big corporate customers. More deals are almost certainly on the horizon.

HEADLINE: Playa Giron Journal;
At the Bay of Pigs, Tourists Storm the Beaches

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PLAYA GIRON, Cuba

 BODY:
Not far from the simple wood-frame home of Antinogenes Alvarez, one of this town's few remaining veterans of Cuba's defeat of the American-mounted Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, a fading billboard announces, "Welcome to the Site of the First Defeat of Imperialism in the Western Hemisphere."
"We only had a few arms, maybe 17 or 18 rifles," said the gravelly voiced 54-year-old veteran, who was dressed in an undershirt, olive-green fatigues and polished combat boots. "The mercenaries thought they had cleared the area by bombarding the shore before they landed, but we took cover and picked as many of them off as we could until the army came." 
 The rest was easy, Mr. Alvarez said, caressing his bronze medal of honor and puffing a filterless cigarette as he spoke. "Once our army got its defense mobilized, it was fast work," he said. "We had 20,000 soldiers on the ground the next day, with tanks and planes. There was no way we could lose."
The ranks of those who witnessed the first confrontation between the Kennedy Administration and the young Government of Fidel Castro are thinning, but the sleepy seaside town that Washington targeted for its invasion still serves as a sort of living museum of Cuba's testy relationship with its powerful neighbor. And the animosity between Cuba and the United States continues to shape the life of the town.
Soon after the attack, the town's valor was rewarded with several blocks of modern low-rise apartment buildings. Roads were improved and houses wired for electricity and telephones. There were also new schools, and for the first time adequate health care.
 
Castro Still Visits
 For years afterward, residents say, Mr. Castro would visit the area to fish, stopping to talk with the people, reinforcing their pride in having lived one of the most famous chapters of Cuban history.
The 66-year-old leader still comes to the area, residents say, but nowadays he confines himself to a secluded vacation spot clear across the broad coral-lined Bay of Pigs.
Hotel workers complain that the leader's attachment to the bay has led to a prohibition against boating in the surrounding waters, a measure taken for security. But the grumblers forget that the growth of the local hotel industry -- now by far the biggest employer -- is another spinoff of the town's history.
Even before the doomed attack by 1,500 Cuban exiles, Mr. Castro had planned for Playa Giron to be a "workers' resort," a place where exemplary state employees would be rewarded with beach vacations.
But as Cuba's integration into the Soviet bloc consolidated, the simple concrete bungalows put up along the beach here came to be used more to reward other kinds of workers: Russians, Czechs and others escaping the Eastern-bloc winters. The cachet of the town's history only reinforced the resort's appeal.
Nowadays, the only souvenirs remaining of this Eastern presence are the boxy Russian short-wave radios in each room, which were presumably used to keep up with the news on Radio Moscow. Hotel receptionists and bellboys practice their rusty French and English instead of Russian.
 
Westerners Now Come
 With the Soviet bloc gone, Playa Giron has been given over to Western tourists on a modest budget, the Canadians and Germans and French whose hard currencies have eased some of the town's seediness and have even given it a feeling of flushness.
Although Americans are not forbidden to travel to Cuba, Treasury Department regulations that were imposed as part of a 33-year-old United States embargo of the island prohibit most Americans from spending money in this country, thus restricting travel.
With hard-currency tips to be earned and other revenue flowing in, from the prostitutes who dance with tourists during the hotel's salsa act each night to the handicraft vendors, the town seems free of much of the grind that permeates life in Havana.
"This was the most backward area of the country before the revolution," said Miguel Beltran, a 20-year-old student and one of several residents who stopped to speak to a foreign visitor. "We have something to show for our efforts at least."
Despite this positive outlook, the standard of living of Western tourists and the privileges accorded them have brought new resentments here, as they have elsewhere in Cuba.
"If a foreigner dies in an accident with us, it's at least two years of prison, automatically," a hotel worker said, laughing wryly at an example he gave of how a strapped Government's quest for dollars had subverted its values. "If a Cuban dies, nothing happens. Zero."
 
Pondering the Embargo
 But if the residents feel some resentment toward the tourists, many also scratch their heads over how the bitterness between Cuba and the United States has somehow managed to outlive the cold war. Even with their history, they think it is time to end the embargo.
"With our Soviet partners, we became used to having a little of everything," said Boris Daniel, a 22-year-old engineering student. "Eighty percent of our trade was with the socialist bloc. We need new partners and yet the Americans continue to squeeze us."
Ramon Lopez, a 32-year-old economist who was riding in a horse-drawn carriage, a popular mode of transportation because of the shortage of gasoline, said: "We are trying to build lives for ourselves, but all this time we have been blockaded. We have never hurt your country and we don't understand why."

Inflation Worries Help Lift Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rates rose yesterday after the Treasury's auction of 30-year bonds, as traders became increasingly concerned that today's producer price report would show a significant jump in inflation.
Analysts at MMS International are forecasting a five-tenths of 1 percent increase in the Producer Price Index for January, its largest monthly jump since last April. Excluding food and energy, MMS expects a jump of three-tenths of 1 percent. The analysts expect a rise of more than 1 percent in passenger car prices and unfavorable seasonal factors to contibute to the jump in the index. 
 An increase of this magnitude could touch off selling, traders said, because it will raise the clear possibility that the Federal Reserve might move again soon to raise short-term interest rates to curb both growth and inflation. The Fed raised short-term interest rates for the first time in five years last Friday.
"The problem is that in the modern era and with few exceptions, the Fed has never tightened only once," one trader said.
The 30-year bond auction was the last leg of this week's quarterly sale of debt securities by the Treasury. There will not be another 30-year bond auction for six months.
Instead of selling a new 30-year bond, the Treasury sold more of the current 6.25 percent bond, which matures in August 2023, because many analysts had noted that the small supply of the bond was creating price distortions.
The new bond was sold at auction at an average price of 97.633, to yield 6.43 percent, but by late in the day, in when-issued trading, the yield of the auction issue was bumped up to 6.45. This is often a sign that dealers are finding few buyers for the issue and, have cut the price to increase the yield to a more attractive level.
Peter Hirsch, a managing director and head of the government trading desk at Salomon Brothers, thought the issue was aggressively priced and relatively expensive compared with bond futures and 10-year notes. But he said that that "the aggressive bidding can't be taken as a bullish sign for the market." He added, "As soon as investors made a few basis points, they hit the road."
 
Value in 30-Year Bonds
 Mr. Hirsch said there was much better value in the older 30-year bonds that were issued three or four quarters ago. "Why would anyone pay a premium for a 30-year bond, when they can buy shorter maturities only 15 basis points cheaper?" he asked.
Out in the cash market the existing 6 1/4 percent 30-year bond due 2023 was down a half-point, to 97 1/2, for a yield 6.44 percent, up from the 6.41 percent the previous day. The 10-year note was down9/32 , to yield 5.92 percent, in trading yesterday, while shorter-maturity bill rates were up a couple of basis points, with a three-month maturity at 3.25 percent and a six-month at 3.39 percent.
Relative to the shorter maturities, there are some analysts who believe the longer-maturity issues give investors greater value simply because of the Federal Reserve's tough stance on inflation.
Market analysts noted some improvement in market sentiment in early trading as dealers squared positions ahead of the bond auction, with several analysts citing Wednesday's good results in the 10-year note sale as a factor.
There was little response to an expected decline in the initial jobless claims data. For the week ended Feb. 5, the Government said jobless claims fell to 366,000, from 413,000 in the previous week. Given the recent volatility in the weekly jobless claims numbers, analysts were reluctant to read too much into the report.

Times Co. Reports Loss in Quarter Despite Operating Gain

BYLINE: By JOSHUA MILLS 

 BODY:
The New York Times Company reported improved operating earnings for the fourth quarter and all of 1993 yesterday but said a reduction in the value of its forest products operations and the expected cost of a planned staff reduction at The New York Times newspaper resulted in a net loss for the quarter.
The company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $24.1 million, or 23 cents a share, compared with a loss of $3.7 million, or 5 cents a share, in the final quarter of 1992. 
 For the year, the company reported net income of $6.1 million, or 7 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $44.7 million, or 57 cents a share, in 1992. The results for both years reflected a number of special factors.
Excluding the special factors, the company said, earnings for the year would have been 93 cents a share, up 40.9 percent from 66 cents a share in 1992. For the quarter, earnings would have been 38 cents, up 90 percent from 20 cents a year earlier.
 
Revenues Increase
 Revenues for the year rose 14.1 percent, to $2.02 billion, and for the quarter 35.8 percent, to $636 million, largely reflecting the acquisition of The Boston Globe in October. The company did not detail The Globe's contribution to revenues and profits.
The Times Company issued 36.4 million class A shares in its acquisition of The Boston Globe on Oct. 1 and bought back 10.3 million shares in the second half of the year.
The earnings announced yesterday exceeded estimates that the Times Company made public on Dec. 6. The gain, the company said in a statement, came from stronger operations at its newspaper group and a lower-than-anticipated tax rate because the company was able to reduce its liability by carrying forward tax losses from previous periods.
The earnings were announced after stock markets closed yesterday. Earlier, the Times Company's shares ended at $26.25, down 37.5 cents, on the American Stock Exchange.
 
Advertising Linage Up
 Advertising linage at The New York Times increased 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter, and 1 percent for the year, the company said. At The Boston Globe, the gains were a more impressive 9.7 percent for the quarter and 4 percent for the year.
The newspapers' circulation was little changed from 1992, with The Times selling an average of 1.2 million copies on weekdays and 1.8 million on Sundays and The Globe 504,600 on weekdays and 814,500 on Sundays.
Among the company's 30 smaller newspapers, advertising rose 3.8 percent for the quarter and 3.9 percent for the year, primarily because of an increase in advertising inserts, the company said.
At the Times Company's magazine group, which produces 21 magazines, operating profit more than doubled, to $4.9 million, in the fourth quarter and rose 24.2 percent, to $12.3 million, for the year. The company said weak advertising for consumer packaged goods hurt its women's magazines.
At the broadcast/information services group, operating profit rose 41.5 percent, to $5.8 million, for the quarter and 31.1 percent, to $19.4 million, for the year. Higher local advertising revenues at the company's five television stations accounted for the gains, the company said. The broadcast group also operates WQXR-FM and WQEW-AM in New York; the information services group includes The New York Times News Service, The Times Syndicate and TimesFax.
 
$47 Million Charge Taken
 The forest products group lost $47 million in the quarter and $51.9 million in the year, after a special charge of $47 million in the 1993 fourth quarter. Without the charge, equity in operations would have been even in the quarter, compared with a loss of $2.5 million in 1992; for the year the loss would have been $4.9 million in 1993, down from a loss of $8.7 million in 1992. The charge reflected a writedown of the company's investment based on current market conditions.
These were other factors that affected 1993 earnings:
*A $30 million pretax charge to cover severance and related costs from planned white-collar staff reductions at The New York Times.
*A $5.4 million pretax charge to cover severance and related costs from voluntary early retirements in The Times's composing room.
*A $5.6 million tax expense because a change in Federal taxes increased the corporate income tax rate by one percentage point, to 35 percent, retroactively to Jan. 1, 1993.
*A $3.7 million adjustment in advertising and circulation rates after last March's huge snowstorm disrupted deliveries of The Times.

Exclusive of the write-down, equity in operations of the Forest Products Group for the latest periods was break-even in the fourth quarter, and a loss of $4.9 million for the year.
The 1993 year also included tax expense of $5.6 million, or 7 cents a share, of which $600,000 was related to the Forest Products Group, because of new legislation, which increased the Federal corporate income tax rate to 35 percent from 34 percent retroactively to Jan. 1, 1993; it affected the deductibility of certain costs and caused the company to remeasure its year-end 1992 deferred tax balances to reflect the higher tax rate.

The period also included a pretax loss of $53.8 million, or 47 cents a share, due to the closing of The Gwinnett (Ga.) Daily News, the sale of its residual assets and its 1992 operations.
d-Included equity in operations of the Forest Products Group, which showed losses of $2.5 million forthe quarter and $8.7 million in 1992.
Latest periods also included pretax charges of $35.4 million, or 19 cents a share, for the quarter and 23 cents a share, for the year, for white-collar and composing room staff reductions. Year-ago periods included a pretax charge of $28 million, or 20 cents a share, for a voluntary union termination program at The New York Times newspaper.
Latest periods included a pretax gain of $2.6 million, or 2 cents a share, on the sale of assets. The latest year included $3.7 million pretax, or 2 cents a share, in unfavorable advertising and circulation rate adjustments at The Times due to the March 1993 snowstorm.
Year-ago periods included $7.6 million, or 5 cents a share, pretax, for the quarter and $10.4 million, or 7 cents a share, pretax, in the year, for training and start-up costs related to The Times's new production and distribution facility in Edison, N.J. The year also included $11 million, or 8 cents a share, pretax, for labor disruptions by The Times's drivers' union.
The 1992 year also included a $1.5 million, or 1 cent a share, pretax gain on the sale of real estate, and a pretax gain of $1.6 million, or 1 cent a share, on the sale of a corporate asset.
Latest periods' shares outstanding differ because of the issuance of 36.4 million shares of class A common stock in connection with the Oct. 1, 1993, acquisition of The Boston Globe and the repurchase of 10.3 million shares of class A common stock during the second half of 1993.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
G.M. Posts $2.47 Billion Profit for '93

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 10

 BODY:
With demand for cars and trucks growing as its own costs shrink, the General Motors Corporation today reported profits of $2.47 billion for 1993. The company's reviving North American operations posted their first profitable quarter since 1989.
For the three months that ended in December, G.M. said it earned $1.18 billion, or $1.28 a share of common stock. In the quarter a year earlier, G.M. had a $651.8 million net loss. For the quarter, sales totaled $37.27 billion, up from $35.55 billion in 1992. 
For the year, G.M.'s profit equaled $2.13 a share. In 1992, G.M. reported the largest loss in corporate American history: $23.5 billion, or $38.28 a share. That loss reflected a one-time charge of $20.72 billion for the future cost of retiree health benefits.
 
 
 
Investors Disappointed
 Worldwide in 1993, G.M.'s revenue grew 4.5 percent, to $138.22 billion.
G.M.'s announcement, which came before the markets opened, touched off an avalanche of sales of G.M. stock; analysts attributed the selling to profit taking and to investors' disappointment with the company's profits. In heavy trading, the stock closed at $62.50 a share, down $1.75.
In part, analysts said, G.M. -- like the Ford Motor Company, whose stock has slipped since its earnings report on Wednesday -- was a victim of the Chrysler Corporation's success. Three weeks ago, Chrysler reported record earnings for the fourth quarter, surpassing all expectations and inflating investor hopes for the other Big Three reports.
In addition, some investors were anxious about one-time effects on G.M.'s earnings. The quarterly results were depressed by a loss of $189.5 million taken by G.M. on the sale of its Allison Gas Turbine division. But analysts attributed investors' disappointment to a large tax credit that bolstered G.M.'s earnings in the fourth quarter. At the beginning of the year, G.M. overestimated its tax liability for 1993; its adjustment added more than $400 million, or 65 cents a share, to the quarterly bottom line.
 
 
 
'Fundamental Improvement'
 "It's kind of sad, because all people want to know is, 'What's this tax thing, again?"' Jack Kirnan, the auto industry analyst with Salomon Brothers, said. Because of that fixation, he said, investors ignored the real news in the earnings report. "You've still got massive, fundamental improvement," he said.
Phil Fricke, the automotive analyst for Prudential Securities, said, "What this fourth quarter and full year tell me is that the company's effort to build a competitive automotive operation in North America is working, big time."
 G.M.'s North American operations lost $17 billion from 1990 to 1993, leading to a board room putsch more than a year ago. Since taking over as president and chief executive in late 1992, John F. Smith Jr. has been working to cut the cost of materials in North America, reduce the variety of parts in G.M. vehicles and increase the productivity of G.M.'s 262,000 hourly workers.
 
 
 
Profit in North America
 G.M.'s changes are occurring as demand for cars and trucks is growing and a strong Japanese yen is driving up Japanese car prices. As a result, G.M. bettered Mr. Smith's goal for 1993 of breaking even in North America -- before interest, taxes and other charges. On that modest basis, G.M. reported that it made $362 million in North America for the year.
But G.M. was also profitable in North America in the fourth quarter on a net-income basis. Even with the tax adjustment factored out, the North American operations cleared a net profit of $75 million in the quarter.
For 1994, Mr. Smith has set a "no excuses" goal of breaking even in North America on a net-income basis.
Although its sales grew during 1993 in the expanding United States market, G.M.'s share of that market continued its slide. In 1993, it held 33.2 percent of the total car and light- truck market, down from 33.9 percent a year ago. Ten years ago, G.M. held more than 40 percent.
G.M.'s unfinanced pension liability -- the amount the company has failed to set aside to cover future retirees' pensions -- ballooned in 1993. From $14 billion in 1992, it grew to $22.3 billion, despite G.M. contributions of $4.4 billion. But the final tally was less than the $24 billion G.M. had predicted, a result the company attributed to good portfolio management.
G.M. is awaiting Federal approval of a plan to contribute to the fund 185 million shares of stock in a subsidiary, Electronic Data Systems. The company's stated goal is to finance the plan fully by the year 2000.
 
 
 
A Surprise on Health Costs
 One surprise in today's report was that G.M.'s health care costs, after regularly leaping upward in recent years, held steady at $5.6 billion in 1993. "It's the first time we've been flat in, like, the history of mankind," said G. Richard Wagoner, the executive vice president who is G.M.'s finance and purchasing chief.
In fact, costs climbed about 5 percent, compared with a 13.1 percent increase from 1991 to 1992, but because the number of covered employees and dependents shrank, the net result was the same dollar cost as in 1992. Mr. Wagoner attributed the low inflation rate to G.M.'s growing reliance on plans that encourage workers to pick less expensive health care.
G.M. was the last of the Big Three auto makers to report fourth-quarter earnings. On Wednesday, Ford said it earned $719 million in the quarter, and last month Chrysler reported quarterly earnings of $777 million.
G.M. also reported today that it lowered cash rebates for its vehicles as demand rose, to $880 a vehicle last year from an average of $960 a vehicle in the fourth quarter of 1992.
Mr. Wagoner also said G.M. workers increased their productivity by more than 10 percent in the year, measured in labor hours per vehicles. He declined to say how many hours G.M. takes to build a car.

HEADLINE: Claims Fall For Jobless

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for state jobless benefits fell last week by 47,000, to 366,000, almost erasing the large jump after the California earthquake, the Government said today.
 The sharp drop in first-time claims for the week that ended last Saturday was the largest in more than five months, the Labor Department said. 
 New claims had surged 50,000, to 413,000, the prior week, with about 20 percent of the increase attributed to Californians seeking state unemployment benefits, the department said.
 That jump helped push the closely watched average level of claims over the last four weeks to 377,250, its highest level in more than 15 months. The four-week average was up from 375,000 the prior week and compared with 378,750 in the Oct. 17, 1992, week.
 But analysts said the claims level now appears to be stabilizing after unusual disruptions -- freezing weather and natural disaster -- in January. They had forecast 371,000 new state claims in the week that ended last Saturday.
 In addition to the new state claims, 6,010 people made first-time claims for Federal emergency benefits, which help people who have exhausted their regular benefits, in the week ended Jan. 29, the latest period for which those data are available. That was down from 7,615 emergency claims the previous week. Unlike the state data, the Federal figures are not seasonally adjusted.
 The department said the drop in initial claims last week was the largest since a 56,000 decline in the July 31, 1993, week.

HEADLINE: Review/Design;
Stylish Persuaders For Modern Times

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
LIKE the recent "Frontline" documentary on diamonds, the new show at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum tackles the subject of consumer manipulation. The "Frontline" program recounted how the South African diamond cartel conspired with advertisers to maintain high prices by creating the illusion that diamonds were rare. "Packaging the New," which opened this week at the Cooper-Hewitt, traces the history of an esthetic cartel -- industrial design -- and the mythology devised by designers to enlarge the market for furnishings, appliances and other household goods.
Focusing on the work of six noted American designers, the show traces a 50-year period beginning in the mid-1920's, when industrial design became an organized profession, and culminating in the mid-1970's, when the oil crisis and environmental degradation prompted widespread disillusion with the industrial juggernaut. Donald Deskey, Russel Wright, Norman Bel Geddes, Raymond Loewy, Walter Dorwin Teague and Henry Dreyfuss: those were the cream of the industrial-design profession. They set a machine-age stamp on everything from cocktail shakers to detergent boxes, airplanes to prefabricated housing, fabrics to World's Fair previews of an utterly transformed world. 
 The message sent forth by these designers was the antithesis of "diamonds are forever." What they said, more or less, is that "design is for the moment." Yesterday's chair, table or refrigerator was obsolete. Happiness awaited purchasers of the very latest style. Together with advertising men like Earnest Elmo Calkins, the designers introduced what the show's curator, Gail S. Davidson, calls "style obsolescence." Unlike planned obsolescence, which insured that an appliance would fall apart in a few years, style obsolesence guaranteed that its esthetic appeal would disintegrate with the arrival of the next streamlined style. The goal of this enterprise, to judge from this show, was only incidentally esthetic. The main objective was to stimulate the American economy by enticing American consumers to buy things they didn't know they wanted.
Organized chronologically by decades, the show is prefaced by a recreated store window designed in 1929 by Henry Dreyfuss for Saks & Company. The display, featuring a smart Molyneux outfit accented by a folding Deskey screen, announces the show's view of industrial design as something theatrical, something not far removed from fashion (and perhaps indistinguishable from it), and, above all, as something created chiefly to seduce onlookers to buy.
Fortunately for the museumgoer, most of the 200 or so objects on view have not lost their allure, decades after its intended obsolescence. For fans of Art Deco, 40's streamlining and the 50's style alternately known as "populuxe" or "googie," the show offers a filling visual binge. Though one need not venture this far uptown to enjoy Deskey's sumptuous interiors at Radio City Music Hall, the show sets out the impressively wide range of Deskey's work, from a gorgeous ebony chest of drawers from the 1930's to the cobra-head streetlight Deskey designed for New York in 1958. Deskey's design for a communications pavilion at the 1939 World's Fair, far from looking obsolete, is actually prophetic. More than half a century before "Late Night With Conan O'Brien," Deskey envisioned modern man as a gigantic, transparent plastic talking head.
Constantin Boym has designed the show's installation with economy and humor, arranging objects into period theme tableaux, like "Cocktails" in the 1930's, "Supermarket" shopping in the 50's and a 60's "Recreation Room." One witty section converts the museum's conservatory into a stretch of landscaped "parkway" connecting the 40's to the 50's. Dominated by a large photograph of Deskey's streetlight fixture, houseplants nestle at the base of magazine ads enlarged to resemble billboards. The display ushers in the postwar exodus to suburbia and the promised land of consumer products after years of wartime scarcity. There, all is Cheer, Joy and Micrin mouthwash, each handsomely packaged by Deskey.
Though much of the show is a cavalcade of relatively familiar period icons, there are nice surprises along the way. The chaste modernity of Ilonka Karasz's silverplated tableware (circa 1928) transcends the merely moderne. Richard Arbib's Musaphonic radio (1958) and Visonette television (1947), and David Chapman's mixer and blender (circa 1960) have the spiky, swollen glamour of erotic fetishes. For Valentine's Day, you will definitely want to give or get one of Kodak's folding "Coquette" cameras, designed by Walter Dorwin Teague to resemble a lady's compact. A concluding tableau, which Dr. Davidson calls the Hall of Obsolescence, mounts a hysterical fashion show of toasters. It sums up the show's message that while consumer products underwent dramatic changes in appearance, their inner workings often remained unchanged.
Needless to say, the show's somewhat jaundiced view of industrial design does not entirely conform to the profession's view of itself. And while it is commendable that Cooper-Hewitt should take a more critical look at its subject matter, there is something fundamentally misguided about the show's reduction of industrial design to a matter of style. It has resulted in a treatment of its subject that, in its own sour way, is as insubstantial as the froth from a Bel Geddes cocktail shaker.
Is it true, for instance, that styling in the 20th century has taken such overbearing precedence to technological innovation? While toasters may not have advanced technically, many things did. My father, a mechanical engineer who worked with Dreyfuss on Honeywell's ubiquitous round thermostat control, helped develop a device that made homes more comfortable. Dreyfuss made the device more attractive. Similar advances in lighting, food preparation, transportation, communication and, yes, fashion could not have occurred without the support of the marketplace. Design was a good way to muster that support.
Moreover, the willingness of consumers to be manipulated is not boundless, as American car manufacturers discovered to their chagrin in the 1970's and 80's. In those years, manufacturers put just as much effort as ever into "packaging the new." But their efforts went nowhere until they came up with designs that were not only new but corresponded to the consumer's view of contemporary life. The minivan, for example, is ideally suited to a time of breakdown in the distinction between "town" and "country."
Surely, many of the objects displayed at Cooper-Hewitt were successful because they connected consumers to the industrial age. Does the show mean to suggest that the Industrial Revolution was more hype than history? Or that the mass public, which was partly created by that revolution, had no business getting a kick out of it?
The concept of progress is not exactly something cooked up by advertisers, either. It was an Enlightenment tenet that industry would advance the cause of freedom because it would shift the balance of power away from palace and church toward natural law. Modernism was not the first movement to seek a design vocabulary to express this social ideal. Neo-Classicism, Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau also employed formal means to create something idealistic from the realities of industrial production.
While I myself enjoy the delirious form-making made possible by the industrial designer's tactic of "creative waste" (and I suspect Dr. Davidson does, too), Cooper-Hewitt is surely right to challenge it. But the show's equation between novelty and waste overlooks the fact that "packaging the old" is also a form of waste, and not a very creative one at that. And it's a form we see all around us now.
Today, for example, Deskey's streetlight is being systematically removed from New York City streets and replaced with facsimiles of old cast-iron lampposts. It is a typical expression of our current widespread yearning for the stability of tradition. Such reproductions may give people the illusion that they are showing respect for history, when in fact, as the architecture critic Alan Colquhoun has observed, they are simply indulging a taste for "pastness." Often, as in trashing the epoch that produced Deskey's lamps, they are indulging it at the expense of history. In assailing the new, "Packaging the New" may end up unintentionally fueling an appetite that is no less wasteful, and is arguably more deceptive, than the one it is trying to challenge.
In fact, it might well fuel the same syndrome it wants to challenge. As Mr. Colquhoun observed, "newness" and "oldness" are not so much opposites as complements. They're two poles in the same search for cultural identity, a quest that has been going on since the 18th century, when the public assumed from traditional authorities the task of self-definition. If we want to get off of this shuttle (and maybe we don't), discrediting the new isn't the way to go about it. What we need to think about is the way newness and oldness feed off each other in an endless cycle of taste.
"Packaging the New" remains at the Cooper-Hewitt National Museum of Design, 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, through Aug. 14.

By James William Gibson
357 pages. Hill & Wang. $23.
With the involvement (and withdrawal) of American forces in Vietnam, the old ideals of movie machismo underwent a violent sea change. The old gunslinger ballads gave way to bloodier and more morally ambiguous sagas (movies like"Shane" were replaced by movies like "The Wild Bunch"), and then in the mid-1970's, the genre of the western itself seemed ready to fade away and die. Meanwhile, however, a new brand of movie hero began to make his way to the screen: Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry, a renegade cop willing to break all the rules; Charles Bronson's one-man vigilante team in "Death Wish" (and "Death Wish 2," "3" and "4") and, of course, Sylvester Stallone's pumped-up ex-Green Beret, John Rambo. 
 The immense popularity of such heroes, the scholar James William Gibson argues in his new book "Warrior Dreams," both represented and galvanized the emergence of a highly energized new paramilitary culture that offered its aficionados an escape from the social, political and economic confusions of post-Vietnam America.
"It is hardly surprising, then," writes Mr. Gibson, "that American men -- lacking confidence in the government and the economy, troubled by the changing relations between the sexes, uncertain of their identity or their future -- began to dream, to fantasize about the powers and features of another kind of man who could retake and reorder the world. And the hero of all these dreams was the paramilitary warrior. In the New War he fights the battles of Vietnam a thousand times, each time winning decisively. Terrorists and drug dealers are blasted into oblivion. Illegal aliens inside the United States and the hordes of nonwhites in the third world are returned by force to their proper place. Women are revealed as dangerous temptresses who have to be mastered, avoided, or terminated."
In the course of amplifying this thesis, Mr. Gibson, who teaches sociology and history at California State University in Long Beach, pelts the reader with lots of information. He notes the rise of the "techno-thriller" -- exemplified by Tom Clancy's noisy, clattering novels -- and an increase in warrior magazines like Soldier of Fortune. He documents the escalating sales of military weapons like the Uzi and the AK-47, and chronicles the growing popularity of combat schools and firing ranges.
Substantial portions of this volume are devoted to descriptions of a Soldier of Fortune convention, a course in shooting combat pistols and a war-game retreat, where men use paint-ball guns to play at killing one another.
As Mr. Gibson sees it, such warrior fantasies began to seep dangerously into real life during the 1970's and 80's, as "the line between doers and wannabe's often blurred." Paramilitary zealots placed ads in Soldier of Fortune to hire themselves out as mercenaries and hit men; the head of a neo-Nazi group, in search of recruits to his cause, bought the magazine's mailing list. In the 1980's, Mr. Gibson reports, right-wing extremist groups like the Order (which plotted the assassination of the radio announcer Alan Berg in Colorado), began a stepped-up campaign of racist violence.
The same decade, he adds, also witnessed the emergence of psychotic killers who saw themselves as warriors, including James Oliver Huberty, who in 1984 opened fire in a McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro, Calif., killing 21 and wounding 19; and Patrick Purdy, who used an AK-47 in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard in 1989 to gun down 5 Southeast Asian children and wound 29 others.
It is Mr. Gibson's contention that American warrior mythology had reverberations on a governmental level as well. Ronald Reagan's Star Wars rhetoric, the invasion of Grenada, covert support of the contras in Central America, Oliver North's theatrics, the invasion of Panama and the Persian Gulf war: all, Mr. Gibson suggests, can be viewed through the lens of America's "post-Vietnam warrior culture."
Although Mr. Gibson lays out his arguments in energetic, readable prose and displays a keen reportorial eye for events he has witnessed, his overall analysis often feels simplistic, derivative and lacking in historical perspective. He fails to situate the new paramilitary ethos of the warrior fully in relationship to America's violent history and its historical faith in the redemptive possibilities of violence. He makes only passing references to the groundbreaking work of the historian Richard Slotkin, but at the same time takes many of his central ideas from Mr. Slotkin's monumental three-volume work on the frontier myth ("Regeneration Through Violence," "The Fatal Environment" and "Gunfighter Nation"). In many cases, Mr. Gibson simply extrapolates Mr. Slotkin's observations to the contemporary American scene, sometimes adding small editorial asides of his own.
These asides tend to be highly subjective, and poorly grounded in factual analysis. Mr. Gibson offhandedly dismisses the gun-control debate, for instance, as "the worst kind of fetishism, in which focusing on a part of the dreadful reality of the decade -- combat weapons -- became a substitute for confronting what America had become."
What are Mr. Gibson's own recommendations for reducing the appeal of warrior mythologies and making America a kinder, gentler place? Well, he suggests that adventure sports (mountain climbing, scuba diving) might provide men with a healthy outlet for their warrior impulses, and that increased male participation in child-rearing might help men to become "more emotionally expressive and less psychologically distant."
Such casually tossed-off suggestions hardly seem like the answer to the culture of violence delineated in these pages, and they ultimately trivialize the very subject Mr. Gibson has labored so hard to explicate in "Warrior Dreams."

HEADLINE: Who Is Running Our Korea Policy?

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration insists it will never subcontract its foreign policy to any international institution. Yet it is doing just that in its nuclear diplomacy with North Korea. It is letting the International Atomic Energy Agency decide how to carry out a deal Washington reached with Pyongyang. By changing the terms of that deal, the I.A.E.A. could embroil the U.S. in a dangerous confrontation on the Korean Peninsula.
The I.A.E.A. is supposed to be negotiating detailed arrangements for inspections at all North Korea's declared nuclear sites. These inspections are designed to insure that nuclear safeguards are in place. More thorough regular inspections, which could impede the diversion of nuclear material to bomb-making, would not resume until the U.S. holds a new round of high-level talks with the North. Inspections of suspected nuclear waste sites to determine whether such diversion has already occurred have yet to be negotiated. 
 But the I.A.E.A., which does not like to see member states trifle with its procedures, is asking for more intrusive access to a reactor site than the North agreed to with Washington, according to Pyongyang. The U.S. now needs to try to break the deadlock between North Korea and the I.A.E.A. before the I.A.E.A. refers the matter to the United Nations Security Council, which has the power to impose economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
The danger is that the drumbeat of war may drown out diplomacy. The Administration is considering the dispatch of Patriot missiles and other military forces to shore up the South. And members of Congress have, perversely, called for putting nuclear arms back into South Korea. Ratcheting up the threats may appease the hawks at home, but it bolsters hard-liners in North Korea, who could use such threats to justify proceeding with the development of nuclear weapons.
Reinforcing the South makes sense if and when the U.S. decides to abandon diplomacy and press for economic sanctions. Such sanctions would likely end all hope of inspecting North Korea's nuclear sites and could lead to the resumption of confrontation in Korea. Given Pyongyang's unpredictability, reinforcements would then be prudent.
But it is premature to be taking such steps now. The U.S. should be doing what it can diplomatically to gain unimpeded access to North Korea's nuclear sites, step by grudging step. And it should not leave it up to the I.A.E.A. to overreach and thereby trigger a confrontation with North Korea.

HEADLINE: Players and Payers

SERIES: SECOND OPINIONS: HEALTH CARE -- An occasional series

BYLINE: By Michael Graetz and James Tobin; Michael Graetz, professor of law at Yale, was Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury from 1990 to 1992. James Tobin, emeritus professor of economics at Yale, won the Nobel Prize in Economic Science in 1981.

 BODY:
The President and First Lady have achieved remarkable consensus on a truly revolutionary principle: all Americans must be entitled to adequate medical services without regard to ability to pay or risk of ill health. Now it's up to Congress to embody that principle in law, a historic opportunity comparable to the enactments of Social Security in 1935 and Medicare in 1965.
Unfortunately, excessive solicitude for existing institutions and interests, and the difficulties of reconciling them with the Clintons' fundamental principles, have made their proposal a bureaucratic and legalistic morass. 
 The issue is much more basic than what is now preoccupying Washington: whether the reforms would modestly raise the Federal deficit in the short term, as the Congressional Budget Office said this week, and whether federally mandated insurance premiums should be "on budget." The biggest flaw in the Administration proposal is the requirement that employers pay the premiums -- a mandate whose awkwardness and unfairness stand out starkly in a system dedicated to universal coverage.
Employer-based medical insurance is a historical accident -- one that no one would choose now if given a clean slate. During World War II, trade unions and employers circumvented Federal wage ceilings by offering medical fringe benefits. Their popularity and generosity boomed after the war, as Congress sheltered them without limit from income and Social Security taxes.
The fact that employers write the checks for medical care does not mean that they bear the full costs. They can generally shift some costs to workers in reduced take-home pay and some to customers in higher prices. The sure losers are taxpayers who have to make up the revenue lost to the tax shelter.
Much of the Administration's 1,342-page proposal is devoted to expedients intended to mitigate the difficulties and anomalies of employer mandates. It's a hopeless task. Some families have no employed members. Some have two or more. Many employees work part time. Some have more than one job. Americans frequently change jobs, employers, work locations, places -- even states -- of residence.
Responsibilities for paying a family's premiums would frequently be divided among several sources -- various employers, governments and the family itself -- in proportions varying month to month. Keeping track of these liabilities would surely involve extensive paperwork and administrative hassle, contrary to Mrs. Clinton's claim that an employer mandate eliminates the need to track individuals.
Nor would the new system be equitable. Equity demands that public subsidies, direct or via employers, be a larger share of premiums and of income the poorer the family. Equity also requires that families' subsidies be the same if their incomes are the same. But in the Clinton plan, subsidies depend more on the size of employers' payrolls than on families' ability to pay. The system is also full of bad incentives -- for example, not to hire workers with dependents.
It's individuals who get sick and need medical services. It's individuals and families whose ability to pay is the natural criterion of equity. It's individuals who must be guaranteed coverage. So it is it's individuals who must be required to have insurance. Let employers help pay the premiums if they wish, but count those payments as taxable income. Treat the self-employed exactly the same as employees.
Let people choose where they will buy insurance. One option should be a kind of Medicare for those under 65; call it perhaps Fedmed.
Fedmed would offer the basic universal medical insurance package at premiums that in total would cover the costs. Let private health plans offer the same package, provided they do not pick and choose members or charge higher premiums for risky cases. As in the Clinton plan, it would probably be necessary to collect money from plans that happen to have low-risk clienteles and distribute them to plans with high-risk members.
With these provisions, Fedmed would be protected against becoming the last-resort insurer of bad risks. As in Medicare itself (which would continue as at present), people could choose their own physicians and other providers. Like Medicare, Fedmed would have low administrative costs and would wield enough clout to limit payments to providers. Like Medicare, Fedmed would let people change employment status, residence or family situation without losing coverage. But it need not be a monopoly.
Federal subsidies to individuals would take the form of refundable tax credits, "vouchers" payable to Fedmed or other insurers. For low-income families the subsidies would cover the whole premium of the basic package; most other families would receive vouchers at least as valuable to them as the current tax exemption for employer-provided insurance.
A family of four in the 28 percent tax bracket with a $4,300 insurance package would receive vouchers of $1,204 -- 28 percent of the premium. No family would face an out-of-pocket cost of more than 8 or 10 percent of their income for the basic package.
This plan would not require new broad-based taxes or new burdens on employers. One source of financing would be redirecting the Clintons' proposed subsidies to employers and low-income people, estimated at $100 billion in 1999 (somewhat more by the Congressional Budget Office). Eliminating the tax shelter for employer-paid premiums would contribute $125 billion, and our plan would replace Medicaid acute care for those under 65 ($75 billion more).
Robert Reischauer of the C.B.O. destroyed a semantic attraction of employer mandates when he testified that federally required purchases of insurance should be included in the budget. Their popularity is waning among businesses and in Congress, where support appears to be growing for the plans of Representative Jim Cooper and Senator John Chafee; unfortunately, these plans do not assure universal coverage in this century.
Our proposal is not a radical reconstruction. It builds on the best of existing institutions. A victory for it would be a victory for the basic principles that the Clintons have so eloquently set forth.

HEADLINE: Art, Money and the Mayor

 BODY:
Even when New York City is at its bitterest and bleakest, there is one claim New Yorkers can go on making. We have more museums, more galleries, more dance groups and more concerts than any other city in the United States. Furthermore, art -- which naysayers love to describe as elitist -- is for this city a cash cow. As a Port Authority study attested last year, New York's extraordinary cultural concentration means jobs, lots of them, for New Yorkers, and tax revenues for the city and state.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appears to realize this, which is why he has made a grab for the very attractive offer dangled by leaders in the city's art world. We will pony up $10 million in private contributions, they said, if you will restore the $4.2 million you want to cut from the arts budget -- and add $5 million more. The deal is contingent on the state also contributing an additional $5 million. 
 Mr. Giuliani has accepted the challenge; the arts group is confident of raising its share; and the rest is up to the state, which so far has seen virtue only in the short-term gains of Draconian cuts. Three years ago the New York State Arts Council budget, much of which comes to the New York metropolitan area, was $54 million. Today it is a mere $25 million. Given the arts' proven ability to trigger economic returns, this form of penny-pinching is foolish.
There are questions to be answered about this plan. Will the city's smallest art institutions, for instance, get the squeeze? No, the plan's sponsors say. They will benefit because not only will they get their share of the restored $4.2 million, but they will get help from the Department of Cultural Affairs about fund-raising. They can also benefit from the advice given them by the larger institutions and by being placed, on occasion, under one umbrella. One massive effort on behalf of groups involved in preserving and disseminating Hispanic culture, say, could profit all of them.
Could the city's largest institutions, by gobbling up $750,000 apiece, which is the plan's cap on grants, leave too little of the pie for the others? Again the sponsors say no. The rules applying to them would be more stringent than those applying to the small groups. The big players have to prove that their grants would be used solely to improve the public's access. The smaller groups could use their grants to pay the rent or the oil bills, hire security -- to do all the little things, in other words, that keep them alive and valuable.
Mayor Giuliani is wise to take the arts group's dare. May Governor Cuomo show equal wisdom.

HEADLINE: Populist Challenge in California Race

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb. 10

 BODY:
Picking up where Ross Perot and Edmund G. Brown Jr. left off in the 1992 Presidential campaign, Tom Hayden is running for governor of California on what he calls a crusade against the influence of special interests in politics.
Mr. Hayden, whose political career started in the protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960's, said he was not in the race to win. But his announcement on Wednesday stunned politicians in this state capital and could significantly shift the dynamics of what is shaping up to be a hard-fought race in a big state. 
 Republicans here said Mr. Hayden's decision would help the Republican incumbent, Gov. Pete Wilson, by fragmenting Democratic voters in the primary on June 7, in which Mr. Hayden is taking on Kathleen Brown, the state Treasurer, and John Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner.
Mr. Hayden, a 54-year-old state senator from Santa Monica, said in an interview today that he was running because of a "tacit silence among Republicans and Democrats about campaign reform and lobbying reform." Mr. Hayden, wealthy since he won a large divorce settlement after splitting with the actress Jane Fonda in 1989, would not need to raise much money for a statewide campaign.
 
$94 Gift Limits
 Like Mr. Brown, a former governor of California and Ms. Brown's brother, Mr. Hayden said he would not run 30-second television commercials and would accept only small contributions -- no more than $94 a person ("94 for Reform" is his slogan).
Mr. Hayden has long challenged the establishment; before he married Ms. Fonda, he was a defendant in the Chicago Seven case arising from his protests at the Democratic convention in 1968.
In concentrating on political reform, Mr. Hayden already has plenty of ammunition: Ms. Brown, who announced her candidacy this week, has so far raised far more than $5 million; Mr. Garamendi has more than $1 million. The nominee of each party is expected to raise as much as $25 million.
"It's the ideal situation for Wilson," the House Speaker, Willie L. Brown, a Democrat, said today. He said Ms. Brown, as the front runner in the polls at this early stage, would be hurt because she would be forced to be more specific about her positions during the primary. "Whether it's a crime issue or a race issue," the Speaker said, "she's got to say it now." But others assert that Ms. Brown could benefit because the entry of the liberal Mr. Hayden in the race will make her appear more moderate.
Mr. Brown said in an interview that he was pleased to see Mr. Hayden in the race. "I'm glad he's putting the issue of political reform front and center." Mr. Brown declined to compare his Presidential quest to that of Mr. Hayden, saying he is curious about whether Mr. Hayden will tap his own money.
 
Noncommittal Brother
 Asked whether he would endorse his sister in the primary, Mr. Brown replied: "I'm staying out of the campaign. I'm certainly urging my sister to get out front on political reform."
Mr. Hayden in an interview on the Senate floor rejected any comparison to Mr. Perot or Mr. Brown. "I would ask voters to judge me on the merits and not let immediate stereotypes characterize me," he said. "I don't want to make comparisons. You may. My point is that I think that there's a message of reform that needs to be voiced, and the alternative is the suffocation of silence. If I can be a magnet that redirects debate to reform, my mission is satisfied."
Asked about how much money he planned to spend on a campaign or whether any of it would come from his personal fortune, Mr. Hayden said, "That's unknown."
He said he would rely on a grass-roots organization and a belief that "the free press still can reach as many people as television commercials." And he insisted that he did not see himself as a spoiler, saying, "I'm not trying to defeat them but to unleash a debate and a movement to which they respond."
In a speech on Wednesday, Mr. Hayden, who was elected to the State Assembly in 1982, said he decided to run on the night before the filing deadline on Wednesday because "the earthquake of Jan. 17 jolted me into a greater urgency."
 
Republican Questions
 Some Republicans questioned whether Mr. Hayden was a legitimate populist voice against big money in politics given his own fortune.
"It borders on hypocrisy -- running on taking no more than 94 bucks is all right if you've got plenty of your own money," said Kenneth L. Maddy, the state Senate Republican leader. "You can be holier than thou all you want. It's one thing to limit how much you receive, but the issue is how much you spend." But Mr. Maddy conceded that his colleague across the aisle would be "forcing the issue in a way that no one likes, even Wilson."
In his 1992 campaign for the State Senate, Mr. Hayden spent an estimated $750,000 in a three-way primary, a large amount for such a race.
Mr. Hayden said he would withdraw from the race if the other candidates speak out on his agenda, which includes public financing of campaigns and outlawing political action committees. But thus far, that is not happening. The Brown campaign issued a statement saying that Ms. Brown would continue to emphasize creating jobs, eliminating violence and reforming schools, "no matter who else joins the race." Mr. Garamendi was not much more forthcoming, saying, "I welcome a discussion of the issues raised by Tom Hayden."
Given voters' worries about the economy, the fallout from the earthquake and other matters, Herbert E. Alexander, a political science professor at the University of Southern California, questioned whether Mr. Hayden would succeed in making campaign reform an important issue. "He's trying to force this as an issue," Mr. Alexander said. "But I don't know that Brown or Garamendi will adopt it in a way that will make it a prime issue that would satisfy Hayden or his supporters."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 17, 1994, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Friday about the entry of Tom Hayden into the race for California governor misattributed a quotation about Kathleen Brown, who is also a Democratic candidate. It was Ms. Brown's brother, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. -- not Willie Brown, the state House Speaker -- who said of Mr. Hayden, "I'm glad he's putting the issue of political reform front and center." Former Governor Brown, who ran for the Democratic nomination for President in 1992, also said: "I'm staying out of the campaign. I'm certainly urging my sister to get out front on political reform."

Investors in California S. & L.'s May Face Their Own Aftershock

BYLINE: By Andrea Adelson 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
ANALYSTS are cautioning that investors in California savings and loan associations need to prepare for a strong aftershock of their own after the Northridge earthquake.
The problem for the S.& L.'s, however, is not damaged homes but a damaged economy. 
 "The real key question is what this will do to the economy in the area," said Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst for Prudential Securities.
The region's already depressed residential real estate market could decline further. Housing prices in the hard-hit San Fernando Valley are at 1988 levels and dropping in some areas at 1 percent a month. Business and home foreclosures are at record levels, a 21-fold increase in four years.
Those trends could be accelerated by a population exodus, new taxes to pay for quake damage and mangled freeways. "Investors should be watchful," he said.
If California's economy continues to lag behind the rest of the nation, lenders will write fewer new mortgages and generate less fee income here, and their earnings will lag behind competitors.
But analysts do not think the direct impact from the quake -- cracked and collapsing homes the S.& L.'s hold mortgages on -- will be that hard on the institutions' earnings. The quake destroyed 9,949 homes and damaged another 45,000 between Santa Monica and Simi Valley.
At worst, industry analysts estimate lenders might face between $1 billion and $2 billion in losses on nonperforming quake loans spread across 100 or more institutions. These preliminary estimates are likely to add just a blip to already jagged earnings records.
For instance, at Great Western Bank, which had $555 million in loan-loss provisions last year, quake losses, including damage to its Chatsworth headquarters, may be $50 million, cutting profit by 15 cents a share, to $1.65, according to one estimate.
While potential quake losses may be widely disbursed, Bruce W. Harting, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc., thinks California S.& L.'s will shrug off the quake's impact for another reason. In fact, after avoiding California S.& L.'s since 1989, he is recommending the Great Western Financial Corporation, the San Francisco Federal Corporation and the Golden West Financial Corporation.
It is no coincidence that two of his three recommendations are outside the quake zone. "L.A. is ground zero, literally and figuratively," he said.
Mr. Harting said his stock picks reflected the findings of Salomon's real estate economist, David Hensley, who formerly headed the Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles. Known for his bearish outlook, Mr. Hensley thinks price deflation has ended in California and that the state should see job growth in 1994 outside of Los Angeles. "He may be the first bull," Mr. Harting said.
Even so, the concern is that quake victims, without equity, ineligible for Government grants and too indebted to accept low-interest Small Business Administration loans, will mail in their keys.
Here, mortgage bankers, who make Federal Housing Administration loans, are likely to have quake exposure, according to Jonathan E. Gray, an S.& L. analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Mortgage banks are required to restore damaged homes with F.H.A. loans, he said.
The nation's largest mortgage banker, the Countrywide Funding Corporation, so far must fix the homes of 55 F.H.A. customers out of 800 borrowers with damage, Thomas H. Boone, a managing director, said. He could not estimate costs.
Unusual flexibility is how H. F. Ahmanson & Company, parent of Home Savings, intends to avoid quake losses.
Rather than foreclose, Home Savings will make interest-free repair loans to borrowers. If such a home eventually sells for less than the original loan, the S.& L. will take a loss. Home Savings estimates that 200 of the 2,000 homes that are damaged fall into this category and has said it will increase its reserves to cover the potential losses.
It was a better bet than the alternative, Charles Rinehart, Home Saving's chairman, said. Adding foreclosure costs to repair costs would likely double the losses, he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Japan Chief Say Trade Talks Fail; U.S. Threatens Action

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
With Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa standing beside him, President Clinton declared trade talks with Japan a failure today, and Administration officials threatened to take aggressive steps to break Japanese barriers to American goods that have created political and economic problems for both countries.
After meeting at the White House with Mr. Hosokawa in what had been billed by both sides as a crucial session for the two leaders, Mr. Clinton offered a pessimistic assessment of the chances that the trade imbalance between the two countries, which neared $60 billion in Japan's favor last year, would be eased anytime soon. 
 "Today we could have disguised our differences with cosmetic agreements," Mr. Clinton said soberly. "But the issues between us are so important for our own nations and for the rest of the world that it is better to have reached no agreement than to have reached an empty agreement."
Although Administration officials characterized the meeting between Mr. Hosokawa and Mr. Clinton as tough, they pointedly declined to specify what steps the United States would be willing to take in an effort to force Japanese markets open. That, one of them said, should wait until the Japanese Prime Minister has left Saturday.
One official said, however, that Mr. Clinton was almost certain to reinstate a lapsed section of American trade law that provides for a strict timetable for Japan to open certain closed markets and includes mandatory sanctions if no deal is reached.
Mr. Clinton invited Mr. Hosokawa to return to the White House before leaving for what an official described as "a purely social" breakfast with no policy discussions scheduled.
 
Otherwise, Warms Ties
 Both leaders emphasized that aside from the trade question, relations between Japan and the United States remained warm and stable.
Although other summit meetings, including President Bush's 1992 trip to Tokyo, have ended in failure, it is very rare for the participants in such conferences to proclaim their lack of accomplishment so openly. Usually, the actual negotiations are conducted by aides well in advance.
The failure to reach a trade agreement will deprive the United States economy of the stimulus Mr. Clinton had hoped it would provide. Retaliatory measures by the United States, like sanctions, could lead to a trade war that would hurt both nations, which is one reason Washington has been so reluctant to resort to them.
But in narrowly political terms, both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa stand to reap sizable domestic political benefits -- the President from having insisted on real rather than paper concessions, the Prime Minister from having stood up to the United States.
What comes next is unclear. Mr. Hosokawa spoke of a "cooling-off period," and Mr. Clinton commented, "I have no idea what will happen from here on in."
"I think this is a very serious problem," the President said.
Mr. Clinton leavened his stern words with a hefty measure of reassurance for Mr. Hosokawa, praising him for his successes in achieving political reform as well as for his less successful attempts to spur the Japanese economy through a stimulus package.
An Administration official said it would be "indelicate" to describe retaliatory options so soon after the collapse of the talks, which ended at about 4 A.M. today when Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata of Japan left the negotiating table.
At first, at least, the steps will probably be modest in scope, in the hope that they will prompt Japan to reconsider its bargaining position.
 
Hosokawa Seems Undisturbed
 Mr. Hosokawa, who leaned comfortably on the podium with one leg crossed on an ankle as Mr. Clinton uttered his threats, appeared largely undisturbed by the President's statement that Japan's best offer "simply did not meet the standards agreed to" at the last talks in Tokyo in July.
"In the past," Mr. Hosokawa said, "Japan and the U.S. sometimes have reached ambiguous agreements which can gloss over the problems of the time, only to find them become sources of later misunderstandings between our two countries from time to time."
He said the relationship between the United States and Japan had matured to a degree that allows them to disagree unequivocally in public. "I believe such is the relationship between grown-ups, as we two are," said the Prime Minister, a reformer who took office last year as the first Japanese leader in 38 years not from the Liberal Democratic Party.
Mr. Hosokawa said that in the end, the two sides had been unable to "clear the hurdle of numerical targets." American negotiators had insisted that Japan agree to procedures that would allow them to measure progress made in opening Japanese markets, particularly for automobiles and auto parts, insurance, telecommunications gear and medical equipment.
 
Japan Cites Free Trade
 Japan has resisted numerical targets as a violation of the principle of free trade and a potential threat to critical Japanese industries at a time when its economy is in the worst recession in decades.
"I understand that the numerical target is not popular, as you said, among the Japanese people, the Japanese Government," Mr. Clinton said in response to a question from a Japanese reporter. "America's trade deficit with Japan is not very popular among the American people or the American Government. It's hard to explain it, year in and year out, always getting bigger."
There was muted tension in public appearance of the two leaders in the White House East Room. Mr. Clinton made faces occasionally at a question. Mr. Hosokawa allowed long silences to build before he offered replies to others.
 
A Three-Hour Meeting
 Mr. Clinton met with Mr. Hosokawa for three hours today, but it had become increasingly clear this week that the trade talks would bear little fruit. Lacking evidence of progress on the trade front, Mr. Hosokawa emphasized instead unrelated agreements, including Japan's intention to spend $3 billion on population and AIDS programs.
Mr. Clinton was left to interpret Mr. Hosokawa's stand for an American audience.
"You know, the problem may be -- it may be one of words, it may be one of the feelings behind the words," Mr. Clinton said. "Japan has taken the position, with which we on the surface do not disagree, that Japan does not wish to commit to numerical targets that amount to managed trade. We understand that."
Mr. Hosokawa was much more firm, in his rejection of the Administration's approach to trade policy.
"At the end of the day we believe that will lead to managed trade," Mr. Hosokawa said. "My administration is promoting deregulation, and so it runs right in the face of our basic tenet. This is what I've told the President during our meeting today."

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
French Aide Visits Bosnia; Both Sides Yield Some Arms

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Both the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led Government troops handed over a small number of heavy weapons to United Nations forces today, and France's Foreign Minister paid a hastily arranged visit to Sarajevo to press the Bosnian Government leaders toward a peace settlement.
A cease-fire that took effect here on Thursday, considered critical to the momentum for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, seemed generally to be holding as the French minister, Alain Juppe, arrived. Only a few outbursts of gunfire were reported during the day. 
 With a new understanding developing between France and the United States on the importance of a negotiated settlement, Mr. Juppe tried to sound out the Bosnians on a set of demands that Washington and Paris could support in the peace talks in Geneva, a Bosnian Government official said.
"There are some conditions for peace now," the official said. "I don't think we were ever so close."
 
Bosnians Told to Be 'Realistic'
 The Bosnian Government official said that Mr. Juppe had asked the Bosnians to "refine" their requests so that the French and Americans "would know what to push for in the talks."
"He emphasized that to be realistic we cannot expect Bosnia's borders to be like they were," the official said.
Visiting the city's main marketplace, closed since a single 120-millimeter mortar shell killed 68 people last Saturday, Mr. Juppe said, "What I have seen passing through this city reinforces my belief that everything should be done to lift the siege."
But two days after NATO demanded that the Serbs remove or hand over all heavy artillery and mortar within 12.4 miles of Sarajevo or face air strikes, the mood here is tense and uncertain.
 
Differences in Agreements
 Significant differences are already evident in the demands outlined by NATO and the cease-fire that the United Nations military commander here, Lieut. Gen. Michael Rose, is working out step by step on the ground. Few residents expect the NATO ultimatum or the cease-fire to end the siege, since both call for Sarajevo to remain surrounded by checkpoints, with food, medicine and other relief supplies arriving by airlift.
After a short, sharp burst of artillery and sustained heavy machine-gun fire late Thursday, along with a few intermittent bursts overnight, United Nations officials said this morning that the firing came from both sides.
"A comparatively small number of rounds have been fired since the start of the cease-fire -- as far as I can judge, as many out of the city as into the city," General Rose said. He had sharp words for what he described as "renegade" Bosnian units that he said were "attempting to sabotage the cease-fire" at the risk of "prolonging the suffering of their own people."
At their barracks in the suburb of Lukavica, on the far side of the airport, Bosnian Serb officers turned over 13 heavy weapons to United Nations forces today. They included four 120-millimeter mortars, one 122-millimeter cannon, two 105-millimeter cannons, four 76-millimeter cannons and two multiple-rocket launcher systems, the United Nations command said at a briefing tonight.
The much more lightly armed Bosnian Government forces turned in four 120-millimeter mortars and one 82-millimeter mortar to Ukrainian troops at the Marshal Tito barracks in the city, the United Nations said.
After sleeping in their armored personnel carriers, 240 French marines in the United Nations force expanded their bases today in six high-combat areas in and around the city where they have placed themselves between the two sides.

Yugoslav Criticizes NATO
 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Feb. 11 (Special to The New York Times) -- In the first reaction by a high-ranking Yugoslav Government official to NATO's threat of air strikes against Bosnian Serbs, Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said today that the Western alliance had no business issuing ultimatums that could determine "war and peace in Bosnia."
"The United Nations is the only organization with the authority to resolve the Bosnian crisis," the official Tanyug news agency quoted Mr. Jovanovic as telling ambassadors from nonaligned countries. Mr. Jovanovic called the NATO ultimatum "destructive to the peace process."

HEADLINE: Dow Slides a Fraction As Trading Ends Early

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Despite a Government report of low inflation, Wall Street posted mixed results in dispirited trading yesterday, as a powerful snowstorm numbed stock market activity.
Many traders remained at home, and others were eager to leave early so they would not be stranded in Manhattan. After some hesitation, officials closed the major stock exchanges 90 minutes early. 
 In the end, the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.56 point, to 3,894.78. For the week, the Dow recovered only 23 points of the 96 points it lost on Feb. 4, after the Federal Reserve Board nudged up short-term interest rates.
Many traders and exchange employees clamored to go home as train service to New Jersey and Long Island was cut back because of the snow.
"It was actually fairly festive here; the New York spirit comes out," Edward A. Greene, managing director of institutional sales at Mabon Securities Inc., said. "But when the exchanges closed, it was Katie bar the door."
 
Plunge in Trading
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange dropped to 213.7 million shares, well below the 300 million-share levels of earlier in the week.
With trading so thin, Wall Street may have a further reaction on Monday to the Labor Department's Producer Price Index. But on the other hand, the stock market's tepid response might be the full response, despite yesterday's abbreviated trading, analysts said. The tiny drop in the Dow came despite a rise of 1.25 points in the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, to 470.18.
The Labor Department reported encouraging results for the Producer Price Index, a barometer of wholesale inflation. Food prices, especially for fruits and vegetables, dropped. And durable goods, like vehicles and furniture, posted modest rises; there were even price declines for home electronic equipment.
There was some cause for concern in the fine print. The index rose two-tenths of a percent, less than the expected four-tenths of a percent. But the core rate, stripped of energy and food prices, rose a worrisome four-tenths of a percent, higher than the consensus range of two-tenths to three-tenths of a percent.
"The P.P.I. contained something for everybody," said David D. Holt, vice president for market research at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "If you're a bear, it confirmed that the economy is weak, and if you're a bull, it confirmed that inflation is low. So it's no surprise that the index had so little impact on the markets."
Some of the traders who managed to get to the New York Stock Exchange yesterday mocked the opening gavel with scattered Bronx cheers, as executives at the Big Board and the American Stock Exchange decided at first to maintain normal operating hours. Later, after an urgent appeal at noon by the Public Securities Association to close bond trading at 2 P.M., the exchanges and Nasdaq decided to close at 2:30 P.M.
The New York Mercantile Exchange, the Commodity Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange all closed operations in the early afternoon to allow traders and employees to make their tortuous way home.
 
Bond Yields Lower
 While trading in the bond market closed at 2 P.M., long-term interest rates eased. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell to 6.40 percent from 6.43 percent, below Tuesday's six-month closing high of 6.44 percent.
Among other market indicators, the Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.03 points, to 781.39, and the American Stock Exchange market value index declined 1.90, to 477.23. But the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.27, to 261.31.
The most active stock was Telefonos de Mexico, which typically serves as a proxy for Mexican stocks because it makes up such a large share of Mexican trading volume. Its American depository receipts rose 87.5 cents, to $74.25, on volume of nearly 4.3 million shares.
After Telmex, Columbia/HCA Healthcare shares were the second most active, at 4.1 million shares. The stock fell $1.875, to $38.625, after Columbia completed a $7.6 billion merger with HCA-Hospital Corporation of America on Thursday to create the nation's largest hospital chain.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Japan Card?;
As Trade Deficit Talks Lead Nowhere Tokyo Awaits President's Next Move

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Strip away the overheated bluster around the United States-Japan summit meeting and it comes down to this: For eight months the Clinton Administration has insisted that it was different from its predecessors, that it was not going to take it anymore. Japan would finally have to open its markets.
The Japanese listened politely. They nodded their heads. And today they called what they think is President Clinton's bluff. The question now is: What does Mr. Clinton really have in his hand? 
 The President could impose a variety of sanctions to bust open the Japanese market to American exports. But almost all of them carry the risk of hurting American companies and consumers or damaging political ties with Tokyo, and Mr. Clinton was offering no hints today about how he intended to play his cards.
In public, the President was remarkably polite in his news conference with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, considering that eight months of negotiations had produced nothing. Mr. Clinton, in fact, seemed so concerned about not embarrassing his Japanese guest that his message may have been lost: that Japan's $60 billion trade surplus with the United States has become intolerable and will not stand.
 
The Real Issue
 But Administration officials insist that the real issue is not whether Mr. Clinton was too polite, given the fact that the Japanese had basically rejected the entire negotiating effort to opening their markets. The real issue, they said, is whether Mr. Clinton, having now broken off the talks with the Japanese, has some effective unilateral measures that will accomplish the same goals that the talks were supposed to achieve.
If he does, it is Japan's bluff that will be called. If he does not, Mr. Clinton could be accused of falling into the same pattern on Japan policy that he has in Bosnia and Haiti -- speaking loudly and carrying a small stick.
"I am not worried about words," said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt. "Our words can be courteous and gentle, and they should be. But they need to be backed up with action. I think the President is prepared to do that. Obviously he has a lot of options."
The challenge, say Administration economic officials, is finding the sort of swords that can slice open Japan's markets, but which are not double-edged and cut into American interests as well. The economies of both countries are so intertwined that hitting Japan without hitting American interests is not so easy.
 
The First Weapon
 The first weapon that Administration officials say they intend to use is the one demonstrated today: that despite the President's politeness, he did in fact break off trade negotiations and left the Japanese to stew.
Some might argue that that is exactly what the Japanese would like, since they are the ones with the trade surplus. But others maintain that the Japanese cannot tolerate a protracted period of trade tension with the United States, particularly when security cooperation over North Korea's nuclear program is so essential.
"I think this is an ideal time to use psychological pressure," said a senior Administration official. "If we put this relationship through a sufficiently protracted period of friction, I think they will sue for peace. The message to Japan is that the United States-Japan relationship is now on hold. You can be sure that we are not going to be picking up the telephone. The next conversation is going to have to be initiated from Tokyo. And if it is not for a month, so be it."
Beyond a general cooling of relations, the Administration has a number of technical options. Officials say that Mr. Clinton intends to immediately reinstate a lapsed section of American trade law that provides a strict timetable for Japan to open certain markets and includes mandatory sanctions if no deal is reached.
The legislation, known as Super 301, was in effect from 1988 to 1990, and was drafted by Congressional Democrats as a way to force Republican trade negotiators to take a more confrontational approach.
The law requires a President to identify countries that discriminate against American goods, then start the clock for imposing sanctions. Mr. Clinton intends to sign an order reinstating Super 301 and possibly name Japan as a violator.
 
Sanctions Invite Retaliation
 The risk is that when such sanctions have been used in the past, American companies that depend on Japanese suppliers beg the Commerce Department to make exceptions.
Such sanctions also invite retaliation from Japan against American companies and could trigger a trade war between the world's two biggest economies that could unravel the progress achieved by the Administration in the GATT and North American free trade agreements.
A second tool the Administration is considering is to stop allowing the expansion of so-called foreign trade zones in the United States. These zones allow Japanese manufacturers to import parts from Japan and not pay duty on them until the final product is shipped to American customers.
For instance, the Nissan Motors factory in Smyrna, Tenn., imports many car parts from Japan which normally would be subject to a 2.5 percent tax upon arrival in the United States. But because the factory has been designated a foreign trade zone, Nissan does not pay the tax until the fully assembled car is shipped to an American dealer, allowing it to collect interest on the tariff money in the meantime, which amounts to at least $5 million a year. The catch in restricting free-trade zones is that it deprives Americans of jobs.
Another option is to have the Justice Department bring antitrust suits against Japanese concerns doing business in the United States that are also part of cartels in Japan that lock out American companies. The Administration has to be careful here though that it does not abuse antitrust laws, otherwise it could find itself tied up in the courts.

HEADLINE: To Vietnamese in America, the Homeland Beckons

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WESTMINSTER, Calif., Feb. 10

 BODY:
As the last groups of bewildered refugees from the Vietnam War arrive here with their identity tags and bundles of belongings, plane loads of their successful countrymen are heading back with dollars in their pockets to visit relatives or open businesses.
Nineteen years after the fall of Saigon, with the Vietnamese population in the United States approaching one million, the flood of refugees is drawing to a close. 
 The flow is, in a way, reversing itself: more Vietnamese are now returning from the United States for visits than are arriving here as refugees or immigrants.
This shift took on momentum last week when President Clinton lifted the two-decade-old American trade embargo against a former enemy. The Little Saigon enclave of 80,000 Vietnamese in this town 40 miles south of downtown Los Angeles is suddenly busy with plans and projects -- not all of them realistic -- for their return to the homeland as wealthy heroes.
 
In High Gear
 "A lot of Vietnamese-Americans have been going to Vietnam like crazy when they heard the rumor that the sanctions may be lifted," said Co Pham, president of the local Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. A medical doctor, he himself has plans to open a hospital in Vietnam.
Vuong Tran, who owns a travel agency and works as a consultant for American companies seeking to do business in Vietnam, said: "This is the day we have been waiting for. We spent a lot of money doing research for this day." Mr. Tran, who has frequently visited his homeland over the years to lay the groundwork for new enterprises, is in high gear now, determined to be one of the first to profit.
T. T. Nhu, a columnist for the San Jose Mercury News, said her uncle, who owned a bank in Vietnam and, as a refugee, earned a doctorate at Cornell University, may return to reopen his bank. "It's like living and dying and going to heaven again," she said.
Surprising some Vietnamese here, the mood even seems to have affected the younger generation here with American educations and only dim childhood memories of Vietnam.
 
Big Plans, Tough Reality
 "Many young professionals have declared to their parents over the last few days that they will return to Vietnam in the next month or two," said Yen Do, editor of Nguoi Viet Daily News here, the largest Vietnamese-language newspaper in the United States. "They said it solemnly and officially within the family. They didn't ask the parents, 'Should I go back?' They just said it: 'I will go.' "
He said the talk is of enterprises like banks and small import-export companies and of using American skills in construction, education, real estate and medical care. "Everything seems possible now," he said.
But Mr. Tran warned that in reality many things were still not possible in Vietnam, with its primitive and slow-moving centrally controlled economy. "The end of the embargo will benefit first the giant companies including rich oil companies, banks, construction, communications, law firms," he said. "Small and medium businesses, and this includes the Vietnamese-Americans, will have more difficulty. This is still a socialist country and doing business there is very complicated. It will take a couple of more years."
Nevertheless, Mr. Tran said his travel business had boomed in recent years as visits to Vietnam became more common and less politically risky within the emigre community, which has been polarized over whether to have dealings with a Communist Vietnam.
One of his plans involves building a retirement community for elderly returnees in their native country. He said he had circulated a questionnaire here and found that about half the 2,000 respondents said they would be interested in buying a home in Vietnam.
When Hanoi first opened the door for returnees in the mid-1980's, Mr. Tran said, he escorted groups of 5 or 10 people on visits to their homeland and his business so angered militant Vietnamese anti-Communists here that his office was firebombed.
Now, the Vietnamese mission to the United Nations estimates that nearly 100,000 Vietnamese return to visit every year. By some estimates, as many as 20,000 people have returned for the lunar new year of Tet this month. At the moment, only a few Vietnamese return home to stay.
 
Dwindling Arrivals
 At the same time, Vietnamese refugee arrivals in the United States, which reached a peak of about 150,000 a year in the early 1980's, have dwindled to fewer than 60,000 in the fiscal year 1993, down from 82,000 in 1992.
And these arrivals will all but end within the next year or two, said Pamela Lewis, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Refugee Programs in the State Department, as a pool of Vietnamese deemed to be political refugees under an immigration program dries up.
Almost all the refugees arriving in the United States now leave Vietnam not by boat but by airplane in the Orderly Departure Program, which was begun in the 1980's.
Most of them now belong to two specific groups: the Amerasian offspring of Americans in Vietnam, along with their family members, and former South Vietnamese officers and Government officials who have been held as political prisoners.
The last 3,500 people in the Amerasian program are expected to arrive in the United States by summer, Ms. Lewis said, bringing the total to nearly 80,000. As many as 100,000 former political prisoners and family members will have entered the country when that program ends some time within the next two years.
The exodus of boat people has all but ended; fewer than 100 people were recorded last year. Their numbers are dwarfed by the 58,000 who have returned to Vietnam from refugee camps since late 1989. Those returnees were denied asylum by third countries, as most of the new boat people will be, because they were judged to be fleeing for economic rather than political reasons.
Once the pool of Amerasians and political prisoners is exhausted, in one more sign of normalization, virtually all Vietnamese arrivals in the United States will come not as refugees but as immigrants. Their entry would be based on the same criteria and follow the same procedures as people from the Philippines or Ireland or Argentina or France.
And yet, in the face of this turning tide of history, it remains politically difficult here in Little Saigon to support the end of the embargo and to do business openly with the Communist Government in Hanoi.
The lifting of the embargo was greeted with angry demonstrations and threats against advocates of normalization. Local political leaders chose their words carefully so as not to offend former Vietnamese military men and political prisoners who are still fighting the long-ago war in their hearts.
 
'They Lost Their Country'
 "These are the hard-core types that we call the San Jose paratroopers," said Douglas Pike, who heads the Vietnam Archive at the University of California at Berkeley. "They lost their country and they are bitter about it, and I guess I'd be even more bitter about it."
So the celebration one recent evening was quiet at the Vien Dong restaurant, where a Vietnamese-American banker, a construction contractor, a doctor, a restaurateur, an import-export executive and a half-dozen others gathered on the eve of Tet to mark the lifting of the embargo.
It was as if they shared a guilty secret in the aftermath of a war that had seemed to bring only tragedy. They were going to go home, and they were going to make money.
"Happy New Year," they said, as they lifted water glasses of California champagne, and they took pictures of one other smiling.

HEADLINE: Hospital Fights Parents' Wish to Keep Life Support for a 'Brain Dead' Child

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 11

 BODY:
A Sarasota hospital that has been caring for a brain-dead teen-ager since early last month is seeking permission from the courts to disconnect her life-support system, despite opposition from the girl's parents.
The parents, Frederick and Sharon Hamilton, say the action is premature and want doctors at Sarasota Memorial Hospital to release their 13-year-old daughter, Teresa, to their custody. 
 Teresa, a severe diabetic, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 7 and fell into a coma soon afterward.
"We are aghast at the fact that they want to call it quits," Mr. Hamilton said today in a telephone interview. "She must come home, and we have to work with her."
Michael Covert, the president of the hospital, said tonight that he planned to ask the state attorney next week how to proceed with the case.
 
No Brain Activity
 Medical workers familiar with the case say doctors determined that Teresa was legally dead after three brain scans showed no brain activity and a blood scan indicated no blood flow to the brain. But Mrs. Hamilton has asked the hospital to do everything to keep her daughter alive. The girl is being kept breathing by a ventilator.
"The hospital is asking the court for direction because of the conflict concerning Teresa Hamilton," said Mike Vizvary, a hospital spokesman, adding that the parents' wishes were in conflict with the hospital's policy.
"The hospital believes court intervention is appropriate to resolve the concerns surrounding Teresa Hamilton," he said.
But John Williams, a lawyer for the Hamiltons, said he feared that the hospital would seek to have a guardian appointed in the case, who would then be responsible for medical decisions about the girl. "The first question is should the parents be deprived of their guardianship rights," he said.
Further complicating the case, the Hamiltons' medical insurance has run out. The intensive care unit where Teresa is being treated costs about $3,240 a day, bringing the Hamiltons' five-week hospital bill to more than $116,000.
Mr. Vizvary said the court action had nothing to do with the family's lack of insurance. But hospital officials acknowledged that care of the girl had created stress and an emotional drain among medical workers who were handling the case.
 
An Atypical Case
 Until now, most cases in which a court has been asked to make a determination of life or death have dealt with family members who wanted to stop efforts by a hospital or state to keep a relative on life support. This case is attracting attention among specialists in medical ethics because it does not fit that pattern.
"If the child is still alive, this is an important case," said George Annas, director of the law, medicine and ethics program at Boston University of Medical and Public Health. "It's almost always the other way around. Hospitals never go to court trying to stop treatment on a child against the wishes of the parent."
In Florida, a person is considered dead "when there is irreversible cessation of the functioning of the entire brain," even though respiratory and circulatory functions are being maintained with the aid of machines. In such cases, there is no requirement for the hospital to ask permission of next of kin or a court to disconnect life support.
"The hospital has an obligation to take her off the ventilator," Mr. Annas said. "Now they are treating a corpse." By doing so, he said, "you really do confuse the parents, because you lead the parents to believe that the child is still alive."
That is what appears to have happened in Teresa Hamilton's case. "They have claimed that she is brain dead, which is the clinical way of saying she's a goner," said Mr. Hamilton, an unemployed oil engineer originally from Scotland. "But they've pursued with her care."
 
1990 Supreme Court Ruling
 In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that treatment could be withheld if there was clear and compelling evidence of the patient's wishes. The decision came in the case of Nancy Cruzan, a young woman from Missouri who spent eight years in a coma while her parents fought to have her disconnected from life support, contending she had told them that was her desire.
Ms. Cruzan died in December 1990, six months after the Supreme Court ruling and 12 days after her parents won the right to remove the feeding tube that was keeping her alive.
But Teresa Hamilton had no known wishes for such a circumstance, and as a minor, the decisions for her medical care are made by her parents.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Ruling in Virginia
 RICHMOND, Feb. 11 (AP) - A hospital must treat a severely brain-damaged baby even though doctors believe the infant should be allowed to die, a Federal appeals court ruled on Thursday.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled, 2 to 1, that Fairfax Hospital must honor the mother's wishes that her infant be given mechanical breathing assistance when she suffers respiratory distress. The hospital is near the town of Fairfax in northeastern Virginia.
The court cited a Federal law that requires hospitals to treat emergency medical conditions. The law was passed to protect indigent patients from being denied treatment.
"We recognize the dilemma facing physicians who are requested to provide treatment they consider morally and ethically inappropriate, but we cannot ignore the plain language of the statute," said the ruling written by Judge William W. Wilkins Jr. He was joined by Judge Karen J. Williams.
"Baby K," as the child is known, was born at the hospital in October 1992 with most of her brain missing. The baby breathes, sucks, swallows and coughs but cannot think, see, hear or feel, the hospital said.

HEADLINE: New Focus on Drugs;
President's Strategy Reflects Concern About Crime and Changing Priorities

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
For months, a handful of Administration officials had been urging President Clinton to place his personal stamp on the drug issue with a splashy White House ceremony. But there always seemed to be something else more pressing.
On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton leaped into the drug issue with both feet. With Vice President Al Gore and half a dozen Cabinet members in tow, he trooped out to a Maryland prison that boasts a model drug treatment program to announce a 1995 national drug strategy that will cost more than $13 billion. 
 Why the big change from a President who had scarcely mentioned drugs since taking office? Many experts on drugs and the ways of Washington say the answer is in the polls.
 
Public Demands Action
 In recent weeks, crime and violence have risen to prominence on the roster of national concerns. They now rival the economy, which so dominated the 1992 Presidential campaign, and surpass health care.
"Clearly, the fact that the public is demanding that something be done on crime and violence is affecting the fact that Washington is paying attention to drugs," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice. "When crime becomes an issue, drugs become an issue. They're opposite sides of the same coin."
At the Prince Georges County Correctional Center, Mr. Clinton succinctly linked the two problems. "No nation," he said, "can fight crime and drugs without dealing honestly and forthrightly with the problem of drug addiction."
The President's strategy speaks of attacking the social problems that many believe to be the root causes of drug abuse, and his anti-drug budget sharply increases spending for drug rehabilitation and anti-drug education by $800 million. But, to the disappointment of many drug experts, the Clinton budget continues to allocate the larger portion of the drug budget, 59 percent, to law enforcement, as those of Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan did without denting the cocaine and heroin trade.
 
Catching Up With an Issue
 But it was not just the polls that moved the President to action, Mr. Schumer said. It was also a matter of catching up with an issue that had been pushed aside by higher priorities. Since taking office, Mr. Clinton has faced one crisis after another, starting with the upheaval over homosexuals in the military and continuing with his plan to overhaul the nation's health care system.
Mr. Clinton's first drug budget, for example, was almost a carbon copy of Mr. Bush's last budget. It took Mr. Clinton five months to name a director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Lee P. Brown, a former New York City police commissioner, and the President was nine months late with a mandatory report to Congress on his drug policy. The report was a blueprint of the new strategy, but Mr. Clinton was criticized for not giving any indication of how much money would go for what programs.
"I think he cared about drugs," Mr. Schumer said. "But there were other things with higher priorities. I'm now finding that the White House is getting into the issue of crime and drugs with the same kind of intensity it has been focusing on these other issues."
Administration officials explain the President's silence and lack of focus another way.
"It's been evolutionary," said one Administration official. "The pieces of his program have come together now, and he's ready to move out front with it. You're going to see more of this."
The nation's drug experts are delighted that Mr. Clinton is calling attention to the subject of their concern. They are convinced that it was the "bully pulpit" style of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush that, to a large extent, brought down the rate of casual drug use from its sky-high levels in the mid-1980's. And they are equally convinced that the silence from the White House since the latter part of the Bush Presidency has significantly contributed to the increase in the use of marijuana among teen-agers that researchers at the University of Michigan reported two weeks ago.
Republicans in Congress seized on the increase in drug use by teen-agers, saying it underscored the feebleness of Mr. Clinton's anti-drug policy.
 
Sending a Strong Signal
 Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, the president of the Phoenix House, which is based in New York and is the nation's largest residential drug treatment organization, welcomed Mr. Clinton's embrace of the issue. "When the White House is talking about drugs and making them a part of the domestic agenda, it sends a strong signal," he said. "You need a persistent societal message that drug use is not acceptable, that there are real dangers and consequences associated with drug use."
While most drug experts have cheered the proposal to increase spending on treatment and prevention programs -- even though the gap between needs and services will remain Gargantuan -- some former drug officials in the Bush Administration are accusing the Clinton team of misrepresenting its spending on prevention programs. The Clinton Administration acknowledges that about $270 million of the $400 million increase indicated for prevention programs would actually be used to hire more officers for community policing.
"Law enforcement can deter drug use," said John P. Walters, who was deputy director of the office on drug policy under President Bush. "But it is usually programs in schools and workplaces that are counted as prevention. This is an effort to make it look like something else."

HEADLINE: Congress Passes Measure Providing $8.6 Billion for Quake Relief

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Congress gave final approval today to $8.6 billion in relief for the victims of the recent Los Angeles earthquake, coupling the aid with $3.2 billion in spending cuts in a show of concern over the budget deficit.
The House voted 245 to 65 for the measure, staying in session -- despite a day of wintry weather that left the nation's capital blanketed in ice -- to finish work in time to begin a 10-day midwinter recess. Senate approval immediately followed the House vote. 
 In the House, 168 Democrats, 76 Republicans and one independent voted for the measure. Forty-eight Republicans and 17 Democrats voted against.
President Clinton said he hoped to sign the bill on Saturday and indicated that the Government's role in earthquake recovery would continue beyond the relief package. "While short-term disaster relief is absolutely necessary, I want to assure that we'll be there over the long run as well," he said.
Earlier in the day, House and Senate conferees agreed on the package, which includes an additional $2.5 in emergency outlays.
 
Spending for Pentagon
 Besides earthquake relief, the measure provides $1.2 billion for Pentagon operations in Somalia, Bosnia and elsewhere; $685 million in disaster aid for the victims of flooding in the Midwest last summer, and $315 million to rebuild the Cypress Freeway in Oakland, Calif., which was destroyed in the 1989 San Francisco earthquake.
An additional $300 million in assistance for heating the homes of low-income families would go to states hardest hit by the winter weather.
Support in Congress for earthquake relief itself was overwhelming from the start, but the $11 billion bill generated substantial debate over the other spending items as well as the issue of providing spending cuts to offset the costs.
Other disaster aid bills in recent years, including a measure last summer for flood victims, have been financed with deficit spending, and the Democratic leadership in both houses favored that approach for the earthquake measure.
 
Bill Moved Swiftly
 But some lawmakers in both houses pressured for spending reductions, and won $3.25 billion in reductions in the measure. Included was $860 million in transportation programs and $600 million in military construction.
But for all the debate, the bill moved with unusual swiftness through Congress. The earthquake occurred less than a month ago, and it was only last week that the House Appropriations Committee sent the measure on its first steps toward passage.
After two days of debate, the Senate by a vote of 85 to 10 on Thursday night approved $8.6 billion in grants and loans for victims of the Jan. 17 earthquake. The House passed a version of the measure last week.
 
'People Are Needful'
 "The clock is ticking and the people are needful," Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, told senators on Thursday as they inched toward a final vote.
Afterwards, Senator Barbara Boxer, another California Democrat, thanked the Senate for a vote she said would lead the way to reconstruction and "economic recovery" in a state also hard hit by recession.
The earthquake has been blamed for 61 deaths and property damage estimated at $20 billion. It also left tens of thousands of people homeless.
The final legislation would also limit the Government to providing short-term relief to disaster victims who are living illegally in the United States. How that limit would be enforced is not clear. The bill does order the Government to furnish up to 90 days of shelter for victims without regard to their immigrant status.
But the legislation would also make enforcement a matter of discretion, and it would bar officials from discriminating against disaster victims on the basis of race or ethnic origin.
The bill would also extend the deadline for the Government to pursue civil charges against failed savings and loans, including the institution concerned in the Whitewater case that involves the President and his wife, Hillary. The deadline for the institution, Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, had been Feb. 28 but now stands at Dec. 31, 1995, for it and all other such institutions.

HEADLINE: Wretched Weather Takes Toll on Economy

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The seemingly endless freezing weather and the waves of rain, sleet and snow are hampering output, productivity and sales in businesses from construction to airlines to retail stores.
Economists are saying that if current weather patterns continue, the wealth lost as a result of the severe winter could exceed the economic losses from the California earthquake. 
 "In economic terms, we pretty much always ignore the weather," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "But this winter has been so harsh in so many parts of the country that we can't ignore it."
Estimates on how much the winter has slowed the economy are just that. But Mr. Ratajczak is projecting that production in the current quarter will be five-tenths of a percentage point lower than it might otherwise have been. At an annual rate, that translates into a drag on gross domestic product of 1.5 to 2 percentage points.
Most economists are assuming that the weather will not stay this bad for much longer and that production lost in the first six weeks of the year will be made up in the rest of the quarter and later in the year. But those expectations are running up against a weather map that offers little relief.
"If this keeps up for another month, it could have a significant negative impact on the first quarter," said Alan Blinder, a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. "I wouldn't be surprised if the economic loss has been worse than the loss from the Los Angeles earthquake. Well over half the nation's population has been affected by this wretched weather."
There are no final estimates for the losses from the California quake. But analysts have estimated that the cost could range from $12 billion to $30 billion.
Hard evidence of the weather's impact on the economy is only beginning to trickle in. The data-gathering task was not made any easier yesterday because bad weather virtually shut down huge areas of the country, from Memphis to Boston.
Even though official Washington was closed yesterday, the Government was open long enough to report that retail sales, a driving force in the economic recovery, fell by five-tenths of a percent last month. It was the first decline in 10 months.
January's freezing temperatures were a big reason for the slide, and most analysts said they still saw underlying strength in consumer confidence.
Some of the lost sales will be made up in coming months. But retailing experts said much of the spending that might have taken place was lost.
"There is no question that retailers have been hard hit by the succession of snowstorms and the very hostile weather," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Consulting Group in New York. "Some of the purchases not made in the last three to five weeks will be made up, but only some. A lot of shopping in January is impulse shopping, and that cannot be made up."
The weather-related problems imposed on retailers have heightened the importance of next weekend's Presidents' Day sales, traditionally the most important retailing event of the winter.
"We won't make this back in a weekend," said Michael Gould, chairman and chief executive of Bloomingdale's. "But hopefully over the balance of the spring season we will."
Retailers and restaurateurs in the New York City area have clearly been hurt by the weather, but analysts said the city's economy had become so dependent on the financial services sector that a sharp rise in interest rates would likely have a more harmful effect than weeks of bad weather.
The weather has also played havoc with the airline industry, which was in financial difficulty even before the bad weather set in.
USAir, an airline with a heavy concentration of routes in the Northeast, estimates that the impact of the weather in January amounted to $10 million to $20 million in terms of revenue lost from canceled flights and higher expenses.
The weather has had a particularly debilitating effect on the economy because it has been so bad in so many different parts of the country, analysts said.
The Federal Express Corporation, the air delivery service, sorts about half its freight in Memphis, where the company is based. Late Wednesday night, an ice storm virtually shut down the city and left hundreds of thousands without power.
"We were in pretty good shape until two days ago," Tom Martin, a Federal Express spokesman said. "But Thursday night was very bad."
The problem has been the frequency of the bad weather, Mr. Martin said. "One day it has been bad in Chicago. The next day it is New York, the next day Boston, and so on," he said. "The cumulative effect of all that has been debilitating."
Major insurance companies are also hoping the bad weather does not persist.
Earlier this month, the State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, the nation's leading home insurer, said it expected to pay more than $81 million in claims for winter storm damage sustained in January in 14 states and Canada. About $70 million of the total represents payments for pipes that froze and broke during the deep freeze of Jan. 15 through Jan. 20, the company said.
Extrapolate State Farm's claims across the insurance industry and "you come up with a number in the hundreds of millions of dollars," said Gerry Parsons, a State Farm spokesman.
"We have had bigger payouts in the past, but this is big," Mr. Parsons said. "It ranks in the top 20."

HEADLINE: Hosokawa's Report, a la Clinton

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa borrowed a Clinton technique today and took his case to more than 100 students at Georgetown University.
It was a highly unusual performance for a Japanese Prime Minister, far from the carefully scripted appearances his predecessors have made here. But Mr. Hosokawa has proved many times in the last six months that he views his job as being more that of a president proselytizing for change than a prime minister taking a cautious approach. 
 This time he used the opportunity to criticize his country's overregulated economy, complain about his problems with the press, and declare with some passion that his country would never go nuclear.
"There have been reports in the last few days that Japan might change its policy should North Korea arm itself with nuclear weapons," he told the students, reading his speech in English. "I wish the people who write such reports would come to Japan and talk to our people. Then they would realize how deeply we feel about this issue."
Mr. Hosokawa was at his best when he alluded to the frustrations of bringing about what he called Japan's first "inner driven reform," that is, one not dictated by outside powers.
"I am determined to do away with regulations which increase the cost of business, and cost to the consumers." he said. The Japanese, he said, should be able to buy a home at "about two-thirds the present average cost." And he insisted that, despite some evidence to the contrary, "the time has come for Japan to play a much more dynamic role in helping to create the stable, peaceful world which we all desire."
But he steered clear of exactly how Japan would do that -- and whether its people were ready for greater participation in military peacekeeping, an issue that has dogged him for the six months of his premiership.
Recalling that The Washington Post recently called him "poker faced," Mr. Hosokawa conceded that with all his trade problems and the difficulties in keeping his coalition Government together, "perhaps I do look a bit grim these days." He and Mr. Clinton, he said, had "both had our bad days in the media, and we've both had a very tough time trying to get people to agree on policy reforms."
Asked by one student whether Japan was ready to join in sanctions against North Korea if it continues to refuse to allow inspection of its nuclear sites -- an enormously sensitive issue within Japan -- Mr. Hosokawa expressed some exasperation dealing with the Communist Government across the Sea of Japan.
"Only God knows what kind of action North Korea might take as its time expires" to allow the inspections, he said. "But if the U.N. takes sanctions, the Japanese Government will do all it can to the extent that Japanese law allows," he said, stepping around the sticky question of whether it would stop hundreds of millions of dollars that flow each year between Japan and North Korea.

HEADLINE: Exits Pose Danger in Emerging Markets

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
Even Americans who have never left their hometowns are investing in "emerging markets," Wall Street's new name for what used to be called "less developed countries." As these nations' stock markets soared last year, Americans poured more than $9 billion into mutual funds that invest in them.
And in the mutual fund business, every company wants to run a fund that invests in these often quirky little stock markets. According to Lipper Analytical Services, the number of emerging-markets equity funds has grown to 40, from just 22 a year ago. And more are in the offing. 
 The combination of overexcited investors and inexperienced managers is worrying some old-timers in the emerging-markets game. A big concern: fund investors can get out at any time, but the funds themselves can't.
 This year, while some emerging markets have soared -- Brazil has jumped more than 60 percent in the last six weeks -- many of last year's success stories have tumbled, including Hong Kong, which is down 3 percent after doubling last year. Turkey, Thailand and Malaysia have suffered double-digit losses.
 When such markets plummet (and given their volatility, the experts say, it's only a matter of time), American investors may find it hard to bail out of their emerging-markets funds at an acceptable price -- and maybe at all.
"There will come a day when everybody's heading for the exits at the same time, and there won't be an exit," said Mark J. Mobius, one of the founders of emerging-markets investing and a fund manager for the Franklin/Templeton group. He is barnstorming the country right now, preaching about the minimum time horizon he thinks investors must have: five years.
Until recently, impatient investors did not find their way into emerging markets. Most such investing occurred through private partnerships or closed-end mutual funds, which don't let shareholders take their money out (just sell their shares to other investors).
But as some hitherto obscure stock markets heated up in 1993 -- Turkey zoomed over 200 percent, Malaysia, 145 percent and the Philippines, 134 percent -- the mutual-fund business jumped on the bandwagon.
One year ago, the Boston behemoth Fidelity Investments changed the name of a tiny fund to Fidelity Emerging Markets. By the end of the year, the fund had $1.9 billion in its coffers. Despite a sharp selloff in many emerging markets in January, which has put the fund in the red this year, its assets now top $2 billion -- almost as big as Sri Lanka's entire stock market.
"There's a danger when you have a lot of demand chasing a relatively limited amount of supply," said David Warren, executive vice president of Rowe Price Fleming in London, which runs T. Rowe Price's international funds. "An investor starts closing his or her eyes and buying anything, and secondly, it does often attract, one might say, not the right kind of money."
Emerging-market investment gurus remain enthusiastic about the long-term outlook for countries whose economies are growing far faster than America's or Western Europe's. But they concede that they are investing in stock markets, and that markets are vulnerable to all kinds of problems.
 For example, the Hungarian stock market levitated about 80 percent in January as Western investors plunged in. It then lost almost 20 percent of its value in a matter of days, and has now bounced back a bit. According to a report by Bloomberg Business News, the exchange plans to institute some reforms -- such as trading for more than an hour and a half a day -- to cut volatility.
The biggest victim of its own success right now may be India. Managers report that it takes weeks, if not months, to buy or sell a stock, and requires a mountain of paperwork. Sometimes it is just impossible; over the last few years, Indian stock markets have closed for days because of strikes, explosions or scandals.
India may be extreme, but it is not alone. A recent survey of investment managers by the Chicago consulting firm Ennis, Knupp & Associates, found that many managers are so concerned about liquidity that they have held back on investing in South Africa, Indonesia, Taiwan, Chile, India and Turkey. Liquidity -- the ability to buy or sell a stock quickly and easily, without driving prices up or down, and without having to worry about back-office errors or exorbitant fees -- remains a problem in many other markets, too.
"In almost every emerging market, typically the systems are very slow, and there's a lot of paper that can be lost," said Daniel J. Duane, who runs Prudential's global funds. "Inevitably, there's a lot of foot-dragging on settlement, especially when someone has to pay you money."
Even relatively liquid markets, like Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, experience wild swings as government policies change and as foreign money surges in and out. Which explains why the Fidelity Southeast Asia Fund, which opened its doors last April and soared 65 percent by the end of the year, has since dropped almost 10 percent.
Just as troublesome for short-term investors, some countries, including Chile, India, South Korea and Taiwan, restrict foreign investors' ability to take their money home.
Old hands in the emerging markets have lived through these problems before. They use several methods to cut their risk, including broad diversification, high levels of cash and big holdings of easily sold securities.
And most of the big fund groups have arranged to borrow money from banks (or, in Fidelity's case, from its other funds) so that they will not be forced to dump stocks wholesale, sending markets into free fall. Dick Haberman, Fidelity's head of international equities, notes that his company's fund holds more than 500 stocks in 30 countries, and that his company, which employs 50 analysts outside the United States, has been investing in Asia since 1969.
But a lot of new players have not had that experience, which is why Mr. Duane of Prudential said, "In a way, you have to worry about your competitors." He said that if one emerging-markets fund ran into trouble, it might cause a run on all such funds, as happened in Britain in 1987.
Many companies that do not yet offer an emerging-markets fund plan to add one this year. The chief investment officer of one such firm, Paul Stephens of Robertson, Stephens & Company in San Francisco, said many of the people available to run such funds had only two or three years of experience.
The mania for emerging markets has grown so strong that Barton Biggs, the Morgan Stanley strategist responsible for fueling much of it, last month wrote a satirical report on a man he called Jim the Trigger, who was primed to take advantage of all the "dummies with phony accents and striped shirts with white collars who think Turkey borders Malaysia" but have "portfolios that were up 70 percent last year."
His plan? To create his own country, make it emerge and reap the profits. When it's time to end the scam, he will stage a revolution; investors will be left holding the bag.
Several money managers call the research report the funniest they have ever read. But if Mr. Biggs proves prescient, as he has before, mutual fund investors will not be laughing.

HEADLINE: Manager Says New York Let Hospital Fail

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE

 BODY:
The top executive of the company managing the billion-dollar project to rebuild Kings County Hospital said the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation -- and not his company -- was responsible for the project's troubles, and he presented a detailed list of what he called the city's mismanagement and delays.
The complaints came a day after Luis A. Miranda Jr., chairman of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, issued a scathing critique of the decadelong effort to rebuild the city's largest public medical center. 
 On Thursday Mr. Miranda said that the hospital corporation and the construction manager, Turner/Santa Fe Joint Venture, were responsible for fumbling that prevented the construction of a replacement for the obsolete hospital in central Brooklyn.
While Mr. Miranda placed much of the blame on his own agency, he singled out Turner/Santa Fe for criticism, questioning whether it was "up to the job" of replacing New York's largest public hospital.
But yesterday, Desmond Emanuel, the chief executive of Santa Fe Construction Inc., one of the partners in the joint venture, said it was the hospital agency that was not up to the job. Agency officials, he said, constantly altered the design of the new hospital and spent years checking the backgrounds of prospective contractors.
 
Company Won't Be Made Scapegoat
 In an interview, he said he would not allow his company to be made the scapegoat, and said the hospital agency was so inexperienced that it should never have been allowed to handle the project.
"I don't know if H.H.C. is up to the task of building this hospital," said Mr. Emanuel. "I know that we are, because we just want to get this project built. But they have chosen to find a scapegoat and point the finger at us, when we have not delayed this project in any way."
Yesterday, a group of elected officials from central Brooklyn announced that they were forming a committee to monitor the city's progress in rebuilding the hospital, the only health-care provider for the largely impoverished residents of much of the city's most populous borough.
Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr. said the group intended to pressure the city to lift the moratorium on the hospital's construction that was imposed last week by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and insisted the building must be completed by the year 2000.
"We don't want to have to fight the city on this, but this project has to move forward," said Mr. Norman, who is also the Brooklyn Democratic leader. "It is too important to the community to be delayed."
Mr. Norman, speaking for a group of City Council members and other elected representatives, said he agreed with Mr. Miranda's assessment that the hospital agency had fumbled the project in the past. But he said the agency must continue to manage the construction in order to avoid further delays.
 
Arrogance and Inexperience
 Turner/Santa Fe, chosen in 1987 to be the construction manager for the huge rebuilding project, is a joint venture between Turner Construction Company, a giant national company based in New York that specializes in institutional work, and Santa Fe, a smaller minority-owned company also based here that has worked on several major projects for the city and state.
Mr. Emanuel said the two companies believed they were prepared for the regulatory and political challenges that usually accompany a huge public building project. But he said they did not expect the "arrogance and complete lack of experience" they faced at the hospital corporation, which had never before tried to build a hospital of this size.
Most of the design and architectural work on the 1,200-bed, 1.4-million-square-foot hospital had been completed by the time the agency selected Turner/Santa Fe to manage the work. But Mr. Emanuel said that shortly after his company began work, several top officials of the agency resigned to enter private industry, including the executive in charge of the Kings County project.
Later, he said, an official of the agency decided to replace the original architects and planners and ordered the entire project redesigned.
The official decided to move various units of the hospital into different buildings, he said, and ordered the deletion of planned bridge between the new hospital and the State University Health Sciences Center across Clarkson Avenue from the hospital in East Flatbush.
"It was like throwing out two or three years of work," said Mr. Emanuel. He estimated that the resulting delay set back the project at least two years.
Agency officials were not at work yesterday because of Lincoln's Birthday and thus could not verify Mr. Emanuel's account of the changes to the project.
 
Contracts Had to Be Redrawn
 As an example of the agency's inexperience, Mr. Emanuel said the hospital planners originally divided the project into only the four basic contracts required by state law: general contracting, plumbing, heating-air-conditioning, and electrical work.
But Turner/Santa Fe quickly realized that there were not enough contractors in the region large enough to qualify for such giant contracts, he said, resulting in a bid process that would not be competitive or economical for the city. In addition, he said, the large contracts meant that no minority firms would be able to participate, despite the insistence of neighborhood leaders that the construction provide an economic boost to the area.
At that point, he said, Turner/Santa Fe and the architects had to redraw the plans and rewrite the paperwork to subdivide the four large contracts into scores of smaller ones. The plumbing contract, he said, was divided to allow individual companies to handle only a few floors.
"That whole process probably added another year to the planning," Mr. Emanuel said.
City officials have cited the unsually large number of contracts for the project as one of the reasons for the moratorium called by the Mayor.
 
Excavation Held Up
 Mr. Emanuel also recounted an almost comical series of events that held up the basic excavation work on the new hospital, necessary before any other construction work on the main building could begin.
In April 1992, he said, the agency awarded the excavation contract to the second-lowest bidder, ruling that the lowest bidder had not properly completed the necessary paperwork. The lowest bidder then sued the city, and was awarded the contract four months later after a court order.
But 10 months later, the lowest bid was thrown out after the agency discovered that it had failed to disclose a previous criminal record. It took another five months for the contract to be awarded to a third company, producing a total delay of 19 months. Even now, Mr. Emanuel said, the agency has still not completed background checks and approved the new company's subcontractors, meaning that no excavation work on the project can begin.
Turner/Santa Fe was criticized two years ago in an independent audit by the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand for experiencing "difficulty in adquately discharging its responsibilities." Mr. Miranda referred to the criticism on Thursday when chastizing the joint venture.
But Mr. Emanuel said his company's difficulties were solely the result of trying to respond to the slipups and constantly changing demands of the hospitals agency. Just two weeks ago, he said, the agency put out new bid specifications on part of the hospital construction and then had to pull them back after the agency's legal department decided it wasn't satisfied with the paperwork.
"It's unprecedented," he said. "I've never seen anything like it. They had no experience at this sort of thing, and they simply didn't rise to the challenge."

Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today nominated J. Langdon Marsh, the second-ranking official in the State Environmental Conservation Department, to replace the department's Commissioner, Thomas C. Jorling, who is resigning next month to join a paper company.
The choice of Mr. Marsh was applauded by environmental groups, whose leaders described him as an accessible administrator and able spokesman for the agency and its policies over the last decade. 
 "I can't imagine a more qualified person in the country to run New York's Environmental Conservation Department," said Lee Wasserman, executive director of the Environmental Planning Lobby. "He's willing to talk to anyone and seriously consider their views in a way that I haven't seen in many state officials."
Mr. Marsh's nomination is not expected to encounter opposition in the Republican-controlled State Senate, which approves all commissioners.
Mr. Jorling will step down on March 2 from the position he has held since 1987 to become vice president for environmental affairs for the International Paper Company.
If his appointment is approved, Mr. Marsh, 52, will oversee an agency with 3,900 employees and an annual budget of $281 million that has endured repeated cutbacks amid the tight budgets of recent years.
He will also wield broad regulatory powers over development, state parks, industrial pollution, water quality and transportation -- powers that require balancing the often competing concerns of environmentalists against those of property owners, business and car drivers.
Among the new Commissioner's first responsibilities will be to develop regulations to bring New York into compliance with stricter Federal air pollution standards. Those regulations could have a major effect on an array of everyday matters, ranging from how people commute to work to what kind of lawn mowers they buy.
The new Commissioner will also face major decisions this year involving a state lawsuit to strengthen Federal acid rain regulations, new rules to reduce toxic chemicals in manufacturing and legislation to broaden protections against development in Adirondack State Park.
He will be paid $95,635 a year.
After graduating from Harvard Law School, Mr. Marsh worked for the Peace Corps in Ethiopia, then joined a private law firm in New York City. In 1973 he joined the Environmental Conservation Department as a counsel and rose through the ranks to deputy commissioner. He left the department in 1979 to become director of the Government Law Center for Union University's Albany Law School.
He returned to the department in 1983 as executive deputy commissioner and has held that position ever since.
In a written statement, Mr. Marsh praised Mr. Jorling for being "acutely aware of the crucial linkage between our environmental and economic futures" and vowed to follow a similar path.

HEADLINE: Long Bond Up After Sharp Swings

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Mixed signals on inflation set off sharp price swings in the Treasury market yesterday.
Prices of longer-term Treasury issues ended moderately higher, with the 30-year bond gaining 14/32 point. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.40 percent, from 6.43 percent on Thursday. 
 The market's swings were amplified by light trading volume as a result of the snowstorm in New York City, which led to an early afternoon closing of the Treasury market.
The Labor Department reported yesterday morning that its Producer Price Index, which provides a gauge of inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, rose two-tenths of 1 percent in January.
 
Early Buying on News
 The news initially enticed investors to buy bonds, sending prices sharply higher, because it showed that inflation stayed low and thus lessened the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates soon.
Higher inflation and interest rates can diminish the value of bonds and other fixed-income securities.
But some traders apparently lost enthusiasm and sold bonds after focusing on the so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors.
The core rate showed that producer prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month. In addition, the rate for capital goods -- including prices for such products as machinery, heavy trucks and computers -- was up six-tenths of 1 percent.
"That's one sector where you really have inflation pressures building," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at the Nikko Securities International Company. "It was a report that wasn't quite the way it seemed."
But prices advanced again later yesterday morning after the University of Michigan reported a drop in consumer confidence in the economy in February.
The Michigan survey index fell to 92.9, from 94.3 in January, according to market participants who saw the report, which is not released publicly.
That seemed to lend credence to the fixed-income camp that says economic growth is not yet strong enough to aggravate inflation.
Still, there are good reasons for the market's skittishness. Last Friday, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the first time in five years, sending Treasury security prices sharply lower across the board.
The market had been awaiting the producer price figures -- and consumer price statistics due out next Thursday -- for clues about when the Fed would act again.
 
Fed Action Expected
 Mr. Brusca said the sharp jump in the prices of capital goods could be one impetus for the central bank to act next month. "Once the Fed has got the bit in its teeth, they're going to run with it," he said.
Prices of short-term Treasuries rose 1/16 point to 3/32 point, and intermediate maturities were 3/16 point to 11/32 point higher.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.72, to 1,295.83.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 1031/32 , down 4/32 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity was 5.53 percent, up from 5.52 percent.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Down Again As Demand Is Seen Easing

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Copper prices fell yesterday for the sixth time in seven days, amid signs that demand will not be as strong as previously expected.
Trading was relatively light in the New York futures markets, which closed several hours early because of the storm in the New York City area. The snow, however, did help lift heating oil prices. 
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, copper for March delivery fell 1.45 cents, to 84.15 cents a pound. The decline followed a surge that took copper to an eight-month high last week on speculation that stronger economic growth in the United States would increase demand.
 
Slower Growth in Demand
 Copper stockpiles have been falling recently in both the Commodity Exchange's warehouse and the London Metal Exchange's warehouse.
But much of the recent decline was caused by restocking by copper consumers. As such, analysts said demand was likely to slow this year to from an annual growth rate of 8 percent in 1993 to a rate of 2 to 3 percent.
"We don't think the market will continue to grow as strongly as it has in the past two years," said Kevin Norrish, research manager at the Commodities Research Unit. "The major part of the restocking is over."
In addition, demand from Europe will probably grow by about only 1.5 percent this year, mainly because Germany's economy is still weak, Mr. Norrish said. And he predicted that demand from Japan would probably not grow.
"Our view is that copper is overvalued at the moment," Mr. Norrish added.
Meanwhile, heating oil prices gained, leading crude oil prices higher, as the snow in the New York City area and forecasts for below-normal temperatures across the East reminded traders that demand would probably remain strong.
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, heating oil for March delivery jumped 0.67 cent, to 50.98 cents a gallon, while March crude oil gained 16 cents, to $14.72 a barrel. March unleaded gasoline gained 0.10 cent, to 43.16 cents a gallon.
Heating oil stockpiles have fallen by about 22 percent since January.
"I had a feeling we could see heating oil get one last rise out of this cold weather," a trader with Arb Oil said. But, he warned, "I think this might be the last hurrah before it starts falling again."

HEADLINE: Year's First Price Data Show Little Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
The Government today offered its first reading on inflation since the Federal Reserve's move last week to raise interest rates, and the data looked good to many economists.
Prices received by American producers for finished goods rose two-tenths of 1 percent in January, the Labor Department found, as jumps for gasoline, cars and tobacco were mostly offset by declines for food and heating oil. 
 The price data seemed unlikely to upset the Federal Reserve, which raised short-term interest rates last Friday for the first time in five years in an effort to keep prices and expectations about them in check.
Today's price data did, however, show a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent when the erratic food and energy components were excluded, the biggest such rise since January 1993.
Although the period covered by today's reading preceded the Fed's action, and therefore could not be taken as a sign that its higher interest rates were having an effect, many investors were concerned that a big jump in today's figures could have compelled the Fed to raise rates yet again. Analysts, noting that the number of items falling in price about equaled those rising last month, generally expect that the next Fed tightening will be months away.
A separate report from the Commerce Department today said that harsh weather and the California earthquake kept shoppers at home last month, pushing retail sales down five-tenths of 1 percent.
"Inflation remained under control while severe winter weather dampened consumers' shopping habits," Merrill Lynch concluded in a commentary for clients. Despite continuing bad weather, Merrill Lynch predicted the economy would grow at a 3.5 percent pace in the current quarter compared with about 6 percent in the October-December period.
Although economists were surprised by the weakness in retail sales, today's results did little to undermine the conviction of most economists that the economy is on a path of moderate growth -- though throttled back from a very strong finish in 1993 -- while showing only scattered signs of faster inflation.
Once again, the figures posed interpretive challenges because of revisions, new seasonal adjustment factors and downright weird numbers in addition to the disruptions of winter weather. With the Government in Washington essentially closed today because of the weather, private analysts were on their own.
Retail sales, which account for about one-third of economic activity, totaled $180.96 billion last month, 7 percent above the January 1993 level, with no adjustment for inflation.
Although most analysts had expected a modest gain in sales last month, the decline was not large and was generally dismissed as a result of weather and a consumer retrenchment after the holidays.
"Consumers were overextended anyway" as their spending increased faster than their incomes, said Evelina M. Tainer, president of Prime Economic Consulting in Chicago.
 
Earlier Data Revised

 
 But analysts also noted that the department revised upward its tally for sales in both November and December, the latter to a gain of 1.2 percent instead of the eight-tenths of 1 percent originally reported.
Sales of cars and other durable goods -- defined as items lasting at least three years -- slumped 1.6 percent after a string of hefty gains, which, except for a September decline, averaged more than 2 percent for each month since March.
Receipts at automobile dealers fell 1.3 percent last month, a result seemingly at odds with previous reports showing that dealers sold more cars. This puzzle, some suggested, might reflect exceptionally large sales to fleets or that individual customers were buying less expensive models.
Excluding autos, retail sales fell three-tenths of 1 percent in January.
The other main durable-goods categories also tumbled. Merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes posted a 2.4 percent drop while those selling furniture and other equipment for the home took in 1 percent less than in December.
Nondurables, which have lagged as housing and cars powered an economic takeoff since Labor Day, held their own last month, edging up one-tenth of 1 percent.
Gains were 2.1 percent for gasoline service stations, 1.9 percent for drug and proprietary stores and five-tenths of 1 percent for department stores and others selling general merchandise. But these were almost offset by declines of 1.7 percent for clothing stores, 1.2 percent for restaurants and bars and one-tenth of 1 percent for food stores.
 
Puzzling Gasoline Numbers

 
 Analysts also found anomalies in the price data, most prominent of which was a 6.5 percent rebound in the price of gasoline, the biggest jump in more than three years.
Severe weather, they observed, not only reduces driving but also tends to raise demand for heating oil. And since refineries produce both products together -- the ability to adjust the mix of the products is limited -- more production of heating oil means greater supplies of gasoline.
As a result of lower demand and higher supplies, there has been intense price competititon, with gasoline retailing recently at less than 90 cents a gallon in some places, like southeastern Pennsylvania. Economists said today that even if gasoline was priced correctly in January's Producer Price Index it has certainly retreated since.
Whatever uneasiness the price figures inspired involved either the higher "core" rate or the fact that raw materials other than food and energy posted another hefty advance.
Core inflation for finished goods averaged three-tenths of 1 percent in the latest three months. This contrasted with the August-October period when prices fell in two months and barely rose in the third. On the other hand, the core rate for the latest 12 months was just four-tenths of 1 percent, the same as for January, a comforting fact, analysts said.
 
Rises in 2 Sectors

 
 Prices for goods at the intermediate stage of production -- a sack of flour, for example -- climbed two-tenths of 1 percent, reversing a December drop of that size. Durable goods used in manufacturing rose two-tenths of 1 percent, compared with a surge of nine-tenths in December, as hot rolled steel sheet and strip fell 1.1 percent and steel bars rose much less than in January.
Materials for making nondurable goods, like chemicals, eased two-tenths of 1 percent after falling three-tenths of 1 percent in December.
At the crude stage of production, prices rose 1.3 percent over all, to retrace about half of December's decline. Crude materials other than food and energy climbed 1.6 percent after surging 1.8 percent and 2.3 percent in the two preceding months. The main reason for the slowing was a 2.4 percent downturn for iron and steel scrap.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Municipals Beckon, But Beware Rate Rise

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty

 BODY:
FOR bond investors who are at sea over the improving economy, municipals may be an inviting port of call. But, like all who may be affected by rising interest rates, buyers of tax-exempts should consider ways to batten down the hatches.
Last August, the Clinton tax increases made municipals much more lucrative. Last year's low interest rates also produced a record $290 billion in new municipals, making them relatively cheap. Indeed, long-term municipals are now earning 83 percent of what comparable, federally taxable Treasuries earn. 
 At this high ratio, "The tax-free feature is almost gravy," said James Lebenthal, a New York dealer.
This year added another attraction to municipals: the belief that new ones will soon be much rarer. "1993 was a flood; 1994 will be a drought," said Ian A. MacKinnon, the bond chief at Vanguard Group. This January saw only $14.7 billion in new issues, while January 1993 saw $18.4 billion.
If the dearth continues, it will put upward pressure on the price of municipals. This means get-'em-now-while-they're-cheap, of course, but it also means a blunting of today's big bond bugaboo -- rising interest rates.
Should long rates rise half a percentage point this year, "the price of Treasuries will decline 5 percent and municipals by only 3 or 4 percent," said Paul Williams, research director at John Nuveen & Company.
Finally, as tax revenues grow with the economy, dealers are offering many confident buy recommendations. James F. Lynch, editor of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory newsletter ($250, 212 663-5552), likes a $13 million Cambridge, Mass., bond because the city's major industries -- schools and health -- are looking up. He likes a $400 million North Carolina bond, too, since the state "has put its financial house in order."
Mr. MacKinnon of Vanguard likes bonds from New York -- city and state. "Wall Street is on a roll," he explained, "and the state's economy is diversified." Specifically, Mr. Lebenthal recommends the state's Dormitory Authority bonds.
All in all, municipals sound good -- but they are still bonds. How can an investor profit safely if the economy is entering a period of rising rates?
"Buy and hold" is the customary answer. By holding, an investor receives the stated interest during the life of the bond and, at maturity, its face, or par, value. The strategy shields investors from notoriously unpredictable interest rates.
Unfortunately, while mutual funds have many virtues -- expert managers, diversification -- they lack the ability to buy and hold.
"A fund is forever -- it never matures," said Wayne F. Nelson, a broker at Merrill Lynch. Fund managers must buy and sell bonds to put new money to use, to pay redemptions and to plump up yields undercut by management fees. If rates rise, this unavoidable activity will spell trouble.
"You may be the world's best health-stock picker," Mr. Nelson reasoned. "But if the health sector goes down, so does your fund." And fund trades can create taxable capital gains -- something municipal investors presumably want to avoid.
Those who think this defect outweighs funds' virtues should consider individual bonds -- if they have $50,000 to diversify adequately.
Generally traded over the counter in blocks of five $1,000 bonds, municipals are always sold net, "so you don't know the commission," Mr. Nelson said. Thus, he advises comparison-shopping -- asking three brokers for prices on, say, $25,000 of New York City A bonds. Or buy new issues, whose prices are known.
Merrill charges commissions of 0.125 percent to 2 percent on bonds, Mr. Nelson said, though 4 percent fees are not unknown in the industry.
Be mindful of bonds' terms of call, or early redemption. Calls expose investors to the very interest rate risk that the "buy and hold" method neutralizes. But wary investors can avoid the danger. "There are noncallables all over," Mr. Lynch said.
Investors can also "buy and hold" municipals through unit investment trusts, available through bankers and brokers. Like funds, trusts are professionally assembled, diversified portfolios, with modest minimum investments and monthly dividend checks. But, unlike funds, trusts are passive. The bonds are held to maturity.
Nuveen, a big packager of these trusts along with Merrill Lynch and Van Kampen Merritt, has "3,000 outstanding trusts with $20 billion," Mr. Williams said. Nuveen Short Intermediate Insured Trust 27 is typical. It has 14 issues, a five-year average maturity and a $5,000 minimum investment. And a sales fee. A $20,000 purchase carries a 3 percent charge; a $150,000 one, 2.6 percent.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
Rising Interest Rates Could Hit Adjustable Mortgages Soon

BYLINE: By Nick Ravo

 BODY:
Among the first consumers to feel the impact of rising interest rates will be homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages. For them, higher payments are at least six weeks away and probably longer, according to housing economists and interest rate analysts.
Keith T. Gumbinger, an analyst at HSH Associates, an interest rate research firm in Butler, N.J., said the vast majority -- more than 90 percent -- of adjustable mortgages have rates that change annually on their anniversary date. 
 Lenders are required to give 45 days' notice of any rate adjustment. Thus, a homeowner with a loan that has an anniversary date of March 1 had to be notified of the loan's new rate by Jan. 15, which was before the recent rise in rates.
"But if your rate adjustment is coming due in April, you are probably going to see it go up a quarter-point," Mr. Gumbinger said.
On Feb. 4, the Federal Reserve raised a key short-term interest rate to 3.25 percent from 3 percent, a move that has pushed up other short-term rates, like one-year Treasury securities. Many consumers' mortgages use these securities as a benchmark for adjusting rates.
"If they are tied to the one-year Treasury bond, it's possibly going to have an adverse effect on their monthly payment," said Robert Rosenblatt, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
About 27 percent of all home loans have adjustable rates, according to the mortgage group. In addition to loans that adjust annually, the category includes some loans that adjust every six months, two years or three years. A few mortgages even have rates that are fixed for the first five or seven years and that adjust once to a new rate for the balance of the loan.
People who took out adjustable loans last year may not be affected by an increase in rates this year. That's because adjustable-rate mortgages usually cap a rate increase at two percentage points a year and at six percentage points over the life of the loan.
When adjustables come due for the first time, the increase is generally the full two percentage points, because the initial rate was a low "teaser" rate, Mr. Gumbinger said. Consumers presumably have prepared their budgets with this increase in mind and will not have to worry about unexpected increases for another year.
Eventually, the rates on these teaser loans will climb to be more reflective of market rates, which are the one-year Treasury rate and a 2.75 percent markup imposed by the lender.

Navratilova Exits Early At Chicago of All Places

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Martina Navratilova received an unwanted reminder tonight of why she has declared this year her last in competitive singles play. She was forced to take early retirement from the quarterfinals of the Virginia Slims of Chicago, an event she had captured a record 12 times, by 18-year-old Magdalena Maleeva.
"If this tournament is any indication, I'll be crying after every match I play," said the 37-year-old Navratilova, who was too distraught after her 6-4, 6-3 loss to participate in a bittersweet ceremony to honor her longevity here. 
 Instead, the top-seeded Navratilova retreated to prepare to meet Maleeva yet again tonight, in doubles, and the vanity license plates and city park plaque went temporarily unclaimed.
 
Key Chain Is Filled
 Navratilova, unwilling to turn her final circuit into a circus, had already declined to accept a key to the city. After all, she already had one, thanks to her accomplishment here in 1992, when she not only won the event the 12th time but also broke Chris Evert's record by collecting her 158th career title.
Tonight Navratilova couldn't outhit the fifth-seeded Maleeva from the baseline, nor was she able to outwit her from the net, and she ended up with a defeat that left her panting from the vain effort of chasing balls she couldn't quite catch.
"I really did not quite take it seriously enough in the beginning, and in the second set I was on my heels the whole time," said Navratilova, who lost to Steffi Graf in her 1994 inaugural event a week ago in Tokyo.

 
 
Had Won Two Straight

 
 Maleeva shocked Navratilova in the second round of the United States Open last September, but the veteran had handily ousted the teen-ager in their last two meetings.
A double fault put Navratilova behind by 3-5 in the first set, and although she broke directly back, she again failed to hold serve in the 10th game, in which Maleeva claimed the set with a backhand that traced the sideline. And once Navratilova fell behind by 4-2 in the second set, she "started to get shaky," said Maleeva, who needed three match points to end Navratilova's spectacular singles run here.
Until tonight, Navratilova felt no sense of nostalgia about her visit here, but the instant she wafted a final backhand just beyond the corner she was aiming at, her deflation overtook her. It hurt to lose, particularly for the last time, but Navratilova said her concern about presenting a classy Chicago swan song wasn't the reason she lost.
"That helps to push me, it doesn't make me any worse," she said of her retirement plans. "It's not a detrimental thing."

N.B.A. Wants the Timberwolves to Stay

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Feb. 11

 BODY:
The National Basketball Association wants to keep the Minnesota Timberwolves where they are despite the interest of several United States cities in taking the franchise, Commissioner David Stern said today.
Stern said that while the support of the team's ownership and fans have been firm, the financial problems with the Wolves' arena, the Target Center, will be difficult to resolve. 
 "There's a concern about whether midsize cities can support a team," Stern said at a press conference in conjunction with the All-Star weekend. "There's a terrible economic issue involved. We have to work to have an apparatus to keep teams in cities like this. The N.B.A. wants a team here. We want the Timberwolves to stay here in the present building in the present form."
 
Team's Future to Be Discussed
 Stern said the issue of the future of the franchise will be discussed in N.B.A. Board of Governors meetings this weekend, "but we want to turn down the rhetoric and focus on the issues. I'm more concerned with solving the problem than making headlines."
Stern said among the cities that have expressed an interest in the franchise are New Orleans, Nashville, San Diego, St. Louis and Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla.
"But our first choice is for teams to stay where they are," Stern said. "It's nice to be wanted, but we're not putting teams up for the highest bidder."
Stern admitted the Target Center "is an economic drain, but the support for the team is fine. I've been impressed with the ownership."
In discussing the state of the N.B.A., Stern said that despite the recent retirements of Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, television ratings, attendance and revenues are all up.
"You can't replace Michael, Larry and Magic, but you can't replace Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Bob Pettit, either," Stern said. "What you do is keep going forward. There's been a tremendous influx of talent that continues to come in."

 
 
A New Look: Dunks and Rookies
 All-Star Saturday has a different look this year. The Legends game is gone, replaced by a mini All-Star game involving rookies only.
The dunk contest will be shorter. Instead of the slow-paced, one-dunk-at-a-time format used in years past, this year's contest will have players doing as many dunks as they can in 90 seconds during the opening round.
The only event that will look the same as it used to is the 3-point shootout. But instead of being held before the dunk contest, it will come at the end of the night.
Competing in the 3-point contest are B. J. Armstrong of Chicago, Dana Barros of Philadelphia, Dell Curry of Charlotte, Dale Ellis of San Antonio, Steve Kerr of Chicago, Eric Murdock of Milwaukee, Mark Price of Cleveland and Mitch Richmond of Sacramento.
The lineup for the dunk contest is down from eight to six players this year. Competing are Antonio Davis of Indiana, Allan Houston of Detroit, Shawn Kemp of Seattle, Robert Pack of Denver, Isaiah Rider of Minnesota and James Robinson of Portland.
The rookie game will have two teams of eight players each, coached by former N.B.A. coaches Doug Collins and K. C. Jones.
On Collins's team are Chris Webber of Golden State, Toni Kukoc of Chicago, Dino Radja of Boston, Rider, Davis, Lindsay Hunter of Detroit, Sam Cassell of Houston and Byron Russell of Utah.
On Jones's team are P. J. Brown of the Nets, Anfernee Hardaway of Orlando, Shawn Bradley of Philadelphia, Jamal Mashburn and Popeye Jones of Dallas, Nick Van Exel of the Los Angeles Lakers, Calbert Cheaney of Washington and Chris Mills of Cleveland.

HEADLINE: Dodging a Trade Battle

 BODY:
In the end, they were two men hemmed in by politics. President Clinton, leader of a Japan-bashing Administration, could not accept Japan's formulaic promises to open its markets. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, barely holding onto office, could not appear to cave in to American demands to measure American imports.
So they walked away without signing a hollow trade agreement that invited ridicule. In a way, it was refreshing to hear them announce -- not in these words, of course -- that they had gone for a political survival pact rather than a trade agreement. The two leaders reassured the public that the trade rift would not compromise the otherwise strong and friendly relationship between the two allies. The moment, both leaders agreed, called for reflection, not recrimination. 
 At the core of the dispute is a persistent $50 billion trade imbalance that has survived dozens of previous attempts to erase it. Last July the U.S. and Japan entered into a vaguely worded "framework" agreement that committed Japan to reduce its trade surplus and specifically open its market to foreign cars and car parts, insurance and telecommunications equipment and medical equipment. Left unsettled was how to measure whether Japan was living up to its import-creating commitments; that question was supposed to be answered by yesterday's meeting.
Mr. Clinton wants to impose numerical benchmarks that would decisively measure market access; he insists that those benchmarks need not set specific import levels. Mr. Hosokawa rejects numerical benchmarks because, he fears, they will evolve into import targets -- forcing him to dictate purchasing decisions of private industry. That prescription, he said, would reverse the deregulatory thrust of his reform Government.
So where do the two leaders head from here?
For his part, Mr. Clinton can first lower the political flame under the controversy. He misrepresents the cause and exaggerates the importance of the trade deficit. Trade deficits are home-grown, caused not by Japanese bureaucrats but by low U.S. savings: Americans buy more than they produce, and must import the difference. If Japan were to sell less to the U.S., some other country would sell more to willing U.S. buyers. That said, Japan does practice protectionism, though its methods are subtle. Its practices undermine faith in international rules of fair trade and victimize specific U.S. industries. Mr. Clinton is right to demand that the Japanese play straight.
Specifically, he can exhort Japan to do more than previously agreed to cut taxes and otherwise spur its economy; some of the extra spending will spill over into imports. He can continue to demand that practices fully under Mr. Hosokawa's control -- like government procurement methods -- be changed to give foreign companies a fairer shot at contracts. And he can demand an end to discriminatory rules that keep financial service markets closed to foreigners. If Japan refuses to yield on these specific demands, the U.S. would be justified in retaliating under international rules.
But Mr. Clinton treads on shaky ground when he broaches specific market outcomes. One danger is that numerical targets will be driven more by politics than by economics. Besides, there is no basis for determining, for example, how many large cars with steering wheels on the wrong side the Japanese should buy.
For his part, Mr. Hosokawa could produce a list of quantifiable criteria -- such as the number of licensing roadblocks a foreign insurance company or investment firm must hurdle -- that the U.S. could use to measure access. Those criteria need not set a specific numerical target.
If there was any cause for hope yesterday, it was that the two leaders seemed genuinely devoted to finding compromise that met each's legitimate objectives. Perhaps with the deadline of the summit gone, and if politically volatile events in both countries pass, they can find common ground.

And Bear in Mind
(Editor's choices of other recent books of particular interest)
 
BEYOND DESPAIR: Three Lectures and a Conversation With Philip Roth, by Aharon Appelfeld. (Fromm, $17.50.) The Israeli novelist argues that literature can and must deal with the Holocaust or give up its pretensions to be a vehicle of spiritual apprehension.
 
THE BINGO PALACE, by Louise Erdrich. (HarperCollins, $23.) Three decent people look for love on a windblown prairie in this novel whose daily life is enriched by supernatural events and the presence of Indian spirits.
 
BITTER WINDS: A Memoir of My Years in China's Gulag, by Harry Wu and Carolyn Wakeman. (Robert L. Bernstein/Wiley, $22.95.) Mr. Wu's memoir of 19 years in labor camps is grimly familiar as to abuse and deprivation but grotesque and surreal in its account of acting out each new political rectification campaign right in the heart of the prison system.
 
BRAZIL, by John Updike. (Knopf, $23.) In the vast, trackless wilds of a Brazil the author freely admits making up out of whole cloth, a tragicomic knight-errant and his dolly, madly in love, break all the rules of class and race.
 
THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE, by George Dawes Green. (Warner, $19.95.) Romulus Ledbetter, Mr. Green's protagonist, is a homeless, black, paranoid private eye who can be roused to propriety only by a case as interesting as the one Mr. Green has dreamed up for his first novel.
 
CROSSING THE RIVER, by Caryl Phillips. (Knopf, $22.) A novel, covering two and a half centuries, that presents a brilliantly coherent mythified vision of the irreversible African diaspora.
 
GOING NATIVE, by Stephen Wright. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $22.) A road novel that explodes the conventions of the genre as a weird, dangerous shape-shifting protagonist remakes his identity on the way to California.
 
HOW WE DIE: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter, by Sherwin B. Nuland. (Knopf, $24.) The author, a physician, surgeon and teacher for 35 years, offers a wise, humane and cultivated examination of what happens to people when they die, omitting none of the clinical detail.
 
IMAGES: My Life in Film, by Ingmar Bergman. (Arcade, $27.95.) At 75, the great Swedish film maker confronts and reveals himself as artist and man in this evocation of his career, based on a fresh viewing of all his movies.
 
JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES. Volume 2: The Economist as Saviour 1920-1937, by Robert Skidelsky. (Allen Lane/Penguin, $37.50.) How Keynes reshaped the world's economy, made a lot of money and married a ballerina, by an economics professor whose mastery of many subjects seems to match Keynes's own.
 
JOSEPHINE: The Hungry Heart, by Jean-Claude Baker and Chris Chase. (Random House, $27.50.) Prodigious research and outstanding narrative fluency mark this biography of Josephine Baker (1906-75), the irresistible American institution of French revues, cabaret and film.

HEADLINE: After 13 years of drama and farce. . . EXIT THE CRITIC. . . humming the music and settling the scores.

BYLINE: By Frank Rich; Frank Rich was the chief drama critic of The Times for 13 years. He is now a columnist for The Times's Op-Ed page.

 BODY:
My career as the chief drama critic of The New York Times began with a car crash and a death, and ended with another car crash and another death. But don't get me wrong: there was lots of life, on stage and off, along the way.
The first crash took place on a hot morning in the Berkshires in July 1980, shortly after I arrived at The Times to serve as a second-stringer to Walter Kerr. The previous night I had covered "Candida" at the Williamstown Theater Festival. Driving back to New York, I lost control of the rental car, which skidded across the country road and flipped over on its roof. 
 I landed on an examination table back in Manhattan, where an orthopedist inspected my fractured collarbone. As the doctor manipulated my shoulder, making me writhe in pain, he looked solemnly into my eyes.
"Tell me something," he said. "Could you get me a pair for 'Barnum' for Saturday night?"
This was my introduction to the omnipotence that strangers attach to the job of drama critic at The New York Times.
What would follow was a 13-year journey full of hairpin turns and plot twists. I would have far more than my share of wild journalistic adventures, be reviled as the Butcher of Broadway and have a front-row seat for a seismic shift in the American theater.
But back in 1980, I realize now, I was still something of an innocent. For one thing, I believed that it was nothing to bounce back from a car crash. Even so, my injury slowed me down, ejecting me from my beat as abruptly as I had landed in it that spring, when Arthur Gelb recruited me from Time magazine, where I was a film and television critic. My torso was elaborately wrapped by the doctor, and I couldn't type easily.
I was still recuperating when Arthur called me with an urgent request. Defying Broadway practice, the producer David Merrick was mysteriously canceling previews of his new musical, "42d Street." Critics would have to cover the show the old-fashioned way -- on deadline on opening night -- rather than follow the standard practice of the past decade, attending a final preview and writing at a slightly more leisurely (and thoughtful) pace. Walter Kerr, who had been ailing himself, did not want the assignment under those conditions. Neither did I. This was the most high-profile Broadway show in years. I was still a novice theater critic, little known by Times readers and unsure of myself. Throw in the added pressure of a one-hour deadline and. . . .
"Are you crazy?" Arthur shouted, all but leaping out of the phone to dismiss my objections. He was a one-of-a-kind editor who exceeded even Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's newspapermen in chutzpah and verve. "How can you not cover it?"
When the big night arrived, I was a wreck. But as I saw the huge billboard above the Winter Garden marquee on Broadway, I also felt an undeniable rush of excitement. I thought of my first visit to the Winter Garden, as a teen-ager on the outside looking in: watching Barbra Streisand from the last row of the orchestra during her final weeks in "Funny Girl," in a seat my stepfather had me fetch from an illegal broker in a dusty walk-up hovel near the old Gaiety Delicatessen on West 47th Street.
And I thought fondly of David Merrick. His shameless promotion of his productions, often at the expense of critics he baited through practical jokes and irrational public ravings, had always struck me as part of the essential romance of Broadway. As a child, I had read every article I could find about him.
Then again, once the theater became my chosen escape from a troubled home, I had read everything I could find on the subject. The stage was my obsession from age 6 -- an idiosyncratic one, to put it mildly, for a child growing up in the sleepy provincial Washington of the 1950's.
By my early teens, I had become so conspicuous a Stage Door Johnny that the manager of the National Theater, Washington's one Broadway tryout house in the pre-Kennedy Center era, took pity on me and hired me as a ticket taker, at $4 a show. (Plus all the performances I could watch free of charge.) That's where I saw Merrick and the director Gower Champion put in an elaborate new number for Carol Channing at the end of Act I of "Hello, Dolly!" And Merrick, Lauren Bacall and Abe Burrows frantically teaching Barry Nelson how not to bump into the turntable sets of "Cactus Flower," Nelson having just arrived in Washington to replace the leading man the producer had canned the night before.
If someone had told me then that someday I would not only be attending a David Merrick opening on Broadway, directed by Gower Champion no less, but sitting down front and writing about what I saw for the whole world to read in The New York Times the next morning, I would have sooner believed I'd win the Nobel Prize for my youthful stabs at poetry. For The Times was also inextricably bound up with my passion. From earliest memory, it was Al Hirschfeld's drawings of plays and the imposing full-page advertisements heralding them in the Sunday Times drama section -- and then the Brooks Atkinson reviews the morning after -- that had transported my imagination to the New York theater while I impatiently languished 200 miles away.
Now here I was, at "42d Street," and high as could be -- until the end of the opening number. Then the leaden dialogue commenced, and my heart sank: "42d Street" was no match for "Hello, Dolly!" "Oliver!" "Carnival!" or any other Merrick musical with an exclamation point in its title from my youth. Anxiously, I started taking notes so I could illustrate with examples the disappointment I felt in my gut. I had a clear idea of my job -- to report what I saw on stage honestly and pointedly, as I might in conversation with a friend -- and it never occurred to me that someone might object to what I wrote.
When the show ended, I waited through one curtain call and ran up the aisle to make my deadline at The Times, seven blocks down Broadway. I hadn't reached the street when an acquaintance in the movie business stopped me.
"Frank, I have to talk to you," he said.
"I'm on deadline," I replied, annoyed, racing toward a cab.
"But I've got big news," he said. "Gower Champion is dead."
What? I had read that Champion had been elusive during the Washington tryout of "42d Street." But dead? He was 59 and not rumored to be seriously ill.
Panic-stricken, I looked back toward the one open door leading into the theater. The sound of the ovation still thundered, but my informant had disappeared. This was big news. But I wasn't a reporter; I was a theater critic, and a fledgling one at that. Had I been handed the scoop of the century? Or was I the patsy in another fabled Merrick hoax? And how could I find out and still write my review by deadline?
As I slid into the cab beside my wife, Gail, I looked toward the theater one last desperate time and discovered a solitary couple emerging -- Arthur Gelb and his wife, Barbara, who had stayed only long enough for the second curtain call.
I leaped back out and, from the middle of Broadway, started waving my sling and shrieking at them. Arthur looked at me as if I was having a breakdown, then ran over, yanking Barbara with him. I told them my news, and Arthur said: "Gower Champion dead! That's impossible!" But they piled into the jump seats, and the driver raced down Broadway to The Times.
When, a few minutes later, we emerged from the elevator on the third floor to enter the deserted culture department, every phone seemed to beringing off the hook. Arthur picked one up to learn that Merrick had just announced Champion's abrupt death from the Winter Garden stage, saving the bulletin for the very end of the curtain calls.
Arthur dashed to the news desk as the first edition was about to close to break into the front page with a picture and caption announcing the news. (The caption carefully said that Merrick had announced Champion's death rather than that Champion was dead, lest the producer be up to no good.) I sat down to write my bittersweet mixed review for the second edition and proceeded to sweat right through my clothes. John Corry, the drama reporter, breathlessly arrived, and Arthur seated him a desk away from me to hammer out the page-one news story.
Big-time journalism! Big-time Broadway! What more could I want? I made my deadline. Once I had, I sat at the terminal alone, my shoulder suddenly throbbing again. Then I broke unexpectedly into tears, partly, perhaps, out of psychic release, now that the pressure had lifted, but also out of some sense of mourning for Champion. I had never met him, but I took the loss personally anyway, out of an inchoate sense that some of my old childhood fantasies about the theater had died with him that night.
Merrick got so much publicity from his brilliant stage management of the announcement of Champion's death -- the director had actually died early that afternoon, but the producer suppressed the news -- that it didn't matter what any review said. "42d Street" was a smash.
And I was the living proof of its undying Broadway legend, the understudy who went out a nobody and came back a star. When I returned to work for real, minus the sling, after Labor Day, Abe Rosenthal, the executive editor, told me that Walter wanted to return to Sunday reviewing and that I was the new chief drama critic.
I called my mother. She had always indulged my twin passions for newspaper writing and the theater; it was she who took me to Broadway for the first time as a child, as an unspoken consolation for the pain of her and my father's divorce. By then my fate had been sealed, and now, 20-odd years later, at age 31, I was doing exactly what she said she always knew I was born to do. "I can't believe it," I told her. "I can," she said.
THE FIRST SHOW I HAD TO REVIEW AS CHIEF CRITIC WAS AN innocuous Off Broadway play, "An Act of Kindness," about which I have forgotten everything except that it took me about eight hours to write the 800-word review, so heavily did the august responsibilities of my new job with its preposterously official-sounding title weigh on me.
But I soon loosened up. I found a method for preserving the spontaneity of theatergoing, so essential to the joy of the experience. I didn't read about new plays before seeing them (or read their scripts); I didn't listen to friends either. This allowed me to still feel that rush of anticipation and surprise when the curtain went up.
I gradually aspired to write reviews as stories evoking the play's impact rather than as merely report cards leaning on adjectives and plot. This, I felt, was a way to engage the majority of readers, who never went to the theater no matter what the reviews, and to reach those readers like my younger self, who wanted to go the theater but couldn't, for reasons of finances or geography. I also learned that if I had anything positive to say, say it first, because the artists who do valiant work in a mediocre enterprise are, in the journalistic sense, the real news -- the lead.
Just the same, I couldn't shake the sense that my calling was a bit arcane, that I had arrived at my dream job after the dream had ended. In college, friends had ridiculed my obsession with so obsolete an art form and had argued (correctly, as it turned out) that I was much more likely to find a job writing about movies than plays after graduation. As I looked around the theater in the early 1980's, I saw few critics who were remotely my contemporaries. When I had been a movie critic in the 70's, by contrast, most of my colleagues were roughly my age.
It wasn't difficult to see why. The seismic cultural events that happened in the theater in my youth now happened at the movies. No theatrical event was capable of creating the American earthquake that "Long Day's Journey Into Night," "My Fair Lady" or "Marat/Sade" had in my formative years.
Yet the talent in the American theater was still considerable, if often young and not widely known. I found a mission in championing new voices -- David Henry Hwang, Beth Henley, William Finn, Marsha Norman, Eric Bogosian, among others, early on -- even as I delighted in charting established talents like Sam Shepard, Michael Bennett, David Mamet, Lanford Wilson and Athol Fugard. Joseph Papp, in a surprising Anglophilic phase, was producing such invigorating works as the Kevin Kline-Linda Ronstadt "Pirates of Penzance" and David Hare's "Plenty," starring Kate Nelligan. In a single week, an Off Broadway theatergoer could discover two sensational new young actresses: Laurie Metcalf (in "Balm in Gilead") and Holly Hunter (in "The Miss Firecracker Contest"). Broadway's diversity could range from Michael Frayn's "Noises Off," the single funniest play I ever saw on the job, to "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," in which the angry black playwright August Wilson introduced himself to a white, middle-class audience by having the fearsome actor Charles Dutton figuratively hold it at knifepoint.
The work and hours were daunting, but I could not disagree with friends who said that I had the best job in the world. When I was virtually alone among my colleagues in liking a show -- Michael Bennett's "Dreamgirls," for instance -- it was a kick to buck the consensus. Even the occasional contretemps were fun. Displeased by both my review and other Times coverage of "42d Street," Merrick tried and failed to place a pair of agate-type ads at the bottom of the front page: "Every time I pass The New York Times building I get hit with a wave of pyromania -- David Merrick" and "Anyone having the power of pyrokinesis, please contact me -- David Merrick." When I once happened to walk past Merrick's table at Elaine's restaurant, he intercepted me, then dressed me down in a low, snide voice out of Victorian melodrama -- as his stricken dinner guests, one of them Mary Tyler Moore, looked on.
He must have sensed that I was more titillated than insulted; critics may not be, as is generally presumed, frustrated actors or playwrights, but few of us mind playing our assigned role in the timeless sideshows of the rialto.
Arthur Gelb, who had been a drama critic and reporter in the Brooks Atkinson era at The Times, inculcated me from the start in my journalistic role: to serve the paper's readers, not the theater's public relations needs. A classic conflict between The Times's view of my job and the theater's popped up early in my first full season. The Shubert Organization, perhaps emboldened by Merrick's successful ploy with "42d Street," announced that critics must cover its new import, "Amadeus," on opening night, rather than at a preview. The Shuberts' theory, one of the many old wives' tales among aged Broadway hands, was that critics would write more favorable reviews with more quotable quotes if pumped full of deadline adrenaline and subjected to the cheers of a house full of backers.
In truth, a critic quickly learns to tune out any audience response in reaching his own judgment. The old opening-night system was deplored by many critics, who often had to miss the end of a show to make a deadline and felt it unfair to review artists' work as if it were a fire or sporting event. (Covering the opening night of "A Streetcar Named Desire" in 1947, Brooks Atkinson had to miss the last scene, which meant that he reviewed the play without having heard "the kindness of strangers.") The system's collapse was inevitable in any case once opening nights on Broadway ceased to be real opening nights in the late 1960's, when New York preview performances for paying audiences began to replace the out-of-town tryout and an "opening" became an artificially designated event.
Merrick had succeeded in getting critics to cover "42d Street" on opening night because it was a bona fide event; at huge financial cost, he had canceled the final previews, leaving the press no option but to surrender to the promotional gala he wanted. The Shuberts, by contrast, were loath to waste money in pursuit of principle. They wanted critics to cover "Amadeus" at the so-called opening, which they could pack with cheerleaders, but they had no intention of canceling highly remunerative previews presold to theater parties.
Gerald Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, called Arthur to plead his case. Arthur told Schoenfeld, "I promise you that Frank Rich will be at 'Amadeus' on opening night." Which I would be. What Arthur did not tell him was that I would already have filed my review, since I would buy a ticket for a preview.
As it happened, I had met Gerry Schoenfeld in childhood when the Broadway trade organization, the League of New York Theaters, hired my stepfather, a Washington lawyer, to lobby the Johnson Administration for the removal of the excise tax on theater tickets. In the 1970's in New York, I had occasionally run into Gerry, who sometimes graciously passed me into the previews of Shubert shows. Neither he nor I could ever have imagined that I would someday end up as The Times's drama critic.
But the day I went to see "Amadeus," I walked right in front of Gerry, who seemed too busy counting the house to notice anything else and failed to recognize me as I went up the stairs to my seat in the Broadhurst mezzanine.
My mission accomplished, my review filed, I went to the "Amadeus" opening. True to form, Gerry sat right behind me to exert maximum influence on my thoughts. He apparently did not find it odd that I didn't take a single note and didn't hurry up the aisle at the final curtain. But, as I would later learn from a friend at the opening-night party, he had no sooner announced to the assembled that there would be no Times review until the following morning when someone ran in waving my first-edition review in his face. He was not amused.
It didn't seem to matter to him that the review was a rave, or that "Amadeus" was a hit. A few weeks after the opening, I was walking on Fifth Avenue with my friend Wendy Wasserstein, a playwright as yet unknown to the Shuberts, for whom she would later make a ton of money with "The Heidi Chronicles" and "The Sisters Rosensweig." (With no help from me; I never reviewed plays written by her or by the few other friends I had in the theater before I became a critic.) In front of Tiffany's we ran smack into Gerry's wife, Pat, who berated me for a good 20 minutes, accusing me of betraying the friendship of our two families.
The "Amadeus" incident marked a surge in the Shuberts' paranoia about The Times, which dated back to the original Shubert brothers in 1915, who had barred the paper's critic, Alexander Woollcott, from one of its theaters. (The Times's publisher, Adolph S. Ochs, beat back the challenge by rejecting Shubert advertising, which proved to cost the Shuberts more business than it did The Times.) Arthur and I soon discovered that the Shuberts had canvassed the staff at the restaurant where we ate together during the dinner break of the eight-hour "Nicholas Nickleby" to ascertain advance word on my review. (In vain, since I was compulsive about never discussing any play before my review appeared.)
Rather more successfully, the Shuberts revived the old tradition of finding out reviews in advance through a Times mole with computer access. When Gerry Schoenfeld brazenly told Abe Rosenthal my review of the musical "Song & Dance" before the curtain went up on opening night and before Abe had read the review himself, The Times set out to find the culprit. Sherlock Holmes was not required -- an obscure editor was discovered to be a conspicuous and frequent lunchtime guest of top theatrical executives at Sardi's -- and the electronic leaks were plugged.
BROADWAY WAS NOT ALL "Amadeus" and "Dreamgirls." At a time when production costs were still low enough for first-time producers to indulge their most catastrophic theatrical whims, covering the theater was as madcap as going to the circus. It became a running gag with me and Wendy Wasserstein, who would accompany me to anything, that many of the biggest bombs on Broadway had titles beginning with the letter M. ("Macbeth" also fell into this category; every production of this play I covered, whether with Philip Anglim, Nicol Williamson or Christopher Plummer, was a fiasco.) There was "Marlowe," a rock musical in which the titular playwright joined Shakespeare and Richard Burbage to smoke dope backstage at the Globe Theater, and "Merlin," in which the on-stage animals outnumbered the audience at the Mark Hellinger Theater on a snowy matinee day, and "Marilyn," a musical biography of Marilyn Monroe that had 16 producers. (Favorite line, spoken by Marilyn: "But you're Arthur Miller. How can you be so boring?")
"Moose Murders" was a special case. It is the worst play I've ever seen on a Broadway stage. A murder mystery set in a hunting lodge in the Adirondacks, it reached its climax when a mummified quadriplegic abruptly bolted out of his wheelchair to kick an intruder, dressed in a moose costume, in the groin.
Wendy and I saw "Moose Murders" at a Wednesday matinee. Hardly had the play started when the smell of vomit wafted through the orchestra at the Eugene O'Neill Theater. Gradually, those seated in the first few rows starting taking refuge in empty seats at the back of the house, until finally we and the apparent source of the exodus, a voluminous man third-row center, were virtually the only members of the audience in the front rows. Yet I feared that if we moved back, I might be too far away to give the play a fair shake.
Finally, my sense of justice gave way. I bolted to the back of the theater, where the press agent and other staff members of the production inevitably hang out at critics' performances, to seek a solution. To my amazement, however, there was no one in the back of the house; this sinking ship had already been abandoned. I retrieved Wendy, and we moved to the back row, where we watched the unfolding horror with no less amazement than we had from close up. "Moose Murders" closed on opening night, but its gallant cast members still list the credit in their Playbill biographies, usually preceded by the word "legendary."
FOR ALL THE FRIVOLOUS BROADWAY amateur nights like "Moose Murders" or "Shogun" (in which flying scenery beaned the leading man) or "Into the Light" (the first and last musical about the Shroud of Turin), there would always be professional failures in which talented people, working under the burden of the commercial theater's costly and rushed production schedule, would stumble. The saddest "M" flop of the early 80's was "Merrily We Roll Along," the last collaboration of the director Harold Prince and the songwriter Stephen Sondheim, both heroes of my youth. The show had first-rate songs -- the overture quickened my pulse in false anticipation of a triumph -- but what surrounded them was chaos. (Most critics didn't even like the songs.)
Or was I being too harsh? As I sat down to write I couldn't square my powerful emotional response to Sondheim's music with my disapproval of the soulless acting, ugly staging and pale characters. I felt queasy. While it can be fun to write a joke-strewn pan of a venal or lunatic theatrical catastrophe, whether "Moose Murders" or "Carrie," there is no pleasure in writing about a failure in which artists commit no crime other than fallibility in pursuit of high theatrical ambitions. But neither was there any point in pulling punches for Times readers who know better. It was a no-win situation.
Haunted by "Merrily," I went back to see it again at the final Saturday matinee. I bought a ticket at the half-price booth at Duffy Square, but only lasted an act. The show was at least as depressing as I remembered it, the audience was noisy and rude and what could I or any journalist do about any of it?
THE ANTITHESIS OF THE "MERRILY" experience was to feel that unmistakable sensation that something extraordinary was happening on a stage -- best of all, something new -- and that I would have the thrill of breaking the story.
Such nights, and they were not infrequent, made the job seem hopeful despite all the larger signs that the theater was collapsing as a business in New York. Ticket prices were rising; the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters were razed for the Marriott Marquis Hotel; even Merrick, who suffered a stroke during the run of "42d Street," had apparently retired. But a new and daring company like Steppenwolf in Chicago or an incendiary play like "Aunt Dan and Lemon," by Wallace Shawn, or an original talent like George Wolfe would still come along (usually Off Broadway).
One show that exemplified my stubborn faith was the very next Sondheim musical, "Sunday in the Park With George." The night I reviewed it, people were walking out all around me, yet as the first act ended, with the re-creation of a Georges Seurat canvas, I felt that tickling sensation on the back of my neck that always arrives when the theater speaks to me at a level so deep that my spirit responds before my mind.
I didn't understand everything that I had seen on stage that night. When all the reviews came out and were mostly hostile, I was full of self-doubt and shaken by the loneliness of my stand, especially since I couldn't articulate my response to "Sunday" to my own satisfaction. So I went back and saw it again and again and again -- and kept being moved and kept writing about it until I felt I had made my case. One consequence of my obsession was to dramatize The Times's power, since my essays kept alive a production that many others deemed worthy of a quick death.
I particularly angered the late Richard Hummler, of the trade publication Variety, who despised The Times's extensive coverage of the show nearly as much as he did the show itself. The theater's resentment of the iconoclastic Sondheim, always apparent in the anonymous and not-so-anonymous mail I perennially received from Broadway folk attacking him, eventually even surfaced on stage at the Tony Awards: Jerry Herman, who won the Tony for "La Cage aux Folles" over "Sunday in the Park," took a swipe at his rival. And now some of the venom spilled over to me, Sondheim's champion (for this show anyway).
For the first time, I found people in the theater questioning my motives in a personal way. Though theater professionals had always heartily (and understandably) protested negative reviews -- either with seriously argued letters or sly, Merrick-esque stunts (a picket line of chorus performers materialized on 43d Street after I panned a stage version of "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers") -- the tone changed. Page Six of The New York Post called to confirm the rumors that I had liked "Sunday" so much because its director, James Lapine, was my college roommate. (In fact, I had never met Lapine, who didn't attend my college and wasn't even my age.) Another, equally scurrilous rumor had me in bed with the show's press agent.
Apparently no one in the theater could imagine that I might like "Sunday in the Park" for the reasons I stated in print. But as the season wore on, some other critics began to reverse their stands about the show. "Sunday in the Park" won the Drama Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize. The supposed clout of The Times and those awards notwithstanding, however, it did not become a financial success.
IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1986, after "Sunday" closed, that I officially became the Butcher of Broadway. The traditional term was revived for my benefit by the British comedian Rowan Atkinson, who told London reporters that he held me responsible for the demise of a revue he brought to New York. I happened to be in London when Atkinson made his remarks. When I went to Heathrow a few days later to fly home, I was chased into a British Airways lounge by a couple of men in trench coats who turned out to be British tabloid reporters seeking a comment. It was a hilarious, surreal adventure, and in subsequent visits, almost anything I did was front-page news in the local tabloid press. Invitations to appear on British television rained down on me, to the point where the Savoy Hotel had to screen the avalanche of calls when I was in London. Only in England, where the theater is still center stage in the nation's cultural life as well as a major export industry, could a drama critic star in a farcical escapade right out of "A Hard Day's Night."
Rowan Atkinson's battle cry was amplified by two other Brits as they passed through New York. One was David Hare, who was infuriated when I wrote that he had mutilated his own fine play "The Secret Rapture" by miscasting and misdirecting the New York production. (The play had been beautifully staged by Howard Davies in London.) Hare wrote an open letter to me that he distributed to the press, arguing that it was part of my job "to insure the survival of the theater" and "support . . . the continuance of the serious play on Broadway." I wrote back that "my responsibility" was "to be honest with The Times's readers," who were too smart to follow any critic with blind Pavlovian slavishness, but instead extrapolated according to their own tastes from a familiar critic's point of view.
The dispute made for great copy and landed me on the front page of publications ranging from The Wall Street Journal to Variety (where Hummler wrote a tendentious story with a classic headline, "Ruffled Hare Airs Rich Bitch"). Hare was seconded by Andrew Lloyd Webber, who, though I had never met him, told reporters that I had not liked the performance given by his wife, Sarah Brightman, in "The Phantom of the Opera," because I was bitter about my own pending divorce. (Webber's divorce from Brightman was yet to come.) When "60 Minutes" did a segment about me, Hare and Lloyd Webber were both heard from, with the latter delivering, in the correspondent Morley Safer's words, an "unprintable tirade" off-camera, questioning my "integrity, sexuality and sanity." Even the stroke-impaired Merrick made a cameo appearance, labeling me "a savage dog."
Merrick had come back to Broadway with "Oh, Kay!" a feeble attempt to create a musical in the style of "42d Street," his last hit, now a decade old. At the critics' preview I attended, he pulled one of his old tricks: in the seat next to Alex Witchel, the Times theater columnist whom I was dating, he planted a loud, disruptive woman who talked and bounced in her seat throughout the show. After my negative review of "Oh, Kay!" came out, Merrick circulated a protesting letter to The Times in which he claimed Alex had talked through the performance. To heighten the public relations push, he then placed an ad in which a negative quote from my review and a news item from Alex's column about an Actors Equity dispute involving "Oh, Kay!" were contained within a cupid's heart. "At last, people are holding hands in the theatre again!" read the headline.
The stunt was a replay of a famous one he had pulled on Walter and Jean Kerr three decades earlier, when he publicly accused Jean of influencing Walter's reviews by dramatically "nudging" him at the theater. (Walter's answer to the charge in The Herald Tribune -- "Surely, Mr. Merrick, someone, somewhere has liked you well enough to give you a little dig in the elbow. No? Ah, well" -- is a journalism classic.) And by Merrick standards, the treatment I got was mild. In his prime, Merrick likened Brooks Atkinson's successor, Howard Taubman, to Adolf Eichmann during a half-hour tirade on Johnny Carson's "Tonight" show, on which the producer also accused the critic of feeding poison nuts to the squirrels in Central Park and spraying pesticide at Hubert's Flea Circus. Those were the days! It's hard to imagine any theatrical producer even being booked on a network talk show now.
Merrick's ad ran for one edition in The Times and was reprinted widely. The publicity did not save "Oh, Kay!" which died ignominiously in a welter of financial disputes pitting Merrick against his own employees. The great producer's career was over. But the notion Merrick perpetrated that Alex and I were in league either to reward or punish the New York theater hardly died with "Oh, Kay!" It became a mantra of New York theater people, who were dumbfounded as Alex got scoop after scoop in her Friday Times column: no one in the business seemed to remember that she wrote a theater column for the publication 7 Days before The Times hired her. Or that she worked in the theater, both for the Shuberts and Joseph Papp, before entering journalism, and had developed countless sources throughout its infrastructure, many of whom knew more about what was going on in theatrical offices than the bosses did. The idea of an evil woman behind the throne also seemed to titillate the almost exclusively male theater establishment, and its members planted gossip items about Alex that, predictably, made the expected juvenile plays on her last name and, eventually, referred to her "Hillary headbands."
The Times's editors, who by this point routinely had husbands and wives working in tandem on beats far more important than the theater, saw the attacks for the frequently misogynist whining they were. The biggest problem for Alex and me in this controversy was our loss of privacy. If we went looking for an apartment, it was in the papers. If we ate at a restaurant, a waiter might report our most innocuous conversation to a gossip column. Even our small wedding was infiltrated by a tabloid spy.
The juvenile tone of the gossip began to dispirit me. The Shubert Alley backbiting that had seemed romantic in "All About Eve," Joseph Mankiewicz's brilliant film satire of the New York theater in its post-World War II heyday, now seemed to be a larger growth industry on Broadway than play production itself, reflecting the diminished size of the business and the spare time its managers had on their hands. As I turned 40, a world I had once seen as sophisticated no longer struck me as adult.
The constant carping also left me wondering whether my own standards were indeed too tough for the tourist arena the Broadway theater had become. Since those standards were inseparable from who I am, I couldn't have changed them even if I wanted to. But was it worth applying them to a Broadway where the apex of achievement in the 1980's was "Cats"?
Yet even in this period of intense criticism, most people in the theater were courteous in their dealings with Alex and me. Alex, as a reporter, had far more dealings than I did, since I had always tried to avoid meeting people I might review. Though the occasional ambitious actor would write me a pleading note -- Glenn Close, for instance, who wrote asking that I return to "Barnum" 11 months into its run to see how she had deepened her performance as Barnum's wife -- most people kept a polite distance. The only producer who repeatedly tried to hawk his shows to me by schmoozing was Gordon Davidson, of the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles; some major showmen (like James Nederlander, the second-largest Broadway theater owner, after the Shuberts) never contacted me for any reason throughout my career at The Times. I rarely had ugly confrontations with anyone in the theater, and my mail from theater people, even at its angriest, was civilized.
In 13 years the few significant exceptions invariably involved Robert Brustein, the artistic director of the American Repertory Theater at Harvard University, and the few contemporary playwrights who worked at his theater (a list that dwindled rapidly as the 80's went on). The nastiest encounter I ever had was with Arthur Kopit, whose play "End of the World," to be produced later by Brustein in Cambridge, fared poorly in New York. One night after it opened I was passing under the marquee of the Music Box, where it was playing, and was buttonholed by Kopit, who, after telling me I was too stupid to appreciate his work, embarked on even more vitriolic tongue-lashings of three other plays, all praised by me, running on the same 45th Street block: "Sunday in the Park," "The Real Thing," by Tom Stoppard, and "Glengarry Glen Ross," by David Mamet. (After Sondheim, no one seemed to arouse more jealousy and anger among theatrical rivals than Mamet.)
Brustein was smoother. He offered me a teaching position at Harvard weeks after I arrived at the paper, air fare to and from my weekly seminars included. I mentioned this offer to Arthur Gelb -- I was naively mesmerized by the prospect -- and he ended the fantasy right there. Not only was the offer unethical, Arthur elaborated, but Brustein had a tortured history with the paper. In his memoir, "Making Scenes," Brustein had objected to the prominence of The Times's 1978 news story about A. Bartlett Giamatti's decision to replace him as dean of the Yale School of Drama.
I turned Brustein's offer down. But I did not fall into his ill graces until a few years later, when I praised the work of August Wilson, who had been discovered by Brustein's successor at Yale, the director Lloyd Richards, and would eventually win two Pulitzer Prizes (for "Fences" and "The Piano Lesson"). In his theater column in The New Republic, which he routinely used to deride rivals and reward associates in the theater, Brustein savaged Wilson for writing exclusively about "the black experience in a relatively literalistic style." (Brustein's American Repertory Theater was notorious among major American institutional theaters for never originating main-stage productions of plays by black Americans.) In a follow-up essay for American Theatre magazine, Brustein attacked Wilson's plays and a long list of others -- among them, "M. Butterfly," "Marvin's Room," "As Is," "The Normal Heart," "Eastern Standard," "Falsettoland," "Lips Together, Teeth Apart" -- that were conspicuous for having received favorable reviews in The Times. Many of these works were by gay writers, another sore spot for Brustein, who implied in print in 1983 that an "AIDS sympathy vote" had contributed to the Tony Award victory of "Torch Song Trilogy" over his production of " 'night, Mother."
But if Brustein was jealous of Lloyd Richards, and uncomfortable with minority playwrights, what drove him most crazy about me, it seemed, was my wife. Often he would stare conspicuously at Alex before the lights went down at a performance we both attended. Soon enough, he wrote a column titled "An Embarrassment of Riches," that attacked the intersection of our marital and professional lives. There was an odd twist to Brustein's attack, since a decade earlier he chastised The Times in his memoir for mentioning that the lead actress in one of his Yale productions was his own late wife. The Brusteins argued that calling attention to "relationships between husbands and wives who worked in the same place" was irrelevant to evaluating their work.
His article started a new wave of publicity. The power of The Times drama critic, real or imagined, now seemed the most interesting story in the theater. And there was nothing I could do about it. The Times's drama critic, whoever it was, had been the most influential in town before I was born, and would be after I'd gone. And the more publicity the drama critic got, the more powerful he seemed to become. When the Shuberts banned Woollcott 75 years earlier, they made both the paper and Woollcott more famous and powerful than they had been before. "They threw me out and now I'm basking in the fierce white light that beats upon the thrown," Woollcott said.
Like most of Woollcott's successors, I felt ambivalent about the paper's weight. If a review of mine could convince people to check out the work of an exciting new playwright, The Times's influence seemed worthwhile. If it had the opposite effect, who could take pleasure in that? Yet was the alternative to write waffling reviews, imploring readers to go to some well-meaning mediocrity for the good of the theater and those who worked in it? If I did that, I'd become the boy who cried wolf: those same readers would not believe me when I praised the really good play that came along. I was writing for the reader who did not want to waste a night or a hundred bucks on a dull evening -- and who did not want a patronizing critic to trick him into doing so. I was hardly writing for the producer who might lose a million dollars on "Merlin."
This was the way The Times wanted it, too, which is why the paper and I were well matched. Though the theater inevitably thought I was too tough, readers and some of my editors more often found me guilty of the reverse: I got far more mail from theatergoers who disliked plays I had praised than the other way around, and no wonder, given the fact that someone who loves the theater enough to be a theater critic is always going to be more charitable than the typical patron who might carefully pick out only a few plays to see each season. When looking through old reviews in retrospect I find that while I occasionally underpraised -- "Nicholas Nickleby," for instance -- my biggest whoppers of critical judgment were mostly of overpraise, from Elizabeth Taylor in "The Little Foxes" to "La Cage aux Folles." (Some other plays that I was accused of overpraising, and that few other critics liked, I still feel strongly about, like "Grown-Ups," by Jules Feiffer, "Eastern Standard," by Richard Greenberg, and "Four Baboons Adoring the Sun," by John Guare.)
The power of the job was not so vast as the Butcher of Broadway gags would have it, in any event. The huge, fast flops of my time, from "Moose Murders" to "Carrie" and "Nick and Nora," invariably received unanimously poor press from all newspaper, magazine and television critics; it would be hard to argue, as a Brustein or Hare might, that the Times review alone "closed" any of these shows. Similarly, many of the big hits, from "Amadeus" to "Angels in America," received almost uniformly favorable reviews, which makes it difficult to argue that The Times alone carried the day. Commercial entertainments with true mass appeal, whether by Neil Simon or Andrew Lloyd Webber, are review-proof: who in the standing-room-only audience at "The Phantom of the Opera" this week either knows or cares what I wrote about it? Does anyone remember that I didn't like "Brighton Beach Memoirs" or "Agnes of God"? Commercial shows that earn mixed or poor reviews can often survive if a producer is willing to do his job and promote it -- as the histories of productions like "I'm Not Rappaport" and "Blood Brothers" attest. In the post-Merrick era, sadly, such producers are in perilously short supply. The only showman left on Broadway who matches Merrick is the British producer Cameron Mackintosh, but he stages only large musicals, and infrequently at that. Merrick would not only mount several productions a season, but for every "Hello, Dolly!" there would be a drama, whether Peter Brook's "Midsummer Night's Dream" or Brian Friel's "Philadelphia, Here I Come!" And he would sell them as hard as he would a musical cash cow.
While I would not dispute some areas of The Times's influence -- especially its critics' ability to encourage extended runs (or commercial transfers) of plays in Off Broadway or out-of-town venues -- the power to control the fate of that most endangered species, the drama on Broadway, is close to nil. Serious dramas enthusiastically greeted by me and most other critics, whether "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Joe Turner's Come and Gone," by August Wilson, or Royal Shakespeare Company imports like the Trevor Nunn "All's Well That Ends Well," routinely fail on Broadway. The marketplace now only accommodates one drama per season -- one "Dancing at Lughnasa" or "Angels in America" -- unless there is a Madonna or Jessica Lange on another marquee.
But why should I even bother to argue my case? The myth will never die. As Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times in 1953, when a musical he panned the year before ("Wish You Were Here") became a hit while well-reviewed plays flopped, "Facts will not destroy the ancient legend that critics are dictators who arbitrarily permit some plays to succeed and haughtily consign most of them to the ash-can."
Or as Atkinson put it when his power was under attack in 1947: "What the theater needs is not the suppression of opinion but a sharp and drastic deflation in the cost of tickets and a sharp and drastic improvement in the quality of plays."
Some things, it's clear, never change.
WHAT DID CHANGE IN THE late 1980's and early 1990's was the quality and texture of American playwriting, which became more diverse in style, ethnic origin and themes. As American theatrical production is now decentralized, with most new plays originating at institutional theaters Off Broadway and throughout the country rather than on Broadway, so American theatrical writing and performance reflect a far less homogenous society than they once did. A list of writers as varied as Jon Robin Baitz, Anna Deavere Smith, Craig Lucas, John Leguizamo, Paul Rudnick, Paula Vogel, Donald Margulies, Jose Rivera, Richard Greenberg and Eduardo Machado just touches the surface of this explosive new talent pool. If the directorial visions of Robert Wilson and Peter Sellars have no wider an American following in the early 90's than they did in the early 80's, the edgy, stylized African-American esthetic that the director George Wolfe brings to plays by black and white writers has caught on. Wolfe's staging and Tony Kushner's writing of "Angels in America" arguably brought more excitement to the American theater than any single work since "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" three decades earlier.
Yet, for all this creative flowering, the mood in the New York theater continued to turn sour as the millennium approached. Rising costs and ticket prices continued to erode Broadway, restricting its ability to present the American theater's large new creative bounty. The theater's old guard, which controls much of Broadway's bureaucracy and funds, resented the new generation that questioned its ways (much as it resented the taste of critics like myself who championed that new generation). Off Broadway theater companies, where most of the artistic action is, remain barred from the Tony Awards, a promotional event that increasingly seemed designed (like high ticket prices) to keep young talents and young audiences running in the opposite direction of Broadway. The Dramatists Guild, the playwrights organization that might have fought the establishment for revolutionary change, was under the thumb of Peter Stone, an old-line Broadway musical-theater book writer ("Woman of the Year," "The Will Rogers Follies") who, unlike much of the group's membership, never worked Off Broadway and was out of touch with the rising writers half his age working in nonprofit theaters.
But one reason for the growing gloom in the New York theater was beyond its control, and that, of course, was AIDS. The disease stepped out of the theater's closet in 1985 when it made its debut as a stage subject (in "As Is," by William Hoffman, and "The Normal Heart, " by Larry Kramer). Two years later, two of New York's greatest theatrical leaders, Broadway's Michael Bennett and Off Broadway's Charles Ludlam, joined the long list of casualties. The deaths would have been shocking under any circumstance, but the tragedy was heightened by the fresh memories of their recent triumphs. Bennett's extravagant staging of the gala, record-breaking performance of "A Chorus Line" in 1983 and Ludlam's Ridiculous Theatrical Company tour de force, "The Mystery of Irma Vep," in 1984, had suggested a limitless future for both men. They both died at 44.
"Sometimes you see death everywhere," went a totemic line in John Guare's brilliant theatrical summation of the 1980's in New York, "Six Degrees of Separation."
IN JUNE 1991, HOWEVER, I COULD not have been happier. A week after my 42d birthday, Alex and I were married in New York. The joy proved short-lived. On July 4, we went to a cookout at the home of Janet Maslin, my close friend and colleague who had first introduced me to Arthur Gelb (and The Times) a dozen years earlier. When we returned to my apartment at nightfall, a phone message announced that my mother and stepfather had been in a grotesque car accident on Route 95 between Baltimore and Washington, on their way home from an Independence Day lunch.
For a month, I commuted back and forth by train between New York and Baltimore, where my mother languished in a shock trauma center. The weather was fetid, the train and Baltimore itself always seemed deserted. My mother was 64 years old and had been in perfect health. There was some chance she might survive her extensive injuries. My stepfather was released from the hospital in a couple of weeks. But hard as my mother fought -- or I imagined her to fight, since she was sedated the entire time -- it was not to be. She died exactly a month after the accident.
My grief was so overwhelming that more than two years later, my memories of that summer remain a blur. For the first time in my life, the theater offered no solace, no escape. My mother too abundantly haunted the theater for me: she had always told me how she listened to the newly issued cast recording of "South Pacific" when she was pregnant with me; it was she who had given me Moss Hart's inspiring "Act One" a decade later.
But just as I hit psychic bottom, one person in the theater reached out to me, as if to bring me back within its spell.
That person was Joseph Papp. Like every critic, especially every Times critic, I had always had an up-and-down relationship with him -- and it had only been a professional relationship, largely in theater lobbies before a curtain went up. While he had never attempted to throw me out of his theater, as he had Walter Kerr, we had had our innings, the fracas over David Hare and "The Secret Rapture" included, once the New York Shakespeare Festival started to stumble in the late 1980's. The stumbling, I and others had not realized, was directly attributable to Papp's fight with cancer, the severity of which he successfully kept secret until the last year of his life.
By the time of my mother's death in August 1991, it was widely known that Papp was dying. No one had seen him in weeks. My last encounter with him, an atypical one, had been in March: he had phoned me to tell me how much he agreed with a favorable review I had written of a play he had read but not seen, Jon Robin Baitz's "Substance of Fire." When I encouraged him to go see the production at Playwrights Horizons, he gave vague excuses.
Now Papp was determined to give an extensive interview to The Times -- his last -- and, more specifically, to give it to Alex. She had worked for him in her college days, and they had hit it off. He had been a constant and reliable source for her column, even when the stories were not flattering to his own institution.
Alex's interview ran in The Times less than three weeks after my mother's death. A few mornings later, I picked up the phone in the kitchen and it was Papp's familiar voice, far stronger than I remembered it having been in March. He was calling to offer condolences. I told him how touched I was by his concern, then told him how sorry I had been to hear about his son, who had died of AIDS since our last conversation. Within moments, both of us were sobbing on the phone, knowing we were saying goodbye. "I want you to know," Joe said, "that even when I was angry at you I always knew you loved the theater." We expressed a desire to become the friends we had never been. Choosing my words delicately, I told him that he and his wife, Gail Merrifield, must come to our place for dinner when he felt well enough to do so. The conversation ended on a high note, the warmest embrace possible by phone, after which I felt more energized than I had since the accident -- if only for a few minutes, until the weight of my grief about Papp kicked in. As Merrick was the impresario who sponsored much of the exciting American theater of my youth, Papp was the far more visionary producer who played that role (reinventing American theater in the process) during my adulthood. Who was left?
AS LABOR DAY ARRIVED, I realized that for the first time in memory, I was not looking forward to a new theater season. The only way I could get back to writing, and to reconnecting with my passion for the theater, was to write an essay summing up Papp's career. Five weeks after it was published Papp died. But then the emotional weather changed for me; the theater came to my rescue with an exceptionally fine season: "Dancing at Lughnasa," "Angels in America" in London, "Jelly's Last Jam," "Falsettos," "Fires in the Mirror" and "Marvin's Room," a daffy yet devastating comedy about a woman who gives her life to caring for her terminally infirm father. My colleague and eventual successor as chief drama critic, David Richards, had written a profile of the young playwright, Scott McPherson, and invited me to join the two of them for breakfast the day after my review ran. This was unusual for me, but "Marvin's Room," more than any play I'd seen before or since, had spoken directly to me about what life had been like at my mother's side in the hospital. And I didn't have to worry about my integrity being compromised: McPherson, who was 32 and sick with AIDS, was not going to write another play.
In the incongruously cheery setting of Sarabeth's Kitchen on Amsterdam Avenue, the elfin McPherson was much like the heroine, Bessie, in his play -- funny, guileless, more concerned about others than himself. His lover, an AIDS activist named Daniel Sotomayor, was too sick to emerge from his hotel room; he died back home in Chicago two months later. McPherson talked buoyantly about his future writing plans. A year later, he, too, was dead.
THE FACT OF THE THEATER'S dwindling was inescapable, yet, paradoxically, American plays continued to rise to a level far higher than had been typical of my beat in the early 80's. However gravely ill the economic and physical health of the American theater, its art was thriving against all odds, and its young artists (Tony Kushner, typically, was only 36) promised a real future.
For me, the future increasinglyseemed elsewhere. As election year arrived, and with it the prospect of both a political and generational turnover in American life, my journalistic focus widened; I found myself more interested in writing about the world itself rather than just the theater's vision of that world. A year after my mother's death, I took a leave from my beat to write columns about the Democratic and Republican conventions with my friend Maureen Dowd; the country was getting ready to elect a President only a couple of years older than I was. Though I returned to the theater for another season, I knew it would be my last. I started balancing my theater reviewing with a column about other matters for this magazine.
When The Times announced my appointment as an Op-Ed columnist, I heard from people in the theater, many of whom I had never met or communicated with before. My favorite send-off, however, turned up in a newspaper clipping from London. The Sunday Telegraph reported that David Merrick, ailing but still kicking, said through a lawyer that "Mr. Rich made many contributions to the American theater, none more great than to leave his post as theater critic."
The locution sounded suspiciously British for Merrick, but what the hell. For now at least, my career in the theater was complete; it seemed only right that the old fox who was there at the start would write my comic exit line.
There were still a few more plays to review. The very last, determined by the calendar, was "Perestroika," the second half of "Angels in America." I invited my oldest friend, Alan Brinkley, and his wife, Evangeline, to join me and Alex. My mother and Alan's had shared a hospital room in Washington on the day we were born 44 years earlier. Now Alan gave me a Playbill from that summer of 1949 as a token of the occasion.
A couple of afternoons later, I was alone in my cubicle at the paper, finishing my review of the play. The image that had most stayed in my mind from Kushner's voluminous epic was one of its last: the almost festive farewell wave to the audience of a man with AIDS who is determined to go on living.
So I wrote about the frail young man's buoyant wave, and, after I did, I realized that his goodbye was also my own; I went back and changed a couple of words in my final sentence to reinforce that double meaning. When I finished, I found myself as tearful as I had been that long-ago night when Gower Champion's death had rung down the opening-night curtain on "42d Street." But I was older now, and this was a different catharsis. Rereading my final review one last time before sending it out into the world, I suddenly saw clearly why I so strongly identified with the character on stage. Death had been transfigured for me too, into something that looked very much like hope.

HEADLINE: Who Are You?

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Is it possible to define oneself in just a single word? Can one sort out all the complicated, complicating factors of public and private life, measure all the facets of one's personality, cast off what's extraneous and then name an essential, identifying characteristic?
Without a lot of soul-searching, without reading social philosophers like Martin Buber (whose writings included the book "I and Thou") or paying homage to bubble-gum bands like the Monkees ("I'm a Believer"), some answers come to mind quickly: the Rev. Jesse Jackson's trademark, "I am somebody." Or Cicero's "I am a Roman citizen." Or Descartes's "I think, therefore I am." Or the poet Robert Lowell's "I myself am hell." 
 But even in the fast-forward 90's, when everything from cooking times in the kitchen to sound bites on television have been compressed to a minimum, narrowing one's identity to a single word is still a difficult order. Perhaps that is why the results are so thought-provoking.
When asked what word best defined her, Karen Finley, the performance artist whose work takes sexual and political issues to raw and graphic extremes, chose "normal."
"I'm your average American," she declared. "I believe in freedom of expression, I work for a living, I've got credit cards, I watch 'Jeopardy,' I screen my phone calls and I can't stand slow drivers."
If she seems to be casting herself against type, she is hardly alone. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, elected as a leader, settled on "participant."
"I am a part of the whole," he said, "evolving with the rest of us."
Martina Navratilova chose none of the labels by which she could be identified -- tennis star, celebrity, lesbian. Instead, she chose a word that might surprise some of her opponents: "kind."
"Because I am," she said. "I'm always very aware of people around me and always try to make them feel better."
And if you ask 1,136 adults to describe themselves in only one word, as a New York Times/CBS News poll did last year, you'll get about 200 different answers. While this open-ended question, posed during telephone interviews Sept. 16-19, may not yield the kind of hard-and-fast data that a pre-election survey or poll about ecomonic confidence does, it provides a compelling sociological snapshot.
Generally, the respondents seemed to resist labeling themselves as members of a "special interest group" or easily identifiable minority group, avoiding stereotyping and choosing either a broader affiliation or a narrower, more personal response.
For example, none of the 97 black respondents said "black," and none of the 967 whites said that being white was the defining fact of their lives. Instead, the word given most often in the survey was "American." Fully 10 percent of the people questioned, by far the largest single group, came up with that one word.
They were evenly distributed across the country, in large- and medium-sized cities, suburbs and rural towns, indicating, perhaps, that "the cultural glue is stronger and thicker than is often thought," said Michael Marsden, a dean and popular culture expert at Northern Michigan University. And discussing national identity and patriotism is, he said, "declasse."
Yet, he said: "Maybe when you scratch the surface -- what are you at the core? -- 'American' is what it is."
That is what some people in the survey who chose "American" said when they were re-interviewed later. Constance Ploss, an unemployed real-estate broker from Manchester, N.H., said the first thing that came to mind when she heard the question was her state's slogan, "Live free or die."
But later she had second thoughts. "Maybe," she said, "I should have said something more about being a woman."
Maybe fame changes the parameters of self-image. In a score of interviews with well-known people, the word "American" didn't come up. Senator Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, came the closest, with "Kansan." "Like Dorothy in 'The Wizard of Oz,' " he said, "I've never forgotten where I came from."
But not everyone was impressed with this kind of patriotism. "I'm always stunned when people describe themselves as 'American,' " said Peter Jennings, the ABC News anchor, who is a Canadian (and who said his word was "impassioned"). "It seems not to say an awful lot. 'American' is where you begin."
Dr. Marsden agreed. "The fact that we can identify as Americans takes away the threat of diversity," he said. "The existence of a unifying concept allows us to be different in greater measure. I may be different than you, but I'm not threatened by that because I know that at the heart of it, we share the same values."
After "American," no one word was mentioned by more than 4 percent of those in the poll. "Average," which may have been a sort of non-answer for people who couldn't think of a more descriptive off-the-cuff answer or felt pressed for time in the telephone interviews, was next over all, with 4 percent of the total (but only 2 percent of the women). "Me" or "myself" also drew 4 percent. Three percent -- including 9 percent of the blacks, but only 2 percent of the whites -- said they were "concerned."
Women were more likely to say they were a "parent" first and foremost: 4 percent, versus 1 percent of the men. Women were also more likely to describe themselves as "caring," or say they were "survivors." Men were more likely to mention where they stood on the economic ladder ("rich," "poor," or "middle class"), and to name a political philosophy ("liberal" or "conservative"). No one mentioned marital status as the defining characteristic.
Religion or faith was cited by a greater percentage of women than of men; over all, 2 percent of the respondents fell into this category. For the most part, they identified themselves as Christians or "born again."
Some may be looking at the world through rose-colored glasses. Beyond those most frequently chosen words, positive responses tended to outweigh negative ones. Seven said "optimist" or "optimistic," one person was "joyous" and a third was "radiant." Jackie Vienticinque of Providence, R.I., gave "helpful" as her answer. "Not that I'm throwing bouquets at myself," she said, "but that's absolutely been my nature."
About 20 others defined themselves by their work, or its effects on them. One person's word was "workaholic" (17 others said "hard-working"). There was one "truck driver" and four "taxpayers."
About 200 in the poll could not come up with a word. And Michael Kinsley, who writes several hundred words for the New Republic magazine every week and utters several hundred more on CNN five nights a week, would not choose one, declaring, "I just think that's a stupid question."
For those who did answer, it was certainly a challenge. "You cannot reduce yourself to one, it's too complicated," said Suzanne Keller, a sociologist at Princeton University. "People really feel multiple. They have multiple poses and attitudes and roles and one is no more important than the next. If they're forced to choose between family and work and leisure roles, which are not even roles but personas, they can't, really, because they live a multifaceted, multitudinous life, not single track."
The author Margaret Atwood seemed to feel the same way when asked to define herself in one word. She picked "indescribable," warning that: "One must always resist the tyranny of adjectives."

Two for the Roads: A Vision of Urban Design

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
WE'RE RIGHT TO BE SKEPTICAL OF URBAN visionaries. Unchecked, even the most radiant dreams can turn into nightmares. The towers Le Corbusier envisioned rising from green open space soon became a deadly formula for urban blight. Robert Moses' idealistic vision of urban parkways grew into an asphalt octopus. Frank Lloyd Wright's democratic vista of a decentralized America helped pave the way for the social atomization of the postwar suburb. In light of this cautionary record, it's worth pausing before tooting the horn for even the worthiest talents.
Pause. 
 And here goes: William Morrish and Catherine Brown are the most valuable thinkers in American urbanism today. Mr. Morrish, 45, is the director of the Design Center for American Urban Landscape in Minneapolis, a think tank he established five years ago at the University of Minnesota's College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture. Ms. Brown, 43, is the Design Center's coordinator of special projects. Their work is just beginning to be widely known. Only a handful of municipalities have put their urban design concepts into practice. They have yet to compile their ideas into a book. But they have firmly established themselves as the most informed advocates of an idea that has lately risen to the top of the urban agenda, and their prominence is rising with it.
Early on, Morrish and Brown recognized that infrastructure would become a key concept in redefining urban design. And they grasped that this term means much more than highways, bridges, sewage and power lines. It also stands for the connective tissue that knits people, places, social institutions and the natural environment into coherent urban relationships. As Mr. Morrish says, "Infrastructure is the safety net of the social system." It is shorthand for the structural underpinnings of the public realm.
People throughout the design professions have awakened to the need to connect their area of expertise to a larger public purpose. But there is also a need to connect the design professions to one another. Unless architects, landscape architects, city and regional planners, and public works engineers can strengthen the connective tissue among themselves, there's little chance that they can do it for the rest of us.
Each of these disciplines harbors a stupendous wealth of intelligence, experience and enterprise that could help transform the way cities are designed and built. In a number of recent projects, Morrish and Brown have sought to release this potential by punching through the walls that have grown up around these increasingly specialized fields. Beyond that, their mission is to convince public policy makers that design encompasses much more than putting attractive wrappers on things. It's a field whose applications are as broad as public policy itself.
Historically, urban design has been among the most marginal of the design professions. Too often the term is taken to mean little more than visual embellishment: the esthetically pleasing coordination of street signs, storefronts, paving and street lamps. Morrish and Brown are by no means indifferent to such features. The most widely known of their projects, a 1987 master plan for the public art program in Phoenix, has immeasurably enriched the cityscape with ornamental lighting fixtures, bus stop shelters and other conventional elements of urban design.
But the Phoenix plan went considerably beyond its initial esthetic mandate. Art, here, became a synonym for vision, a tool for gaining a comprehensive overview of the city's underlying structure: its network of highways and canals, its transportation and sanitation systems, its parks and schools. While the plan resulted in the creation of dozens of distinctive artworks, its chief value was to foster civic exchange. It used art as a bridge between the public and those who make public policy. While the plan's framework was political, it was also artistic in the deepest sense, evoking the ancient meaning of poetry as an art of making connections.
MORRISH AND BROWN'S expertise in linking different areas of knowledge may well derive from the dialogue they have conducted between themselves over the years as designers trained in different disciplines. Mr. Morrish is an architect, Ms. Brown a landscape architect (the two, who are married, met in 1976 while they were both students at Harvard's Graduate School of Design), and their vision of urban design could be said to grow from the symbolic act of planting a wall in the ground.
The symbolism of that act is twofold. It is a joining, a metaphorical marriage between the natural and the cultural. But it is also a primal act of differentiation. It carves land into turf, divides space into conditions of inside and outside. Such divisions are culturally and socially indispensable: arts, sciences, communities and families flourish within differentiated spaces. But those divisions can also produce conflict, alienation and gridlock. How to preserve the complexity without being defeated by it? How to retain reverence for the land without escaping into simplistic pastoral fantasies?
Morrish and Brown's thinking runs strongly along Big Picture lines. But it runs just as vigorously along pragmatic, microcosmic lines. Few of the projects they've worked on have the high-profile pizazz of the Phoenix public art plan. More typical is the plan for a highway corridor they conceived for Chanhassen, one of four small Minnesota cities that have recruited the Design Center to help them cope with the pains of urban growth. Located 12 miles west of Minneapolis, Chanhassen (pop. 35,000) is the home of a dinner theater that draws audiences from throughout the region. The city's population nearly doubled in the 1980's, transforming it from a rural community to a "third ring" suburb and prompting plans to expand the area's main traffic artery from a two-lane road to a divided four-lane highway.
Chanhassen city officials were caught in a classic bind. While they favored growth, they wanted to retain the identity that made people want to live there in the first place. They feared that the highway would solidify into a tacky commercial strip, obliterating the rolling, wooded landscape with parking lots and discount stores. In 1991, the Design Center was brought in to give advice. Morrish and Brown recognized that the problem of growth couldn't be solved simply by prettifying the highway. Inevitably, the new road's impact would be felt throughout the region. Thus the team's first task was to enlarge the "highway corridor" to an area that eventually encompassed about 40 percent of Chanhassen's land, including properties likely to be developed in the future.
Morrish and Brown viewed this project as an educational mission, not only for their students (the Design Center, which is financed by the Dayton Hudson Foundation, offers a program of graduate studies) but also for the officials who would have to work with state officials and private developers over the long term. What is "identity"? A design committee, including the Mayor and other officials, began meeting about once a month to get an analytical hold on this elusive quality.
The first lessons were visual. Committee members went into the field to photograph natural features and historic buildings; then the pictures were pinned up and analyzed. The committee saw that the topography formed large, outdoor "rooms" that could guide future development. It saw how relationships between rolling hills, low-rise buildings, treetops and church steeples defined Chanhassen's character.
Next the committee studied the "architecture" underlying these visual images. Outside consultants led seminars on wetlands and geological formations and their impact on local vegetation and wildlife. Old maps and newspaper articles were used to trace the impact of agriculture, industry and urbanization. The purpose of these exercises was not to turn people into amateur environmentalists. It was to help them become better clients for engineers, architects and landscape designers. The city had learned to see that there is more to identity than the visual surface of things. They wouldn't have to settle for the phony-natural look of the typical suburb, with its arbitrarily curving streets, ersatz pastoral landscaping and artificially weathered wooden siding.
The highway design was modified. Frontage roads, which usually run parallel to highways and shopping center parking lots, were moved away from the highway and designed to become actual city streets. The developers of a new chain discount store were persuaded to rotate the building 90 degrees, orienting it toward the town instead of the highway. Landscape designers were brought in to improve the design of pedestrian underpasses. A pedestrian bridge over the highway was reconceived as a landmark city gateway and linked to a park/ride service.
But something more important than these individual projects came out of the process. The town discovered that it didn't have to accept standard solutions. The highway Morrish and Brown designed was not only for cars but for minds.
Though small in scale, the Chanhassen plan is far-reaching in scope. Most urban development today is unfolding at the suburban edge. (The 1992 Presidential election was the first in which the majority of voters were neither urban nor rural but suburban.) But Morrish and Brown have not abandoned the older, downtown core. Two current projects, both in Minneapolis, demonstrate their recognition that explosive growth at the urban edge calls for even greater commitment to the inner city.
Hennepin County Works, a contemporary, grass-roots version of the New Deal's W.P.A., will create jobs as well as a network of small neighborhood parks. In a second project, commissioned by the Minneapolis Housing Authority, the Design Center is studying how design and planning modifications could break down the barriers that have isolated public housing residents from the rest of the community. Both projects illustrate Ms. Brown's belief that community building calls for a combination of design skills and social initiatives.
Though the Design Center's approach is fresh, it does not come out of a historical vacuum. Its fusion of esthetics, engineering and natural systems places Morrish and Brown in the tradition pioneered by Frederick Law Olmsted. The cognitive mapping of Kevin Lynch and the ecological planning of Ian McHarg are among their philosophical bedrocks. Above all, their ideas are rooted in the work of J. B. Jackson, a writer who expounded the idea that the beauty of landscape lies in the complex integration of nature and human artifacts. Jackson taught a way of looking: a way to see that a Roman fountain, for example, is at once a work of sculpture, a public space, a feat of engineering and a unit of regional planning that linked the city to its surroundings via the aqueduct system.
Morrish and Brown have turned Jackson's way of seeing into a method of education. In a six-week exploration of cities along the Mississippi River that they conducted in 1990, they trained students to see how engineering and urbanization have tried to change the shape of what they call America's fourth coast. Through the Mayors' Institute, a program established by the Design Center in 1991, they have trained public officials in Midwestern cities to see that design can be an effective means of mustering a community's physical, economic and intellectual resources.
But the main contribution of these two has been to make education the basis of design. It is a painstaking process, one that cannot be reduced to a cookbook of recipes. And yet, with billions of dollars earmarked for public works, it would be folly not to rethink from the ground up the way those dollars are spent. Morrish and Brown are not selling buildings; they're not selling images; they're not even selling designs. What they offer, really, is deliverance from the state of exhaustion that can easily overtake us as we drive across the land and focus on potholes, rust, traffic jams, crumbling levees -- a route out of the despairing sense that America has run out of horizons, closed the frontier, arrived at the end of our road. Morrish and Brown see that the end is only the beginning of a new learning curve, a path through ideas.

HEADLINE: Fine Dining Comes to Vegas

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER

 BODY:
Las Vegas has become the latest, and most unlikely, high roller on the national restaurant scene. Just five years ago gastronomic opportunities there were circumscribed by garish institutional hotel fare and modest family-style establishments catering to year-round residents.
But with the arrival of spectacular new resorts like the $1 billion MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, the $475 million Treasure Island Casino and Hotel, and the $375 million Luxor Hotel, leading restaurateurs from around the country have decided that Las Vegas is ready for cutting edge cuisine. 
 Nearly 200 restaurants have opened in the city in the past two years, according to Van Heffner, president of the Nevada Restaurant Association.
"It has really gone wild," Mr. Heffner said. "Our old pace used to be about one restaurant a week. That has easily doubled." One of the biggest success stories is Wolfgang Puck's re-creation of his celebrity chocked Los Angeles grill, Spago, in Caesar's Palace Forum Mall. Spago serves California-style pizzas, grilled fish, game and meat and was designed by Adam Tihany, the architect who has created many restaurant decors.
The all-American steakhouse has found its place in Las Vegas in a big way. Among the most prominent out-of-town establishments to take root in Nevada's sandy soil are Morton's, a Chicago-based chain; Palm, the masculine Manhattan beef emporium, and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, part of a large New Orleans chain.
The prosperity of those newcomers has prompted other leading American chefs to look toward Las Vegas. The most recent is Coyote Cafe, an offshoot of a Southwestern restaurant by the same name in Santa Fe. Coyote Cafe is in the huge MGM Grand Hotel and Casino. Coyote Cafe caters to all kinds of customers with a formal 90-seat dining room and a 110-seat cafe that serves Mexican and Mediterranean dishes.
The presence of fine dining establishments like Spago and Coyote Cafe has also meant the immigration of sommeliers, nearly an extinct species in the economically pressed East. Impressive wine lists are appearing all over town.
Italian restaurants have been opening at a fast clip, most of them locally based. The biggest and spashiest import is the new Sfuzzi, a stylish and theatrical spot that serves au courant northern Italian fare like individual pizzas, risottos and game.
And as Las Vegas vies to become an all-around family resort rather than just a gambling mecca, chains that cater to children and teen-agers, including every incarnation of fast food, have appeared. A Hard Rock Cafe opened in 1990, with the usual crashing music and colorful T-shirts. First year's sales topped $16 million, a success that has inspired a Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, an $80 million, 325-room property scheduled to open in December. The other teen palace on the way is Planet Hollywood, which has announced plans, but no date, to open downtown.
Why all this activity now? "Las Vegas has a much larger customer base than ever," said Joel Bergman, a leading Las Vegas architect. "We expect 25 million visitors in 1994, and many of those people are coming for a complete vacation that includes leaving the hotels for dinner."
And with its permanent population expected to reach one million by the end of the year, Las Vegas has developed a large, and demanding, core of restaurant-goers. "Many of us travel around the country and dine at places like Spago," Mr. Bergman said. "So it's nice to have these places opening right here."

HEADLINE: Co-op Market Drift Continues In Manhattan

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
THE apartment market in New York seems dead to Jeff Mullen, who for the last year has been trying to sell his co-op on the Upper West Side for $118,000. Not even his classified ad promising views of Maui and offering the lucky buyer two round-trip tickets to Hawaii has attracted much interest in his run-of-the-mill one-bedroom unit.
"We did get one person who wanted to know whether you could actually see Hawaii from the apartment," said Mr. Mullen, an advertising copywriter. "They obviously didn't get the joke and thought the building was taller than it is." 
 The market, however, appears vastly different to Virginia M. Henneberry. Last month, she sold her Upper West Side two-bedroom co-op overlooking Central Park. She also received close to her asking price and turned a tidy profit.
"It's a real jewel," said Ms. Henneberry, an investment adviser, who sold the co-op, in a West Side building next door to the famed Dakota, for $475,000. "I would have been surprised if no one had bought it."
The tales of Mr. Mullen and Ms. Henneberry show the vivid variances in the health of the New York residential real estate market. For the relatively small number of wealthy Manhattanites who own large, sought-after co-op or condominium units in financially stable buildings in prime neighborhoods, demand and sale prices are firm, if not strong. But for middle-class owners of the far more numerous dark, cramped studio or one-bedroom apartments, perhaps in a financially precarious building in a marginal area, 1993 was a year of low demand and prices that continued to fall.
"You have a tale of two cities," said Barbara Corcoran, the head of the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan real-estate brokerage that bears her name.
Because most of the apartments in Manhattan fall into the lesser of these two worlds, the median price for all co-ops in the borough fell substantially -- by 9.8 percent -- in 1993, to $77,465 a room, according to figures compiled by the Real Estate Board of New York. Median means that half the apartments sold for more than that figure and half sold for less.
The number of co-ops sold in Manhattan is estimated to have increased slightly in 1993 over 1992, but the volume, as measured by Douglas Elliman, a Manhattan real estate broker, was less than in 1991.
There were, though, some signs of improvement. The overall price decline was not as steep as the double-digit drops of two or three years ago. Moreover, the median sales price among co-ops with three or more bedrooms rose 3.9 percent in 1993 over the previous year. The median sale price of units with one bedroom or less, however, dropped by 12.1 percent.
The happiest sellers may have been those who owned condominiums, which make up 22.7 percent of the market-rate apartments in Manhattan. These units, of which there are 45,000 in Manhattan, soared in value.
According to Yale Robbins Inc., a real estate research and publishing concern, the average sale price of a condominium in Manhattan rose 9.3 percent in 1994, to $335,788, and the number of sales increased by 20.7 percent.
Despite the smattering of positive statistics for the owners of condominiums and large co-ops, these numbers were overshadowed by last year's sharp decline in the overall sales price of co-ops, especially since brokers a year ago predicted that the market would soon start to rise in value.
The slide also marked the fifth straight year that co-op prices have ebbed, evidence that the nation's economic recovery is more rumor than reality for many apartment owners in the region.
For example, Mr. Mullen recently decided to rent his apartment for $1,200 a month and absorb a $300-a-month negative cash flow.
"My sense is that things are bad and getting worse," he said.
Curiously, the continuing decline in co-op prices comes as prices in many other sectors of the residential real estate in the Northeast have begun rebounding, particularly the detached single-family home market in places like Fairfield County, Conn.
ECONOMISTS and real estate analysts have attributed the drop to the rapid price escalation that occurred in the early and mid-80's as well as to the slack demand created by the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the city, particularly in the financial-services industry, since the stock market crash in October 1987.
"It's the economy," said Roberto Bezjon, who has been trying to sell his spacious five-room co-op with spectacular East River views for $500,000. The monthly maintenance charge is $1,800, and the minimum down payment is 50 percent.
"Three or four years ago, people would come into my apartment with $750,000 checks saying, 'I want it,' " he said.
"I hope there will be a turnaround," added Mr. Bezjon, a make-up artist who plans to move to the West Coast but keep a smaller apartment in Manhattan.
There is also a huge degree of uncertainty, some brokers believe, among many potential apartment buyers, especially in the middle class, not only about the economy and holding on to their jobs, but also about the lack of liquidity in buying a co-op and the amount of time it may take to realize a profit.
Others note, too, the dwindling number of prosperous, first-home-buying baby boomers moving to Manhattan and perceptions that the quality of life in the city is declining.
One of the most oft-cited fears about buying a co-op, however, involves the restrictive policies that are part of this form of ownership. Co-op boards can require high down payments for buyers in their buildings (50 percent is not unusual in more luxurious neighborhoods).
Further, owners are often barred from subleasing their units (owners are considered tenants) or they are restricted to renting them out for one or two years.
Co-ops, to some degree, have also been stigmatized by buildings that have unsound underlying mortgages, which has led to abnormally large monthly maintenance charges in some cases, particularly in buildings less than 50 percent owner-occupied.
The maintenance on Mr. Mullen's relatively inexpensive co-op, for example, is $1,000 a month. Any buyers, unless they paid all cash, would likely face the prospect of paying more in maintenance than for their mortgage.
"The maintenance is a killer," Mr. Mullen said.
Tracking the ups and downs of the city's apartment market is much more imprecise than measuring the market for suburban single-family detached homes. Not only are there huge disparities between neighborhoods and unit sizes, but co-op sales, unlike sales of condominiums and homes, are not publicly reported. This is because they are, technically, stock rather than real-property transactions.
Besides the Real Estate Board of New York, several Manhattan brokers, most notably Douglas Elliman, the Corcoran Group, and the Halstead Property Company, have their own surveys and indexes, as does the National Cooperative Bank.
But these reports have not been independently verified, their sample sizes are generally small and they tend to give short shrift to, if not outright ignore, the boroughs outside Manhattan and, in some cases, even downtown Manhattan.
Their methodology is also skewed in varying ways and thus they report somewhat different findings. Douglas Elliman's survey of 1,171 apartments, for example, relies mostly on its own sales, which tend to be from largely upscale buildings in uptown locations; according to its survey, average co-op apartment prices fell 3.1 percent in 1993.
The Corcoran Group report, on the other hand, applies an estimate of the variance between listing prices and sales prices, derived from its own offices and those of cooperating brokers, and applies it to a wider sample of listing prices to arrive at its overall sales-price estimates. Its survey, which included condos, stated that average prices fell 1.5 percent last year.
AS for a survey of 925 sales by the National Cooperative Bank -- which is based in Washington and provides an array of financial services, including underlying mortgage financing, to the nation's co-ops -- it showed a 2.4 percent increase in average co-op sale prices for the entire New York area last year.
Though the bank's sample was small, it did scan average prices in the city outside Manhattan, where their sample found that prices fell 8.2 percent in Brooklyn and Queens, and in Westchester County, where they fell 14.9 percent. (The vast majority of the nation's co-op apartments are in the city.)
"Even though the New York City co-op values have yet to reach their 1989 high point of $84,473 per room, the 1993 increase of 2.4 percent is an encouraging sign," said Sheldon Gartenstein, vice president and loan officer at the National Cooperative Bank. "The increase follows two years of steady and significant declines, representing a stabilization of co-op values in the overall market."
In an effort to produce a single comprehensive study of the co-op market in Manhattan, the Real Estate Board of New York began its survey last year and includes sales volume and median prices from various brokers throughout the borough. Even so, its report for 1993 only covered 1,286 transactions, or about 25 percent of approximately 5,000 apartments that the board estimates turn over each year.
There are about 153,000 market-rate co-op apartments in Manhattan.
"The market has bottomed out," said Jonathan Adams, chief economist for the Real Estate Board of New York. "But saying it has turned around may give the impression that there has been an appreciation of value, and it is too early make that conclusion based on our data."
Mr. Adams added that the recovery among larger, more expensive apartments might trickle down and eventually spur demand for smaller, cheaper units. He cautioned, though, that such a scenario is by no means guaranteed. He also predicted that apartments in Manhattan will "see some appreciation" in 1994 as job growth, rents and apartment demand are all thought to be rising this year, while the supply of units remains stagnant because of the dearth of new building.
"I am least confident about the studio and one-bedrooms," he said.
Even among studios and one-bedroom co-op apartments, Mr. Adams said the worst may be over. "At $50,000 a room, it's comparable to renting," he said.
The increasing popularity of condominiums is due, in part, to the declining attractiveness of co-ops over the last five years. Condominiums, though more expensive generally, are easier to buy, sell and rent because there are no restrictive policies. Further, condominiums, unlike co-ops, do not have underlying mortgages and high monthly maintenance fees. In fact, condominium common charges are usually low, though they do not include property taxes, as do co-op maintenance charges.
"I didn't want to the liability of owning a co-op, a piece of the mortgage on the total property," said Nathan Zutty of New Canaan, Conn., who recently paid $332,500 in cash for a 1,400-square-foot, two-bedroom condominium on the Upper East Side. His common charges are $704 a month and his taxes are about $400 a month.
Mr. Zutty, a retired senior manager at Union Carbide in Danbury, Conn., who bought the unit for himself and for his son, Max, a graduate student at Columbia, also believes the New York real estate market is about to be revived. More important, perhaps, he likes New York City. "I was born here, and I always wanted to come back," he said.
BUT not every buyer craves a condominium. Constance Sullivan, for example, said she found it difficult to find a condominium that had the charm -- the moldings, fireplaces and 12-foot ceilings -- of many old co-op buildings. (Pre-war condominiums do exist on Manhattan's Upper East Side, but only a few and the market tends to be dominated by wealthy foreigners.)
"I wanted to be in a prewar building," she said.
Ms. Sullivan, a book packager, said a key factor in her decision to buy a one-bedroom co-op on the Upper East Side for $150,000 was that prices had declined to the point that it made more sense to buy than to continue renting. She had been paying $1,600 a month to rent a similar apartment. For her new apartment, she put 50 percent down and will have a monthly maintenance of $700 a month. "My monthly expenses will be much lower than when I was renting," she said.
Such an endorsement of the co-op market offers little solace to Mr. Mullen, who has offered a trip for two to Hawaii as an inducement to buy. He said his best hopes for selling his apartment probably lie with turning the unit over to a rental tenant in some sort of lease-option arrangement. In the meantime, he'll keep dreaming up novel enticements.
"Maybe we'll offer certificates to Toys-'R'-Us," he said. "It seems to work with gun owners."

HEADLINE: Is There Another Airport in the State's Future?

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER

 BODY:
TRAVELERS using Bradley International Airport at Windsor Locks will be able to fly to more destinations and to choose from more flights under a $364 million plan to expand the airport over the next 20 years.
The plan, developed by the state's Department of Transportation, calls for a new terminal, expansion of an existing terminal and three concourses serving 36 aircraft gates. Ultimately a fourth concourse could be built, raising the number of gates to 54. 
 Improvements like a new Federal inspection service for international flights, a 5,000-space parking garage and a road system serving each terminal with upper and lower roadways are also part of the plan.
The expansion, which must be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, was drawn up to meet increases expected in cargo and passenger traffic. The number of passengers using the airport each year will more than double by the year 2015, from the current 2.3 million to nearly 5.8 million, according to the Transportation Department. And cargo traffic is anticipated to triple over the next 20 years.
 
New Airport Proposed
 But Bradley may not be the state's only international airport in coming years. A group led by William B. Stanley of Norwich, a former state senator, and Arnold M. Danielsen of East Lyme, a retired Coast Guard rear admiral, have their own vision of Connecticut's airport of the future. They have begun an effort to build support for an international airport and industrial complex in a location that may include parts of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. A precise site cannot be chosen until environmental, economic and engineering studies are made, Mr. Danielsen said.
What they call the Gateway Transportation Center would encompass about 30,000 acres and serve as a transfer point for passengers and cargo. Passengers on flights from Europe and Asia would board connecting flights to destinations in the United States. A two-mile-wide band of parkland surrounding the complex would serve as a buffer zone.
"We're talking about a large airport to handle the airplanes of the future that will carry 550 to 800 passengers and go anywhere in the world nonstop," Mr. Danielsen said.
Even though Gateway is at this point scarcely more than an idea, the mere mention of it strikes fear among environmentalists and others who passionately protect eastern Connecticut's forests and farmlands and promise a relentless fight against a jetport.
State and Federal officials, who also oppose the project, cite the high cost and the many environmental obstacles and maintain there are other airports in the region that can do the job. Local legislators have also spoken out, saying there are more workable solutions to the region's economic problems.
 
'No One Wants It'
 "It's not going anywhere," the ranking Republican on the General Assembly's Commerce Committee, State Senator Catherine Welles Cook, a Republican from Groton, said. "No one wants it. No one supports it."
One center of stiff resistance is in Griswold, in the target area for the Gateway. A Griswold resident, Mary Walton, and the Save Our State Coalition regard Gateway as unwanted, unnecessary and impossible. "It will never be able to provide the jobs it promised, nor will it be able to be built," Mrs. Walton said. The project would result not only in the destruction of valuable natural resources, she said, but also in the upheaval of surrounding communities. "Like people around the casino, people here are trying to preserve their land," Mrs. Walton said. "The whole social life would be affected." An international airport and industrial complex for eastern Connecticut is a concept that Mr. Stanley, now a stockbroker, has kept alive for more than 20 years. While he was a state senator from 1966 to 1970, he became convinced that a Gateway was a means of diversifying the state's defense-dominated economy, since the New York and Boston airports could not continue to expand.
 
Highway, Rail and Air Center
 In 1972, the Connecticut Port Authority Study Commission, headed by Mr. Stanley, recommended a regional transportation center that would include highway, rail and air components. But the General Assembly's transportation committee rejected a bill last year authorizing the state to update the 1972 study.
Nevertheless, Mr. Stanley and Mr. Danielsen said they were committed to the Gateway concept, which they envision will provide eastern Connecticut's depressed economy with industry and jobs, and link businesses in the state with markets around the world. The two have set up the Gateway Transportation Center Corporation and a 26-member board of directors, which includes representatives of labor unions, business and industry, academia, service organizations and the Mashantucket Pequot Indians.
An advertisement by the Gateway Corporation in a local newspaper last June solicited money and volunteer help for everything from clerical work to engineering and management. Thirty to 40 volunteers responded, Mr. Danielsen said, and more than 300 groups and individuals signed up as supporters. Some start-up money will be needed from government or private sources, but all additional costs will be financed with bonds, said Mr. Danielsen, who declined to say how much money the corporation had raised so far.
 
Presenting the Case
 Mr. Stanley, who is proposing that Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts collaborate on the project, seems undaunted by his critics. "We must present the case so that various legislators will see the wisdom of it," he said. "This will benefit all three states. I'm not going to get out of the way until somebody else comes up with a better idea."
Another Gateway critic, Richard Strauss, Deputy Commissioner of the State Transportation Department, said that the department was trying to attract international flights to Bradley Airport and that a $300 million investment to expand Bradley was minor compared with the cost of a new airport. Bradley's runways are adequate for the types of aircraft expected in the future, and the longest runway can accommodate flights to European destinations. Areas now used for cargo and general aviation will also meet future needs, according to the 20-year plan.
The airport employs 5,000 people, with a total payroll of about $94 million, according to the Transportation Department. The economic benefit to the region is expected to increase from nearly $808 million to about $2.4 billion annually in the next 20 years.
 
'Too Many Airports'
 In addition, a new United Parcel Service cargo installation is scheduled to open at Bradley by the late 1990's, Mr. Strauss said. "What advantage is there in moving traffic from Bradley to a Gateway only 30 miles away?" he asked. "There are too many airports in the area. I don't see the airlines providing service to Boston, Bradley, a Gateway and Providence, and being able to come up with the traffic to fill the planes."
The Federal Aviation Administration has taken the Transportation Department's position. "We try to be consistent with what the state is calling for in its system plan and incorporate it into the Federal plan," the manager of the F.A.A.'s airports division, Vincent Scarano, said. "There's nothing that indicates a need in their system plan for a new airport. Cargo and passenger needs are served by existing airports."
Mr. Danielsen argued that dense populations around most airports prevented their expansion into an airport and industrial complex and that the cost and public inconvenience in expanding Bradley would be high compared with building a new airport in an isolated region.
At Gateway Transportation Center, on the other hand, cargo planes would be provided with loading sites at warehouses in the industrial park. "Our Gateway would be the vehicle," he said, "that would allow businesses to have the 'just-in-time deliveries' that we find so essential in today's very competitive world economy."
The assistant director of public relations for the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Tribal Council, Joseph Carter, is one of two members of the tribe on the Gateway Corporation's board. Mr. Carter said an international jetport in eastern Connecticut would open desirable European markets to the tribe's enterprise, Foxwood High Stakes Bingo and Casino in Ledyard. Bradley Airport is about 60 miles from the casino.
 
Unions Support Plan
 Although the Mashantuckets have not invested any money in Gateway, Mr. Carter said, the tribe is taking a close look at the project's potential. "It would benefit the whole area, not just the casino, by opening a bigger field for businesses and recreation," he said.
Also on the board are John Olsen, president of the Connecticut A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has endorsed the Gateway Transportation Center, and Cameron G. Champlin Jr., business manager of the United Association of Plumbers and Steam Fitters, Local 305. Mr. Champlin said Gateway was the only project he knew of that would put thousands of people who have lost their jobs back to work. About 100 members of the local's rank and file voted recently to donate $2,500 to the Gateway Corporation.
"New England, and especially Connecticut, has a very highly educated work force," Mr. Champlin said. "If we don't do something now, they're going to move to other parts of the country."
But Representative Steven Mikutel, Democrat of Griswold, a critic of Gateway, accused Mr. Stanley and Mr. Danielsen of manipulating hard economic times to sell the project. "It's like starving somebody for a month and then asking if they want to eat," he said. "You don't ask for a decision like this in a poor economic climate. The tendency is to seize any plan."
Fear of a jetport in his backyard nags at Mr. Mikutel, who has been nervously eyeing Mr. Stanley's brainchild for 20 years. "People don't want outsiders like Bill Stanley, who lives in Norwich, saying it's fine to build a jetport in my district,' he said. "There's no compromise. We're going to fight this until they die or we die."
Gateway supporters face another opponent, the Commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Protection, Timothy R. E. Keeney, who said the many permits required to build an international jetport on virgin land made a site in eastern Connecticut impractical. A large airport, he added, would make it difficult for Connecticut to comply with the Federal Clean Air Act. "For the increase in air pollution the project would bring, it would have to be offsets elsewhere in the state," he said. "My suggestion is that time might be better spent on another project."
 
Task Force Has Ideas
 Although the state's Department of Economic Development has taken its place in the opposition lineup, the department's spokesman, Joseph M. Cohen, described Mr. Stanley as a man with a vision and political savvy. "Bill Stanley is a visionary who saw something that is likely to happen somewhere, someday," he said. "But whether he can make it happen in this century is a big question mark."
Mrs. Cook, the State Senator from Groton, has come up with an alternative to Gateway. The legislature's export task force, which she heads, is looking for ways to improve export opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses in the state. The task force is examining trade financing problems, changes in the tax code, and infrastructure improvements like more warehouse space at Bradley Airport.
But the Gateway idea will not go away and has, in fact, grown into a volatile issue with powerful players on both sides. Mr. Danielsen is recruiting more people for the corporation's board not only from Connecticut but also from Rhode Island and Massachusetts. "We owe it to ourselves to seize this great opportunity before another, more aggressive and imaginative state grabs the brass ring," he said.

 BODY:

YUGOSLAV BREAKUP
A forum on the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia will be held at Purchase College Friday at noon, free of charge. Visitors may bring lunch.
The speakers, Evan Kraft, assistant professor of economics at Salisbury State University in Maryland, and Jill Benderly, a journalist and author, have family ties in that beleaguered region. 
 Ms. Benderly participated in establishing an international tribunal to investigate the rape of Bosnian women by enemy forces, and she has been active in the United States and the former Yugoslavia in feminist pursuits. Professor Kraft, a former member of the Purchase College faculty, recently returned from a research visit to Bosnia, adding to his data on the destruction of the economy of the region.
The program will take place in the Social Science Auditorium on the Purchase College campus, 735 Anderson Hill Road. The number to call for more information is 251-6600 or 251-6050.

 
TREE-PRUNING SESSION
Pruning small ornamental trees correctly will be demonstrated on Saturday at Lasdon Park and Arboretum in Somers, organized by the Master Gardeners of Westchester Cooperative Extension of Cornell University.
Carmine Serpe, president of Serpe Tree Service in Scarsdale and member of the American Society of Consulting Arborists and the National Arborists Association, will conduct the session, offering advice based on 45 years of experience.
He will present a one-hour lecture before taking the group outdoors to do some actual pruning, emphasizing the preservation of the tree's inherent structure. Japanese maples, dogwoods, crabapples, flowering cherry and magnolias are frequently topped off, ruining their natural appearance, Mr. Serpe said.
"In winter, when the leaves are off, is the ideal time to observe their natural shape, and in their dormant state, the best time to prune," he said. "Other than removing diseased or broken branches, pruning of older trees should consist of cutting back to the same point each year. Young trees with long shoots should be left alone: the other branches will catch up as the tree matures."
Lasdon Park is off Route 35, and the phone number is 232-3141. Boots and cold-weather gear should be worn. The admission fee will be $7.50; reservations are necessary. More information may be obtained by calling 666-4549.

 
ZYDECO PERFORMANCE
 Roy Carrier and the Nite-Rockers is the latest zydeco band to hit Westchester, performing Saturday night at the Free Synagogue, 500 North Columbus Avenue in the Fleetwood section of Mount Vernon. Free dance lessons will be given from 7:30 to 8:30, and music for listening and dancing begins at 8:30 and continues to midnight. Admission will be $12.50 at the door.
Many aficionados say that Mr. Carrier is one of the few remaining zydeco purists, eschewing amplified instruments and hewing to the original guitars, drums, accordion and rubboard. He has recorded extensively for Lanor Records since 1984, and he jams with other professionals and amateurs every Thursday night at his Offshore Lounge in Lawtell, La.
The barnlike roadhouse accommodating 500 people sits next to Carrier's oversized mobile home and was named for his former vocation -- driller on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico during the 1970's. But his musical calling is one of long standing, beginning with the Sears Roebuck catalogue guitar bought for him by his mother when he was a teen-ager.
In recent years he has become a mentor for up-and-coming zydeco musicians, including John Delafose, Beau Jacques and Zydeco Force. His son, Chubby Carrier, still plays with the Nite-Rockers when not occupied with his own band.
For more information, the number to call is 381-0708.

 
VERSATILE BAND
 Shockra, a five-piece band from Boston, plays jazz, funk, rock and rhythm and blues with an energetic edge that inspires its audiences to dance rather than listen sitting down. Its first recording, "Garuda's Groove," was released as a compact disk last May by Apogee Records and has been selling well.
Dave Watts is the drummer and principal songwriter; Dan Coutu is the keyboardist and sound effects man, and Edwin Hurwitz thumps the bass.
Felix Rentschler doubles as guitarist and composer, and Jeff Grove plays saxophone and does vocals, which has contributed to the group's singular sound. The band may be heard at 7 Willow Street in Port Chester on Saturday from 9 P.M. to 4 A.M.
The nightclub, named for its location, is ensconced in a former small opera house. There is no food service, just drinks and music, with a Saturday night cover charge of $10 in advance, $12 at the door. The number to call for reservations is 939-1474.

 
'PETER AND THE WOLF'
 Prokofiev's "Peter and the Wolf" will be performed twice today by the Bronx Arts Ensemble and the Bronx Dance Theater, first at 2 P.M. and again at 3:30 P.M. The fully staged, hour-long production will be presented in the studios of the Dance Theater at 204th Street and Bainbridge Avenue in the Bronx.
Barbara Klein, artistic director of the Dance Theater, was the choreographer, and Yehuda Gilead, conductor of the Colonial Symphony Orchestra in Madison, New Jersey, will conduct musicians of the Bronx Arts Ensemble.
The cast, will be made up of students from the Dance Theater, and a musical introduction to the instruments of the orchestra will be provided by the Bronx Arts Ensemble members.
Tickets are $12 for adults, $10 for children under 12. Call (718) 652-7655 for reservations and directions.

 
PLEIN-AIR PAINTERS
 Just when most people figured plein-air painters had gone the way of the nickel subway ride, up pop five practicing, contemporary Hudson River School artists whose work may be seen at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson in Dutchess County.
The show opens with a reception and free artists' symposium on Thursday at 4:30 P.M. in the college's Procter Art Center, and the pictures will remain on view through March 8. Visiting hours are 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. seven days a week; admission is free.
George Van Hook, one of the exhibitors, has shown his work in galleries and museums across the United States and in France, and he believes that "the work of a plein-air artist is as valid today as it was in former centuries."
He argues that an increasingly alien and often hostile technological environment has had a disorienting effect on many artists, and a return to painting on-site in daylight has provided an escape from the confinement of studios and the numbing impact of high-tech art on the senses.
Other painters represented in the exhibition are James H. Cramer Jr., Robert Hacunda, Robert Schneider and Seth Nadel, all of whom, including Mr. Van Hook, live in the Hudson Valley region.
More information and directions may be obtained by calling the college at 758-6822.

 
CLASSES FOR DISABLED
 An introduction to a program that trains disabled people to qualify for jobs in desk-top publishing or desk-top video production, or to start a similar venture at home, is scheduled Thursday at 11 A.M. at the Choices Center, 125 North Main Street in Port Chester.
Arranged by Westchester Disabled on the Move of Yonkers, the session will include observation of a class in progress and a briefing on the 5-to-11-month courses. They are available to disabled people with average or above-average intelligence who are referred to the center by the State Education Department, which pays the tuition. Classes meet twice a week six hours a day, and 20 hours of homework a week is assigned.
"We assess the referrals in terms of aptitude," said Jean Campbell, the center's director, "not previously acquired computer skills." Classes are formed with an average of five students 18 or older. "Most of our students became disabled through illness or accident," Ms. Campbell said. "We have the adaptive devices to assist them and the latest hard and software on which to learn." There is no charge for Thursday's workshop. The number to call to register or obtain more information is 968-4717. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: It's a Business. No, It's a Religion

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
THE Texas Medical Center here is the nation's largest health care complex by far, with more acreage than Central Park, more Federal money than the Johnson Space Center and more human traffic than Disneyland. But for two of the nation's foremost heart surgeons, the place isn't big enough for the both of them. In word and deed, these two rivals personify the struggle within the medical establishment over how to deal with outsiders clamoring to control health care costs.
On one side is Michael E. DeBakey, 85 years old and still practicing. Many operations that are now routine first took place under his knife, including the bypass procedure that has kept millions of failing hearts throbbing. 
 But now he is on the defensive, intent on preserving the traditions of American medical research, training and treatment. He says the pressure to contain medical costs endangers not only patients on the operating-room table today but also those who would someday benefit from the expensive research, like his, that has made American medicine arguably the best in the world.
He mocks the growing number of physicians who are accepting prices and practice standards dictated by Government bureaucrats or insurers. When someone from an insurance company -- "some clerk," he says -- called recently to urge him to discharge a 90-year-old stroke victim, he snapped: "You come here and tell the patient's relatives you want her transferred to your care. Otherwise, butt out."
Dr. DeBakey's complaint: "You've got people with no experience in medicine deciding whether a patient should be operated on or how long they should stay in the hospital. All of a sudden they're empowered. You should get some idea how things are going to be under the Clinton plan."
On the other side is Denton A. Cooley, 73, whose achievements include the first use of a man-made heart and leading more open-heart operations -- 60,000 -- than anyone else. He insists that American medicine must change, must become more economical.
Anticipating the triumph of cost-conscious care a decade ago, he swore he could make heart surgery better and cheaper at the same time. Since then, he has signed up 75 insurance plans, including those for Delta Air Lines, Tenneco and Shell, offering them cut-rate, fixed-price heart operations and treatment in return for the patronage of the people they insure. A businessman as well as a physician, he has been called the Sam Walton of heart surgery. He takes it as a compliment.
"Of the many firsts with which I have been involved at the Texas Heart Institute, including the first successful human heart transplant in the United States and the first total artificial heart transplant in the world, the achievement that may have the greatest impact on health care did not occur in the operating room or research laboratory," he wrote recently. "It happened on a piece of paper, 10 years ago, when we created the first-ever packaged pricing plan for cardiovascular surgical procedures."
Although their offices are separated by just a few corridors, Drs. Cooley and DeBakey argue only indirectly. They have refused to talk to each other for 25 years, ever since Dr. DeBakey accused his former protege of stealing his devices to implant the first artificial heart.
"I don't regard him as anyone I need to talk with," Dr. DeBakey said. Dr. Cooley draws no inspiration from his rival either. "He's indicated that health care is the cheapest commodity available," he said. "I have somewhat different opinions. I think it's been overpriced."
The battle between Dr. DeBakey and Dr. Cooley is emblematic of the disputes not just among the 10,000 physicians and Ph.D.'s at the medical center here, but also among the more than 600,000 doctors across the United States. Dr. DeBakey's conviction that doctors alone should decide on how to care for their patients and what it will cost retains great influence. But increasingly, Dr. Cooley's willingness to adapt to a changed marketplace, even take advantage of it, is winning the day. The two surgeons' experiences at Texas Medical Center attest to that.
 
The Battleground
A Medical Fortress Under Siege
 The Texas Medical Center was born more than 50 years ago with an act of Texas populism. The legislature, noting the state's high rates of cancer, decided to provide care and research. With matching donations from a wealthy cotton broker, Monroe D. Anderson, and friends, the center got its start in 1942 on a campus 15 minutes south of downtown Houston.
Today, Fannin Street, known locally as Bedpan Alley, courses through a center with almost 55,000 workers, more than any other Houston employer or any corporation in the state. No other medical complex in the country comes close; the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Md., the second-largest medical center, has 16,490 employees. Texas Medical Center's more than 100,000 daily patients, employees and visitors outnumber Disneyland's daily count by tens of thousands.
The center's combined operating budgets exceed $4 billion a year, with a good deal more than $1 billion from Federal sources, more than goes to operate the Johnson Space Center, according to Texas Medical Center officials.
And it is still growing. The center's institutions have already developed 670 acres, with hundreds more acquired, giving the institutions more land than Central Park's 843 acres.
The center's 14 hospitals and 27 other clinics, schools and research centers serve a clientele as diverse as the surrounding city. At the upper end is Methodist Hospital, the nation's wealthiest with a cash reserve running well into the hundreds of millions of dollars; it is the nation's largest private tax-exempt hospital, with more than 1,500 beds. It offers a skylit palm court, with marble floors and Chippendale furniture, as well as the services of Dr. DeBakey.
Right next door is Dr. Cooley's hospital, St. Luke's Episcopal. It is more the middle-class hospital, with vinyl tile floors and a McDonald's in the basement. Hermann Hospital and a Veterans Administration hospital are also comprehensive, while Texas Children's Hospital and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center pursue their specialties.
There are also two medical schools, Baylor and the University of Texas, as well as schools of nursing, dentistry and other professions.
Finally, there is Ben Taub, the county's public hospital, whose doctors are so familiar with urban violence that, using a video link, they were able to instruct their counterparts in battlefield treatment during the siege of the Russian Parliament.
The medical center provides whatever coordination, including roads, security and some group purchasing, that the center's many institutions will agree to. But each jealous institution has its own management and budget. And each has had its own way of answering demands for cost controls, from Methodist's refusal to grant discounts for any company or insurer, to St. Luke's eagerness to strike deals for treatment.
Until quite recently, Dr. DeBakey's ardent convictions held greater sway here. If hospitals and doctors nationwide have resisted abandoning their independent ways, Houston's have been especially stubborn.
But in an age when insurers want economy and simplicity, the Texas Medical Center is a superconducting supercollider. The treatment practiced at the medical center remains expensive and specialized at a time when health care buyers in business and government, indeed President Clinton himself, want to increase reliance on medical generalists, community hospitals and clinics that can often treat all but the most serious cases more cheaply.
DECADES ago, most of the medical center's hospitals tried to avoid duplication of services, saving the expense of empty beds or idle staff and machinery. But the center's major hospitals now each have specialists in every field. Not to mention lots of equipment, including 12 million-dollar magnetic resonance imaging machines that Roger Altman, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, recently cited in a speech as an example of waste.
Dr. M. David Low, a neurologist who is president of the University of Texas schools of medicine and related subjects here, said that closer cooperation among rivals can yield great savings. The institutions at Texas Medical Center have so far refused close cooperation, however. For example, they don't think Dr. Low's idea for all 14 hospitals to form a Texas Medical Center Healthcare Plan, then bid on contracts to offer their services as one huge group, could possibly work.
But what the hospitals haven't done themselves, the organizations paying the bills are beginning to do for them. Control of the medical center has been slipping from the long, dexterous fingers of surgeons like Mr. DeBakey into the stubbier hands of people like Ralph T. Smith Jr.
Mr. Smith, director of employee benefits at Mitchell Energy and Development, an oil and gas producer, has shaped an alliance of businesses, also including Compaq and Baker Hughes, that has brought the medical center's hospitals to heel.
The alliance's goal: steer patients to the hospitals with the best records for each treatment. The hospitals with the highest survival rates for, say, heart surgery, and the ability to meet the alliance's prices, would get the business; the others would not, and might see their departments wither away. "Every industry has gone through a shakeout," Mr. Smith said. "Now it is their turn."
Dr. Cooley's approach, which the business alliance applauds, is increasingly guiding the medical center. "His group was the first in the medical center to provide a one-price package of services," Dr. Low said.
In the past few months, every other hospital at the medical center has followed the Cooley example. Even Methodist Hospital, Dr. DeBakey's home, moved into the new era on Jan. 1, through a contract with Mr. Smith's Houston Health Care Purchasing Organization. Faced with the loss of patients from Houston's leading companies, Methodist joined other Texas Medical Center hospitals in negotiating a fee schedule and, reluctantly, allowing the purchasing group to study its treatment records.
The hospitals have changed in other ways too. Last September, Methodist began moving into basic, primary care with the purchase of the humble Diagnostic Center Hospital.
All the hospitals are also finding ways to treat more patients without admitting them. M.D. Anderson has moved into home and outpatient chemotherapy, for example.
With 20 to 30 percent of their beds empty (except at Ben Taub, the county hospital, with less than 10 percent), the hospitals have also been trimming their staffs. St. Luke's has, over the last year, begun ranking doctors on how thrifty they are with drugs, nursing, operating-room time, hospital stays, even bandages.
So much for the notion that real change in medicine awaits the Clinton health plan. "While we were preoccupied with Washington," Dr. Low said, "this managed-care train came and ran over us from behind."
Indeed, the center's managers feel they are under attack in a place where the fences that once protected them from people obsessed with cost have fallen. "Have you read Jurassic Park?" asked Richard E. Wainerdi, the center's president, likening his complex to the island where dinosaurs gained control over humans.
 
On the Defensive
Michael DeBakey: Guard the Faith
 The office suite where he is seated may be a shrine to Michael E. DeBakey, lined with plaques, trophies, honorary degrees and notes from the world's leaders, but it's a shrine to academic medicine as well. Dr. DeBakey remains so obsessed with his trade that he seems to change out of his scrubs only when a president or prime minister wants to hand him another medal.
Just last Sunday, he showed President Clinton the new artificial heart he is developing with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, borrowing the space agency's know-how in miniaturization and pumping. Then he flew to New York to display the heart on CBS.
At 85, he has permitted himself to cut back, but still sweeps into the operating room when friends or patients of long standing insist. One recent evening he did a quadruple bypass complicated by a valve replacement, relying on many of the techniques he had initiated.
The next morning, he was back. For a patient who had nearly lost the use of his legs, he restored circulation by running two new arteries from the aorta, near the heart, down through the groin, using the standard dacron grafts he also developed.
His most grateful and wealthy patients have given him Ferraris, Maseratis, Jaguars, Alfa Romeos. (Too impatient to keep fixing such finicky cars, he instead drives a Volkswagen. "It still has good acceleration, so I can get around people," he said.)
BUT these days, Dr. DeBakey says, many patients who want to see him cannot, forbidden by their health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.'s. He tells of a woman whose aorta had ballooned like an old innertube, a defect that kills 9 of 10 within six months. A doctor in her family told her to see Dr. DeBakey, who had first developed the repair work for the condition. On learning that her H.M.O. was balking at an operation, especially using a doctor outside its network, he asked, "Do you have a lawyer in the family?" She did. After the lawyer threatened to hold the H.M.O. responsible for her death, Dr. DeBakey operated, and she survived.
He was just as tough when an aide to Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, called recently. He knows that the Clinton health plan would offer some subsidies for teaching and research, and that the Houston business alliance pays teaching hospitals like his an extra percentage point or two on top of fees it pays other hospitals. But it's not enough, he says. Teaching hospitals say their costs are 20 percent higher than other hospitals'.
For Dr. DeBakey, parsimony that leads to cuts in medical training and research is as bad as a botched operation. "My definition of stupidity is an inability to learn from experience," he said. "The English are saying they have a health care crisis. They are closing three of the most important teaching hospitals because they don't have the money." Now we're going the British way, into penny-wise medicine, he charges. "If that's not stupidity, I don't know what is."
Especially when corporate chiefs ask, he questions why they want to foist lower-cost care on their workers. When the top executives themselves need heart surgery, he said, "They come to the best."
Dr. DeBakey looks down at Dr. Cooley as a mass marketer of second-rate medicine. "You have to think in terms of quality," Dr. DeBakey said. "When we do an open-heart procedure, we have two technicians with that pump. They don't. I know that for a fact. We have two people in anesthesiology. We think that makes a difference." (Dr. Cooley, however, says he usually uses two technicians and two anesthesiologists.)
An academic medical center, Dr. DeBakey said, should have higher ambitions than Dr. Cooley's. "He is interested in doing large volumes of surgery at cheap prices. There are many community hospitals doing the same thing and just as cheaply."
Research, training and the best treatment cost more, he said. "Most of our cases are not routine. A lot of theirs are. Sure, you can cut costs. But you get what you pay for."
Dr. DeBakey, a lifelong Democrat who boasts of having made the Nixon enemies list and who recounts how he has welcomed the Government's past efforts to broaden access to medical care, would like to see more spending for health care but less for some doctors. Comfortable on a substantial income that, he says, has never approached $1 million, he gives 75 percent of his fees to Baylor, and insists others on the faculty contribute too. "In the academic world, you don't have time to use all that excess money," he said. "You're interested in providing the best teaching and care. Your leisure time is your work."
 
On the Offensive
Denton Cooley: Hear the Market
 Dr. Cooley's office is not so intimidating as his rival's. It's less like a shrine than a good-old-boy club for Denton Cooley alone. Medical journals and pictures of him with presidents abound, but there too is a disheveled bar, a stack of Playboys and a print commemorating his eagle on an especially tough hole. On the top shelf of the bar sits a plaque. "Poverty sucks," it says, above the double-R Rolls Royce emblem.
From a wealthy Houston family, Dr. Cooley remains much more a part of the city than his rival, whose voice hints of his Louisiana origins but whose only roots seem to be in the territory beyond Type A. He mixes easily with other Houston business leaders, among them his sometimes golfing partner, a certain George Bush. Like them, he is a conservative, favoring rambunctious free enterprise unconstrained by Government. His medical deal-making is no less than could be expected from any executive alert to his market.
He came home to Houston in 1951 to join the Baylor faculty and to work at Methodist with Dr. DeBakey, who had already expanded what doctors could do for heart disease. As Dr. Cooley's own fame grew, he chafed at Dr. DeBakey's rule and moved most of his practice to St. Luke's by 1960.
The complete rupture came in 1969 when Dr. DeBakey heard that Dr. Cooley had implanted the first artificial heart. Dr. DeBakey accused Dr. Cooley of stealing his artificial heart and his research, by secretly contracting with one of Dr. DeBakey's aides. Dr. Cooley says that, with a patient near death, it was urgent to try the new heart.
THE rivalry intensified. Just as Dr. DeBakey has his own research institute at the center, bearing his name, Dr. Cooley has one, the Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke's. He also continues to do research. For patients whose systems are too weak or damaged for heart bypasses, he is experimenting with a laser to drill tiny holes to supply the heart muscles with blood from inside the heart chamber.
By the early 1980's, Dr. Cooley and his surgeons were performing 5,000 open-heart operations a year, mostly bypasses, and his annual medical income passed $9 million. He bought prime Houston real estate. He donated three professorships to the University of Texas at Austin, his college, and $1 million for a gym at Johns Hopkins, his medical school.
Then came the oil, banking and real estate crashes. Dr. Cooley filed for bankruptcy in 1989, listing debts of almost $100 million.
His income has shrunk to about $1.5 million a year, he said. New methods of cleaning out the circulatory system, with medicines and Roto-Rooter-style instruments, have halved the number of open-heart operations under his direction. He also faces new competition from other hospitals, many staffed by doctors he or Dr. DeBakey trained.
The decline would have been much steeper but for his courting of corporations and health maintenance organizations with fixed fees. Now, he offers a bypass for $27,040, well below the national average of $43,370.
He says Dr. DeBakey charges more for treatment that is no better. "He's never cared too much about costs," Dr. Cooley said. The clear plastic tubes that draw blood out of the heart and into a machine during surgery? "A simple plastic tube can cost as much as $75," he said. "We use one that costs less than $10. It has the same qualities that they say makes theirs for $75 foolproof."
He reduces risks, and expense, by minimizing the time that patients are under his knife, ceaselessly modifying and simplifying. "I think people price themselves out of business," he said. "Abercrombie & Fitch has challenges from stores like Wal-Mart."
Watching Dr. Cooley operate, as doctors visiting from Egypt and Italy were one recent morning, is a lesson in economy. No wasted movement, no errant emotion, no extra tools.
The surgery was to replace both a heart valve and the root of the aorta just above in a woman from Michigan, stopping her heart for about 47 minutes, and all circulation for 9.
Let Dr. DeBakey and others gripe about H.M.O.'s and the Clinton plan. Dr. Cooley thinks he can adapt to cost controls, and make a good living at it. "Some of the hospitals that are more expensive than ours are going to suffer for it," he said. "They are going to find some way to contain costs or else they are not going to have patients."
On the one hand, the surgeon who realizes medicine is a business. On the other, one who treats it as a religion. Both have a lot to offer. The challenge for Texas Medical Center, as well as the country, is to combine the best of both of them.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Foreign Investment Roars Into Bombay

BYLINE: By Sanjoy Hazarika

DATELINE: BOMBAY

 BODY:
SINCE November, one of the world's hottest stock markets has been the Bombay Stock Exchange, thanks to an avalanche of foreign investment and the gradual opening of what was once one of the world's most insular economies.
After soaring early last week to 4,162 points on the Bombay Sensitivity Index, the market closed Friday at 3,991 points, a 24 percent rise, in dollar terms, since the first of the year and a rise of almost 50 percent since November. Bombay's is the third best performing market after Brazil and Finland this year. 
 The exchange's last bull run, which drove the index to a record 4,500 in August 1992, was a consequence of fraudulent purchases on credit, which inflated prices. After that boom, laws permitting mutual funds and other foreign institutional investors to invest here were eased in September 1992. But it was not until last summer that substantial funds started arriving.
Their arrival reflected the fact that foreign investors were moving out of markets elsewhere, especially Japan, as well as growing confidence that the stock market scandal of 1992 was over and that the political and social turmoil in India had subsided. Extensive Hindu-Muslim riots in 1992 and 1993 appeared to have abated and Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao had overcome a challenge to his leadership.
Under prior Government rules, overseas investors were barred from playing the Indian markets. Under current regulations, they can put money into Indian companies through foreign institutional investors registered with India's Securities and Exchange Board as overseas investment funds.
One such fund, and the first available to American investors on the New York Stock Exchange, is the closed-end India Growth Fund, which invests primarily in Indian corporate stocks. It closed Friday at $26.625 a share, off from its 52-week high of $30.75 early last month. (Individual foreign investors still cannot directly invest in the market here and foreign institutions can't hold more than 24 percent of stock in a listed company.)
Stock analysts say an estimated $1 billion has surged into the market from overseas buyers in the past few months. In addition, Indian companies have raised more than $1 billion from international markets, all of that through Euro-issues, most of which were heavily oversubscribed. More than 40 Indian corporations are scheduled to float new Euro-issues this year, which may fetch another $4 billion to $5 billion.
A. N. Kolhatkar, the executive director of the Bombay Stock Exchange, said he hoped for an influx of $3 billion into the Indian market through foreign portfolio investors. "The market is buoyant and it is a natural rise although we have too much money chasing too few premium scrips," Mr. Kolhatkar said, referring to individual stocks.
Foreign institutional investors are also tapping the Indian market by raising money here. One example is the Morgan Stanley Growth Fund, the first onshore fund organized by a major foreign investment house. Aiming to raise about $100 million, the company was overwhelmed last month by some 1.4 million Indian investors who put about $300 million into the fund.
From a bare 2.5 million investors in 1980, the Bombay market has galloped to 22.5 million, as more and more Indians turned to it instead of trusting in such traditional investments as gold.
"Foreign investors are coming into India because of the recessions in the United States, Europe and Japan," said Hemendra Kothari, a leading stockbroker whose company, DSP Consultants, helped manage the Morgan Stanley issue. "This is a growing economy, with sophisticated and historic traditions of trading and business, it has a vast consumer class and there is quick appreciation on investments."
Keen to seize the opportunities here, other big foreign investors have also entered the market. They include Alliance Capital, Barclays Zoette Wedd, Fidelity Investments and Lloyd George Management.
As a result of financial measures aimed at liberalizing the economy -- devaluing the rupee, reducing regulations and red tape, opening the doors to foreign investment -- India's Gross National Product is growing at about 4.5 percent a year and inflation has fallen to single-digit levels.
One important hurdle for the market, however, is the lack of adequate custodial services to handle the growing number of transactions. The slow speed of settlement, a paper-intensive market and infrastructural strains are obvious.
Under Securities and Exchange Board rules, only the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank and Citibank qualify to handle custodial services for foreign companies purchasing shares. They have been overwhelmed with the scale of the paperwork, which is largely a consequence of the lack of computerization.
Board officials, concerned about a possible slowing of foreign investment, say it may take several weeks to resolve the problem and that more Indian and foreign banks must share the load. There is talk too of a National Depository, which could pave the way for paperless trading.
Yet major stockbrokers and analysts are bullish about the Indian market over the next few months.
"The index is bound to rise because there is bound to be further liberalization and once the economy opens up, the process is irreversible," said Radheshyam Goenka, one of India's leading stockbrokers.

HEADLINE: At Work;
After the Divorce, the Deluge

SERIES: Second in a series of articles on women and pensions.

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
THERE are so many ways for a woman to end up living in poverty when she is elderly that it seems almost churlish to focus on one particular group as more victimized than any other. Women may, for example, work at jobs in companies unlikely to offer significant retirement coverage and for wages so low that saving is virtually impossible. Or, to increase their income, they may juggle two or three low-paying jobs. Together, the jobs may add up to years of more-than-full-time employment and yield a living wage -- but no benefits and certainly no pension.
Or they may enter and leave the labor force as family duties ebb and flow, interrupting the long march toward qualifying for retirement plans, or lowering the amount they will receive. Or their husbands may die, leaving them with considerably less than the expected amount of retirement income. "Our life patterns are different than the life patterns of men," said Lou Glasse, president of the Washington-based Older Women's League. 
 All women may be at the mercy of their life patterns, but women who divorce in midlife or later are shoved with sudden force into a vulnerable subset of the female experience. It is women who have done what was expected of them and led the most exemplary middle-class lives who may be the least prepared to face the reduced circumstances in which they will very likely find themselves in old age.
A study last year of the economic status of older divorced women by the Brandeis University Policy Center on Aging painted a Lucian Freud-ish picture of the so-called golden years. The study noted that only 5 percent of divorced women living on Social Security and a private pension were poor, but it also revealed that only about a quarter of older women (age 62 and over) receive a pension in addition to Social Security. The median annual income of older divorced women is about $9,000 (in 1990 dollars) and has been growing at a below-inflation rate of 1.5 percent.
Both the study and experts in pensions and divorce say changes in matrimonial law since 1970, when California became the first state to allow "no-fault" divorce -- based on irreconcilable differences instead of designating a guilty party -- have generally not worked to the benefit of women. Where the courts once used alimony and tangible assets to punish and reward, they now focus on distributing property fairly. They have expanded the definition of property to include intangibles like potential earning power and pensions, but in the process women have come to receive alimony less often and for shorter periods of time. The first major study of California's no-fault divorce law, published in 1985, found that men's standard of living went up 42 percent in the first year after divorce and women's went down 73 percent.
The last thing women may be thinking about as they contemplate the sinking trend line of their post-divorce income is a pension that won't come home to roost for several years. "Women, especially if they have children, may have other priorities. They have short-term problems," said Anna Rappaport, a senior actuary in the Chicago office of William M. Mercer Inc., the human resource consultants. "It's easy to say I'm going to solve a 2-year problem at the expense of a 10-year problem."
COMPOUNDING the difficulty is the well-documented reluctance of some women to throw themselves wholeheartedly into financial and retirement planning. "Women don't know enough about the issues," Ms. Rappaport said. "When they make a settlement, they let the husbands keep their pensions without realizing the economic impact."
Women are often not well-served by their lawyers, who themselves may be unfamiliar with the intricacies of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Federal law covering private pensions; the Retirement Equity Act of 1984, which broadened the rights of divorced spouses, or the particular pension system relevant to their client. And some lawyers, according to several pension advocates, simply don't think about pensions and benefits, which are not automatically put into play when the marital assets go on the table during a divorce. They may not anticipate changes, like remarriage or the death of the ex-husband, that could nullify the agreement and leave the woman with nothing. Such lapses are not uncommon despite the fact that a traditional defined-benefit pension accrued during a lifetime career at one employer will often be the couple's largest asset, after their home.
WHAT is to be done? First, learn about your family finances and catalogue your potential pension assets. Think long and hard before handling a divorce without a lawyer. When you do engage a lawyer, make sure he or she is knowledgeable about pensions, especially if you fall into a special category, like one of the Federal retirement systems. And if you feel you might be wrecking your karma by raising these topics when you are not contemplating a divorce, or if you can't cope with them when you are, ponder for a moment living alone in old age on the $500 monthly Social Security payment women typically receive.

You Decide: Puredrug's Dilemma

 BODY:
To stimulate thinking about global business ethics, the Columbia University Graduate School of Business has prepared case studies. One study, by Joanne B. Ciulla, Karen Marquiss and Hans A. Wolf, is adapted below. If you ran Puredrug -- a fictitious company, with fictitious employees -- what would you do?
YOU are the chief executive of Puredrug, a large, global pharmaceutical company. Your firm has an outstanding reputation for quality as well as a long-term record of growth and profitability. 
 But by October 1993 the company is in trouble. Due to a general economic downturn and product development problems, the firm faces a declining market share and weak profits.
You call an emergency meeting of your top managers. Charles Dunn, head of the export division, reminds you that his department has an opportunity to sign an $8 million sales contract with the Philippine Government. The contract involves Travolene, a new injectable medicine developed by Puredrug for treating serious viral infections, including measles. The drug remains difficult and expensive to manufacture and has been in very short supply since its introduction. The 1993 budget did not include this Philippines sale because there was not enough product available.
Mr. Dunn mentions that Puredrug's inventory contains a large lot of Travolene, produced at a cost of about $2 million. The United States Government rejected the batch for the domestic market on the basis of a new, very sensitive test for endotoxin, a toxic substance. The authorities recently added the new test to the standard safety test, which had been used for many years. The new test revealed a very low level of endotoxin in the Travolene; the old procedure uncovered none.
You ask Ann Doe, the company's chief medical safety officer, whether this rules out shipping the batch to the Philippines. She explains that the Philippines and many other countries still rely exclusively on the old test. "It always takes them a while to adopt more sophisticated practices, and sometimes they never do," she said. "Endotoxin might cause high fever when injected into patients," she added, "but I can't tell you that the level in this batch is high enough to cause trouble. Still, how can we have a double standard, one for our nation and one for third world countries?"
Mr. Dunn disagrees. "It's not our job to overprotect other countries," he said. "The Philippines health authorities know what they are doing. Our officials always take an extreme position. Measles is a serious illness. Last year in the Philippines, half of the children who contracted measles died. It's not only good business but also good ethics to send them the only batch of Travolene we have available." The sale also would put Puredrug into the black for 1993 and help foster a lucrative relationship with the Philippines.
Uneasy, you leave the meeting. You have 72 hours to present a plan to your company board.

Strategies for Rising Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
IF the Federal Reserve thought it was being clear about the future of interest rates when it said on Feb. 4 that it was lifting the Federal funds rate by a quarter-point -- well, the markets bought the idea for a day.
On the Friday the rate rise was announced, stock prices dropped (wouldn't money be hightailing it to grab those higher yields?) and long-term Treasury funds lost a little over half a point (wouldn't they have to, to match the higher yields?). 
 But with the stock market bouncing back last week, the question became: Is the Fed's move really a long-awaited signal that the era of falling interest rates is over? If so, now what?
While the Fed's action was widely perceived as preventive, not a reaction to rising inflation, "If the economy continues to strengthen, this will be the first of many blows to come," said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, in Chicago.
That's why many investment advisers say now is a good time for income investors to review their strategies.
Most advisers recommend that those in short-term bond funds stay put. "We haven't moved clients out of short- or short-intermediate funds, because we're still operating under the premise that rates won't be rising that quickly," said Steven B. Enright, an investment adviser in Rivervale, N.J.
That doesn't mean investors in short-term bond funds will escape unscathed should rates rise more. "You'll have some price pressure on net asset value, but total return should be positive because there's only so much that you can lose in short-term funds," Mr. Rekenthaler said.
As for long-term bonds, the case is less clear. Some economists say inflation is licked; others say inflation will pick up as the economy recovers. That leaves one thing sure: The uncertainty will produce volatility in the long-term bond markets.
Investors who plan to hold shares 10 years or more and can handle the risk can reap higher yields, Mr. Rekenthaler said. He likes the Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond Fund, which yielded an annualized 6.4 percent in January. But most investors would be better off in funds that have shorter maturities and would not be hit as hard by rising rates. Mr. Enright likes the Stein Roe Income Fund and Pimco Total Return.
Many advisers are turning away from United States bonds and looking for income elsewhere. "We don't see domestic investment-grade bonds as a good place to be in 1994," given their extraordinary returns over the last five years, said Craig Litman, an investment adviser in San Francisco.
Instead, he recommends junk bond funds. "We believe the economy will be stable and slow-growing, and inflation won't be a threat over the next year," he said. Even so, "a blip up in rates will have a greater impact on domestic investment-grade bonds." Mr. Litman expects junk bond funds to yield at least 8 percent. His two favorites: Pimco High-Yield Fund and Financial Bond Shares.
Because of their relative insensitivity to interest rates, junk bonds are also the choice of Eric M. Kobren, who edits Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter for Fidelity funds. He recommends Fidelity Spartan High-Income for investors who can meet the $10,000 minimum investment.
Bob Markham, an Edina, Minn., investment adviser, calls junk bonds "the best bet for income investors." When the Fed announced its rate increase, "stocks, bonds and utilities got trashed, but junk bonds stayed steady," he said. "It's the same scenario I expect to be repeated throughout 1994." Mr. Markham likes Northeast Investors Trust and Federated High-Yield.
The year is also shaping up as a good one for Ginnie Mae funds, Mr. Rekenthaler said, if rates keep rising moderately. He likes the Benham GNMA Income Fund, which yielded an annualized 6 percent in January.
Real estate investment trust funds are another good source of income, Mr. Litman said, with yields of 6 to 8 percent and capital gains potential. "Even assuming no appreciation in the underlying properties," he said, "higher cash flow from rising rents will help earnings and prices." His favorites are the Cohen and Steers REIT Fund and the Fidelity REIT Fund.
On one point the advisers are nearly unanimous: Income investors should diversify their portfolios overseas, where rates have fallen, but remain above domestic rates. But it is important to find funds that can hedge currency risk, and managers who can do so effectively, Mr. Enright said. He recommends Scudder International Bond and T. Rowe Price International Bond.
Because international bonds behave differently from domestic bonds, they lower overall portfolio risk. Nonetheless, he advises capping the foreign fixed-income portion at 10 to 15 percent of the total portfolio.
Mr. Markham would go as high as 20 percent, because "We don't want the entire portfolio subject to what Mr. Greenspan says," he said, referring to Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman. Because of the risks of overseas investing, he likes SoGen Overseas, an equity fund with large cash holdings and very cautious management.
Even income investors should own equities as a hedge against inflation. Utility funds may not be a good idea anymore, the advisers say, but try conservative, high-dividend stock funds. Mr. Markham recommends Lindner Dividend and Wellesley Income.

The West Moves to Silence the Guns And Change a State of Mind

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TO hear the Pentagon tell it, the threat of NATO air strikes in Bosnia, voiced last week after so much diplomatic huffing and puffing, is neither a carrot nor a stick but an aspirin. It is designed neither "to affect the military outcome nor to propel the parties to settle," said Walter Slocombe, a top official at the Defense Department, but to "reduce the level of violence while the peace process continues." And reduce the level of violence, other senior officers noted, only in a limited area around the besieged city of Sarajevo.
Well, not exactly. The saber-rattling was also designed to break the psychological stalemate that has settled over what used to be Yugoslavia. It was meant to achieve a limited military end with limited military means, yes, but if that is all it does, it will have to be counted a failure. The real goal lies not on the scarred, wooded hillsides above Sarajevo but in the minds of the men and women whose passions keep this conflict alive. 
 NATO's new step is bold only by comparison with the timorousness of past reactions. So then is the decision really a historic departure, as Secretary General Manfred Worner asserted, or is it only an opportunity for President Clinton and the others to be seen, finally, to be taking a tough stance?
Without doubt, the allied warplanes and their pilots have the capacity to knock out some of the artillery pieces that ring Sarajevo; NATO planes enforcing the air-exclusion zone have had ample opportunity to plot targets. There are perils, of course. Allied pilots might be shot down and captured, even tortured, with all the domestic political turmoil that can cause. The Serbs could move some of the guns close to schools or hospitals or other civil installations, to make them harder to hit or to insure civilian casualties if they are hit. There might be retaliation against the United Nations forces stationed in Bosnia; the fear of that is one reason the bombing threat was so hotly debated and long delayed.
But the greatest danger perhaps is more mundane than any of those. Nothing in the decisions made by NATO in Brussels prevents Serbian offensives against other Bosnian towns like Tuzla and Srebrenica; in fact, NATO does not really propose to lift the siege of Sarajevo, just to take the big guns out of the military equation. The Serbs will still control the roads into the city, to say nothing of the power lines and the water mains.
Often in months past, the Serbs have shown that they know how to play the game. Challenged by outsiders, they play possum for a time, and when the attention of the West turns somewhere else, they take the offensive.
Whether the NATO initiative accomplishes anything will depend largely on the much less well-defined diplomatic track upon which the allies have also embarked. The United States has agreed to take a leading role in the efforts to negotiate a settlement, which inevitably means, if Mr. Clinton is serious about it, an effort to nudge, cajole, persuade and ultimately pressure both the Bosnian Government and its Serbian and Croatian rivals to agree on the terms of a partition of Bosnia.
Until now, the Administration has been reluctant to bring any pressure to bear on the Muslims, viewing them as the aggrieved party, entitled to regain lost territory. Even now, State Department officials piously deny any intent to do so; they proclaim their readiness to "work with the Muslims" toward a workable solution.
No one should take that seriously. The Serbs and the Croats will have to be pressured to give more -- not necessarily the 3 or 4 percent more of Bosnia and Herzegovina than the 20 percent originally set aside for the Muslims, although some net addition will surely be required. More important is the location of the territory allotted to the Muslims. It will have to be more compact, more militarily defensible, and it will surely have to include secure access to the sea.
 
Leaning on the Muslims
 Having offered the Serbs, in the initiative that it put on display in European capitals last week, the prospect of a step-by-step easing of economic sanctions in return for good behavior on the battlefield, the United States may have to contemplate the threat of even tougher sanctions to punish bad behavior.
But the Muslims will have to be leaned on as well, especially by the United States. At the moment, they have rejected partition outright, and they are fighting to regain all the lands where Muslims constituted a majority before the war. That represents a formula for continued strife and probably for eventual Muslim defeat, and if there is a peace settlement, they will have to be talked out of that goal, however righteous it may seem to be.
The Muslims have held out when they were alone and almost defenseless. They have little obvious reason to yield now, when they have gained a bit of breathing room, either through a Serbian artillery withdrawal or NATO air strikes that will at least keep the gunners' heads down. Unless the United States talks tough, very little will be achieved. Given the slightest ray of hope, says Sir Fitzroy Maclean, the old Scottish soldier who fought with the Yugoslav partisans during World War II, "these people will fight on forever." Certainly, a few localized air strikes will not deter them; even the Nazi legions never fully brought the Balkans to heel, and the resources they deployed in these parts were indescribably greater.
If the diplomacy fails, as it has before, the United States and its European friends may be drawn in more deeply than they would like. Already, from Lady Thatcher and hard-shell conservatives here, but also from the likes of Senator Richard Lugar, there are appeals for a wider air campaign. Attack bridges behind the battle zone, they say, as well as ammunition dumps and headquarters. Rearm the Bosnians by lifting the United Nations embargo. All that could have dire consequences -- extending the war to Croatia or Kosovo, or driving a wedge between the United States and Russia, whose Slavic soul is already stirring with resentment over the Western alignment against the Slavic Serbs.
If the Administration has planned its next steps, it has kept its plans quiet. But it has surely learned one lesson in the last eight days: inaction is not always the safest or even the wisest course, and the whole political context can be changed by something as unpredictable as a single shell falling in a crowded marketplace in Sarajevo. It happened once. It will likely happen again.

Behind a Dark Mirror: Traditional Victims Give Vent to Racism

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BLACK racism. For some blacks it is a laughable oxymoron. ("How can the victims of racism be racist?") For some whites it is an excuse for doing little to reduce the inequalities that still plague the country. ("See, blacks are just as bad as they say we are.")
The recent diatribe against Catholics, Jews and homosexuals (among others) by Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a member of the hierarchy of the Nation of Islam, has focused attention on the disturbing question of how much racism permeates black America. Indeed, the public fascination with the Nation of Islam -- a fringe group with negligible political and economic power -- is partly explained by white fear that its views are shared by other blacks. Looking at the cleaning women, the bank tellers, partners in their law firm, some whites silently ask, "Do you agree with Louis Farrakhan?" 
 Until recently, the question of how blacks view whites has been largely unexplored territory for scholars and sociologists. Why have sociologists not probed the black psyche to see how much racial animus resides there? Perhaps because they are afraid of what they might find; perhaps because they feel that since whites are the dominant group, their views are more important; perhaps because they feel that blacks have no opinions that whites are bound to respect.
But recent work by pollsters, sociologists and political scientists has uncovered evidence of specific negative attitudes that blacks may harbor toward whites in general and Jews in particular. Seeking responses to a series of assertions (Jews tend to stick together more than other Americans; Jews wield too much power on Wall Street; Jews are more willing than others to use shady practices to get what they want), a 1992 survey by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith found that blacks are more than twice as likely as non-Jewish whites to hold stereotypical views of Jews.
Preliminary findings in a study to be published soon by the National Conference of Christians and Jews found that blacks feel that whites think themselves superior, and that they do not want to share power and wealth with nonwhites. The poll found that black antipathy toward whites is far greater than that of other minorities, such as Latinos and Asian-Americans.
 
'Fill in the Blanks'
 "Of course, there's black racism," said Roger Wilkins, a professor of history at George Mason University, who is black. "I think that any time that you say that a whole group of people is this or that, fill in the blanks, and the blanks are all negative adjectives, and then you go on to prove your conclusions by telling stories that support your use of those adjectives, that's racism."
But, as another black writer, Ellis Cose, points out in his 1993 book, "The Rage of a Privileged Class" (HarperCollins), the harboring of negative views by blacks does not tell the whole story. Surveys of blacks also find that many give American whites, both Jew and gentile, high marks for intelligence and for creating a democratic society. Viewed in this light, the results of the surveys may be less an affirmation of racism than an expression of envy and a plea to share power.
Racism among blacks, whatever its extent, has been like magma bubbling under black nationalism. Like other nationalist movements -- Zionists, the Quebecois in Canada, Serbs seeking a "Greater Serbia" -- those embraced by some blacks have used ethnic solidarity as a political organizing tool.
For some mainstream black politicians, black anger toward whites presents both opportunity and temptation. Just as white politicians often take advantage, some discreetly and others more cynically, of racist attitudes among whites, so black politicians are aware of hostility among their constituents. And when they tap into it, they confront a question of conscience: When do they cross the line into demagoguery?
A call for unity is by implication a call for exclusivity. The desire to maintain that solidarity makes it difficult for many blacks to denounce black racism. But the censure of Mr. Muhammad by people like the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Benjamin Chavis, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and Representative Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, shows that difficult does not mean impossible. Indeed, black officials have shown more willingness to move beyond solidarity than have members of the United States Senate who met with silence the remarks of Senator Ernest F. Hollings when he jokingly implied in December, while commenting on trade talks in Switzerland, that African heads of state are cannibals. A Hollings aide later said the Senator meant no offense.
There are those who argue that even if blacks espouse racist views, it makes little difference since they lack the power to turn those views into action. Such a rationale was articulated by Mr. Farrakhan at his recent press conference: "Really, racism has to be coupled with a sense of real power."
Mr. Farrakhan may have a point. For all the racial bombast by the Nation of Islam and other strident black nationalists, America has had no episodes of large-scale co-ordinated attacks by blacks against whites. But individual acts like the beating of the trucker Reginald O. Denny during the Los Angeles riots demonstrate that black bigotry can maim people and poison the atmosphere.
There is no denying that black bigotry is fed by social and economic conditions. Even discounting, as some whites do, the country's history of slavery, segregation and discrimination, there are trends that insure black resentment of whites will not diminish soon, and that black demagogues will find allies among the disaffected.
Black poverty rates remain stubbornly high. Progress toward closing the income gap between the races stalled in 1975, according to census data, and since then the gap has widened. (For instance, male black college graduates who entered the job market in 1971 earned on average 2 percent more than their white counterparts, but by 1989 the same blacks were earning 25 percent less on average than white men who graduated in 1971.)
Blacks remain the most segregated group, according to the census. Whether it is the result of whites making blacks feel unwelcome, or of declining faith in integration among some blacks, black Americans and white Americans remain huddled in their corners, afraid that any attempt to reach out will tar them with labels: bleeding heart, Uncle Tom. "We don't live next door to each other," said Lani Guinier, the law school professor whose nomination as Assistant Attorney General for civil rights was withdrawn in a controversy over her voting-rights theories. "No one talks to each other. Racial sterotypes fester in isolation."

Change is In the Air in Cuba, but the Paint is Still Peeling

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
THE air of expectation is still heavy wherever one goes in Cuba these days, but it no longer seems to be for the quick, catastrophic fall of the Government following the Soviet Union's collapse.
Rather, one senses a pungent mixture of depression and hope that attends a more gradual passage. As the photos on this page suggest, one world is withering in Cuba. Another of still uncertain shape is being born. The process continues even as the United States, for domestic political reasons, continues to shy from a relaxation of the decades-old trade embargo on Cuba, though it recently lifted the one on Vietnam. 
 The old Cuba still remains everywhere on display, barely creaking by -- in tattered, majestic Havana, in the high-rises without working elevators, in the ration lines snaking around whole city blocks. But more and more, the new Cuba is revealing itself as citizens pursue a quest for betterment made possible by American dollars, whose possession was legalized last year. This is the Cuba of tourist development, of sleek-suited Cuban and foreign businessmen who huddle in well-appointed hotels, and of city skies crowded by satellite dishes. The free-market stirrings coincide with a religious resurgence ushered in by Government liberalizations.
The old and new collide regularly. In the neighborhoods of central Havana, a mother showing her sparsely furnished walk-up is asked why her stove burners were left running with no food cooking. She explains with a smirk: "There's never any gas when I need it. I may as well burn it off when they turn it on." In the same streets on another day, a stranger is greeted by calls of "McDonald's, McDonald's" in a Cuban accent -- a hawker selling hamburgers to all comers with dollars.
If the Government has not yet admitted that the country is heading toward some form of capitalism, the people seem little inclined to await an announcement. State jobs that pay in non-convertible pesos are going unfilled as thousands flock to the informal activities that enable them to earn dollars. Suddenly, because of their access to foreign exchange, hotel waiters and taxi drivers earn more than bureaucrats. Others left to fend for themselves find that they can't, and go wanting.
With Cubans' rush to fit into an expanding private economy, there has come a new candor. "They still say 'Socialism or death' in all their speeches," a sugar-mill worker said of the Communist Party's cadres. "I suppose someone will always have to work for the Government, but if I can help it, it won't be my children."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Workers of the World Reflect -- Two sugar-refinery workers take a cigar break. Many Cubans are forsaking peso-paying Government jobs like theirs to earn dollars in the newly liberalized economy. Still Exercising Socialism -- A group of elderly women limber up in central Havana before medical checkups. Later, they serve food at a nearby hospital -- a reflection of the Government's longstanding exhortation for all to contribute to the common social good. Field of Dreams -- A youth catches a baseball in the ruins of a lot recently cleared to make way for a new tourist complex -- hotels, restaurants, etc. -- that is planned for the center of Havana. In the Shadows -- A homeless man sleeps on the steps of a Havana bank in the early-morning hours. With more Cubans fending for themselves and the social safety net fraying, some go without. Heading for the Light -- Worshipers in Rincon observe the Festival of St. Lazarus. As the Government has become more tolerant in recent years, religious worship has enjoyed a resurgence.

HEADLINE: Economic Recovery: Manhandle With Care

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
THE good thing about economic recoveries is that they help people. There are more jobs. They pay better. There's more money around. Right?
Curious, then, that the popular economic wisdom holds that the best way to nurture the present recovery is to administer pain. 
 Recovery fans nodded sagely nine days ago when Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, announced that the Fed was pushing short-term interest rates higher. Enthusiasts hailed the move as a "pre-emptive strike" against inflation. Not that there are any signs of inflation.
Higher rates, however, will mean households and companies pay more interest on their loans, in the interest, of course, of prolonging the recovery that they are supposed to be energizing.
To insure discipline, some banks are already starting to raise the rates they charge consumer and corporate borrowers. They tend to do this very quickly, at the slightest hint that rates are inching upward, yet move more slowly when rates head the other way, pocketing the widening difference between what they pay on deposits and what they charge for loans.
Probably a good thing too: The Fed and the commercial banking system are supposed to be guardians of a nation's financial fitness. Start coddling the public and customers and before long you have a $6 trillion economy that resembles a spoiled child -- chubby and out of control.
 
Cruel to Be Kind
 Corporate America has embraced today's eat-your-peas ethos with a vengeance. As any beginning student of economics knows, productivity -- an efficient labor force churning out more and more goods and services -- fuels growth.
With that in mind, American management has taken this approach: fire workers by the thousands and then apply the lash even more firmly to the fortunate few who remain.
In top management circles, the practice is known by the term "re-engineering" -- one of several euphemisms peculiar to this paradoxical, gain-despite-pain recovery.
A Chicago-based employment consulting firm, Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., reported last week that major corporations announced 108,000 layoffs in January, the highest monthly level since it began tracking the figures in 1989.
GTE, Nynex, Scott Paper and Boeing were among the biggest job-cutters, and there is little sign that the pace is easing. Last Thursday, A.T.& T. said it plans to eliminate as many as 15,000 jobs, or 15 percent of the work force in its long-distance business, over the next two years.
"It's such a trend that it's become easier for companies to lay off workers now," says Rick Cobb, a vice president of Challenger, Gray. "There are so many companies doing this, you get lost in the crowd."
The workers who survive these cutbacks are not getting paid more, and fear has undoubtedly played its role in restraining wages. March into the boss's office to demand a raise these days and he may well decide to offer up your job as yet another sacrifice to American economic health.
Meantime, labor costs in the executive suite have not been held in check nearly as well as they have been on the factory floor. Executive salaries have outstripped the inflation rate for years. Every recovery has its anomalies.
The Clinton Administration, in tune with the Zeitgeist, is doing its part.
Its health plan, an ambitious effort to throttle rising medical costs, would add $74 billion to the Federal budget deficit between 1995 and 2000, the Congressional Budget Office estimated last week, taking issue with the Administration's projection of a deficit reduction in that period. Of course, the shortfalls foreseen by the budget office could be offset by "revenue enhancements," or taxes, as they were referred to in less enlightened times.
At worst, we're assured, the high initial cost of the Clinton health plan is just another near-term sacrifice well worth making in the interests of a stronger economy in the long run, as overall health-care spending eventually declines.
John Maynard Keynes, the British economist, had a pithy observation about where we'd all be in the long run: dead. But that's just quibbling, isn't it?

HEADLINE: U.S.O.C. to Let Harding Skate In the Olympics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Feb. 12

 BODY:
After a week of legal maneuvering and hours of intensive negotiations today, the United States Olympic Committee cleared Tonya Harding to skate in the Winter Olympics, which opened today in Lillehammer, Norway.
A settlement was reached in a state circuit court in Oregon City, about 20 miles south of here, when the Olympic committee agreed to cancel a hearing next week in which Miss Harding faced administrative charges for her conduct relating to last month's assault on her rival, Nancy Kerrigan. In exchange, Miss Harding agreed to drop a lawsuit filed earlier this week in which she charged the Olympic committee with interfering with her right to compete in the Olympics. She asked for more than $20 million in damages. 
 The settlement brought to an end a sometimes chaotic six-week period in which two overriding questions lingered: Did Miss Harding have anything to do with the assault and would she skate in the Olympics?
One question was answered, although the settlement did not address the possibility of further action against Miss Harding by the Olympic committee at some point. Under its bylaws, the committee could still inititate a disciplinary procedure against the skater if she were found guilty of, or plead guilty to, a crime. That could result in the loss of any medal she might win in Norway.
Nearly all the lawyers left the courthouse without comment today. But one of Miss Harding's lawyers, Dennis Rawlinson, who had notified her of the final details of the agreement, described her as "very, very pleased."
Later, as she climbed into her truck to drive away from her apartment in suburban Portland, Miss Harding said, "I finally get to prove to the world I can win a gold medal."
In Lillehammer, Olympic committee officials said they pursued the agreement with Miss Harding's lawyers to eliminate the distraction the case had become to officials and athletes at the Games. "For the moment the matter is stilled, and we turn all of our energies and resources to our Olympic team," the committee said in a statement.
Miss Harding is scheduled to leave for the Olympics within several days. At the Games, she is scheduled to join a practice group that includes Miss Kerrigan, under an International Skating Union ruling that requires all members of the same country to train together.
 
Skating Is Now the Main Event
 The settlement assures that the women's figure skating competition, which begins Feb. 23, has gained instant spectacle, with the promise of a showdown between two Americans whose lives have intrinsically been linked by an act of violence. Not long after the Jan. 6 attack at the national championships in Detroit, Miss Harding's former husband and three of his associates were charged in the crime.
For her proximity to those four men and her acknowledgement that she delayed telling authorities what she knew about the attack and when she knew it, Miss Harding was thrust into an uncompromising worldwide spotlight, not to mention a local criminal investigation in which any indictments would not have to be made until March 21, well after the Olympics.
But more critically for her Olympic aspirations, she had been summoned by the Olympic committee to explain her behavior in the case even though she has not been charged with any crime. The Olympic committee still felt it had the right to question her sportsmanship and adherence to the sport's code of ethics.

 
 
Discipline Still Possible
 By terms of the settlement, the committee has left any discipline against the 23-year-old skater to the United States Figure Skating Federation, which conducted its own investigation and found last week that grounds existed to call her conduct into question. The federation gave Miss Harding 30 days to prepare a defense and gave the Olympic committee the information it had gathered. The committee claimed jurisdictional rights because of Miss Harding's acknowledgement that she had learned about the involvement of her former husband and the others after she had qualified for the team.
As a result, the Olympic committee scheduled its own procedural review, which was to culminate with a hearing Tuesday in Oslo. At that point, Miss Harding objected, claiming that notice of eight days did not give her enough time to prepare an adequate defense and disrupted her training. To delay the hearing, her lawyers went to court, seeking a restraining order.
On Friday, the Olympic committee agreed to delay the hearing for three days, and Judge Patrick D. Gilroy urged both sides to work through the weekend to resolve their differences.
By early this morning, the lawyers had reconvened in the judge's chambers, where the details of the agreement were eventually set forth.
 
Unrelenting Attention
 The settlement brings to an end one phase of a remarkable saga, reflecting not only a crime against one skater but the hardships of another.
Throughout her ordeal, Miss Harding has made no secret of the stormy relationship she has had with her mother, LaVona Golden, and her former husband, Jeff Gillooly. Mr. Gillooly, a 26-year-old unemployed former warehouse worker, has pleaded guilty to a charge of racketeering for his involvement in the case. In a plea agreement, he received up to two years in jail.
Miss Harding's travails have also been noteworthy for the constancy and intensity of news media attention, with television crews and reporters ever present and living virtually next door to her. ABC News rented the vacant apartment in Clackamas County beside the apartment in which Miss Harding has been living with friends.
That kind of attention played at least an indirect role in the settlement. Miss Harding's fight took on uncommon celebrity, to the exclusion of most other Olympic athletes and developments. That rankled many senior Olympic committee officials, a growing number of whom were said to be willing to forego the hearing as a way of restoring some order to the Olympic routine.
 
Jurisdictional Conflict
 From his remarks during the arguments for the restraining order, Judge Gilroy sounded conflicted by issues in the case, leaving the impression that he would much prefer a settlement rather than having to rule in the case.
Among the major issue that led to his "deep concern" was that of jurisdiction. His questions of both sides during their presentations revealed the sometimes ambiguous relationship between the Olympic committee and individual sports federations -- particularly since the assault occurred before Miss Harding was on the Olympic team, and the conduct for which she could be disciplined -- not telling the authorities right away what she learned about it -- occurred after she made the team.

HEADLINE: JAPAN WARNS U.S. AGAINST IMPOSING TRADE SANCTIONS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa warned the United States today against imposing trade sanctions on Japan after their failed negotiations. His top aides said such action would cause Tokyo to retaliate with sanctions on American products.
"I very much hope the U.S. will refrain from such action," Mr. Hosokawa told reporters before leaving Washington, a day after the eight-month-long trade negotiations between the United States and Japan collapsed. 
 With American officials already vowing to impose some sort of punitive measure on Japan, now that Japan has refused to accept American demands for more open markets, the world's two biggest economies appeared to be poised on the edge of a trade war.
 
Posturing Is Seen
 Then too, there is undoubtedly a lot of posturing going on with the respective warnings, as both sides try to look tough for their domestic audiences, and it is possible that cooler heads will prevail as they approach the brink.
Mr. Hosokawa sounded a polite but firm warning at his morning news conference, which followed a breakfast at the White House with President Clinton. He said that under no conditions would his Government drop its resistance to "numerical targets" for opening Japanese markets, the issue that has been the main stumbling block in the negotiations.
The Americans insist that Japan agree to certain numerical indicators that will prove whether it is opening its markets in autos, telecommunications, insurance and medical equipment. The Japanese refuse to accept such indicators, saying that would constitute "managed trade," and that is why the talks collapsed.
 
'Will Not Modify Position'
 "We will not modify our position in that regard," Mr. Hosokawa bluntly told reporters.
Asked about reports that the United States was considering unilateral trade sanctions on Japan to pry open closed markets, Mr. Hosokawa not only said he hoped that the United States would refrain from such a move, but also pointed out that "that would be a contravention of GATT," the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
He left the clear indication, amplified by some of his aides, that Japan would respond to any attempt by the United States to slap tariffs on Japanese imports by taking the United States to a GATT tribunal, or by imposing its own unilateral sanctions.
Japan has threatened to take the United States to a GATT tribunal for some 20 years each time the United States threatened or took unilateral trade action. But Japan has never followed through out of fear of triggering a broader trade confrontation.
Under GATT rules, a country that believes its exports are being restricted in violation of the agreement's free-trade rules may request that a panel of three experts from countries not involved in the dispute be convened in Geneva. The panel reviews legal arguments by both sides, a process that may take many months, before issuing a ruling. The ruling in favor of the complaining country gives it moral authority to impose trade sanctions.
The United States, however, has not always complied with GATT panel rulings against it, and the Japanese threat does not instill real fear in American negotiators.
Mr. Hosokawa, who presented his visit to Washington as a success from the Japanese point of view, expressed his willingness to return to the bargaining table after "a cooling-off period," but made clear that any concessions on numerical indicators had to come from the American side.
 
Hosokawa Seems Confident
 The Prime Minister seemed quite relaxed and confident. Although American officials described him and his aides as "shocked" by Mr. Clinton's decision to put trade talks on indefinite hold, he and his team evinced the confidence of a younger brother who had finally stood up to an older brother and was now discovering that it really was not that hard after all.
American officials say there is no chance that they will compromise on the issue of numerical indicators. They contend that because the 31 previous trade agreements relied upon Japanese promises instead of quantitative and qualitative measures, the agreements have not made a dent in the Japanese trade surplus with the United States, which now stands at $60 billion.
"We just have to examine what our next step should be," Mr. Clinton said.
One step he is almost certain to take is to issue an executive order reinstating his authority to use the Super 301 trade law, which authorizes the President to identify countries, like Japan, that systematically discriminate against American goods. This designation then starts a clock for imposing sanctions if Japan does not respond by lowering trade barriers.
Another possibility is for the United States to drive up the value of the Japanese yen and therefore make Japanese exports more expensive and American imports to Japan cheaper. After failed summit meeting Friday, the yen closed in New York at 107.13 to the dollar, sharply stronger than the 108.25 yen late Thursday.
Driving up the yen is the preferred weapon of American auto manufacturers. Some 60 percent of Japan's $60 billion trade surplus with the United States is in Japanese auto sales in the United States, and there is a direct correlation between the rise in the yen and the drop in Japanese auto sales in the United States. But pushing the dollar down against the yen raises the cost of living in the United States by making a range of imports more expensive. It also encourages the Japanese to withdraw their funds from the American stock market and Treasury markets.

HEADLINE: CLINTON CONSIDERS TAXING AID TO POOR TO PAY FOR REFORM

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The Administration is considering a plan to finance President Clinton's proposal to revamp the welfare system by taxing food stamps, welfare benefits and housing assistance and by cutting aid to legal immigrants who are elderly and indigent.
While no decisions have been made, those are among the options being considered by senior officials at the White House, Treasury Department and Department of Health and Human Services, confidential documents and interviews with officials show. The money from the cuts would be used to expand work and job training programs. 
 Critics liken the size of the cuts being considered to those pushed through by President Ronald Reagan. The options illustrate the Administration's difficulty as it simultaneously pursues ambitious welfare and health care proposals while seeking to reduce the deficit.
 
Double-Edged Risks
 One risk is that cuts will hurt the very people the welfare plan seeks to help, the poor and near-poor. That was the fear of the Administration official who disclosed the options, calling them "unconscionable."
A second risk is that the potential reductions, which are already being denounced on Capitol Hill, could alienate some Democrats whose help Mr. Clinton needs to pass his health bill.
Melissa Skolfield, an Administration spokeswoman, declined to discuss any specific options, calling the discussions "very preliminary." But she argued that the pain of any cuts would be more than offset by the benefits to the welfare program, which is intended to help poor women, who are its main recipients, find jobs.
"The plan is going to provide new investments in child care, education and training for poor women, who were simply written off by previous Administrations," she said.
 
Few Options Open
 The cuts being considered are in addition to the $30 billion in proposed reductions in the 1995 budget, which was released this week. One Administration official said the search for money had become "brutally hard" since "painful cuts have already been made."
The choices are being shaped both by law and politics. The 1990 budget law requires the Government to pay for any new spending increases with offsetting taxes or program reductions. And since welfare, mainly the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, is considered an "entitlement program," the cuts have to come from similar programs whose benefits go automatically to everyone meeting the criteria.
The largest entitlement program is Social Security, but officials consider it too politically risky to try to make cuts there. The growth of the next two largest such programs, Medicare and Medicaid, is being restrained to finance changes in the health care system. That means that most remaining targets are entitlement programs for the poor, mainly welfare, food stamps and disability programs.
"Everything that's left is virtually a mortal wound," the official said.
 
Campaign Promise
 One of Bill Clinton's main promises in the 1992 Presidential campaign was to "end welfare as we know it," and he has vowed to send Congress a bill this spring. He has pledged to expand training programs for people on welfare but then require those still unemployed after two years to join a work program.
A record five million families are receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare program. The number of people who would hit the two-year limit is a matter of sharp dispute, with the Administration's estimates ranging from 500,000 to more than 2.3 million.
The hunt for money is crucial. If the Administration fails to find enough revenue, it could be forced to scale back its plan. Administration officials have said that the welfare plan would cost about $7 billion a year when fully implemented.
The options under consideration have multiplied in recent weeks, as officials prepare to send Mr. Clinton a list by March. Officials are considering cuts in an emergency cash aid program used to prevent evictions and utility cutoffs and to provide shelter for the homeless.
The $300 million program is growing rapidly, and Federal officials suspect that states are using it to finance services they once provided themselves.
Administration officials are also considering a plan that would make it harder for drug addicts and alcoholics to receive disability payments through the Supplemental Security Income program by claiming their addiction as a disability.
 
Aiming at Obscure Program
 As another way of raising money, the Treasury Department is scouring a $16 billion annual tax credit program for low-income families, looking for signs of fraud or abuse. The issue is considered politically sensitive since the program is one of Mr. Clinton's favorites and the Administration gave it a large increase last year.
The search for viable options is difficult enough that officials at the Department of Health and Human Services proposed cutting $1.2 billion a year from an obscure provision of Social Security, which provides increased payments to retired fathers who have young children.
They were overruled by senior officials, including Donna E. Shalala, the department's Secretary, who feared that the move would antagonize the powerful lobby for retired people.
Ms. Skolfield, the Administration spokeswoman, emphasized that "no decisions have been made." But reports of the financing options are already drawing fire from Administration allies on Capitol Hill.
They argue that the cuts could increase the number of poor Americans, since the money gained would be used largely to pay for the administrative costs of the welfare plan, like the overhead in the work and training programs.
"You're taking money away from poor people to hire social workers," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who is a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee. "It's foolish for them to even consider these alternatives. It's just damn stupid."
"I've already heard some liberal members say they will not support health care reform," if the financing plan for welfare change is considered too severe, he said.
But the potential cuts got a warmer reception from Senator Hank Brown of Colorado, a co-sponsor of a Republican welfare plan. "I'm encouraged that they're looking for ways to pay for it," he said.
 
A Crucial Meeting
 The financing debate began in earnest at a late January meeting in the White House that included Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff; Leon E. Panetta, the budget director; Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary; Robert E. Rubin, the President's economic policy adviser, and Carol H. Rasco, the White House domestic policy adviser.
Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services, led by David T. Ellwood, an assistant secretary, presented the meeting with a list of six options, estimated to save $6.5 billion to $9.3 billion a year.
Mr. Panetta and Mr. Bentsen were dissatisfied with some choices, officials familiar with the meeting said, and each has asked his staff to suggest alternatives. Mr. Panetta, who displays an award in his office for promoting nutrition, was particularly skeptical of the plan to tax welfare and food stamp benefits.
Among the proposals presented by Mr. Ellwood that seem likely to remain on the final Administration list are the cuts in benefits to immigrants. But the proposal is likely to arouse bitter opposition from the House Hispanic caucus, which unsuccessfully fought an earlier round of reductions last year.
The debate focuses on the Supplemental Security Income program, which provides cash payments of $434 a month to elderly or disabled people who are indigent. It also provides them with Medicaid. Currently, most immigrants must wait five years before they can apply for the benefits. The Administration proposal would save $1.8 billion a year by barring immigrants from the program until they become citizens.
The issue only involves legal immigrants; illegal immigrants are already barred from applying.
 
Looking at Immigrants
 Some Congressional Republicans are seeking to finance their own welfare reform proposals with even more restrictive rules on payments to immigrants.
Those who favor the reductions argue that some immigrants are cheating the system by inviting their elderly parents to immigrate and then signing them up for aid rather than supporting them. But opponents, including Mr. Matsui, argue that it is unfair to single out immigrants for cuts.
The proposal to tax such payments, as well as welfare, food stamps and housing assistance may face a tougher fight, both inside the Administration and on Capitol Hill. The human services department's paper estimated the taxes, described as "recapture" provisions, could save the Government $1.5 billion to $4 billion a year.
Some officials argue that taxing the benefits would make the system fairer by treating all incomes alike. Consider two families, each making $15,000 a year and one receiving food stamps. The family with the food stamps clearly has more income, but its tax burden is the same.
Arguments against the taxes are also strong. They increase the economic burden of many low-income working families, who are precisely the people Mr. Clinton has tried to help by expanding tax credit programs and vowing "to make work pay."
The suggested cuts have caught some outside analysts by surprise, in part because they were proposed by Mr. Ellwood and Wendell E. Primus, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Both men have reputations as zealous advocates for low-wage workers, and their proposal seems to underscore the severity of the budget constraints.
Mr. Ellwood is a former Harvard professor who coined the phrase "make work pay." Mr. Primus, a former aide on the Ways and Means Committee, spent more than a decade fighting off Republican plans to cut programs for the poor.
Both have said the Clinton plan intends to increase the incomes of the needy, but neither could be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: The Big Train Wreck

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
From the time Japan's first postwar Prime Minister took office, the job has come with a single mandate: whatever you do, keep the Americans happy.
So whenever a trade crisis erupted -- first over textiles, then autos, computer chips, beef and citrus, cellular phones, baseball bats and construction -- there was always a last-minute sucking-in of breath from Tokyo and a deal. Some worked, some failed, some markets opened and many had an odd way of remaining sealed, but open confrontation was avoided. 
 Now, Morihiro Hosokawa, arguably Japan's most innovative and interesting leader in decades, is trying a very different approach. On Friday, he became the first Japanese Prime Minister to say no to the Americans, and he said it at a summit meeting with the American President.
Mr. Hosokawa has once again taken a tremendous political gamble. He is betting that the applause he will receive for standing up to the Americans will drown out whatever condemnation comes his way -- particularly from the powerful Japanese business community and the ousted Liberal Democratic Party -- for putting at risk the one international relationship that keeps Japan afloat.
His defiance will likely appeal to a growing soft nationalism in Japan, a sense that nearly 50 years after the end of World War II the country can stand up and speak out a bit more directly. But if the relationship sours in the coming months, it could contribute to Mr. Hosokawa's political problems at home, and it could be used to speed the end of his coalition Government.
 
Seeking High Moral Ground
 Mr. Hosokawa has been careful to cast his action in moral terms, arguing that what the United States wanted him to do -- set numerical "targets" or "indicators" for the sales of American goods in the Japanese market -- was a gross interference in free markets. It was managed trade, he said, adding more regulation to an economy that he has sworn to deregulate.
Without question, the argument will play back home in Japan, where Mr. Clinton's mounting pressure is being characterized as the latest whining of a country that is making Japan a scapegoat for its competitive failings.
"It's a high-wire act," one of Mr. Hosokawa's aides acknowledged. "But we are convinced that his popularity will go even higher."
Mr. Hosokawa is certainly not acting like a man scared that his broader relations with Washington are imperiled. He seemed relaxed when he met with a small group of reporters traveling with him late Friday. And this morning at a news conference he said again that he did not think the breakdown of talks would "undermine Japan-U.S. bilateral relations as a whole." He talked of a "cooling-off period," and said he fully intended to go ahead with other market openings on his own -- not because they were good for America, but because they were good for Japanese.
 
First Summit Failure
 Behind Mr. Hosokawa's willingness to make this the first Japanese-American summit meeting that ever failed to reach a trade accord lies a generational change in Japanese politics -- a change whose full dimensions the Clinton Administration may not have fully understood when they welcomed Mr. Hosokawa seven months ago as the urbane reformer who would finally remake the country.
Because Mr. Hosokawa is of a new generation -- Mr. Clinton's generation -- White House officials have said for many months that the two men would work together as a team, battling a $50 billion trade surplus that will not let up.
What Japanese officials say the White House was not listening to were Mr. Hosokawa's repeated vows to bring those changes about from within, letting market forces work on their own instead of relying on outside pressure. He acknowledged in a speech at Georgetown University late Friday that such an approach can be enormously frustrating to Japan's trading partners because it happens so slowly.
"The problem is the pace of change in Japan," he said. But he said he told Mr. Clinton that "my administration is promoting deregulation," and that dictating targets "runs right in the face of our basic tenet."
 
A Long Way From MacArthur
 Even the Japanese were a bit surprised by Mr. Hosokawa's casualness during his news conference with President Clinton on Friday, which he followed -- so that he did not leave town with too many bad feelings -- with a largely social breakfast at the White House this morning.
"We could not have imagined something like this happening even a year ago," one of Japan's top trade negotiators said Friday night. Mr. Hosokawa's predecessor, Kiichi Miyazawa, who was forced from office in July, came of age as a politician in the days of the American occupation of Japan. That was when Gen. Douglas MacArthur ruled the Japanese economy, or what was left of it after the war, by fiat.
Among members of Mr. Miyazawa's generation, that sense of the relationship remains. But Mr. Hosokawa, in one of the striking moments of his exchange with President Clinton at the White House, said that disagreements are to be expected "in a relationship between grown-ups, as we two are." He continued that theme this morning. "In the past we settled for ambiguous agreements that created misunderstandings," he said. The United States, he added, often "took advantage of the process to get more concessions."
Mr. Hosokawa, as one Government official who has known him for some time said, "does not have an inferiority complex toward the U.S. or Europe, or a superiority complex about Asia; this is what makes him different."
 
Haunted by a Family Memory
 Yet Mr. Hosokawa is also haunted by one particular memory when he deals with America: the image of his grandfather, Fumimaro Konoe, one of the last civilian Prime Ministers before World War II.
As Prime Minister, Mr. Konoe temporized while military leaders manipulated him. He was frustrated in his efforts to communicate to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and some believe that only worsened the tensions that led to the war.
Last year, writing in a leading intellectual magazine, Bungei Shunju, Mr. Hosokawa argued that the lesson of his grandfather's premiership was simple. "If you raise your voice," he said, "you must raise it clearly."
Mr. Hosokawa did just that. But one of the mysteries of what one senior Japanese official called "our first big train wreck" is whether Mr. Hosokawa was leading the bureaucrats who stiff-armed the Clinton Administration, or whether, like his grandfather, he was led by them.
 
Alliances With the Enemy
 Few of those around Mr. Hosokawa doubt that he is sincere when he says that his dispute with the Clinton Administration is a matter of principle.
Mr. Hosokawa often seems to agree with those in the Clinton Administration who say Japan will not change until it humbles the powerful bureaucracy that sets policy in Tokyo and commands the economy to a degree that is unmatched in the West.
The Prime Minister has said repeatedly that if the balance of power is to shift back to consumers in Japan, rather than producers, political leaders must regain control.
Weakened by battles within his eight-party coalition Government, it is doubtful that he has the power to do it. Mr. Hosokawa's own staff is considered ineffective and inexperienced. To pass critical legislation at home -- particularly a tax and economic stimulus plan -- he had to create alliances with the same bureaucrats he has vowed to fight.
 
A Secret Emissary
 His uncertainty about how to deal with the bureaucracy was evident even before he left Tokyo. While he was still immersed in political struggles at home, Mr. Hosokawa clearly had a premonition of the conflict awaiting him in Washington. So he reached out to an old friend of the family, Akitane Kiuchi, a former Japanese Ambassador to France and to Thailand. Mr. Kiuchi was sent as a secret emissary to Mr. Clinton to plead for time.
The Japanese trade negotiators, who were already at work in Washington, did not have an inkling of the visit, and they were outraged when they learned what had happened. But Mr. Kiuchi came only with a plea, not a plan. He had no authority, or experience, to negotiate in the Prime Minister's behalf. The mission failed.
Some Japanese saw it as a technique drawn from the feudal lords who populate Mr. Hosokawa's family tree. Messengers were often sent to the shogun, seeking alliances that would maintain the balance of power.
"Perhaps we should have expected it," one Japanese Foreign Ministry official said. "This is how his family survived for 450 years."

HEADLINE: As Nations Trim Costs, Embassies Feel Pinch

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Before the global marketplace, before the recession, before the decline of greed and the rise of austerity, there was the diplomatic party. There were dozens of them. Every night.
Any enterprising youth with a decent suit or little black dress could ditch budget meals at home to graze on hors d'oeuvres at some embassy function here. 
 No longer.
 
From Receptions to Lunches
 As governments around the world tighten their belts, the squeeze has been felt in many of the 164 embassies here. Even those social functions that remain are increasingly an extension of work or a showcase for a country's cultural exports. The result: less lavish parties and tighter, more focused functions, including breakfasts and lunches.
"In the past, we would have big receptions," said Lionel Majeste-Larrouy, press counselor of the French Embassy. "Now we tend to have a working session lunch or a dinner around a good table. We still use the crystal and champagne, but it is more targeted."
Gone is the splendor of social functions like those given by Ardeshir Zahedi, the Iranian Ambassador in pre-Ayatollah days. Mr. Zahedi's parties featured bands, fresh orchids, 24-karat game prizes, caviar and champagne with guests like Henry A. Kissinger, Andy Warhol and Elizabeth Taylor schmoozing in the embassy's blue-tiled Persian Room.
Gone, too, the yearlong series of parties and receptions that built up to the visit of President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines and his wife, Imelda, in 1982. That kind of opulent overkill is frowned on today.
"We can certainly say that things are not as lavish or extravagant as they were during the Marcos days," said Jose Ebro, a press officer at the Philippine Embassy. "Our social entertaining is focused on business and investment initiatives."
Didi Cutler, who worked for the New York City Commission for the United Nations and the United Nations Consular Corps, said, "Today it's a question of what is appropriate."
 
Some Big Events Remain
 Appropriate does not necessarily mean fewer guests. In 1993, the British Ambassador entertained 11,500 people at various functions, from small breakfasts to huge receptions.
Still, ambassadorial functions are much more likely to be about drumming up business for the home countries than about celebrating the arrival of a political figure or an eligible movie star. Few diplomats can complain these days, as did Bernard Vernier-Palliez, the French Ambassador to the United States in early 1980's, that he had to attend "futile parties."
Today, tradesmanship is as much in demand as statesmanship.
"Your country's priorities inform your entertaining, and India's priorities are economic growth and investment," said Nirupama Rao, minister for press and information at the Embassy of India.
Because the United States is India's largest foreign investor, Ms. Rao said it was natural that one of the latest social events given by Ambassador Siddhartha Shankar Ray was a 40-person dinner for officials from a group of American companies like General Electric, International Business Machines, American Telephone and Telegraph, General Motors and others interested in doing business in India.
 
Seeing the Nation
 The expansion of the global market also means that many ambassadors no longer restrict their entertainment to Washington.
Ambassador Jukka Valtasaari of Finland recalled that on his first diplomatic visit here in 1977, only 50 Finnish companies had businesses in the United States, most of them in New York. Today, 350 Finnish companies are doing business in the United States.
"That dictates changes in your operational and entertaining methods," said Mr. Valtasaari, who travels outside Washington 50 days of the year.
But Mr. Valtasaari said the size of the United States and its many centers of influence outside the capital did not diminish the need to entertain here.
"You need to work for your access," he said. "Unlike some other countries where you deal more with institutions, Washington is a person-to-person city."
 
More, but More Focused
 Still, the emphasis is a narrower palate.
"We're doing more but in smaller and more focused groups," said Ruth Yaron, press counselor of the Israeli Embassy. "It's easier to meet people, to talk and have a benefit out of a dinner party."
There has also been a shift from reliance on the dinner as the only meal for diplomatic entertainment.
Ambassador Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima of Brazil, who recently played host to the Princess of Wales during a in low-key visit said that diplomatic entertainment in Washington tended toward "stag functions at luncheons, whereas in London there was more entertaining around dinner."
Certain diplomatic social functions, however, remain de rigueur, like national day or independence day celebrations when the entire diplomatic corps is traditionally invited.
"We are talking about thousands of people," said Ms. Yaron of Israel's independence day celebrations in May, "and building a tent outside in the yard for the overflow."
Nabil Osman, minister and counselor of press information at the Egyptian Embassy, said leaner, more focused entertaining was "a worldwide phenomenon."
 
'Taxpayers Expect Results'
 Terry Colli, director of public affairs at the Canadian Embassy, said: "All over the industrial world, governments have deficits and taxpayers expect to see results for the dollars spent. Doing a diplomatic dinner just to entertain another diplomat, or anyone else for that matter, when there is no immediate issue of business is rare.
"We are out here to achieve an objective," Mr. Colli said. "We have to think: What are we achieving for Canada when we do this function?"
Increasingly, embassies also use social functions to promote their culture and art.
Especially active are the French, Mexican and Japanese Embassies.
The Embassy of Japan, for example, recently offered two evenings devoted to lectures exploring the relations between black Americans and Japanese.
"We think that it is extremely important to contribute to the community in Washington, because mutual understanding between the two countries begins with people-to-people communication, not Washington-to-Tokyo diplomatic negotiations," said Kenji Nakano, a press officer at the embassy. Last year, the embassy gave 24 such events.
 
The Top Entertainers
 Japan and Britain, perhaps because of their imperial and monarchial backgrounds, still maintain some of the most elegant social functions. They also entertain in big numbers.
"Such entertaining still continues because it's an important aspect of doing the job," said Peter Bean, press secretary at the British Embassy. One of the embassy's largest functions, Mr. Bean said, was a reception last fall for 300 people, followed by a dinner for 100 for Nelson Mandela, the South African leader of the African National Congress.
"In some instances, entertainment will be small," Mr. Bean said, "for example, the breakfast meeting with Prime Minister John Major, there were only six guests."
When those limousine- and long-dress occasions do occur, they are most likely to be because an embassy has made its building available for a charitable event.
Mr. Colli of the Canadian Embassy said, "We receive well over 300 requests a year to use the embassy for charitable events and that is over and above Canadian requests."
Sometimes, especially among the new embassies created in the wake of the demise of the Soviet Union, there is truncated entertainment -- even on national days.
"We simply cannot afford the big bash," said Jonas Paslauskas, an official at the Lithuania Embassy. "Usually we have one big reception on our national day, Feb. 16, and we try to invite mainly European countries and countries with which we have diplomatic relations instead of the entire diplomatic corps."
And for some embassies, there is no entertainment at all.
"We consider it important," said Lublin Dilja, Ambassador of Albania. "But because Albania is in a period of transition and there are economic problems, we haven't had any parties."

HEADLINE: Japan Sees Hosokawa Leveling Ties With U.S.

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's refusal to accede to American trade demands on Friday is being seen here as the beginning of a new relationship with the United States, one in which Japan has an equal voice and cannot be bullied into making concessions just for the sake of preserving peace with its main ally.
"The United States must learn that it can't simply make very unreasonable demands by using external pressure," said Kuniko Inoguchi, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo. "Such a traditional style of negotiating won't work anymore. This reflects a change in political culture." 
 But if Mr. Hosokawa's stand is being greeted favorably and even with a little self-satisfaction here, there is also a sense of dread about the chill in trade relations that may lie ahead and a sense of uncertainty about what Japan should do now.
 
'We Couldn't Do Otherwise'
 "We are not too happy about the result, but we couldn't do otherwise," said Kazuo Nukazawa, a managing director of Keidanren, the most powerful business lobbying group in Japan.
Trade negotiations under the framework signed by the two nations in July broke down on Friday without reaching agreements to open Japan's markets for automobiles and auto parts, insurance, and telecommunications and medical equipment.
The stumbling block was Washington's demand for "objective criteria" to measure progress, which Japan insisted were numerical targets that would contravene free trade.
It is always unclear how much any single agreement can do to reduce the trade gap. While some of the imbalance is the result of informal barriers in the Japanese market, much of it also has to do with getting Japanese consumers to spend instead of save and getting American companies to invest more heavily in everything from distributorships to factories in Japan.
American negotiators seemed convinced that Japan would concede at the last minute, as it has in past negotiations. This time, it did not happen.
"We maintained our principle," said one mid-level official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, who stayed in his office Friday night and watched the live broadcast of the news conference by President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa at 4:30 A.M. But he became more sober when he thought of the consequences of standing on principle. "Another storm will come, and it will be severe," he said.
Indeed, Washington is already thinking of reviving a trade law that allows it to declare countries unfair traders and apply sanctions. But the first blows to Japan are likely to come from a rise of the yen, which will squeeze Japan's export-oriented automobile and electronics companies. The vise already began to tighten on Friday, with the dollar falling to about 107 yen in New York trading, down more than one yen from the day before.
Some politicians and business leaders have long argued that Japan should be more assertive in its relationship with the United States. That point of view found its voice in "The Japan That Can Say No," a book written a few years ago by Shintaro Ishihara, a politician, and Akio Morita, the chairman of the Sony Corporation.
Mr. Hosokawa appears to be better positioned than his predecessors to move the two nations toward what he called "a relationship between grown-ups," because he is part of a younger generation of politicians who feel less beholden to the United States for its help in resurrecting Japan's economy after World War II.
Another factor is that with the ending of the cold war, the United States and Japan feel less compelled to sweep their economic differences under the rug to present a united front on security issues.
 
Political Fallout Minimal
 Maintaining smooth relations with Japan's senior ally and biggest trading partner has been one of the most important jobs of the Prime Minister. But political analysts here say that unlike what would have happened in the past, Mr. Hosokawa will not suffer much, either in political power or popularity, from the breakdown of talks in Washington.
Mr. Hosokawa presides over a fragile coalition that has almost torn itself apart over electoral and tax reform. In both of those cases, the Prime Minister suffered damaging setbacks, only to save himself with watered-down compromises.
But on the issue of numerical targets for the purchase of American goods, there has been relative unanimity among politicians. Even Yohei Kono, the president of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, while chiding the governing coalition for failure to reach an agreement with the United States, said today that he agreed with the Prime Minister's position against numerical targets.
Businesses, while wanting to keep good relations with the United States, are in less of a mood for bargaining now because of the severe recession here. Auto makers, for instance, are having enough trouble keeping their traditional suppliers afloat without worrying about buying more American components.
Nor has the public shown much interest. Many people here seem concerned not with bilateral relations, but with nine inches of snow, the worst snowstorm in 25 years, which paralyzed Tokyo today. Of course, those interested in trade found it somewhat symbolic of a new chill in relations that both Tokyo and Washington should be hit with rare snowstorms just as their leaders were meeting.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Kazakh Chief Each Filling a Need

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE WASHINGTON, Feb. 12, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
Kazakhstan's President, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, is to arrive here on Sunday for an official visit during which the Clinton Administration plans to shower him with increased aid as it tries to make him a model for other leaders of the former Soviet Union.
In return, President Nazarbayev will give President Clinton what he wants most from the Kazakh leader: the signed document in which Kazakhstan formally joins the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and a pledge to become a nonnuclear state. 
 For Washington, that is a crucial step toward cementing relations with a leader whose nation, the largest in area in the former Soviet Union after Russia, used to have 104 long-range SS-18 missiles, each with 10 warheads.
The Administration is showing its appreciation to Mr. Nazarbayev by announcing plans to more than triple aid to Kazakhstan, from $91 million this year to $311 million next year. Some of it will be used to dismantle warheads. The Administration will sign more than half a dozen cooperation agreements with the Kazakh leader on economic, military and space matters.
Mr. Nazarbayev, the former steelworker turned Communist Party leader turned capitalist head of a new country, will receive the attention he desires: a meeting and lunch with President Clinton on Monday, capped by a dinner with Vice President Al Gore as host at the State Department.
When Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited Kazakhstan in October, he pressed Mr. Nazarbayev to provide the papers for the nonproliferation treaty then and there. But the Kazakh leader, with a sense of theater and political moment, signaled that he would do it only at a White House ceremony with Mr. Clinton. Two years ago in Lisbon, Kazakhstan tentatively agreed to sign the treaty.
Administration officials want to use Mr. Nazarbayev's visit partly to show that they are paying more attention to the former Soviet republics other than Russia. As part of this strategy, the Administration is doubling its economic aid to Ukraine to more than $300 million and plans to promote that country's transition to capitalism.
One official said Mr. Nazarbayev was being rewarded not only because Kazakhstan is joining the treaty, but also because "his country has done more on economic reform than all of the other newly independent states.
"It's in a region where we want to see more reform," the official said, "and we want to show we are good to countries that want to reform."
Kazakhstan has moved rapidly to privatize large and small businesses and has opened itself to more Western investment than any other newly independent state. With one of the biggest oil fields outside the Persian Gulf, Kazakhstan has signed an agreement with the Chevron Corporation in which the San Francisco-based company plans to put up four-fifths of the $20 billion to develop the field.
Kazakhstan, the ninth largest country, borders Russia, China, the Caspian Sea and three other former Soviet republics: Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It is abundant in gold, silver, chrome, zinc and iron ore and is an exporter of wheat and coal.
Attracted by those resources and by Kazakhstan's embrace of economic reform, executives from more than 50 companies, including A.T.& T., Amoco, Du Pont and Procter & Gamble, will meet on Monday with Mr. Nazarbayev at a conference organized by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which helps American companies pursue foreign business opportunities. Mr. Nazarbayev is eager for a flood of Western investment that brings jobs, technology and better living standards to his nation of 17 million.
Among the agreements Mr. Nazarbayev is expected to sign is a memorandum of understanding with the Pentagon to establish regular contacts between senior military officials. There are three agreements with the investment corporation, including one to support a gold processing plant to be operated by the Minproc Corporation of Englewood, Colo. There will also be an agreement under which a Russian rocket will use the Baykonur space center in Kazakhstan to launch an American communications satellite.

HEADLINE: Easy as Pie? Not in New Mexico Town

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PIE TOWN, N.M.

 BODY:
In New Mexico as in other places, naming towns is a quirky business. Some names honor people, like the Duke of Albuquerque. Others are linked to Catholicism, including Santa Fe and Las Cruces. And one, Truth or Consequences, pays homage to a quiz show. But only this one owes its name to a dessert.
Conjuring up aromatic images of home and truck stop, Pie Town, a mile west of the Continental Divide, has always drawn people. In New Mexico's territorial days, some say, weary cowboys came here for sweet sustenance. Spotting it on a map in 1940, Russell Lee, a Farm Security Administration photographer, drove from Amarillo, Tex., and captured the indomitability and interdependence of its people, primarily homesteaders from Texas fleeing the Dust Bowl and the Depression. 
 Curious tourists still forgo the more streamlined Interstate 40 for Route 60 to check out Pie Town. And every September, a thousand or more people come here for the Pie Festival, complete with pie-eating and pie-baking contests.
The "Welcome to Pie Town" sign at the city limits depicts a Boston cream pie and two others of uncertain lineage. But the sad truth is that a recent visitor could not buy a single slice of pie in Pie Town. Finding people was almost as hard. The piquant smell of burning pinon wood, a ubiquitous sign of life in New Mexico winters, is faint here. The pie-shaped telescope on the edge of town, run by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, probably picks up more activity in galaxies light years away.
 
A Crucial Crossroads
 The Pie Town to which Mr. Lee brought his Speed Graphic was poor but populated, and vital. It was a place without telephones or running water, but with all-night dances, community sing-alongs and a "literary society," a place in which women in aprons fixed each other's hair, and men in overalls built each other's dugout homes. There was even a main drag, with newly minted signs for Dr. Pepper and Beech-Nut chewing tobacco hammered into its storefronts.
Pie Town, about 100 miles southwest of Albuquerque, still has some communal trappings, including a volunteer fire department, two churches and a Town Council. But almost from the day Mr. Lee left, it has been dying. First came World War II, which lured many to munitions plants elsewhere. Then came drought, which left the land too dry to produce pinto beans. Mr. Lee placed the 1940 population at 250 families; Rand McNally found 85 people last year.
Even its alluring name cannot protect Pie Town from the kind of creeping oblivion that is facing hamlets everywhere. Its hardiest commercial creatures were gas stations. Now there are only carcasses -- a Shell, a Mobil, a Phillips 66, condemned by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency for leaky storage tanks. The nearest working gas stations are 22 miles away, in either Datil or Quemado. That's also where Pie Town's 13 children learn their three R's now that all the area's one-room schools are gone.
The Pie Town Post Office is open only four hours day. Just about the only other going concern is H. & R. Block. "You can't get anything in this town, but they still expect you to pay your taxes," said Crystal Leyba, 29, who drives the local school bus.
 
Economic Extremes
 Many of the rough-hewn structures of logs and mud that housed the homesteaders have been abandoned. So has the former beanery, where farmers brought whatever they had extracted from the begrudging ground.
"You have to do some pretty hard work to make a living in this country," said Roy McKee, 83, a Texan who came to Pie Town in 1937, and whose brother can be seen dancing a jig in one of Mr. Lee's most famous photographs.
Pie Towners tend to fall on the extremes of the economic spectrum. Many are on welfare. Others are wealthy ranchers, including a few original families who strung together their 640-acre sections into valuable pieces of property.
"The ones that stayed are wealthy now if they would admit it," said James Hogg, an 89-year-old former teacher and rancher who arrived in 1931. "You never ask a cowman how many cattle he has, because he won't tell you. He'll tell his banker if he needs to borrow money, and he's supposed to tell the tax people. Supposed to."
 
What's in a Name?
 Down the road from the old general store, whose Coca-Cola signs are too faded to make worth stealing, is what was once Harmon Craig's store. From its ovens came Pie Town's first pies -- or so some say. For just as the spelling of Pie Town is debatable -- some road signs say Pie Town, others Pietown -- so, too, is the etymology.
In one story, a family carrying a wagonload of dried fruit and flour to California lost a mule here. Rather than push westward, they stayed. And rather than let the fruit rot, the wife made pies. Another story has a drunken cowboy looking at the dessert selections on an early menu and declaring, "This must be Pie Town!"
In her history of the area, Mr. McKee's daughter, Kathryn McKee-Roberts of Bosque Farms, N.M., determined that Pie Town's first pie man was Clyde L. Norman, who sold dried apple pies at his gas station in the 1920's. Shortly after, he placed a Pie Town sign on his roof. He soon sold out to Mr. Craig, who put the town on the postal map.
"The postal inspector came to appraise the situation and said a more suitable name must be found, as 'Pie Town' was ridiculous and 'beneath the dignity of the department,' but Mr. Craig said either that or nothing!" Ms. McKee-Roberts wrote.
 
Passing the Rolling Pin
 For a time, Mr. Craig's wife and daughters made the pies. From the Craigs the rolling pin was passed to a Mrs. White, then to Edd Jones and Jody Carver and Lester and Emily Jackson. But the Jacksons divorced, and until a retired couple, Arthur and Cleo Candalaria, arrived a few years ago from Grants, 70 miles north, Pie Town was pieless.
Truth be told, the Candalarias, who live behind their store, have been importing pies from Albuquerque, 15 or 20 of them a week. They are closed for the winter, however, and, ready for another challenge, have their store on the block. Like Pie Town, its prospects are uncertain.
"The world has changed so much," said Mr. Candalaria, breaking into tears. "It's all damned cities -- dog-eat-dog, drugs, murder and rape. People can no longer live on the land, be neighborly. It's all gone."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Russell Lee, a Farm Security Administration photographer, left Pie Town in 1940 after capturing the interdependence of its people in pictures that brought notoriety to the New Mexico town. But since then, it has been dying, as evidenced by an abandoned gas station photographed late last year. (David Margolick/The New York Times); Pie Town in 1940 was poor but populated and vital. In one of Russell Lee's photos, women danced at an all-night party. (Russell Lee/Farm Security Administration/Library of Congress)

HEADLINE: Is Albany's Bureaucracy Half Full or Half Empty?

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo kept his pledge, made as the recession darkened three years ago, to cut 1 in 10 state jobs. Now he says the pain is over. This year, he is calling for almost no layoffs, as his re-election campaign nears and the economy tiptoes into a recovery.
But even after the elimination of 20,000 positions, the questions remain. Is the state work force, connected in the minds of voters to the taxes they pay, at optimal size? Or should Mr. Cuomo seek deeper cuts from the Legislature? The questions are likely to stalk him as he runs for a fourth term as head of a state administration still slightly bigger than when he took office in 1983. 
 "To have a year when the Governor says, 'It's over, it's done and I have no suggestions to make to reap productivity savings,' that's disappointing," said Cynthia Green of the Citizens' Budget Commission, a watchdog agency. "We're not out of the woods. We're not at a point where these things are not important."
Even Mr. Cuomo's harshest critics give him credit for the cuts over the last three years, which resulted in 7,000 layoffs, 4,000 early retirements and vast numbers of jobs vacated but never filled. He says he is not finished: this year's budget calls for another 170 layoffs, 2,100 jobs lost through attrition, various cuts for efficiency and the empanelment of a bipartisan commission to reorganize and reduce government.
But as New York City and New Jersey prepare to lay off public workers, it is clear the big cuts in the state are over for now, in a work force of 238,131 in 1992, the latest year for which complete data are available. Though many experts say services have not declined significantly, Andrew J. Zambelli, Mr. Cuomo's chief of staff, said the pause was necessary to review the effect of the cuts on the work force and delivery of services.
"Literally two months ago we finished this reduction," Mr. Zambelli said. "We're reviewing what it all means, absorbing it, understanding it."
But some business groups and governmental experts, as well as at least two potential Republican challengers, have marshaled numbers and anecdotes to suggest that the Governor has not gone nearly far enough, either in direct cuts or other efforts to streamline government.
For example, the combination of state and local workers per 10,000 population in New York ranks fourth in the country and is the highest among the 11 most populous states, according to Federal census data from 1991, the last year available.
When looking at state employees alone, the only ones over whom Mr. Cuomo has direct control, New York State ranks only 36th in workers per capita. But some argue that the state delegates much authority to local governments, for instance education and social services, and thus bears responsibility for keeping all costs in check. They argue that the overall work force, of which the state remains a major part, determines the tax burden and to varying degrees a corporate climate in New York that business groups say is costly and inhospitable.
 
Problems on Local Level
 "A big part of the problem is on the local level," said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the Rockefeller Institute in Albany, a research organization financed by the state.
But Mr. Gold added: "Governor Cuomo has emphasized that we are in a very competitive time. New York has to continue to slim down its work force. Because if it doesn't, the state is going to continue to have stratospheric taxes and that is going to strangle the economy."
In 1983, the year Mr. Cuomo took office, the work force was reduced from 234,201, to 229,176, but it then rose to a high of 255,817 in 1989. These figures include the state university system, the judiciary and the Legislature, areas over which the Governor's office contends it has less than full control.
 
More Prisons
 Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the State Division of the Budget, argues that the increase was necessary: the state has opened 27 prisons since 1982, doubling inmate population, and by 1989 had 28,500 corrections workers, up from 16,000. The number of state police officers, judges and parole officers increased, and the state opened a teaching hospital in Stony Brook and two veterans' hospitals. There were other financial burdens, like an explosion of Medicaid costs.
But by late 1990, the recession was choking off tax revenues and the Governor faced a $6.5 billion budget gap. So Mr. Cuomo pledged a 10 percent cut in workers financed by the general fund, the part of the budget derived from taxes and fees. According to state budget numbers, this was cut 12.7 percent between November 1990 and November 1993, from 185,718 to 162,117. The percentage cut in the same period has been just under 10 percent for all state jobs controlled by the executive branch, including those paid by fees and by Federal money.
"That didn't mean we had too many people to start with," Ms. Hutton said. "It means we recognized what we had to do. In the end we did what we had to in order to keep the budget balanced."
 
Services Broadened
 Nearly every other state in the nation also broadened its services through the 1980's, mostly in corrections and education. With the exception of New York and a few other large states, most states and localities continued to expand their payrolls throughout the recession, according to a recent study by the Rockefeller Institute.
In New York, there is a consensus, even among some unions, that the cuts, while deep and painful for many individuals, did not devastate the overall quality of state services, which have been traditionally much broader in New York than in other states. A large majority of the cuts, more than 12,000 positions, came from the Offices of Mental Health and the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, in a budget-driven acceleration of deinstitutionalization in favor of small, private, community programs.
 
Room for More Cuts?
 Some critics say the apparent ease with which the state slimmed down by 10 percent is proof more could go.
"A bloated government has lost some of the excess fat but still is completely out of shape," said State Senator George E. Pataki, Republican of Peekskill, who is seeking the Republican nomination for Governor. Herbert London, who is also seeking the nomination, has made similar criticisms.
Senator Pataki and groups like Change New York, the conservative political action group, advocate more layoffs as well as changes such as abolishing the state energy office, issuing health vouchers for poor people and reducing staffing at prisons.
But Ms. Hutton of the budget office said hacking into the work force is not so simple and not always desirable.
"Politically the popular thing to say is we have too many employees," Ms. Hutton said. "Then you take that general statement and say where are we going to cut? But if you cut the Department of Motor Vehicles and it results in longer lines, they say, 'Why did you do that?' I think employees are often used as battering rams in the political process and that's not fair to them."
In arguing against further cuts, Ross D. Hanna, the director of contract services with the Civil Service Employees Association, and other union leaders say the work force has been reduced enough. He said the effects of the layoffs since 1991 were real but felt more within the ranks. For example, the Department of State, which inspects buildings, lost all 13 of its inspectors but still had to do the job with other workers.
"The individual taxpayer might not notice these things," he said. "If you have less people working in a social services office or office of the state, things take longer to get done. And it is a significant problem. We have people who are truly overburdened."
Union leaders argue, though not stridently, that the state should selectively rehire some state workers as the economy improves. But they and other experts seem more concerned with intelligent planning for future changes or layoffs.
 
More With Less
 Among other experts, Frank J. Thompson, dean of the School of Public Affairs at the State University at Albany, said Mr. Cuomo had not done enough to streamline government, combine overlapping functions and reform the Civil Service system. The Governor's office has some successes of doing more with less, like the revamping of the Department of Motor Vehicles, which has tried to reduce frustration by relying more on the telephone and mail, and has various initiatives to do more. But many experts say the state has lagged and results have been minimal.
"If you look at what the State of New York systems require, it is probably not overstaffed," Mr. Thompson said. "It probably needs more people to make these systems work."
"The real question is -- and it's very hard to do in New York -- a lot of the functions of the state need to be streamlined," he said. "Then we could focus more on the front-line services positions that you and I care about as taxpayers."

HEADLINE: U.S. and East European Weapons Dealers Clash

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GLIWICE, Poland

 BODY:
Three years ago, the tank factory here, reeling from the loss of its reliable Warsaw Pact customers, was greatly relieved when Syria signed a contract for 300 tanks. Then disaster struck. Washington did not like the idea, and Poland responded by canceling the tank deal.
"It's a miracle we survived," Marek Jurkiewicz, spokesman for the Bumar Labedy factory, said recently. 
 And the survival has been tenuous at that: more than half the plant's workers have been laid off. The future would be a little brighter in this polluted industrial pocket of southern Poland if the company could wrap up two other sales -- to Iran and Pakistan.
But Washington's objections have hindered these deals and are preventing another Polish factory from shipping Kalashnikov rifles to Myanmar, and another from selling helicopter parts.
 
Someone Always 'Telling Us'
 "Before, the Soviet Union was telling us what to do," Mr. Jurkiewicz said. "Now the United States is telling us what not to do. It amounts to the same thing."
Eastern European leaders say they want to stay on Washington's good side, particularly as they try to enter NATO. But these countries, facing the transition to capitalism and rising unemployment, are desperate for business, and many of their best customers are on Washington's list of undesirables.
The Eastern Europeans are also frustrated that Washington has not come up with millions of dollars to convert the arms plants to peaceful uses, an idea much discussed at the end of the cold war. In the meantime, the United States remains the world's largest arms factory.
"They are preaching that we drink water while they drink wine," said Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech Minister of Industry and Trade, who was angry after Washington's intervention scuttled the sale of Czech-made radar and of civilian nuclear power plant engines to Iran. "I consider it hypocritical."
 
Concern About Ethnic War
 Washington's fear is that Eastern European arms will fuel ethnic conflicts and strengthen repressive governments. Shoppers in the Eastern European arms bazaars come largely from the third world, attracted by lower prices and by a willingness to sell to them where the West is often reluctant.
Eastern European arms makers generally abide by United Nations embargoes, but the embargoes now cover only Iraq, Libya and Yugoslavia. They waver when the list expands to countries suffering from civil strife and those Washington accuses of state-sponsored terrorism, like Syria and Iran, or of human rights abuses.
Washington's objections to the Polish tank sale to Iran are raised "in almost every meeting," said Jerzy Pomianowski, a senior official in the Polish Foreign Ministry. Poland argues that since Iran already has 3,000 tanks, selling it 100 more, as the Bumar Labedy plant wants to do, will not contribute to regional instability.
A poor human rights record is the reason the United States cites for opposing the sale of helicopter spare parts by a Polish company to Myanmar, formerly Burma. This rankles Poles, who note that there are American-made Bell helicopters there. These were sold as civilian helicopters, but American officials say they were quickly adapted for military use.
Another Polish company would like to sell Kalashnikov rifles to Myanmar.
 
Burma Is 'Promising'
 "I have been in Burma," said Raymond Szwonder, an executive at Luzcnik Metal Works in Radom, 60 miles south of Warsaw. "It looks very promising to us as a market."
Mr. Szwonder was arrested in Germany two years ago on charges by the United States that he was part of a conspiracy to sell arms to Iraq. He was never extradited, and four other defendants were acquitted. Today he is a member of the Polish Senate and chairman of its defense committee.
"The Bulgarians don't give a damn about any lists" Mr. Szwonder said in an interview. "The Czechs aren't saints either."
The Czech Republic personifies the turnabout on arms sales.
In the 1980's, Czechoslovakia was the seventh-largest arms exporter in the world, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
 
Czech Business Growing
 After the fall of Communism, the Government of Vaclav Havel banned or restricted arms sales to more than 50 countries at one point. Today, the conservative Government of Vaclav Klaus has no such list, and the business is growing.
Miroslav Duda, president of Ceska Zbrojovka, which manufactures pistols, submachine guns and rifles, said the company could have converted to tractor hydraulics and airplane gearboxes, but his studies showed that the arms business was more profitable. So today only weapons come off the computerized assembly lines at the sprawling factory in Uhersky Brod, 120 miles east of Prague. Production has increased 15 to 20 percent each year since 1990, Mr. Duda said.
 
Policing Is Difficult
 Czech officials said the Government respects United Nations military sanctions and prohibits arms sales to countries where there is civil strife. Last year the Government blocked shipments of arms to Bolivia and Panama when it suspected that the weapons were destined for other places, probably the former Yugoslavia. But the Government cannot police all sales.
Recently, a Czech company, Tesla Pardubice, wanted to sell Iran an advanced radar system, called the Tamara, and Mr. Dlouhy, the Minister of Trade, saw no reason why it should not, arguing that it is a "non-aggressive defense system."
But after Washington complained, the Czech Government stopped the sale. Other Middle Eastern countries are now negotiating to buy the system, according to Czech officials; Chile has also expressed an interest.
Iran also came close to buying components for a nuclear power station from another Czech company, Skoda Plzen, in a deal that Mr. Dlouhy endorsed because it was a civilian project. Again, however, Washington objected, and the Czech Foreign Ministry vetoed the sale.
But Skoda, which was one of the largest arms manufacturers in Europe during the cold war, is not discouraged. Recently, it formed a consortium -- the RDP Group -- with other arms makers.
 
Modernizing the T-72 Tank
 One of the consortium's first projects will be modernizing the T-72 battle tank, once the mainstay of the Soviet Army. There are tens of thousands of T-72's in the former Soviet Union, in the Middle East and throughout the third world.
As Skoda gets back into the tank business, it will be competing against companies that were once part of the national family, but which are now on their own across the border in newly independent Slovakia.
During the cold war, the tanks, armored personnel carriers, and artillery that rolled off the assembly lines from ZTS factories formed the spine of the Slovakian economy. Now the Slovakian arms manufacturers are putting together their own consortium, said Rudolf Cyprian, a spokesman for ZTS.
The principal customers will be in the Middle East, Asia and Africa, said Lubomir Gazak, a senior official in the Slovak Ministry of Economy. He said the Government had a list of countries to which arms sales were forbidden. He would not identify them, but he said Syria and Pakistan were not on the list.
 
Bulgaria Sells to Syria
 Another country that has no qualms about dealing with Syria, is Bulgaria. In the last two years, Bulgarian companies have sold Kalashnikovs and other weapons to Syria, according to Mladen Mutafchiiski, president of Teraton, a state-owned company that arranged the sales.
Last fall, when the Georgian Government went shopping for arms for its civil war, it bought at least 1,000 Kalashnikovs from Bulgaria, he said.
Algeria, Albania and Yemen have also received Bulgarian weapons in the last year, arms traders say. But officials will not discuss the matter.
Though no Eastern European government is as secretive as Bulgaria, neither does any country have such strict public disclosure laws as the United States. As the arms business in former Warsaw Pact countries takes on new life, it will become more difficult to determine who the new customers are.

HEADLINE: U.N. Speeds Arms-Monitoring Effort in Iraq

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 12, Special to The New York Times 

 BODY:
The United Nations is speeding up its monitoring of Iraq's military industries in an effort to determine whether Baghdad has complied with Security Council disarmament terms, a move that would bolster the position of Iraqi officials who have cooperated with the inspection effort.
The supporters of cooperation -- chief among them is Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz -- appear to be facing political difficulties in Baghdad, officials here say. 
 Once the Security Council agrees that Iraq is complying with the disarmament order, it has the power to lift the embargo on Iraqi oil sales imposed under Resolution 687, which ordered the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction after the defeat of its armed forces in the Gulf war.
In a statement issued on Friday, Rolf Ekeus, head of the special commission overseeing Iraq's disarmament, and Mr. Aziz said they planned to "expedite" the inspections to insure that Iraq is not producing banned weapons. The statement said the Security Council would be informed of the results "at the earliest feasible time."
The joint statement was negotiated in Baghdad on Feb. 5 after Mr. Aziz asked Mr. Ekeus to fly there on short notice to provide political support from the United Nations in his efforts to persuade his Government to continue cooperating with the Security Council's disarmament plan, officials here said.
The statement said that the talks in Baghdad consolidated "the breakthrough" achieved last summer. They were referring to Iraq's decision to cooperate with the disarmament order after being convinced by the Special Commission that compliance will give the country access to billions of dollars in oil revenues again.
Recently, however, the Clinton Administration has hinted that it may impose additional conditions for easing the embargo, including Iraq's recognition of Kuwait's frontiers and an end toattacks on dissident Kurds and Shiites.
Mr. Ekeus has warned that setting up a long-term monitoring system to prevent production of nuclear, chemical or biological arms is taking longer than expected and that it may not be ready until near the end of this year.
The United States has said it will want to test the monitoring system for at least six months before it even considers lifting the oil embargo.
Iraq had hoped the Council would agree to ease sanctions in January. It did not, prompting bitter complaints in Iraq's Government-controlled press and leading to an even higher inflation rate, which is a result of the trade embargo. Last summer the dollar was worth about 50 Iraqi dinars on Baghdad's free market. The dinar has now fallen to around 270 to the dollar.
Writing on Jan. 20, just after the sanctions review, in Babil, a daily paper owned by President Saddam Hussein's son Udai, Nuri Najm al-Marsumi, first Under Secretary in the Ministry of Culture and Information, said "beware of the patient man's rage."
He warned that "Iraqis will not remain silent at the continuation of the blockade" and seemed to threaten a new confrontation with the United Nations, saying, "We are capable of bringing the game back to the beginning ."
Opponents of the policy of cooperating with the United Nations argue that it is not worth pursuing because the United States will not agree to the lifting of sanctions as long as Mr. Hussein remains in power.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans Deep Cuts in Malaria Vaccine Program

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is planning deep cuts in a program to develop a malaria vaccine just as tests of a promising experimental vaccine get under way in Africa, Government officials say.
The Administration is seeking to trim the budget for health programs at the Agency for International Development because of demands for more money to bolster the Commonwealth of Independent States and the peace efforts in the Middle East, Joseph J. Byrne, a spokesman for the agency, said on Friday. 
 Vaccine researchers in the United States and at the United Nations Development Program said they were alarmed at the prospect of cuts in funds for malaria research.
Officials of A.I.D. said "substantial cuts" would be made in funds the agency provides for tropical disease research and other health programs, with some programs losing as much as 40 percent of the money they got in 1993.
 
$2.5 Million for Research
 The agency has sent about $2.5 million annually to the Tropical Disease Research Global Program of the World Health Organization.
"We are not going to zero this program," Mr. Byrne said of research on a malaria vaccine. "But it will probably be cut substantially."
He said the agency was trying to preserve programs that serve people in need, and so research programs may take larger cuts than programs such as those for rehydration therapy to prevent diarrheal disease, the leading killer of children in Africa.
"Malaria is only the No. 3 killer," Mr. Byrne said. "So we don't want to move money from things like rehydration therapy. We are also trying to cut programs that have disproportionately high administrative expenses."
The malaria vaccine being tested in Africa was created in Colombia by Dr. Manuel Patarroyo and his colleagues. In tests in Colombia it was found to reduce the number of malaria attacks in children by more than 70 percent, and in adults by 20 percent.
Though the vaccine is only partly protective, it is the first to prevent parasitic disease at even this level, said Dr. D. A. Henderson, Assistant Secretary of Health at the Department of Health and Human Services.
The experiments in Africa began last year. Next Friday in the medical journal Vaccine, scientists will report that in the first injections in Africa, no serious side effects were seen and those injected showed strong stimulation of their immune defenses.
The next step, already begun, is to immunize 600 children in Tanzania to see how much malarial attacks can be reduced. Results are expected next year.
Dr. Henderson, a leading expert in public health, said in a telephone interview that cuts in research programs in tropical health could be catastrophic. "Some people are oriented to stick with programs out in the field, thinking they can drop the research and pick it up later," he said. "It's not true. Once you kill the research it is dead, because it takes five to ten years to build a research program back up once you dismantle it."
Dr. Tore Godal, director of the tropical disease research program, said in an interview that the United States had contributed greatly to the development of the malaria vaccine, and that other countries looked to the United States for substantial contributions.
He said other countries may be inclined to cut their support if they see the United States doing so. The program's budget is about $30 million. He said about $5 million of that money is spent on research in labs in the United States.
If the United States reduces its contributions, Dr. Godal said other donors will press him to cut the amount of money spent in the United States. "We may have to cut the support we give to American researchers," he said, "which would be very unfortunate, because they are very efficient and competitive."
Mr. Byrne said substantial cuts would be made in many programs in the A.I.D. health budget, which last year was $114 million.

HEADLINE: WINTER OLYMPICS;
Kerrigan Glides Through Compulsory Interview

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LILLEHAMMER, Norway, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Six police officers, dressed in severe black uniforms and with even more severe faces, provided escort for Nancy Kerrigan's interview with the world's sporting media today. Fittingly, it was high noon. The long-anticipated figure-skating shootout between Kerrigan and Tonya Harding is less than two weeks away.
Photographers formed a human gridlock in the auditorium, standing shoulder to shoulder on a railing, elbowing for position, awaiting Kerrigan's arrival amid a media throng that numbered in the hundreds. Mike Moran, spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee, admonished reporters to ask their questions with a microphone. "Don't injure yourselves," he said, in case this interview turned into a journalistic roller derby. 
 He needn't have bothered. This was less a news conference than a taping of "Oprah," with the media serving as a live studio audience. Olympic and skating officials say that Kerrigan has healed, physically and mentally, from the clubbing attack on her right knee, but they insist on treating her like an emotional cripple.
 
Stronger Now
 Attempting to shelter her from a storm of tough questions, Moran and Kristin Matta of the United States Figure Skating Association, sat on the podium and chatted with Kerrigan, eliciting such insightful responses from her as, "My family has been there since I was born."
Finally, when the floor was opened for questions, Kerrigan handled herself quite well, thank you. In sheltering and protecting Kerrigan, Olympic and skating officials have missed one critical point. The attack, however chilling, appears to have made her stronger and more confident. Where she was vulnerable five weeks ago, crying "Why, why, why?," Kerrigan is self-assured now. There is no need to protect her. She can protect herself.
When one foreign journalist suggested today that the judges would feel sorry for her and give her artificially high scores, Kerrigan replied, "I don't think it's true. I don't think people have a reason to feel sorry for me. I'm capable of performing everything I've worked for all year, for 18 years."
Since she couldn't drive to a convenience store in Massachusetts without news-at-11 shadows trailing her, Kerrigan said, she stayed inside and watched the Harding saga unfold on television. To her, it seems like the mysteries she loves to read.
"It's kind of like reading a book," Kerrigan said. "You can't wait to get to the end to see what happens."
 
Thrown Together
 The end finally came today, when the U.S.O.C. announced it would allow Harding to compete without first appearing at a disciplinary hearing scheduled for this week in Oslo.
Now that Harding will compete, she and Kerrigan will apparently practice at the same time, in the same rink. They will live in the same building, on different floors, but they are bound to bump into each other. In the dressing room. In the cafeteria. Somewhere. Harding, who has maintained her innocence in planning the attack despite a guilty plea by her former husband implicating her, has said that she would like to hug Kerrigan if given the chance.
"I don't know how I'm going to feel when I see her," Kerrigan said. "I don't know what's going to happen. It is personal, between the two of us, not you guys."
 
Other Stories, Too
 Again, she bemoaned her lack of privacy, though, in truth, Kerrigan has sought the spotlight as much as she has run from it. And she appeared slightly disingenuous when she said she hadn't considered the economic windfall from her attack; her agent, after all, has entertained more than 35 offers for a television movie. Still, she said all the right things about diverting attention from other Olympians.
"There are a lot of great athletes and stories and I don't want to take anything away from the other athletes," Kerrigan said. "I hope the other athletes get the recognition they deserve. They worked hard to get here."
Kerrigan has worked as hard as anyone. After a disastrous performance at the 1993 world championships in Prague, she has mended her cracked porcelain confidence.
"She was afraid to do a perfect program in practice," Evy Scotvold, her coach, said. "She was afraid she couldn't do it. She didn't want to find out that she couldn't. I had never seen her do a perfect program until October. There has been a great maturing in her life this year."
And if she wins a gold medal, there will be another news conference. This one would be bigger than Katarina Witt's loopy, beer-induced, coronation gigglefest at Calgary in 1988. Bigger than the Dream Team's Meet the Press gathering in 1992. Bigger than anything the Olympics has ever seen.

HEADLINE: WINTER OLYMPICS;
Class Against Dash In Battle of Styles

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAMAR, Norway, Feb. 12

 BODY:
When pairs figure skating begins on Sunday, and Russian gold medalists from the previous two Olympics take the ice, nine judges will have a decision to make. Not a decision about talent, but about style.
What do they prefer: the husband-and-wife artistry and harmony of Yekaterina Gordeyeva and Sergei Grinkov, the 1988 champions? Or the muscular invention and flexible contortions of Natalya Mishkutienok and Artur Dmitriev, the 1992 champions? 
 "I think we skate better, but it is the judges' problem, not my problem," Dmitriev said.
So far, the judges have voted for the elegance and line and unison of Gordeyeva and Grinkov. At the recent Russian championships. At the recent European championships. And at every other competition before these. Gordeyeva and Grinkov conjure something about the essence of figure skating, about grace and control and tandem flow that is unrivaled in the sport.
 
Setting the Standard
 "Gordeyeva and Grinkov are the clear favorites," said John Nicks, who coaches the American champions, Jenni Meno and Todd Sand. "When you have a 170-pound man on the ice and you don't hear a sound, that's an indication of wonderful control. She's a much better jumper than before. The others may be better in terms of originality and flexibility. They may be more pleasing to the public. But, in terms of the skating fraternity, Gordeyeva and Grinkov are the example for everyone in pairs skating today."
Gordeyeva was only 16 at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, an effervescent sprite weighing but 90 pounds who was tossed so effortlessly and spectacularly by Grinkov, her partner. With the Soviet Union beginning to crumble, they turned professional in 1990, leaving Mishkutienok and Dmitriev as their Olympic successors. In 1991, Gordeyeva and Grinkov married. A year later, a change in the rules, allowing professionals to regain amateur status, opened the door for their Olympic return. But it wasn't an easy decision. Gordeyeva was six months pregnant at the time. Could she regain her fitness to skate the demanding jumps and spins? Did she want to?
 
Gave Birth in New Jersey
 "We watched a lot of tapes of the last Olympic Games," Gordeyeva said. "In the end, the decision was more emotional than calculated."
Wary of the uncertain medical care in the former Soviet Union, Gordeyeva came to the United States, delivering her baby -- a daughter named Daria -- in Morristown, N.J., on Sept. 11, 1992. Gordeyeva had gained only 18 pounds during her pregnacy, so there wasn't much extra weight to lose. A month after she gave birth, she began skating again. She is six years older than 1988, which, along with motherhood, has given Gordeyeva a maturity she lacked at the Calgary Olympics.
"Before, we were not like machines, but we did not feel everything," Gordeyeva said. "Now, we are together, and we feel our skating."
If Gordeyeva and Grinkov, who is 27, are defined by their balletic grace, then Mishkutienok and Dmitriev, their friends and chief rivals, are to be remembered for their daring, gymnastic elasticity.
Figure skating was inelegant and unartful at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, marred by repeated falls and unfulfilled performances. Except for Mishkutienok and Dmitriev. Their strenth and originality was mesmerizing; at one point Mishkutienok draped herself around Dmitriev like a feather boa, then inverted herself, head at his feet, for what has come to be known as the Natalya Death Spin.
"It's up to the judges to decide which style they like," said their coach, Tamara Moskvina. "Classical, easy-looking, but something that doesn't catch your soul. Or something that expresses a lot of emotion and celebrates the movements themselves."
 
Subpar in Copenhagen
 It has not been an entirely satisfying season for the defending champions. Over the summer, one of their training rinks in St. Petersburg was closed to skaters so that it could be used to store bananas. Later, the rink reopened. At the recent European championships in Copenhagen, Mishkutienok and Dmitriev finished third after a Czech judge inadvertently gave them marks of 4.4 and 4.7 instead of 5.4 and 5.7 in the technical program. The judge realized her mistake, but the referee did not allow a change. Moskvina didn't complain.
"They didn't skate well," she said. "But in the last few practices, I have my hopes back."
Two new spirals and an innovative combination spin have been added to their Olympic program, which includes a side-by-side triple-toe-loop jump. For the moment, there are no concerns about Mishkutienok's weight, about which Moskvina is forever worried. Before the 1992 Olympics, Dmitriev hurt his back when Mishkutienok fell on him during a routine. In Albertville, Moskvina said that Mishkutienok, who is 23, skated like a cloud, but a "heavy cloud."
"She is not a feather, but she looks nice," Moskvina said of her skater's 1994 Olympic form.
Dmitriev, who is 25 and married, has fathered a son named Artur Jr. since the Albertville Olympics. Money from a professional tour has allowed him to purchase a car; he know longer has to take a series of buses to practice in St. Petersburg, as he did in 1992.
Another gold medal would mean more money on tour, a chance to keep up with Russia's skyrocketing inflation. He and his partner have the expressiveness and creativity to win. The question is, do they have the preferred style? Only nine judges know the answer.

HEADLINE: Desperately Seeking Someone?

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
MELISSA LEVINE says she went on 17 blind dates last month, and that's not even counting the guy she met by the bee pollen.
"I was in the health food store, and I saw this man looking at the products," said Ms. Levine, a 33-year-old financial planner who lives in Manhattan. "I went up to him and said, 'What are you buying?' and when he told me bee pollen, I said, 'Oh, get it, you'll have a lot of energy.' " He gave her his card on the way out, and they had a date soon after. 
 When she isn't being set up, Ms. Levine meets men all over New York, often just because they're there. (Ask her about the time she ended up going out with the guy who answered the reservation line for the Hampton Jitney.)
"I think it's easy to get a date," she said. "What's hard is getting a second one."
Ms. Levine's travails may seem a bit extreme, but the search for love in New York is clearly not for the weak of stomach. There are about 3.4 million single people in New York City, and what an awful lot of them seem to have in common is the belief that finding a mate in New York is like waiting for the E train on Sunday night: you assume one must be out there, but it isn't arriving any time soon.
"I hated being single," said Valerie Frankel, a magazine editor from Brooklyn and co-author of "The Heartbreak Handbook," a memoir of dating in New York. "I used to meet a lot of guys at bars. I would end up thinking, 'Why am I going home with a guy I met in the East Village?' But I did it because I was hopeful."
Sometimes it even works out. Yet the angst of it all drives many single New Yorkers into the arms of a thriving industry with a simple credo: there must be a better way.
Computer dating services, personal ads, special singles nights and weekends, singles groups with niches and special interests as diverse as New York (singles lawn bowling in Central Park?) -- the dating industry is not exactly new. Still, at least according to some experts in the laws of the dating jungle, these frantic times especially seem to demand some kind of order.
"I saw a lot of nostalgia during the 80's for the old structured system where rules were clear," said Beth Bailey, director of American studies at Barnard College and the author of "From Front Porch to Back Seat: Courtship in 20th-Century America." "In freeing ourselves from rules, we now know less how to behave."
Not surprisingly, this nostalgia seems to increase in direct proportion to age.
"When you are between the ages of 20 and 30, you're not single, you're unattached," said Michael Brandon, editor of Singles Almanac, a journal for singles in the New York area. "At around 30 you become actively single, and that's when you start attending parties, taking singles trips, weekends and things like that."
Perhaps this doesn't sound very romantic. Perhaps you really believe that you'll find your perfect match on that Sunday night E train. Perhaps you will. But it can't hurt to consider the alternatives.
 
THE CRUELEST MATH?
 Even the Census Bureau would probably agree that it's hard finding love in New York. Consider the numbers:
While it isn't exactly true that there are no single men out there, there are an awful lot more single women. Of those 3.4 million single New Yorkers, roughly 2 million are women, while only 1.4 million are men.
And, yes, New York, male and female, is significantly more single than the nation as a whole. Across America, 57 percent of men and 52 percent of women are married; in New York, only 47 percent of men and 39 percent of women are.
And while there are no accurate statistics for gay New Yorkers, their predicament is much the same.
"There is a myth that dating here is easier for gays, but it just isn't true," said Donald Suggs, a spokesman for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. "Whether you're a gay man, lesbian or straight, we are all equally dysfunctional. Dating in New York is simply incredibly difficult for everyone."
All of which, among other things, keeps roughly a dozen dating services in business in the city.
Actually, the boom time for dating services was the 80's, when about 30 operated in New York City alone. But many were driven out of business by the recession. Others either closed or moved to northern New Jersey in the early 90's, after the State Attorney General's office began cracking down on unscrupulous services by enforcing some of the most stringent regulations in the country.
Under these rules, dating services are not allowed to charge more than $500 for a 6- to 12-month membership. In addition, the contract must stipulate the minimum number of dates the service will provide. If the service does not keep its promise, the customer is entitled to a refund.
The Attorney General's office says it gets few complaints these days, and Mr. Brandon, the editor of the singles magazine, agrees that the survivors are generally reputable.
"A good service is one with a strong backlog of people," Mr. Brandon said. "It is run by people who are sincere, people who bend the rules, give an extra couple dates when the membership has run out."
How, then, do these dating services go about finding you the love of your life? At Together, a national company with three franchise offices in New York City, clients spend up to three hours with a "personal introduction counselor" who talks them through their dating needs, and gives them a questionnaire that rivals the S.A.T. in length and requires analytical thinking.
"New Yorkers are very busy," said Sherri Gilman, the spokeswoman for Together, which claims 1,500 clients here. "They are more interested in a real relationship and as a result want more of a screening process."
On the "attitude profile" section of the questionnaire, for example, respondents are asked to examine certain statements and check off their responses, from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree."
A few sample statements: "I find cultural arts boring." "Early hotel checkout times are annoying." "It's highly probable we will have to pay for our sins after life on earth."
The answers are computer coded, and matches are made according to compatibility in responses. "It's very scientific," Ms. Gilman said.
Many of the dating services tend to pepper their spiels with promises about all of the "quality people" they offer. And what, exactly, are quality people?
The services' rosters all seem to be filled with the attractive and the well employed. (About 60 percent are women, a figure that generally holds for the industry as a whole.) Most of these people, many of the services acknowledge, are white and middle class.
Many dating service owners say they take only "professionals"; they talk obsessively about all the doctors and lawyers the women manage to meet.
"People," said Ruth Roses, founder of Catholic Singles Matching Club, "are yearning to meet someone who meets their standards."
 
LADIES (AND MEN) WHO LUNCH

For those who can't stomach the idea of an entire evening with a stranger, there's a dating service with a reassuring name, It's Just Lunch. Started in Chicago and new to New York this year, this service sets up people for weekday lunch dates. As one of the founders, Andrea McGinty, points out, "Not much can go wrong in an hour. Lunch is nonthreatening, and you don't have to worry about the good-night kiss."
Ms. McGinty and her partner, Margaret Kunkler, interview potential lunch dates, capture them in Polaroid, then get down to the business of matchmaking.
Sitting on the floor of their midtown offices, the women plow through the piles of applications. "Here's David," said Ms. McGinty, running her hands over a new application. "He doesn't mind kids, but no New York accent. He's a little old fashioned."
Ms. Kunkler holds up a woman's application. "Oh, she could probably do that. She loves to sail." Ms. McGinty is thrilled. "This guy has a sailboat!"
Comments made in the margins during interviews with the clients guide them, too.
"No losers," reads the scrawl on the back of one.
"I feel on edge with her. She seems desperate."
"Episcopal: Easter only."
"No smoke (might tolerate a pipe)."
Once they think they discern a match, they call both parties (never giving out the other person's last name or phone number) and, if both agree, tell them the time and place to show up for lunch.
Because It's Just Lunch has relationships with several Manhattan restaurants, the maitres d'hotel are well practiced in their role of discreetly showing dates to their tables. Clients are instructed to call with feedback within 48 hours, the better to plan future dates, should they be needed.
After eight months in New York, It's Just Lunch boasts 750 clients, as well as one marriage and two engagements.
Jack Isenberg recently suspended his membership with It's Just Lunch, which was given to him as a birthday gift and still had time on the meter, after six dates led him to his new girlfriend.
"I am lazy and this seemed like a very 90's thing to have them do it for me," said Mr. Isenberg, who is 50 and divorced and owns a manufacturing company. "It's also good because it doesn't matter if it doesn't work out. You meet someone new, they're sweet, they're charming and thank you very much goodbye."
 
THE DATING DELI

Dan Fields has a utilitarian approach to matchmaking. At Fields Exclusive Service, which has been brokering marriages in New York since 1920, there is no handholding, no exploring past pains, no soft talk about emotional dysfunction. If an appointment with your average dating service is somewhat akin to a day of therapy, an hour with Dan Fields is more of a stop at the salad bar.
"You tell me what you like and I give it," said Mr. Fields, a "middle 60"-year-old who inherited the business from his father, who inherited it from his. "I have millionaires, I have working class, I got all religions and race. You tell me the height, you tell me the weight, you tell me the religion and that's what I'll give you." (With a side of cole slaw?)
"In the old country they came to grandfather's house," said Mr. Fields, the old country being Russia. "They said, 'I am looking for a certain type of lady,' and he matched them. Today I find a partner for future and happiness."
Mr. Fields claims a roster of 90,000 current clients and says he is responsible for thousands of marriages. But he is vague as to just how he matches people up. He says his 30 years of experience have molded him into a perceptive Cupid, but one might think the key actually rests in his surplus of supplies.
"I give some people 100 names, and others just one or two," he said, relying once again on his rather nebulous points of reference. "I have one gentleman who I gave 275 names, but he married the first one I gave him."
Mr. Fields doesn't so much arrange matches as help his clients make them. They must write him or stop by and tell him the vital statistics being sought in a mate. He will respond in a letter with a list of names, their vital statistics and phone numbers.
"I don't call nobody," he said, with the defiance of an insulted grandfather who is waiting for you to make amends. "If you need more numbers, I will send you more. And more and more and more and more."
 
MIX AND MATCH

Maybe all this matchmaking makes you nervous. Maybe you'd rather look around on your own, or at least what could pass for on your own. New York is flush with organizations devoted to the sponsorship of all sorts of events for all sorts of singles.
These professional party-givers say their events are a giant step up the evolutionary ladder from the traditional singles-bar jungle, because the atmosphere is preconditioned. The guests come from a list, not from the front door, and everyone knows that everyone else is looking.
"In a bar, you never know what to expect," said Jesse Itzler, a musician and entrepreneur. "A place could be packed, but there might only be five girls there. A party is a festive atmosphere, with an open bar and dancing. Everyone is there for the same thing. It works out great."
One such group is Singles of Distinction, which sponsors parties, weekend getaways and longer trips for singles "of all ages." The other night, the event was country dancing at Denim and Diamonds, a midtown singles bar.
The guests, who paid $25, were mostly 38-something folks from all over the city with varying degrees of dancing ability and Western fashion sense. One woman, decked out in black cutoffs, fishnet stockings and a black cowboy hat, danced front and center, two-stepping with a near-vengeance and intimidating those around her onto the sidelines.
There sat mostly women, sipping beers or primary-colored drinks, their eyes darting around the room. Holly Ellison, a 36-year-old market researcher, said she felt comfortable going to a singles event at Denim and Diamonds, because she already knew the place and liked the crowd.
"This is better than the personals," she said.
Hardy Blasberg, a 44-year-old engineer, said he usually met people by accident. When it was pointed out to him that this was a planned singles party, he appeared confused. "Oh, really? This is a singles night?" he said. "I didn't know, I thought I had just come out to have a good time."
Mr. Itzler has created his own slightly subversive singles fantasy for people in their 20's. He rounds up a large group of men and women (most too young to take the imminent prospect of marriage terribly seriously), charges them $50 and presides over a mock wedding reception. But first, there is the ceremony.
Guests' names go into two hats, one for men, one for women, and a bride and groom and an entire wedding party are drawn. The rest of the night is spent celebrating the union of two people who just met.
Call it a Generation X mixer. "Everyone likes to go to weddings," said Mr. Itzler. "People in the city are always looking for something new and creative to do."
 
PERFECT MATE SEEKS SAME

In the spirit of enterprise, mystery and creativity, there is always the old singles standard: the personal ad. Dr. Bonnie Eaker Weil, a Manhattan psychologist who specializes in relationship counseling, works with her patients on writing them.
She should know: she met her husband seven years ago through answering an ad in New York magazine that read, "Be my Guinevere. A truly romantic handsome dentist seeks a caring relationship with an attractive professional woman."
Dr. Eaker Weil started hitting the personal ads after a series of really bad dating-service dates. After three dates, one guy told her he wanted her to meet his mother. They ended up going to a mausoleum.
"There are a lot of desperate people out there," she said. "I tell my clients if they want to get married, they have to take it as seriously as if they were trying to get a master's degree. They have to work at it."
Here is how she tells her patients to write and screen the personals:
Looking to get married? Use the word commitment in your four-line text. Wary of "commitment phobic" men? Skip the ads that ask for beautiful women, or mention high heels and skirt lengths. Keep in mind that people lie about their age and looks.
"When people say that they are attractive, they usually aren't," she said. "If they say they are handsome or beautiful, it usually means they are attractive. When you read these things, you have to go down a notch."
 
A HAPPY ENDING

In the end, there is always the hope of happenstance romance.
Will Hermes, a 33-year-old editor, met his wife, Anne Galperin, on a hot summer afternoon waiting for the E train.
"The train was put out of service and everyone had to get out so we started chatting on the platform," he explained. Another train finally came, and he noticed that she got off at Forest Hills. The next night, he got off there, hoping she would show up, and sure enough, she did.
"I tried to act like I just happened to be there, which of course, she didn't buy," he said. "I mean, why would I just happen to be hanging out against a steel girder?" He bought her an ice cream and soon they were boarding the train together each morning.
Now that's a New York love story.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: RICHMOND HILL;
Coming Back Soon: Engine Company 294

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Mayor Guiliani is losing little time in delivering on a campaign pledge he made to the people of Richmond Hill.
Last year he stood in front of the firehouse on Jamaica Avenue and promised, if elected, to restore its Engine Company 294. Local leaders had assailed the fire company's elimination by the Dinkins administration in a 1990 economy move -- especially after two brothers died in a nearby fire a few days later. 
 Mr. Giuliani rolled up a big electoral margin in Richmond Hill. Although his maiden budget proposal -- which focuses primarly on the fiscal year that begins July 1 but also updates the current budget -- called for severe cutbacks at most city agencies, the Fire Department was spared, and Engine Company 294 was restored. The date for the opening has not been announced, but it could come by the end of this month.
"We're going to have a welcome-back party, and I'm going to pop the champagne," said Dario L. Centorcelli, president of the Coalition to Save Engine Company 294 and a past president of the Richmond Hill Block Association. The coalition organized rallies, candlelight vigils and other protests to garner support for the engine company's return.
The price tag for firehouse renovations and staffing for the engine company, as set forth in the Mayor's budget proposal, would be $432,000 through the end of June. The annual cost after that would be about $1 million. Sheldon S. Leffler, chairman of the City Council's Public Safety Committee, predicted that the council would support the fire company's restoration.
The fire company's backers have said that its closing had caused deadly delays in the response of firefighters to alarms. But Fire Department officials denied those charges, saying its crews arrived quickly from other firehouses. A state judge in 1991 upheld the elimination of the engine company, saying that the move had been based on "sound fire protection principles."
Richmond Hill's fire station has continued to have a ladder company, whose role is to enter a burning building, find the fire, rescue anyone inside and vent the structure. An engine company's role is to bring and deploy the hose, connecting it to a hydrant and directing the stream of water.
"We rank third highest in fire fatalities among the 14 community districts in Queens," said Mary Ann Carey, the district manager for Community Board 9, "so we're very excited about getting 294 back. It's been a long time coming."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LOWER EAST SIDE;
A Restoration Revived for Prayer And Posterity

BYLINE: By NINA REYES

 BODY:
For years, the roof did little to keep rain from sluicing down into the sanctuary of the Eldridge Street Synagogue, and in the 1950's congregants had to move into the basement. Upstairs, in the richly detailed sanctuary, illuminated by dozens of stained-glass windows, pigeons alone occupied the pews.
Today, the leaks have been repaired and the birds are gone, but gaping, blackened holes in the soaring ceiling, caused by water damage, still need to be patched and replastered. And only a tiny Orthodox congregation of 25 to 30 still worships at the Lower East Side temple, though it lies in what was once the largest Jewish community in the world. 
 Reincarnation of the synagogue, one of the city's oldest, has been slow. Structural restoration began with considerable fanfare almost a decade ago, but with the recession and other causes tugging at donors' pocketbooks, lack of funds has stalled work. Now, the Eldridge Street Project, the nonprofit group coordinating the renovation, has hired a consulting company, Pierpont & Wilkerson, to advise on fund-raising strategies as organizers prepare to start the second phase of restoration. The total needed to complete the renovation is estimated at $6.7 million.
The first phase, a $2 million effort that concentrated on stabilizing the building's structure, was completed in 1991. The work being planned now includes replacing plumbing, heating and electrical systems. The third and final phase involves restoring the sanctuary's trompe l'oeil works, its stained-glass windows, the enormous central chandelier and the congregation's sacred treasures.
At the heart of the restoration is the hope that the temple, which first opened for services in 1887, can be preserved not just as a place of worship but also as a monument to the early immigrant community.
"We're basically developing the foundations of a national institution," said Roberta Brandes Gratz, the project president. "So many people -- blacks, Asians, Hispanics -- have never thought of Jews as having a parallel history to theirs." As they walk through the temple and hear about its past, she said, "you can see them make the connection."
Ms. Gratz says she believes the century-old synagogue can offer new immigrants in the neighborhood, now engulfed by Chinatown, an opportunity to view their experience as part of the area's cultural heritage.
Each year nearly 10,000 people visit the temple, which lies between Division and Canal Streets, and children from nearby Public School 124 visit monthly as part of their social studies program.
"When we started people didn't even realize there was a Lower East Side left," Ms. Gratz said. "Now do you know how many tour groups go through the Lower East Side? We hadn't begun to appreciate our American Jewish history roots."

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
Luring Two Pigeons With One Bean

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
WHY did General Motors have such a hard time when it started marketing its Chevrolet Nova in Latin America? Quite simple. "No va" means "no go" in Spanish.
How do you kill two birds with one stone in German? You hit two flies with one swat. In Italian, you lure two pigeons with one bean. In Korean, you catch two fish with one rod. 
 It was to perform such linguistic and cultural pirouettes that TransImage International Communications was created nearly five years ago. From its headquarters in an old printing factory in TriBeCa, the company offers communication and marketing services to American corporations doing business anywhere in the world, everything from developing ads in foreign languages to refocusing brochures to vetting television commercials.
When Time-Warner decided to offer its first annual report in six languages, it turned to TransImage. When a major communications company wanted to make sure there were no cultural bloopers in its commercials, it had them checked by TransImage (which did notice that one ad, set in Hong Kong, had a brothel in the background). And when the state of Oregon wanted to market itself as an international tourist destination, it contracted with TransImage to produce a Pop Art-style video for Japanese and German audiences.
Indeed, TransImage is finding itself at the leading edge -- along with dozens of other highly specialized, internationally oriented service companies that now thrive in Manhattan -- as New York carves out a position as perhaps the world's most important center for global business.
"New York's roots in the international marketplace are especially significant today," wrote Hugh O'Neill and Mitchell M. Moss in "Reinventing New York: Competing in the Next Century's Global Economy," an influential 1991 economic study for the Urban Research Center at New York University. New York's prosperity, they concluded, will flow "primarily from its role as the leading -- although by no means unchallenged -- urban center in an increasingly integrated world economy."
For Magda Sole, 35, a co-owner of TransImage, American business is just beginning to learn a lesson already well established in most other countries. "If you are just buying, you can do that in any language," she says. "But if you are trying to sell someone something, the key is to communicate in your customer's language."
She knows what she is talking about. Ms. Sole, who speaks seven languages, was born in Barcelona and educated in Switzerland. She worked in Italy before coming to New York 10 years ago. Her partner, David Halvorsen, a 41-year-old American, spent several years studying and working in Sweden.
TransImage's staff reflects New York in all its cultural diversity. Maha See, its director of operations, is from Myanmar and has lived in Singapore. He speaks Burmese, Chinese and several other languages. One project manager, Frederic Autran, is French. Another, Naoko Okabe, came to New York from Tokyo as a student. (The staff of 16 does include a few native New Yorkers.)
Ms. Sole and Mr. Halvorsen, longtime friends, founded TransImage in 1990 after deciding they were dissatisfied with their jobs -- she with a translation company, he as a computer and communications manager for Merrill Lynch. They also felt the time was right for a company that could do more than provide standard translations.
TransImage opened its doors just as the regional economic downturn was turning its full fury on New York City. Nonetheless, the company has grown rapidly, recently moving from its old scruffy office on Franklin Street to a larger, custom-designed space in a Hudson Street building. Last year, TransImage billed more than $2.5 million to about 300 clients.
The way the company is run accounts, in part, for its ability to adapt to a changing world marketplace: TransImage is an exemplar of an emerging business trend that experts call the virtual company. In place of the standard organizational structure, in which everyone works out of the same office or is part of a more far-flung but fixed management system, TransImage operates flexibly with its small staff core. Via fax, E-mail and even old-fashioned telephone, that core coordinates the activities of nearly 350 freelance translators, editors, writers and designers around the world.
THERE is little place for traditional corporate culture at TransImage. Everyone works in a big open space divided into three areas -- for design, production and marketing. The few separate offices are shared as needed. It is difficult to tell where one job ends and another begins.
The company can draw on expertise in 80 different languages, as well as knowledge of a panoply of cultures.
In advising American companies on marketing in France, Mr. Autran, for example, discusses how to avoid offending French sensibilities.
"The French are enamored by American products, yet threatened by American cultural imperialism," he said. "We tell them how to avoid a faux pas that might cost them sales." Mr. Autran points to Eurodisney, just outside Paris, as one company that underestimated that problem.
Similarly, TransImage helped a United States auto parts company enter the Japanese market by developing a brochure modeled on advertising popular in that country. Rather than using glitzy American techniques, the brochure included long interviews with Japanese executives discussing the future of the industry. Only at the very end did the company even mention its own name.
Colors and images also mean different things in different cultures. Some carry particular messages. Green, the color of Mohammad's flag, must be used with care in Islamic countries, as must blue in nations with a Greek Orthodox population. Orange is sensitive in Buddhism. Yellow, which in America connotes cowardice (a yellow streak) or faithfulness (a yellow ribbon), carries religious and mystical overtones in India. In China, yellow represents both the Emperor and pornography.
Design features that may work in the United States, like bold elements with bright, trendy colors, could come on too strong in Japan, where black, white and pastel dominate.
Many American companies, with their assumption that English has become a universal language and American standards predominate, suffer when they fail to take such differences into account.
But cultural misunderstanding works in reverse, too. Mr. See remembers a trip to Japan at Christmas time. In a cafe, there was a sign: "Happy Birthday, Jesus Christ Superstar."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Foreign Investment Roars Into Bombay

BYLINE: By Sanjoy Hazarika

DATELINE: BOMBAY

 BODY:
SINCE November, one of the world's hottest stock markets has been the Bombay Stock Exchange, thanks to an avalanche of foreign investment and the gradual opening of what was once one of the world's most insular economies.
After soaring early last week to 4,162 points on the Bombay Sensitivity Index, the market closed Friday at 3,991 points, a 24 percent rise, in dollar terms, since the first of the year and a rise of almost 50 percent since November. Bombay's is the third best performing market after Brazil and Finland this year. 
 The exchange's last bull run, which drove the index to a record 4,500 in August 1992, was a consequence of fraudulent purchases on credit, which inflated prices. After that boom, laws permitting mutual funds and other foreign institutional investors to invest here were eased in September 1992. But it was not until last summer that substantial funds started arriving.
Their arrival reflected the fact that foreign investors were moving out of markets elsewhere, especially Japan, as well as growing confidence that the stock market scandal of 1992 was over and that the political and social turmoil in India had subsided. Extensive Hindu-Muslim riots in 1992 and 1993 appeared to have abated and Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao had overcome a challenge to his leadership.
Under prior Government rules, overseas investors were barred from playing the Indian markets. Under current regulations, they can put money into Indian companies through foreign institutional investors registered with India's Securities and Exchange Board as overseas investment funds.
One such fund, and the first available to American investors on the New York Stock Exchange, is the closed-end India Growth Fund, which invests primarily in Indian corporate stocks. It closed Friday at $26.625 a share, off from its 52-week high of $30.75 early last month. (Individual foreign investors still cannot directly invest in the market here and foreign institutions can't hold more than 24 percent of stock in a listed company.)
Stock analysts say an estimated $1 billion has surged into the market from overseas buyers in the past few months. In addition, Indian companies have raised more than $1 billion from international markets, all of that through Euro-issues, most of which were heavily oversubscribed. More than 40 Indian corporations are scheduled to float new Euro-issues this year, which may fetch another $4 billion to $5 billion.
A. N. Kolhatkar, the executive director of the Bombay Stock Exchange, said he hoped for an influx of $3 billion into the Indian market through foreign portfolio investors. "The market is buoyant and it is a natural rise although we have too much money chasing too few premium scrips," Mr. Kolhatkar said, referring to individual stocks.
Foreign institutional investors are also tapping the Indian market by raising money here. One example is the Morgan Stanley Growth Fund, the first onshore fund organized by a major foreign investment house. Aiming to raise about $100 million, the company was overwhelmed last month by some 1.4 million Indian investors who put about $300 million into the fund.
From a bare 2.5 million investors in 1980, the Bombay market has galloped to 22.5 million, as more and more Indians turned to it instead of trusting in such traditional investments as gold.
"Foreign investors are coming into India because of the recessions in the United States, Europe and Japan," said Hemendra Kothari, a leading stockbroker whose company, DSP Consultants, helped manage the Morgan Stanley issue. "This is a growing economy, with sophisticated and historic traditions of trading and business, it has a vast consumer class and there is quick appreciation on investments."
Keen to seize the opportunities here, other big foreign investors have also entered the market. They include Alliance Capital, Barclays Zoette Wedd, Fidelity Investments and Lloyd George Management.
As a result of financial measures aimed at liberalizing the economy -- devaluing the rupee, reducing regulations and red tape, opening the doors to foreign investment -- India's Gross National Product is growing at about 4.5 percent a year and inflation has fallen to single-digit levels.
One important hurdle for the market, however, is the lack of adequate custodial services to handle the growing number of transactions. The slow speed of settlement, a paper-intensive market and infrastructural strains are obvious.
Under Securities and Exchange Board rules, only the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank and Citibank qualify to handle custodial services for foreign companies purchasing shares. They have been overwhelmed with the scale of the paperwork, which is largely a consequence of the lack of computerization.
Board officials, concerned about a possible slowing of foreign investment, say it may take several weeks to resolve the problem and that more Indian and foreign banks must share the load. There is talk too of a National Depository, which could pave the way for paperless trading.
Yet major stockbrokers and analysts are bullish about the Indian market over the next few months.
"The index is bound to rise because there is bound to be further liberalization and once the economy opens up, the process is irreversible," said Radheshyam Goenka, one of India's leading stockbrokers.

 CORRECTION:
The World Markets column last Sunday about the Bombay Stock Exchange misstated the rules for banks' providing custodial services for foreign investment institutions. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission requires that any bank providing such services for investment firms and mutual funds have at least $200 million in capital. Under that guideline, several banks qualify, including Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, Citibank and Standard Chartered Bank.

HEADLINE: At Work;
After the Divorce, the Deluge

SERIES: Second in a series of articles on women and pensions.

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
THERE are so many ways for a woman to end up living in poverty when she is elderly that it seems almost churlish to focus on one particular group as more victimized than any other. Women may, for example, work at jobs in companies unlikely to offer significant retirement coverage and for wages so low that saving is virtually impossible. Or, to increase their income, they may juggle two or three low-paying jobs. Together, the jobs may add up to years of more-than-full-time employment and yield a living wage -- but no benefits and certainly no pension.
Or they may enter and leave the labor force as family duties ebb and flow, interrupting the long march toward qualifying for retirement plans, or lowering the amount they will receive. Or their husbands may die, leaving them with considerably less than the expected amount of retirement income. "Our life patterns are different than the life patterns of men," said Lou Glasse, president of the Washington-based Older Women's League. 
 All women may be at the mercy of their life patterns, but women who divorce in midlife or later are shoved with sudden force into a vulnerable subset of the female experience. It is women who have done what was expected of them and led the most exemplary middle-class lives who may be the least prepared to face the reduced circumstances in which they will very likely find themselves in old age.
A study last year of the economic status of older divorced women by the Brandeis University Policy Center on Aging painted a Lucian Freud-ish picture of the so-called golden years. The study noted that only 5 percent of divorced women living on Social Security and a private pension were poor, but it also revealed that only about a quarter of older women (age 62 and over) receive a pension in addition to Social Security. The median annual income of older divorced women is about $9,000 (in 1990 dollars) and has been growing at a below-inflation rate of 1.5 percent.
Both the study and experts in pensions and divorce say changes in matrimonial law since 1970, when California became the first state to allow "no-fault" divorce -- based on irreconcilable differences instead of designating a guilty party -- have generally not worked to the benefit of women. Where the courts once used alimony and tangible assets to punish and reward, they now focus on distributing property fairly. They have expanded the definition of property to include intangibles like potential earning power and pensions, but in the process women have come to receive alimony less often and for shorter periods of time. The first major study of California's no-fault divorce law, published in 1985, found that men's standard of living went up 42 percent in the first year after divorce and women's went down 73 percent.
The last thing women may be thinking about as they contemplate the sinking trend line of their post-divorce income is a pension that won't come home to roost for several years. "Women, especially if they have children, may have other priorities. They have short-term problems," said Anna Rappaport, a senior actuary in the Chicago office of William M. Mercer Inc., the human resource consultants. "It's easy to say I'm going to solve a 2-year problem at the expense of a 10-year problem."
COMPOUNDING the difficulty is the well-documented reluctance of some women to throw themselves wholeheartedly into financial and retirement planning. "Women don't know enough about the issues," Ms. Rappaport said. "When they make a settlement, they let the husbands keep their pensions without realizing the economic impact."
Women are often not well-served by their lawyers, who themselves may be unfamiliar with the intricacies of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Federal law covering private pensions; the Retirement Equity Act of 1984, which broadened the rights of divorced spouses, or the particular pension system relevant to their client. And some lawyers, according to several pension advocates, simply don't think about pensions and benefits, which are not automatically put into play when the marital assets go on the table during a divorce. They may not anticipate changes, like remarriage or the death of the ex-husband, that could nullify the agreement and leave the woman with nothing. Such lapses are not uncommon despite the fact that a traditional defined-benefit pension accrued during a lifetime career at one employer will often be the couple's largest asset, after their home.
WHAT is to be done? First, learn about your family finances and catalogue your potential pension assets. Think long and hard before handling a divorce without a lawyer. When you do engage a lawyer, make sure he or she is knowledgeable about pensions, especially if you fall into a special category, like one of the Federal retirement systems. And if you feel you might be wrecking your karma by raising these topics when you are not contemplating a divorce, or if you can't cope with them when you are, ponder for a moment living alone in old age on the $500 monthly Social Security payment women typically receive.

Strategies for Rising Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
IF the Federal Reserve thought it was being clear about the future of interest rates when it said on Feb. 4 that it was lifting the Federal funds rate by a quarter-point -- well, the markets bought the idea for a day.
On the Friday the rate rise was announced, stock prices dropped (wouldn't money be hightailing it to grab those higher yields?) and long-term Treasury funds lost a little over half a point (wouldn't they have to, to match the higher yields?). 
 But with the stock market bouncing back last week, the question became: Is the Fed's move really a long-awaited signal that the era of falling interest rates is over? If so, now what?
While the Fed's action was widely perceived as preventive, not a reaction to rising inflation, "If the economy continues to strengthen, this will be the first of many blows to come," said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, in Chicago.
That's why many investment advisers say now is a good time for income investors to review their strategies.
Most advisers recommend that those in short-term bond funds stay put. "We haven't moved clients out of short- or short-intermediate funds, because we're still operating under the premise that rates won't be rising that quickly," said Steven B. Enright, an investment adviser in Rivervale, N.J.
That doesn't mean investors in short-term bond funds will escape unscathed should rates rise more. "You'll have some price pressure on net asset value, but total return should be positive because there's only so much that you can lose in short-term funds," Mr. Rekenthaler said.
As for long-term bonds, the case is less clear. Some economists say inflation is licked; others say inflation will pick up as the economy recovers. That leaves one thing sure: The uncertainty will produce volatility in the long-term bond markets.
Investors who plan to hold shares 10 years or more and can handle the risk can reap higher yields, Mr. Rekenthaler said. He likes the Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond Fund, which yielded an annualized 6.4 percent in January. But most investors would be better off in funds that have shorter maturities and would not be hit as hard by rising rates. Mr. Enright likes the Stein Roe Income Fund and Pimco Total Return.
Many advisers are turning away from United States bonds and looking for income elsewhere. "We don't see domestic investment-grade bonds as a good place to be in 1994," given their extraordinary returns over the last five years, said Craig Litman, an investment adviser in San Francisco.
Instead, he recommends junk bond funds. "We believe the economy will be stable and slow-growing, and inflation won't be a threat over the next year," he said. Even so, "a blip up in rates will have a greater impact on domestic investment-grade bonds." Mr. Litman expects junk bond funds to yield at least 8 percent. His two favorites: Pimco High-Yield Fund and Financial Bond Shares.
Because of their relative insensitivity to interest rates, junk bonds are also the choice of Eric M. Kobren, who edits Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter for Fidelity funds. He recommends Fidelity Spartan High-Income for investors who can meet the $10,000 minimum investment.
Bob Markham, an Edina, Minn., investment adviser, calls junk bonds "the best bet for income investors." When the Fed announced its rate increase, "stocks, bonds and utilities got trashed, but junk bonds stayed steady," he said. "It's the same scenario I expect to be repeated throughout 1994." Mr. Markham likes Northeast Investors Trust and Federated High-Yield.
The year is also shaping up as a good one for Ginnie Mae funds, Mr. Rekenthaler said, if rates keep rising moderately. He likes the Benham GNMA Income Fund, which yielded an annualized 6 percent in January.
Real estate investment trust funds are another good source of income, Mr. Litman said, with yields of 6 to 8 percent and capital gains potential. "Even assuming no appreciation in the underlying properties," he said, "higher cash flow from rising rents will help earnings and prices." His favorites are the Cohen and Steers REIT Fund and the Fidelity REIT Fund.
On one point the advisers are nearly unanimous: Income investors should diversify their portfolios overseas, where rates have fallen, but remain above domestic rates. But it is important to find funds that can hedge currency risk, and managers who can do so effectively, Mr. Enright said. He recommends Scudder International Bond and T. Rowe Price International Bond.
Because international bonds behave differently from domestic bonds, they lower overall portfolio risk. Nonetheless, he advises capping the foreign fixed-income portion at 10 to 15 percent of the total portfolio.
Mr. Markham would go as high as 20 percent, because "We don't want the entire portfolio subject to what Mr. Greenspan says," he said, referring to Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman. Because of the risks of overseas investing, he likes SoGen Overseas, an equity fund with large cash holdings and very cautious management.
Even income investors should own equities as a hedge against inflation. Utility funds may not be a good idea anymore, the advisers say, but try conservative, high-dividend stock funds. Mr. Markham recommends Lindner Dividend and Wellesley Income.

HEADLINE: THE MYTH OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

 BODY:
Although single-shot efforts at housing or education or health care can make important contributions to a better life, they cannot alone be effective in transforming the dreadful conditions at the bottom of our society. What is required is literal transformation of these dysfunctional neighborhoods into fit places to live and raise families.
 To this end, the Enterprise Foundation is working with residents of the Sandtown neighborhood of Baltimore (10,300 people, in 72 square blocks -- 44 percent jobless, the center of violent crime), in an effort to transform these conditions -- and all at the same time. The project is being watched across the country as a potential model.

HEADLINE: Efforts to Stem Violence in the Workplace

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

 BODY:
A Disgruntled employee at a Westchester-based manufacturing company began warning his supervisor that he would come to work one day with his semiautomatic weapon and go on a shooting spree. The man, who appeared increasingly unkempt and whose behavior had become progressively more threatening, assured his co-workers that his aim was good because he had served in the Vietnam War.
A manager at a different corporation in the county was being stalked by one of her employees. The harassment began with a call to the manager's home, but the campaign soon escalated. The employee became more menacing -- showing up at the manager's house, following her around town and tracking her down on vacation.
 HB>Incident in Mount Vernon
 Both of these incidents were defused by corporate employee-assistance programs before they could explode into violence. The two companies involved would discuss the cases only on condition of anonymity. Several weeks ago in Mount Vernon, however, a workplace dispute ended in tragedy. 
 William Santiago, 22, of Yonkers, was dismissed in late January from his job at Steve's Market, a grocery chain with stores in Yonkers and Mount Vernon. Two days later, he attempted to kill his former boss by spraying him with gasoline and setting him on fire. Landers Chambers, 51, owner of the market, was severely burned but survived the attack. Mr. Santiago, the former employee, was fatally burned in the incident. Police said it was unclear whether his death was accidental or a suicide.
All three incidents illustrate what is increasingly recognized as a serious cause for concern -- violence in the workplace. Last year, a study called "Fear and Violence in the Workplace," conducted by the Northwestern National Life Insurance Company of Minneapolis, reported that from July 1992 to July 1993, more than 2 million Americans were victims of physical attack on the job. An additional 6 million workers were threatened and 16 million were harassed, the report said.
"Violence is spilling into the workplace," said Peggy Lawless, research project director for Northwestern. "It is pervasive. Our figures showed that chances are one in four that a worker may be attacked, threatened or harassed on the job next year."
The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, based in Cincinnati, released a study calling workplace homicide a "serious public health problem." During the 1980's, the institute documented 7,603 homicides in American workplaces. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that in 1992, there were 138 murders in the workplace in the New York City area.
 
Figures Are Misleading
 Those figures do not distinguish between murders committed in the course of other criminal activities, like robberies and rapes of employees, and outbreaks of violence that occur between co-workers on the job. In other words, they include the taxi driver who is robbed and murdered on the job as well as the laid-off employee who exacts revenge on his supervisor. Experts say that the vast majority of violence on the job is still related to crime from the outside, particularly robbery. But they warn that employee-to-employee violence is on the rise.
At a recent symposium on workplace violence sponsored by the United States Postal Service in Washington, Dr. Dennis L. Johnson, president of a management consulting firm in Stuart, Fla., who is considered an expert on the subject, said that violence within the workplace -- in which an attacker has a known relationship with co-workers, supervisors or customers -- was one of the fastest-growing crimes in the country.
While employers in Westchester have long examined ways to keep workers safe on the job by reducing crime from the outside -- by hiring security guards, using employee identification cards, installing closed-circuit television, maintaining well-lighted parking lots, and the like -- they are now being forced to pay closer attention to the type of violence that may be induced in the workplace itself.
"We are getting called into more and more in-house situations where there is the potential for a violent outcome," said Lise Mayers, who is based in Purchase as area manager for Personal Performance Consultants, an employee-assistance company that provides counseling services for more than a dozen corporate clients. It was Personal Performance that was called in to handle the situations involving the employee making threats to co-workers and the employee stalking his manager.
 
A More Violent Society
 The county government is also starting to look at the problem.
"Obviously people are concerned about the trends in violence at work and recognizing that this is something you have to be aware of and knowledgeable about -- even if it hasn't happened to you directly," said Pat Doyle, director of alcohol and drug abuse services for the County Department of Community Mental Heath. "You look at it from the preventive perspective as well as if it happens, what is your protocol about it?"
Violence at work is pervasive enough that trade journals for employee-assistance professionals run articles like "When Employees Make Good on Bad Intentions" and "After the Incident . . . Intervention," with tips on treating post-traumatic stress disorders. One advertisement offered employers a three-hour videotape on workplace violence, which covered "traits in the violent offender, assessment procedures, hostage considerations" and other subjects.
Experts who study workplace violence attribute its increasing prevalence to a number of factors. First, they say it is a reflection of a more violent society, particularly the availability of guns. According to Niosh, 75 percent of workplace homicides are committed with firearms.
Second, the pervasiveness of drugs and alcohol contribute to the instability of the work force. In some instances, domestic violence migrates into the office. An abusive husband, for example, can track down his wife at work.. But most recently, it is the stress and potential violence triggered by the wave of corporate layoffs that has become the focus of employers.
"With downsizing throughout corporate America, there is this overwhelming sense of insecurity and fear," said Dr. Estherann Grayzel, corporate medical director for Nynex, which has corporate offices in Manhattan and White Plains. "When someone feels out of control, that he no longer controls his destiny -- and there's no support system in place -- there is the potential for trouble. It's the loners who are most likely to explode."
 
Layoffs a Major Contributor
 Ms. Lawless, who conducted the study for Northwestern, said that her research revealed that layoffs were a "major contributor" to violence in the workplace. In Westchester, as elsewhere, an entire corporate culture has developed over making layoffs as least traumatic as possible. One caveat is never to dismiss anyone on a Friday because they will then be alone over the weekend while trying to absorb the blow. ("Frequently, it's not at the point when someone is fired that you have the outburst -- it has to percolate a little," Ms. Mayers said. "Someone is apt to explode a few days later.")
Dr. Grayzel said Nynex makes every effort to be sensitive to employees during terminations with in-house discussion groups to teach skills for coping and preparing for change. At International Business Machines, with corporate headquarters in Armonk, every manager receives training on how to handle layoffs as well as how to handle an employee who is having professional or personal difficulties. Both I.B.M. and Nynex make extensive use of their employee-assistance programs, which can counsel employees on how to handle stress, drug- and alcohol-abuse problems and other mental health issues. Termination benefits often include extended access to those services.
So ingrained are layoffs in the corporate culture now that counseling is offered at both companies to "survivors," those who have avoided the most recent wave of cutbacks. Scott Brooks, manager of human resources issues at I.B.M., said that such employees often experience "survivor's guilt" because they still have a job and former co-workers do not and that they also suffer from anxiety over being the next to go.
 
Threat-Assessment Teams
 Of course, the vast majority of people who are laid off do not respond with threats or violence. But when such a situation arises, it is taken seriously. I.B.M., which declined to identify any specific incidents, acknowledged that it has developed threat-assessment teams to cope with potential violence.
If a threat is made, staff members from the human resources, security, medical and legal departments convene to evaluate the problem and make a judgment on how to intervene appropriately and when to call in law enforcement agencies.
"Instead of playing ostrich, companies have to deal with this," Ms. Mayers of Personal Performance Consultants said. "In Westchester, especially with the economy, we haven't seen all the fallout yet."

HEADLINE: Some Districts Planning to Hire New Teachers

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
FACED with increased student enrollments and growing numbers of teachers eligible for retirement, many school districts are planning to hire teachers in the new school year.
For the first time in three years districts are beginning to rehire or replace teachers who were laid off as a result of losses of state aid and budget cuts. 
 Some districts have also offered incentives to encourage teachers to retire early and, in some cases, are trying to save money by hiring younger, less experienced teachers.
The Island has 127 districts, with 56 in Nassau County and 71 in Suffolk. Not all districts plan to hire teachers next year. The districts planning to hire are mostly those with retirement incentives for teachers and those that have had significant increases in enrollment, particularly in the elementary grades and largely from students from overseas.
Over the last three years Long Island lost 5,000 jobs in education, said Dr. Bruce Brodsky, president of the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association. The cuts included teachers, administrators, support workers like guidance counselors and psychologists, custodians and lunchroom aides, Dr. Brodsky said, adding:
"Most school districts are now in the midst of developing their budgets for next year. They are looking at projected enrollment, staffing and the questions of what class size does the board of ed want to maintain? What courses will be offered next year? What has been mandated by the state for us to do? What services did we cut that we can possibly restore? And, finally, how many personnel are needed to achieve those goals?"
Dr. Brodsky added that for many districts two priorities would be rehiring staff members like psychologists, social workers and guidance counselors, as well as multilingual teachers to work with growing populations of students who do not speak English.
 
The Decline 'Is Over'
 For teaching candidates seeking positions on the Island, job prospects are beginning to brighten, the Superintendent in Hewlett-Woodmere, Dr. Bert Nelson, said. "The long period of enrollment decline that followed the postwar years is over," he said. "Most Long Island school districts are experiencing increasing enrollment, beginning first on the elementary level, and this will result in increasing teaching positions.
"Parallel to that is a maturing staff eligible for retirement. As a cost-saving measure a number of districts have begun to offer various local retirement incentives, to get people to think about retiring early. This creates more opportunities for people seeking teaching positions."
Teachers are eligible to retire with benefits at 55. Some districts and some states have added incentives to encourage teachers to retire, according to Dr. Edward Broderick, president of the Suffolk County Council of Superintendents and Superintendent of the Westhampton Beach Schools.
"In Florida, for example," Dr. Broderick said, "retirement incentives have saved the state billions of dollars. While several other states have followed Florida's example, New York has not offered any statewide plan, and it is up to local districts to decide whether or not to offer retirement incentives. If the state does come out with a policy it will negate the plans of individual school districts."
Westhampton Beach has a $25,000 incentive for teachers 55 and older. At the end of the school year 15 teachers out of a staff of 120 will leave.
"Next year 23 teachers will be eligible for retirement," Dr. Broderick said. "Many will take advantage of the incentive and will bale out. With 50 percent of our teachers on the maximum pay steps receiving the top salary, their retirement will be a great cost savings to the district."
 
Advantages of Younger Teachers
 Districts are obligated by contractual seniority and recall rights to rehire teachers who were laid off at their old salaries. To fill many remaining positions districts are looking to hire teachers at the lowest pay steps.
Education officials see financial advantages in hiring younger, less experienced teachers, said Dr. James Ruck, Superintendent of the Sachem Schools. "When an experienced employee making a salary of $70,000 retires and you can replace him with someone on step one making $30,000, it's a big financial help," Dr. Ruck said.
The Herricks district in New Hyde Park has had a 30 percent turnover over the last five years, mostly from retired teachers, said an assistant to the superintendent, Michael Klopfer. The district has a $25,000 retirement incentive and starting salaries of $32,900 for a teacher with a bachelor's degree and $38,000 with a master's.
"For next year we're looking to hire between 10 and 15 new teachers out of a staff of about 300," he said. "The trend in this district, as in many others, is to recruit quality teachers on lower steps."
 
Starting at $30,000
 "In Westhampton Beach," Dr. Broderick added, "for years we went for experienced teachers so we didn't have to break them in. Under our contract we could hire up to step 10. But in the last three years every new teacher has been hired at step 1.
"Many applicants with four years' experience are willing to come in at step 1 so as to get the job. With so many teachers who have been excessed, many are willing to accept a lower salary. It's a buyer's market. Our starting salary with a bachelor's degree is about $30,000. If we can't fill the positions then we go higher."
Administrators say every available position attracts hundreds of applicants. In Herricks, Mr. Klopfer said, 300 to 500 people apply for each elementary-school position.
In Rockville Centre 400 to 600 applications are received for each elementary position, said Superintendent William Johnson, who is also president of the Nassau County Council of Superintendents. Salary negotiations are dictated by the levels of education and years of experience, Dr. Johnson said, adding:
"Level of education is not negotiable. We are bound by contract. A candidate with a master's degree can't agree to accept a salary based on a bachelor's degree. But years of experience credited to salaries are negotiable. Applicants with five years of experience, for example, can accept a starting salary of step 2."
Among the many candidates, the pools are smaller in specific areas, Dr. Johnson added. Opportunities are greater in the fields of advanced science and mathematics, technology, home and career skills, library science and speech therapy.
Some districts have developed programs to help new teachers. This year Herricks started a mentoring program to help train 15 new teachers. Mr. Klopfer said the program offered informal support by experienced teachers. The average time spent with the new teachers, before and after school and on their lunch hours, has been 30 hours. The program has cost $6,000.
Herricks has also introduced "collegial circles," groups to discuss topics like curriculums and other academic programs. "They are a cost-effective way to address teacher isolation and allow teachers to provide support for one another," Mr. Klopfer explained.
In Hempstead assistants have been hired to work with teachers in the classrooms. Superintendent Eddy Bayardelle said: "These paraprofessionals are trained in the school district and encouraged to get their teaching degrees. More and more we are hiring them as our new teachers. It's an economic way to hire new teachers at the entry level who know the expectations of the district, thereby guaranteeing the quality we're looking for."
State-mandated programs will also affect many districts. One new requirement is to provide transition services for special-education students between 18 and 22 who graduate from high school, said Dr. Johnson. That may increase the need for special-education teachers, he said.
"On the Federal level," Dr. Brodsky added, "the big word in special education is 'inclusion.' As we bring more handicapped kids into the classroom we'll need more special-ed teachers and additional support staff. Although New York has not yet mandated full inclusion we're moving in that direction."
 
Districts With Few Openings
 Not all districts are looking for new teachers. For districts without retirement incentives, the turnover is minimal, said Superintendent Carole Hankin in Syosset. She added that her district would have few openings next year.
In Rockville Centre, another district without a retirement-incentive package, there will be no new teaching positions. But the staff will be redistributed to fill whatever gaps arise, said Dr. Johnson.
"School districts tend to go in cycles," Dr. Ruck said. "When other districts were facing declining enrollment and cutting back their teaching staff Sachem was still growing. Now, while many districts are hiring new teachers, we're on the other side of the cycle, facing a slight decline in population and not hiring. In a few years, as enrollment across Long Island continues to climb, more teacher hiring is expected."
The key word for most districts is balance, Dr. Nelson said. "We're all struggling with our budgets," he added, "trying to maintain and improve our services in an economy that hasn't turned around fully. In the face of increasing enrollment, that's a challenge and a half."

HEADLINE: Statistics Offer No Solace To Those in Jobless Line

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
FOR Yvonne Harris, a former office manager and bookkeeper who was waiting in line with several hundred other unemployed workers at a State Department of Labor office here last week, it was little consolation that many of the country's economic indicators were signaling an end to the recession.
"All I know is my story," said Ms. Harris, who lives in White Plains, "and I've gone from being a Cinderella to a Raggedy Ann: I've worked my whole life, and now this." 
 In the nation's capital, the latest figures showed that the Consumer Confidence Index surged for the third time in a row in January to 83.2 percent and factory orders rose 1.2 percent in December, the fifth increase in a row. President Clinton and economic forecasters greeted the news as more evidence that the country was pulling itself out of a long, hard slump.
But Juan Carlos, an unemployed chef from Port Chester, viewed matters from a different perspective. "We don't care what they are saying in Washington because you can see with your own eyes what's happening here," said Mr. Carlos, who was waiting for his benefits as the long line at the Labor Department office snaked through a hallway and down a flight of stairs. "This line just keeps growing, and people are losing heart."
 
Benefits for Only 26 Weeks
 Although jobless figures for Westchester in December, the most recent available, showed that unemployment in the county had dropped to 4.7 percent from 5.6 percent for the same month in 1992, Margaret Herrera, manager of the office on Prospect Street here, said that statistics notwithstanding, she was busier than ever processing claims.
Also, the Federal Government last week ended its extended unemployment insurance program, making matters more difficult for those out of work for long periods. Workers once again are limited to collecting benefits for 26 weeks only.
"What we're seeing is more frustration among the unemployed, especially those who were in white-collar jobs," Ms. Herrera said. "Companies continue to downsize, and there's not a lot of rehiring going on."
 
Better Prospects Elsewhere
 James Mason, a former sales and marketing employee for a large Westchester firm who was also at the unemployment office, said he had been sending out a steady stream of resumes since he lost his job two months ago. "Still no work," said Mr. Mason, who lives in Stamford. "It's taking its toll on me."
Others waiting in line were hopeful that the national trends might soon trickle down to the local economy, although one unemployed man, a former white-collar worker who agreed to be interviewed only on the condition that his name not be used, said, "I'm getting ready to pack up my bags and move to another state."
Indeed, job prospects are better in most parts of the country than in the Northeast, and it may be months before the region pulls out of its slump, economic analysts said.
"Nationally, we are starting to see the leading indicators -- factory orders and the work week -- improve," said Joseph J. Kozlowski, a regional economist for the State Department of Labor. "But locally, we haven't seen gains in employment, and that's the way we measure the local economy."
While the State Department of Labor reported a drop in the jobless rate, it also released figures showing that from December 1992 to the same month last year, the county lost 7,200 jobs.
 
'Not the True Story'
 "The low unemployment rate is terribly misleading," said Thomas J. Spitznas, an economist in Mount Vernon who specializes in trends and forecasts. "What we are really seeing in Westchester is a dropout in the labor force: discouraged workers.
"If you have 20 people and 2 are unemployed, you have a 10 percent unemployment rate. But if the next month, one of those workers gives up and stops looking for a job, you officially have only one person out of 19 not working, and the jobless rate drops to 5.2 percent," he said. "So the headlines read, 'Major Improvement in Labor Market,' but that's not the true story."
Mr. Spitznas said Westchester's problems were not only the result of continued downsizing in the corporate sector. He blamed, in part, "the cost of doing business downstate."
"When a company's income is not growing, things like workmen's compensation in the state, the cost of living and local property taxes become very painful," he said.
Noreen L. Preston, an economist with the County Office of Economic Development, said new job growth in New York City may relieve some of the unemployment problems locally.
"Once New York City gets going, Westchester generally follows suit," she said. "But the big companies' layoffs here are still hurting us. It's hard to counteract the major headliners like Nynex."
Nynex, which has its corporate center in White Plains, announced last month that it would cut up to 12,000 jobs, or about 25 percent of its work force in New York State, by the end of 1996. The large telecommunications company said that about 1,100 workers in Westchester, about one-fifth of its work force here, could be affected by staff reductions.
Another major employer of local workers, I.B.M., has seen its work force in the county drop from more than 14,000 in 1986 to about 7,500 last year, said Scott Brooks, a company spokesman.
Cutbacks at I.B.M. and other Fortune 500 companies in the county are also reflected in the high office vacancy rates being reported -- 35 percent in the main business district of White Plains at the end of 1993, Ms. Preston said.
Meanwhile, figures from the State Department of Labor confirmed what people waiting in line for their unemployment checks already knew. The statistics showed that the manufacturing sector of the county's economy lost 2,700 jobs in a one-year period from December 1992 to the same month last year. The service-producing sector -- which includes wholesale and retail trade, transportation and public utilities and finance and real estate -- lost 3,600 jobs for the period. There were another 800 jobs lost in construction and mining.
 
A Longer Work Week
 By contrast, general merchandise stores in the county -- department stores like Bradlees, for example -- saw an increase of 700 jobs, and health services recorded 400 new jobs for the period.
The work week in Westchester, however, grew longer over the year, with manufacturing reporting that it had gone to 41.9 hours last December -- the longest work week on record -- from 40.5 the year before, said Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist with the State Department of Labor. Workers in the transportation industry, for example, recorded seven hours overtime during a sample work week.
But while employers have been adding hours, they have also been cautious about rehiring -- perhaps reflecting a lack of confidence about the long-range outlook for the economy, Mr. Surdey said.
One fallout from the layoffs is that many workers are toiling longer and harder to hold on to the jobs they have, especially as they witness fellow workers join the ranks of the unemployed. The work load that was shared by many has fallen on the shoulders of the relatively few left after downsizings.
 
Smaller Staffs Under Pressure
 Herbert Levitt, 56, an art director from Larchmont who works for a Manhattan advertising agency, lost his job last year but recently found full-time employment. Grateful to be working again, he said he was putting in more hours and taking work home on weekends.
"I've watched mergers and firings in this industry and have seen people around me lose their jobs," Mr. Levitt said. "And you can't say anymore, 'I'll see you Monday,' because that attitude doesn't hold in a tight job market."
Mr. Surdey cautioned that the smaller staffs responsible for keeping up the output "can't go on doing that forever, because they are going to get burned out."
Looking ahead, the economists said that the outlook is not promising for unemployed workers trying to retrain for new fields, especially if they expect to re-enter the work force at their former salaries.
"When displaced workers retrain or go into business for themselves, statistics show they don't get back on the same income track," Mr. Spitznas said. "There is always the occasional success story, like when someone invents something, but that doesn't happen too often."

HEADLINE: Supplies Of Blood Decline

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
While many parts of the country are reporting that blood supplies have dropped to the lowest level since World War II, blood bank officials in Westchester and the greater New York region say they have been able to maintain a two-to-three-day supply.
"The blood supply is a little soft," said Vivien Epstein, an associate administrator for Hudson Valley Blood Services in Elmsford. "We should have a five-day supply, but we are O.K." The organization supplies blood and blood products to about 50 hospitals in the Bronx, Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Rockland, Orange, Ulster and Sullivan Counties. 
 Ms. Epstein added: "Sometime in November, we had a five-day supply, but after that it dropped off, as it traditionally does over the holidays. December is usually the most difficult time for us."
Even though the shortage was not being called an emergency, the organization was nevertheless "concerned," Ms. Epstein said.
 
Layoffs Have Affected Supply
 In January, the normal after-holiday rebound in the number of blood donations did not occur, most likely because of severe weather and flu outbreaks, officials said.
Blood supplies have also been affected by the weak economy and job layoffs. "We have been hard hit by the downsizing," Ms. Epstein said. "Traditionally we depend very heavily on the business community. It's had a domino effect, because people's priorities change. If you are looking for a job, or worried about the one you have, giving blood is not the first thing on your mind."
Also, with a leaner work force, there have been fewer donors in the companies where Hudson Valley Blood Services holds its regular drives.
Donations from people 17 and older in the Hudson Valley fell to 5,000 units of blood, about 1,000 short of the goal last month. Ms. Epstein said that from April 1993 to this March, Hudson Valley Blood Services would need 73,125 units.
 
Million Units a Year
 At the New York Blood Center in Manhattan, the parent organization for Hudson Valley Blood Services, Andrea Smith, a spokeswoman, said that in the region there was a two-and-a-half-day supply of blood, or about 4,500 units.
"We are a little bit short of Type O," she said. "Hospitals like to keep that on hand." The center also has a low inventory of Type B.
The New York Blood Center, which supplies parts of New Jersey, all of Long Island and the Hudson Valley region, is the largest blood center in the country, distributing about a million units of blood each year to 260 hospitals. The American Red Cross, which collects and processes about 50 percent of the blood transfused in the United States, does not serve this area.
The chronically ill -- those with cancer, heart conditions and terminal illnesses -- are the primary recipients of blood transfusions, Ms. Smith said. Chemotherapy patients, especially, need blood platelets, which aid clotting following treatment.
 
Bone Marrow Processing
 Blood plasma, the liquid portion of blood, contains mostly water but also hasproteins and other nutrients needed by burn victims and hemophiliacs.
Red cells, the third component of blood, are often needed during surgery and for accident victims.
While most donors give whole blood, some are apheresisdonors. During an apheresis process, platelets or plasma are processed out for transfusions, and the remaining components of the blood are returned to the body.
In addition to whole blood and apheresis donations, Hudson Valley Blood Services also performs bone marrow processing and storage, tissue typing for the National Marrow Donor Program and rare blood typing.
Ms. Epstein said that fear of contracting diseases like AIDS has deterred some potential donors. But she explained that all materials used to draw and collect blood are sterile and are used only once before they are discarded.
 
Quick Replenishing
 It is estimated that 95 percent of the population will require a blood transfusion or blood product at least once, and 1 out of every 10 people admitted to hospitals require blood, according to Hudson Valley Blood Services. Yet fewer than 4 percent of the population donate, while 40 percent in the region are considered qualified to do so.
After a donation, the body replenishes the liquid portion of the blood within 72 hours, and the red cells within 2 to 4 weeks. A donor can give whole blood every 56 days, while apheresis donations can be made as often as every 72 hours.
Anyone in good health between the ages of 17 and 76 who weighs at least 110 pounds can give blood. Those over 76 can give with the written consent of a doctor.
Those interested in giving blood should call (800) 843-2566 for information on times and places. Donors are asked to bring picture identification with them.

HEADLINE: POP VIEW;
Black or White? Labels Don't Always Fit

BYLINE: By Michael Eric Dyson; Michael Eric Dyson is the author of "Reflecting Black: African-American Cultural Criticism."

 BODY:
AT ITS BEST, POP MUSIC PRESSES an anxious ear to American society, amplifying our deepest desires and fears. At times, too, pop invites us to listen to ourselves in ways forbidden by cultural debates where complexity is sacrificed for certainty. In this vein, the reascent to the top of the charts of Mariah Carey's newest album, "Music Box," signals more than her musical dominance.
Part of Ms. Carey's significance -- and undoubtedly the sharpest controversy around her -- has nothing to do with the singer's musical gifts. Instead it derives from the confusion and discomfort that her multiracial identity provokes in an American culture obsessed with race. Though she has made no secret that she is biracial (her mother is Irish-American, her father is a black Venezuelan), Ms. Carey's candor evokes clashing responses from fans and critics. Some see her statement of mixed heritage as a refusal to bow to public pressure to choose whether she is black or white. But in light of the "one drop" rule -- where a person is considered black by virtue of having one drop of black blood, a holdover from America's racist past -- many conclude that the issue of racial identity, for Ms. Carey and other interracial people, is settled. 
 To make matters more complex, Ms. Carey's vocal style is firmly rooted in black culture. It features a soaring soprano and an alternately ethereal and growling melisma that pirouettes around gospel-tight harmonies. So if she's not clearly black yet sings in a black style, is she singing black music? And what difference does it make? Without even trying, Ms. Carey's music sparks reflections about how race continues to shape what we see and hear.
Partly what's at stake is the messy, sometimes arbitrary, politics of definition and categorization. What makes music "black music," and who can be said to legitimately perform it? Consider the fiery fusion of rock, soul and blues performed by Lenny Kravitz (like Ms. Carey, the child of an interracial marriage) and Terence Trent D'Arby, or the socially conscious hard rock of the group Living Color. Is theirs black music? Though the answer is often negative, the roots of their music can be traced to black cultural influences, from Howlin' Wolf to Jimi Hendrix. The difficulty of fixing labels to what Mr. Kravitz, Mr. D'Arby and Living Color do highlights the racial contradictions at the center of contemporary pop music.
Behind this painful, often protracted struggle to get at the "original article" is what can only be termed the anxiety of authenticity. Such quests are more than academic for black folk because of the history of appropriation and abuse of black musical styles by white performers and producers. While black artists like King Oliver and Chuck Berry initiated musical innovations from jazz to blues-based rock, the public recognition and economic benefits due them evaporated, while derivative white artists like Benny Goodman and Elvis Presley reaped huge artistic and financial rewards.
Curiously enough, the debate over authenticity lies at the heart of hip-hop, though irreverence and transgression are staples of rap culture. But authenticity, even in a genre as closely identified with black culture as rap, does not strictly follow the rules of race. For instance, while the white rapper Vanilla Ice was greeted within hip-hop with derision because he came off as a white boy trying to sound black, white rap groups like Third Bass and House of Pain have been enthusiastically embraced because of their "legitimate" sounds and themes. Conversely, black rap artists like Hammer and Fresh Prince have been widely viewed as sellouts because of their music's pop propensities.
An even thornier issue is the belief in many black communities that some artists obscure their racial roots in a natural but lamentable response to a racist environment. As a result, they benefit from being black (given the extraordinary popularity of black music) but do not identify with the black people who support them before they discover a crossover market. In the extreme, this circumstance leads to the ideal of the pan-ethnic, omni-racial artist, an exotic fantasy whose energy derives from an implicit denial of the inherent value of simply being black.
Still, as the saying goes, the finger pointed at artists implies several others pointed back at ourselves. American culture is redefining itself through bitter debates about "identity politics," "multiculturalism" and "universalism." Music cannot be naively expected to triumph over social differences. Because of the schmaltz that often passes for conscience in pop, the quest for transcendence -- whether of race or, for that matter, sex and class -- is often hindered by sappy appeals to brotherhood and oneness. What such impulses reflect is a desire to fix what has gone wrong in a culture intolerant of difference.
THE ANXIETY of authenticity about what and who is really black in pop music is proportional to just how increasingly difficult it is to know the answer. As multiracial unions of sex and sound proliferate, the "one drop" rule may lose its power. And, as cultural theorists are now proud to announce, race is not merely a matter of biology but an artifice of cultural convention. Such a construction is meant to establish and reinforce the power of one group over another. This view does not mean that black music is solely the product of perception. Nor does it mean that black music's power must be diluted to a generic form. What it does suggest, however, is that the meaning of race, like the art it molds, is always changing.
In the end, what Ms. Carey's career may teach us is that paranoia about purity is the real enemy of black cultural expression, which at its best has been characterized by the amalgamation of radically different elements. It is precisely in stitching together various fabrics of human and artistic experience that black musical artists have expressed their genius and grit.

HEADLINE: SUITS CHALLENGING REDRAWN DISTRICTS THAT HELP BLACKS

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 13

 BODY:
A year after Congressional redistricting sent a record number of minority lawmakers to Capitol Hill, newly created black Congressional districts face a rising tide of court challenges that may threaten those electoral gains.
At stake are not just the future of the districts and the representatives being challenged. At issue is a tangle of politics and race that has the potential to affect the nature of districts, from city councils to Congress, and the makeup of Congress at a time when President Clinton is trying to maintain the fragile margin of support in the House that provided him with legislative victories in his first year in office. 
 The challenges stem from a United States Supreme Court ruling last June in Shaw v. Reno, a case that challenged a predominantly black district that snakes across 160 miles of North Carolina. The state, defending the district's shape, said that the 12th Congressional District had an urban identity that went beyond race and that it had complied with Federal dictates to enhance black representation in a state that, before 1992, had not had a black member of Congress for nearly a century.
 
'Racial Gerrymandering'
 But the Supreme Court ordered a district court to review the contention by the plaintiffs, who are white voters in the 12th District, that the district, which stretches from Durham to Charlotte, is a form of "racial gerrymandering" that isolates black voters in an artificial entity whose only justification is race.
Seven months later, the ruling is being used by some disgruntled white voters and politicians to challenge electoral districts from North Carolina to California, from hospital boards to Congressional seats.
"Everybody is raising this Shaw v. Reno argument from the smallest town you can think of, right on up to Congress," said Laughlin McDonald, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union in Georgia who specializes in voting rights. "It's really a movement now."
But the main focus of the suits has been on Congressional districts.
 
Other Challenges
 Last December, a Federal District Court in Louisiana rejected Louisiana's Fourth Congressional District, which zigzags across that state, picking up black voters. In January, white voters and politicians filed a suit challenging Georgia's 260-mile-long 11th Congressional District, which covers a swath of central Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah. And next month, a Federal District Court in North Carolina will hear the state's defense of the 160-mile-long 12th Congressional District, which runs along Interstate 85.
Suits have also been filed challenging new Congressional districts in Florida and Texas. All are elongated or oddly shaped and represented by first-term black legislators. They are among the 50 or so districts, mostly in the South, created after the 1990 census to make minority representation in Congress more closely resemble minority presence in the population; these districts were also intended to comply with the Voting Rights Act, which was passed in 1965 and amended in 1982. The 1982 amendment stipulated that the law was meant to apply not just to discriminatory practices but to serve as a vehicle for voting practices that would increase minority representation.
It is not clear what standards the courts will eventually adopt and how many of the challenges will prove substantial. But blacks in the House, who saw their numbers grow to 39, from 26, after the 1992 redistricting process, are angry over what they regard as an effort to overturn black electoral gains.
"This is an epidemic now," said Representative Cynthia McKinney, the first-term Democrat from Georgia's sprawling 11th District. "The agenda is to turn back the hands of the clock and to put minorities back in the back of the bus."
 
Question Once Thought Closed
 But the challenges do raise vexing questions about whether the law guarantees opportunity or outcome -- the right to have a fair electoral system or the right to have adequate minority representation -- that until last year were thought to have been settled but that are now wide open. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing the Supreme Court's opinion last year, summed up the concerns when she said that the North Carolina district "bears an uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid."
Alan Slobodin of the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative legal organization, agreed with the concerns voiced by Justice O'Connor. "We think the pendulum has swung too far toward a kind of racial Balkanization that's intolerable from a constitutional standpoint," he said.
Under prodding from the Justice Department during the Bush Administration, redistricting based on the 1990 census produced a historic increase in minority representation in Congress. But to achieve that, state legislators fashioned some of the most unusual-looking districts that Congress has seen.
 
'Sherman's March'
 North Carolina's 12th District, represented by Melvin Watt, a black lawyer serving his first term as a Democratic Congressman, has been described as one in which a politician could drive on I-85 with the car doors open and hit every voter in the district. Louisiana's Fourth District, represented by Cleo Fields, a black former state senator in his first term as a Democratic Congressman, has been compared to the mark of Zorro. Georgia's 11th District, represented by Ms. McKinney, is known by some as "Sherman's March," recalling the path of the Civil War general's drive from Atlanta to the Atlantic.
The Supreme Court ruling on June 26 did not throw out North Carolina's districting plan; it sent it back to the district court for review. But in December, a three-judge Federal panel in Shreveport used the Court's language in the North Carolina case to justify rejecting the shaping of Louisiana's Fourth District. Citing Justice O'Connor's words, the Louisiana panel said the district was a product of "racial gerrymandering" and was not "narrowly tailored to further any compelling governmental interest." Louisiana officials are appealing, but if the decision is upheld, the state will be forced to redraw its map, changing not just the Fourth but other districts as well. The representatives who hold those seats, however, would not be summarily removed from office; rather, they would have to seek re-election from revised districts.
"There's an element out there that has no interest in seeing minorities have any representation that will always be there, unless there's a legal standard that makes them understand they can't win," Mr. Watt said. "The Supreme Court ruling was almost an invitation to attack these districts."
 
'Political Apartheid'
 But critics say the districts make a mockery of traditional geographic boundaries and create artificial districts predicated almost entirely on race. "It's basically political apartheid," said Larry Chesin, a lawyer for the Georgia plaintiffs, who included one of the white candidates who lost to Ms. McKinney.
Race has inflamed the issue, but the districts have as much to do with partisan politics as race. Some Democrats complain that George Bush's Justice Department was the guiding force behind the districts, intending to segregate black voters into a few black districts that would be Democratic while creating a lot of white districts that would be Republican.
Others say the biggest factor in the districts' odd shapes was the need of white Democratic incumbents to retain as many black voters from their districts as existed before 1992.
David Bositis, a senior researcher at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research organization specializing in issues affecting blacks, said North Carolina's 12th District, often cited as the most bizarre-looking of all, reflected the needs not of blacks but of white Democrats in districts like North Carolina's Second District. There, Tim Valentine, a Democrat, won with 55 percent of the vote in a district where blacks are 20 percent of the electorate.
 
To Whose Benefit?
 "The idea that the two black districts were drawn to rope in black voters is total baloney," Mr. Bositis said. "They were drawn to protect the six white incumbents."
He also said the idea that Mr. Watts's district ghettoizes black voters was equally wrongheaded. With an electorate that is 53 percent black, the district has racial balance close enough to offer the potential of being represented by a white, he said. And critics of the Supreme Court ruling say that focusing on what the Court called the district's "bizarre" shape sets a maddeningly subjective standard that ignores the widespread practice of creating odd-looking districts for other purposes.
But in other districts, like Louisiana's Fourth, which is 64 percent black, it is hard to argue that the district is not anything other than a designated black seat. And skeptics say there is something dangerous about an electoral system in which blacks and whites are increasingly segregated into districts in which whites represent whites and blacks represent blacks.
"If you have a kind of racial segregation built into the electoral districts, that has to increase racial polarization in the society," said Merle Black, a professor of politics and government at Emory University in Atlanta.
Carol M. Swain, a political science professor at Princeton University and author of "Black Faces, Black Interests: The Representation of African-Americans in Congress (Harvard University Press, 1993) said the real losers could be black politicians. By pushing for largely black districts, they may insure easy victories in Congress, but they will also fail to generate broader support that can carry them to higher office.
The effort to give minorities the political representation that their numbers warrant without skewing the political process solely along racial lines has proved to be politically explosive. For example, the nomination of Lani Guinier, President Clinton's original choice to head the Justice Department's civil rights division, fell apart when some of her solutions -- significantly different from the ones now under court challenge -- were used to cast her as a radical.
Even proponents of the districts under attack say they are imperfect solutions to the reality that blacks often face extreme hurdles to winning in districts that do not have a black majority. The result, they say, has been a success in terms of providing better choices to black voters, but, they continue, it has also been a social experiment inflamed by emotional issues of race.
"This was the first time in the history of this country that the reapportionment process was subject to some form of fairness guarantee beyond the one person, one vote standard," said Dayna Cunningham, a lawyer with the Voting Rights Project of the N.A.A.C.P Legal Defense Fund. "It's like you put your foot in the water and the water's cold, you feel shocked, and you pull it out."

HEADLINE: Beyond Pigs and Quilts in Cooperative Extension;
In New York City, Growing Trout in the Bronx and Teaching About AIDS and Drugs

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
Philson Warner showed off the catfish and striped bass that he was rearing in dozens of gurgling tanks and plastic garbage bins in a makeshift laboratory in the South Bronx, remembering with some antipathy the time the central oxygen pump expired for a day and hundreds of fish simultaneously moved heavenward. He didn't care to talk much about the occasional floods.
He nodded at his vegetables and spices -- celery, spinach, basil -- being grown hydroponically in nutrient-rich solution. That is how you do things when you are a high-rise farmer. He's working on a device that will hang from the ceiling. "Won't take up as much space, great for the city," he said. "Listen, I'm always dreaming." 
 People squeezed for money trickle into the lab and are presented food, exchanging only thanks. The fish eventually become dinner at shelters. And children are recruited from the surrounding moldering neighborhood to work in the lab in the hope that they will choose to learn about science rather than deviance.

 "We want to show the kids that this isn't so bad," Mr. Warner said. "Science can be a neat can of worms. We've had people start fish farms."
Mr. Warner is one of about five dozen people working for the Cornell Cooperative Extension's New York City operation, what at first blush seems an indisputable oxymoron. Cooperative Extension programs, spawned by the Federal Government in 1914, were intended to funnel practical knowledge to a rural America. Their inappropriateness for a city famously low in corn production and pathetic in the number of hogs bred for market was so obvious that no one even bothered to try an extension program in New York for decades.
"I grew up in New York and thought extension was all agriculture and home economics -- pigs and quilts -- and that is the stereotype that it still has," said Ruth Allen, who is now the director of Cornell Cooperative Extension's New York City operation. "But extension has so much application to the city of New York."
Sure, it's dicey trying to raise cows on West End Avenue, but trout grow fine in the Bronx. Certainly, sewing doesn't do a lot for hyperactive New York children, but they like working in soup kitchens. The extension started a "Confabulator Program," where parents visit their children's schools to tell family stories. It has a "Master Angler" program that trains adult fishermen to teach children to fish off the piers as a way to make them ecologically aware.
And, of course, the gardens. The Cornell Extension operation oversees 13,000 community and home gardens, many in formerly blighted lots, that generate about $1 million a year in crops. One important piece of distinctly urban advice dispensed by the gardening experts is to pick the crops as soon as they ripen or else they will be stolen, a snippet less pertinent for the five acres cultivated on well-guarded Rikers Island.
Moreover, the New York operation has bent the mandate somewhat to be relevant. It has a program dealing with rehabilitating decaying apartment buildings. It sings the virtues of monitoring water quality. There is a literacy program. It teaches about AIDS and resisting drugs. In fact, as the peculiar ills of the cities have crept into rural and suburban areas, many rural extension programs have expanded their scope, too, in effect mimicking the New York operation.
 
First, Food Prices and Grades
 Two laws created Cooperative Extension. The Morrill Act of 1862 set up a land-grant university in each state aimed at making education available to the children of the working class. Then the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 dictated that all land-grant colleges initiate programs to disperse practical information into the community. Given the times, the principal information to be shared related to agriculture and home economics. The program fell under the auspices of the United States Department of Agriculture.
In the wake of the laws, Cornell, the state's land-grant school, began an extension program in each of the state's 57 counties -- except for New York City. Not until 1948 did Cornell give the city a whirl, confining itself to a service that furnished information about food prices and grades. Two people staffed it. Not until the mid-1960's did the city operation branch into programs in broader consumer education and later a service to train tenants about caring for their housing.
The New York Extension program now employs 20 full-time staff members and 42 paraprofessionals, who operate under a $4.6 million budget supplied by the Federal Government, the state and private grants. The program has chosen to go where it feels most needed -- the direst broken-down neighborhoods.
 
Still Unsung Soldiers
 Dozens of programs hum along, and Ms. Allen wants the operation to increasingly focus more on broader issues. "We still want to help low- income families increase their consumption of vegetables," she said. "But these families have lots of problems. We want to help them manage their money and deliver parenting education. We're talking in Far Rockaway about helping that community create an infrastructure to deal with water quality.
"Con Edison funds us to try to reduce energy expenditures in targeted communities, and so we show people how to caulk windows and tell them about energy-efficient light bulbs. We are now looking at helping communities influence public policy."
The extension people would not mind being noticed a bit more. In rural expanses of New York State, just about everyone knows the extension people and a healthy proportion solicit their wisdom. The city extension agents remain unsung soldiers.
Shielding her face from the brittle wind, impassive to her own anonymity, Raquel Rios trudged along West 174th Street in Washington Heights and settled on a building. "This area is not so bad," she said. "There aren't too many drug dealers."
She is a nutrition educator for Cornell Cooperative. Harlem and Washington Heights are her milieu. By knocking cold on doors, her goal is to uncover families that can profit from better nutritional and food safety information. In recent years, she has also diversified into waste and money-management tips.
When she finds a willing party, she leaves some literature and takes the name. She then arranges to visit the candidate periodically and school them in depth.
 
Helping With Nutrition
 A quizzical woman cradling a toddler answered the door at 551 West 174th Street. Ms. Rios identified herself and gave a quick pitch. "I don't have time now," the woman said. "I can give you five minutes." She beckoned Ms. Rios in. Her name was Maria Baez.
Could she use some help with her nutrition? Ms. Rios asked.
"Yes, my son is a picky eater," she said. "Yams, beans. I'd like to get him to eat more things. Some days he doesn't want to eat anything. He doesn't want to drink milk anymore."
Ms. Rios took her number and left some basic material, including sample recipes for peanut butter roll-ups, orange smoothie and chili-bean dip.
A cornerstone of extension programs are 4-H clubs (the head, heart, hands and health operations). New York City and 4-H don't seem to mix. How can a youth living on West 54th Street raise a plump chicken that he can enter in a county fair?
It's not encouraged. But the New York Extension program began sponsoring 4-H clubs in the mid-1980's and has 30 now. They study photography, clean up parks, read and sing to the elderly and learn about that quintessential New York animal, the pigeon.
On East 34th Street, the subject was Maria. She has it hard. She has three children, one a teen-ager seemingly glued to the phone. She is divorced from her husband and is paid less than $20,000 a year as a nurse's aide. Her debts are in anarchy. Her dream is to own a washer and dryer.
Maria was under scrutiny in conference room A at the East 34th Street headquarters of the New York Extension operation, as the embodiment of one of the newest programs: teaching low-income women to manage their finances.
Assembled around tables were 24 people from social-service agencies in the Bronx. They were being trained to help their needy clients. Maria was a composite character patched together by Hada Lugo de Slosser, a Cornell consumer-education program leader, who teaches the workshop.
This day, Maria was planning a family celebration. She had 16 people coming and probably needed $75 to pay for it. But the class skipped down the list and determined that Maria's sister could bring the pumpkin and apple pies. They shaved the soda bill. Eventually, they wrung a good $20 or so out of the cost through intelligent shopping. Maria could have her celebration, Ms. Lugo de Slosser said.
"Next time," she went on, "we will help Maria start saving. Then she can think about that washer and dryer. Won't that be nice?"

HEADLINE: Court-Appointed Defense Offers the Poor a Lawyer, But the Cost May Be High

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANNISTON, Ala.

 BODY:
For Jimmy Davis, a 23-year-old accused of murdering a sales clerk in a robbery attempt, the justice system moved with frightening speed: After a five-day trial in December, it took 90 minutes for a jury to find him guilty of murder and two hours for it to recommend that he be put to death in the electric chair.
As Calhoun County sheriff's deputies led the lanky defendant with protruding, frightened eyes from the courtroom, he softly muttered under his breath: "This ain't right. This is wrong." 
 But lawyers who specialize in capital-case appeals say Mr. Davis's experience was unsurprising, given the weakness of his defense.
Assigned to the case in March, when the slaying occurred, Mr. Davis's defense lawyers say they began investigating the case in earnest "a few weeks before" the trial started on Dec. 6.
During the trial the prosecution put forth 28 witnesses and the defense just one. Though an intelligence test showed Mr. Davis to have an I.Q. placing him between the mentally retarded and the low average, no experts were put forward to address his mental competence or to discuss the effects of his harsh childhood.
 
Short Shrift for a Life
 Little effort was made to present Mr. Davis as a three-dimensional person. No motion was made for a change of venue, even though the case had caused a furor about street crime in Anniston, a city of 30,000 people in northeastern Alabama about halfway between Atlanta and Birmingham. Prospective jurors were not questioned about racial attitudes, even though Mr. Davis is black and the clerk he was convicted of murdering was white.
Nothing the defense did was blatantly negligent, say death penalty experts who were asked to examine this case. In fact, in an interview after the trial, the prosecutor gave the defense lawyers credit for shrewdly getting the judge to allow the jury to consider a lesser murder charge.
But the death penalty experts said the defense of Jimmy Davis fell into the vast gray area of lackluster or routine efforts given most indigent suspects in capital cases. And that, they say, is the problem: Regardless of Mr. Davis's guilt or innocence, no one's life should be disposed of so casually.
"The cases that involve the highest stakes and the most difficult constitutional issues are given very short shrift," said Stephen B. Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights and a professor at Yale Law School. "I find it immensely troubling when the life of a person is dispensed of in three or four days when we spend months on civil litigation involving say the licensing of Cabbage Patch dolls or the secret behind Coca-Cola's syrup."
When Judge Malcolm Street Jr. sentences Jimmy Davis on Feb. 14 he has two choices: life without parole, or death. If the judge follows the jury's recommendation, Mr. Davis, a high school dropout who has lived all his life in this city, will join 125 other Alabama inmates on death row.
 
Defense for $20 an Hour
 If this case follows the typical course, a sentence of death will be just the start of a tortuous journey through state and Federal appellate courts that could last years and cost tens of thousands of dollars in public money. Increasingly, what consumes the courts as death sentences are appealed is the extent and adequacy of the defense at the trial stage.
Often, that defense is inexperienced and ill-paid. Mr. Davis was represented by two relatively experienced court-appointed lawyers, Jonathan Adams, who had worked on four previous capital cases, and Steve Giddens, who had worked on two; in all cases their clients were convicted.
While fees for lawyers in private cases usually start at $125 an hour, court-appointed lawyers in Alabama capital cases are paid $20 an hour for out-of-court work. The state assumes a lawyer needs no more than 100 hours to prepare for each phase of the trial and pays a maximum of $1,000 for a trial. Because the penalty part of the trial after a decision is reached on guilt is considered, lawyers are entitled to another $1,000 for that. The lawyers are paid $40 an hour for work in the courtroom.
These kinds of fees are common in court-appointed systems around the country. Most lawyers, including those for Mr. Davis's case, insist that money is not a consideration in their work.
But critics of the Alabama system of indigent representation say that many lawyers put in only the amount of work that is commensurate with the fee and that 100 hours is not enough to research a capital case. The fee system, said Bryan A. Stevenson, head of the Alabama Capital Resource Center, amounts to "a built-in disincentive for thorough representation."
Another problem with systems like Alabama's, these critics say, is the dependence of the lawyers on judges for appointment to cases. Often, particularly in small towns, a deference or coziness among judge, lawyer and prosecutor can arise, discouraging aggressive advocacy for the accused.
Mr. Bright said he had found that "getting the death penalty was not so much the result of how bad the crime was or how bad the defendant was, but how bad the lawyer was."
 
The Crime
Instead of Money, A Man's Death
 Around dusk on March 17, 1993, while Anniston was digging out from a freak snowstorm, two men with bandanas and sweatshirt hoods hiding their faces walked toward the Direct Oil gas station near downtown. Johnny Hazle, a 50-year-old clerk at the combination self-service station and convenience store for seven years, was talking with his friend Dewey Waites, a 65-year-old retiree.
According to accounts by the police, the lead man pulled out a .25-caliber semi-automatic pistol, pointed it at Mr. Hazle and shouted at him to give him the money. When Mr. Hazle, either ruefully or nervously, laughed and looked toward Mr. Waites, the gunman fired at least two shots, hitting Mr. Hazle in his chest and lower back. Mr. Waites, who was behind Mr. Hazle and never saw either intruder, ducked to the floor, and the men fled without any money.
The next day, acting on a tip, the Anniston police arrested Jimmy Davis, Alphonso Phillips, then 17 years old, and his cousin, Terrance Phillips, then 16. They later found the handgun used in the robbery hidden under bushes and old awnings in the backyard of the house belonging to the Phillipses' grandmother.
The police would later say that the plan to rob the station was hatched as the three walked there from the Carver Community Center that evening and that it was Mr. Davis who had led the group and fired the fatal shot. The police said Alphonso Phillips was supposed to get the money and Terrance Phillips had been designated the lookout but had gotten scared and left before the shooting.
 
The Pretrial Phase
Few Seeds Planted For an Appeal
 Jimmy Davis's court dossier in the Calhoun County Circuit Court clerk's office is a thin one for a case involving a capital offense. Its lack of heft reflects the fact that his lawyers did not pepper the court with pretrial motions, which outside lawyers said could have served a variety of purposes in effectively advocating for Mr. Davis.
Motions for actions like a change of the trial's location, the suppression of some evidence crucial to the prosecution case, or the use of questions that should be raised to explore jurors' attitudes could have clearly signaled the prosecution that it faced more than token opposition. Such motions might also have made the prosecutor more willing to consider a plea bargain for Mr. Davis that would have spared him the death penalty.
Even if no motions succeed, by raising them and then objecting to their denial, defense lawyers preserve them for reargument on appeal. Under state law, the failure to raise issues like prejudicial publicity or racial bias at the trial level precludes their being raised at all on appeal in the state courts.
Experienced death penalty defense lawyers said in interviews that it should not be uncommon to file 50 to 100 pretrial motions in such cases.
"Sometimes the most important race is the race to the courthouse to see who gets there first to make a deal with the prosecutor," Mr. Bright said. "And pretrial motions can put your client in a better position to make a deal."
Between last March, when their client was arrested, and Dec. 6 when jury selection began, Mr. Adams and Mr. Giddens filed six, mostly routine, motions. A potentially significant motion, requesting psychological screening of Mr. Davis, was filed just a week before the trial.
"I don't believe in filing a lot of frivolous motions," said Mr. Giddens when asked about his actions before the trial. "I'm not in the habit of filing motions that I can't argue. There was never any offer of a plea bargain from the district attorney. I explored that possibility but there was no offer. There were no statements made by my client that should have been suppressed, and so I don't know what else we could have filed."
 
The Investigation
Building a Case In Several Weeks
 Mr. Giddens said that he and Mr. Adams started investigating Mr. Davis's case in earnest "a few weeks before" the start of trial. At another point Mr. Adams put the start at two weeks before.
Outside experts in capital cases say that in trials involving charges against more than one person it is essential for a lawyer to keep track of the others and their legal maneuvers because they might make a deal with prosecutors and turn against his client.
It was in early October that Terrance Phillips, who was accused of agreeing to be the lookout and was charged with capital murder, made an agreement to plead guilty to robbery and accepted a 10-year sentence with the hope of probation in exchange for testifying against Mr. Davis.
Mr. Giddens, who with Mr. Adams practices primarily in neighboring Talladega County, said he did not learn about the plea until early November, almost a month after it was entered.
He and Mr. Adams talked very briefly with Terrance once by accident about two weeks before the trial. They had gone to his grandmother's house to question his relatives about the discovery of the gun.
"They didn't know who I was at first, but then they asked me a few questions before I left," said Terrance Phillips in an interview. "My lawyer had told me how far to go in answering questions, but they didn't ask me that many."
Mr. Adams said Alphonso Phillips had refused to be interviewed, but he added that he and Mr. Giddens spoke with several other prosecution witnesses. The investigation also included several visits and talks with Mr. Davis.
Another important part of the two lawyers' investigation included a visit to Lillie Bell Davis, Mr. Davis's mother. She said she first saw her son's lawyer, Mr. Adams, when he knocked on her door unannounced late at night a week before trial. A timid woman who did not finish high school, Mrs. Davis said she was wary of him.
"He said that I had to get Jimmy's sisters to come to the trial and cry and beg for his life," Mrs. Davis said. But she said she was scared of him and did not trust him.
On Dec. 7, just as the lawyers were preparing for opening statements, the prosecutor, Joseph Hubbard, announced that Alphonso Phillips had entered a plea agreement. He would testify against Mr. Davis, naming him as the one who shot the clerk, and in exchange, Mr. Hubbard would lower his charge to robbery and recommend 20 years' imprisonment.
 
The Trial
Issues Are Left Unexplored
 Jury selection in a case involving a black defendant and a white victim that failed to take pains to qualify black jurors would be almost automatic grounds for appeal and reversal under the United States Supreme Court's 1986 ruling in Batson v. Kentucky, which prohibits "systematic discrimination" on the basis of race.
In this case, the trial court came up with a racially diverse jury, starting with 16 blacks in a pool of 127 people and seating a jury of eight whites and four blacks -- 33 percent black, exceeding the county proportion of 18 percent.
But the makeup of the jury was somewhat misleading. The panel included four jurors in occupations generally viewed as fostering sympathy for law-enforcement officials. The jurors were a black former military policeman, a black former Anniston police officer, a female postal worker and a female nursing technician in the emergency room at the local hospital.
In selecting the jury, Mr. Giddens and Mr. Adams probed the candidates' feelings about the extent of crime in the community but avoided any questions to white jurors about their racial attitudes, including whether they lived in all-white neighborhoods or sent their children to segregated schools. Such questions, they said, would do more to awaken racial prejudice and "we wanted to stay as far away from that as possible," Mr. Giddens said.
Other defense lawyers like Mr. Bright and Mr. Stevenson insist that queries about racial attitudes of jurors in cases where the victim is white and the accused is black are often essential to provide adequate and aggressive representation. Lack of such questioning can be used as part of an appeal, they said.
Just before the trial, Mr. Adams said that no matter what he and Mr. Giddens did they would end up being second-guessed by lawyers who would handle his appeals in the event of a guilty verdict. Noting that such appeals in Alabama are handled by Mr. Stevenson's Alabama Capital Resource Center, he said that expertise could be better used at the trial level to prevent possible errors.
With Mr. Davis's decision not to take the stand, the core of the defense strategy seemed to be to shatter the credibility of the three main prosecution witnesses, Alphonso and Terrance Phillips and Willie Smith, a 21-year-old friend of the defendant. Mr. Smith, who was in jail on separate robbery charges at the time of trial, corroborated the Phillipses' testimony that Mr. Davis had talked about shooting Mr. Hazle.
During cross-examination, the lawyers confronted the witnesses with inconsistencies between their testimony and earlier statements to the police. The three witnesses invariably responded that they had been trying to evade punishment earlier but were now resigned to telling the truth.
The jury was told of the Phillipses' plea bargains, but the defense did not emphasize any motive the brothers might have to implicate Mr. Davis. Only once did a defense lawyer, Mr. Adams, suggest that perhaps it was Alphonso Phillips who actually pulled the trigger or that perhaps Willie Smith was at the scene rather than Jimmy Davis. But the suggestion was made almost in passing in closing arguments, and there was no evidence brought forward to support this.
The prosecutor, Mr. Hubbard, gave the defense lawyers credit for using testimony that Mr. Davis had said he would shoot the clerk in the leg if necessary to persuade the judge to give the jury an option of considering the lesser charge of felony murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Mr. Hubbard said murder convictions had been overturned when the jury was not given that option.
 
Mitigating Evidence
Giving Accused A Human Face
 While a 1984 Supreme Court decision, Strickland v. Washington, found that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel did not necessarily mean a right to have a "meaningful attorney-client relationship," many lawyers who handle death penalty cases say that effective representation almost requires such a relationship to present the client as a human being.
"The evidence presented should weave a fabric of the defendant's life -- triumphs and successes as well as failures and obstacles," wrote Welsh S. White, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh law school in a recent article in the University of Illinois Law Review. "Vivid details are important. In presenting this evidence, one of the goals is to make the sentencer see the defendant as an individual who is connected to other lives."
However, Jimmy Davis sat alone as the jury heard evidence about his role in the crime. Mrs. Davis said she could not get time off from her job as a maid at the Holiday Inn. Throughout this phase the main picture of Jimmy Davis was sketched by the prosecution. It showed him as a rootless, purposeless young man who had dropped out of school, been put out of his mother's house and spent his days wandering the streets aimless and unemployed.
Only after the guilty verdict, during the sentencing phase, did Mr. Giddens and Mr. Adams seek to present their client in a different light and suggest mitigating factors that they hoped argued against a recommendation of the death penalty. And even then, those efforts fell short of standards highlighted by other lawyers familiar with such cases.
For the first time they called as a witness Mrs. Davis, who testified after her workday. She described her son's history of disciplinary problems and his growing up without a father after she and her husband separated when the boy was barely a year old. She asked the jury to show mercy.
Annie M. Story, a specialist in intelligence tests with the Calhoun County Mental Health Department, told of sitting with Mr. Davis for an hour and 15 minutes on Dec. 4, the Friday before the trial, and administering two tests. The results showed Mr. Davis to have an I.Q. of 77, placing him on the "borderline" in functioning, "somewhere between mentally retarded and low average," Ms. Story said.
Though the defense lawyers could have asked the court to finance further intelligence tests, they did not examine more thoroughly the possibility of mental retardation or brain damage.
An effort by defense lawyers to interview Mrs. Davis more extensively and to get access to medical records might have fleshed out other possibilities of brain damage and neurological problems.
When she was pregnant with Jimmy, Mrs. Davis told a reporter, her husband was abusing her and she did not care for herself properly. It affected the fetus, she said, and after a difficult birth, Jimmy was kept in the hospital for three weeks.
Later in his life, as she tried to guide him and discipline him in the only ways she knew, she said, she may have gone overboard. When Jimmy was 9 years old, a teacher at his school observed welts on his thighs and buttocks and reported it to social welfare agencies. Mrs. Davis said social workers visited her and warned her about possible child abuse charges.
"He was just 9, but he knew what they had told me," Mrs. Davis said ruefully. "That's when I slacked up with the whippings. I told him that if he didn't want to obey me, he must want the white man to come and raise him. Now here I am, running after him in this courthouse."

HEADLINE: Yen Soars and Stocks Fall on Collapse of Trade Talks

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Feb. 14

 BODY:
In the first sign of business's deep disappointment over the collapse of trade talks between Japan and the United States, the yen soared and share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell sharply today.
The dollar settled at 105.90 yen in late trading here, down from 107.20 yen in New York late Friday. 
 The Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell 531.45 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 19,459.25. Volume was very thin as most investors watched nervously from the sidelines. The exchange was closed on Friday because of a national holiday.
The failure of President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to break the impasse over trade in Washington on Friday has led to speculation that the United States may impose sanctions against Japan.
In coming weeks, the Clinton Administration is expected to encourage a strong yen against the dollar as just one step to force Japan to come to terms on trade, analysts said.
 Ever since the Administration took office, it has tended to encourage a stronger yen as one means of shrinking Japan's yawning trade surpluses. A strong yen makes imports less expensive for the Japanese and tends to reduce exports by making Japanese goods more expensive for foreigners.
 The expectation that the United States would seek a strong yen prompted today's rise in the value of the yen.
"There were no signs of central bank involvement, but the feeling toward the dollar is overwhelmingly bearish," said Laurent Depus, a foreign exchange trader at Chase Manhattan Bank in Tokyo. "A stronger yen is considered almost part of the sanctions the U.S. will take."
A strong yen, however, is the last thing that the Japanese economy needs. It is still reeling from a two-year-old recession, and one of the key reasons the economy failed to recover last year was the rising value of the yen, which hit exporters and other manufacturers hard. That sent corporate profits plummeting and reduced industrial investment.
Worried about another round of corporate belt-tightening, investors sold off shares this morning. But the market has risen considerably over the last two months, and today's decline only reduced, rather than wiped out, those large gains.

HEADLINE: Redirecting Technology to Travelers From Troops

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
A steel net used on aircraft carriers to stop jet fighters from plunging into the sea is being tested at Illinois railroad crossings to stop cars from driving into the path of oncoming trains. Materials involved in the production of Stealth bombers are being used in the construction of a San Diego bridge, and a technology developed to simulate tank battles is being tested for the study of automobile traffic in urban areas.
The beating of swords into plowshares is booming in the world of transportation, where military technology is being applied to an array of new projects. Technology was the big winner in President Clinton's budget, and the Transportation Department proposed $692 million for research and development, a 14 percent increase over current spending. Of this amount, $425 million was for projects designed to enhance commercial applications of defense-related technology. 
 "We think transportation technologies are the most ripe for defense conversion," Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena said in a recent interview.
 
Replacement for Radar
 Transportation researchers are developing civilian uses for the Global Positioning System, a $10 billion network of 24 satellites that provides navigation information to American troops. The researchers hope to make this technology available to aircraft pilots, motorists, transit systems and ships.
The researchers also hope to use satellites to track civilian aircraft all over the world, replacing radar. They are steadily improving their ability to amass weather and flight information instantaneously, and give air traffic controllers a better sense of when and where to reroute aircraft.
"We're constantly refining the system and improving the quality of information," said Richard Wright, chief of automation applications at the Transporation Department's premier technology research center, the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, in Cambridge, Mass.
Military technology involving sensors and computer information systems is also being used in the development of so-called "smart cars," whose sensors and computers exchange information with similarly equipped highways, enabling motorists to avoid traffic jams by using alternate routes. The new budget earmarks $289 million for this project.
Transportation researchers also hope to use lightweight, high strength material developed by the military to develop the first generation of "clean cars" with high gas mileage and low emissions, high-tech safety devices and super sophisticated air traffic controls. They are conducting studies on alternative fuels, lightweight buses and magnetic levitation trains.
But Mr. Pena stressed that the Administration was also committed to deployment and commercialization. He noted that many technologies developed in the United States were later commercialized abroad, including railroad technologies like magnetic levitation and the tilt trains.
"We're now trying to buy them from the Swedes and the Spaniards," Mr. Pena said of the two train technologies. "Let's not make that mistake again."
The Secretary noted that the Federal Government had a history of financing transportation programs, including the transcontinental railroad, the highway system and aerospace programs. "Investment in technology and in transportation systems has been critical to developing the vast continental economy of the United States ever since Colonial times," he said.
In addition to the Transportation Department's research programs, civilian transportation projects make up half the $475 million awarded last year for Technology Reinvestment Project programs overseen by the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency. These programs are matched by private sponsors on a 50-50 basis.
"Industry has to perceive that there is a market," said Noah Rifkin, the Transportation Department's director of technology deployment. "It helps us validate the importance of the technology, and therefore represents true defense conversion and dual-use capability."
The Technology Reinvestment Project received 2,800 applications last year requesting a total of more than $9 billion in grants. Last October, the President announced the first round of selections, 41 projects involving 272 industrial sponsors.
Transportation projects also get a large share of the research money awarded the National Institute of Science and Technology, whose budget will rise from $200 million this year to $750 million in 1997.
 
'Technology Secretary'
 In the broadest sense, the Federal Government this year budgeted $2.7 billion for transportation research and development, including projects in the Departments of Defense, Energy and Transportation, as well as National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Of this amount, $1.9 billion involved aviation, $585 million was for motor vehicles, $80 million was for railroad projects and $55 million for waterways.
The Volpe Center, the heart of the Transportation Department's technology programs, conducts and oversees $225 million in research projects annually. Twenty percent of this money is spent at the center, whose 550 researchers hold 250 advanced degrees including 65 Ph.D.'s. The remaining 80 percent of the money is awarded to consulting firms.
Dr. Richard R. John, the center's director, said that in recent years, "Transportation has not been a major constituent of the research and development community," adding, "It's been primarily a regulatory and grant-making agency."
But all that has changed, Dr. John said, because "Pena wants to be the 'technology secretary.' "
The center has no budget of its own. Each project is financed by a Federal agency, and the center's researchers speak of meeting their sponsors' goals. Dr. John said the center's mission was to "anticipate and create awareness of national, state, local and international transportation issues."
Mr. Pena noted that transportation accounted for 21 percent of the nation's economy, 50 percent of its petroleum consumption and 51 percent of ambient air pollution.
"We can't simply buy, build or invest our way out of these problems," Mr. Pena said. "We must turn to technology for solutions."

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs Trade Actions on Japan

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
After Japan's rebuff of American trade demands, Clinton Administration officials said today that they had agreed that a swift response was needed but were struggling to find one unlikely to start a trade war.
"There is a unanimous understanding on the American side that there is a range of actions and that we will undoubtedly be choosing one or more of them," a senior official said. 
 The options under consideration range from very moderate ones, like ordering a study showing how Japan excludes imports in certain sectors, to instituting powerful sanctions, like reinstating the President's authority to use a potent trade law authorizing him to punish countries that systematically discriminate against American goods.
According to several officials, the Clinton Administration might take action against Japan as soon as Tuesday, when a deadline expires for Japan to announce plans to open up its cellular telephone market to foreign products.
 Several officials said the President's top economic advisers would meet Monday or Tuesday to discuss and perhaps decide what the response should be to the breakdown of trade talks on Friday during a visit by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.
Criticizing the Administration for trying to foist "managed trade" upon Japan, Mr. Hosokawa rejected demands that Japan agree to numerical indicators that would show whether it was opening markets.
 
 
Fear of a Trade War
 Scared of starting a trade war and of being accused of fomenting trade frictions, the Clinton Administration seems to be leaning toward what might be called "managed trade retaliation."
"You would find some sentiment in the Administration to react with a scalpel, and not with a blunt instrument," one senior policy maker said.
Whatever action is eventually decided, one official said, may be more of a veiled threat than formal retaliation. One possibility under consideration is for the Clinton Administration to announce some numerical criteria that it believes Japan should meet in terms of increasing imports in one or more industries.
After his breakfast with President Clinton on Saturday, Prime Minister Hosokawa warned the United States not to order sanctions against Japan. His aides asserted that Japan would retaliate with its own sanctions.
 Mr. Hosokawa said Japan would never drop its opposition to what he described as the Clinton Administration's call for "numerical targets" for increasing access in autos, insurance, medical equipment and telecommunications.
The Tuesday deadline on cellular telephones could give the Administration a convenient hook to hang a retaliation order. Some officials, however, said retaliation might have been ordered in this longstanding dispute even if Mr. Hosokawa and Mr. Clinton had reached an overall trade agreement last week.
In 1989, under pressure from Washington, Japan agreed to give Motorola Inc. roughly one-third to one-half of the cellular phone market in the Tokyo region. Motorola now complains that Japanese companies have worked behind the scenes to sabotage the accord and that as a result it has less than 4 percent of the market.
"That deadline certainly hits at an interesting time," a senior official said.
Administration officials said they felt caught between Congressional forces that want to hit Japan hard and fears of a trade war, especially since many officials feel sympathy for Mr. Hosokawa. Administration officials often say in private that they like the Prime Minister for his pledges to deregulate the Japanese economy.
 The Administration feels pressure from another source: its oratory on Japanese trade has been so strong that officials fear they will look weak if they do not respond firmly.
"On one hand, our response will be resolute, and on the other hand it will be quite prudent," one official said. "It has to be managed, quite measured, to help keep things in bounds."
The Administration's options include deploying its heavy trade artillery, namely a trade law known as Super 301. Under the law, the President can identify a country that systematically discriminates against American goods. That law requires the President to take action if that country does not remove trade barriers within a certain time.
Officials say one option is for the President to sign an executive order that re-establishes his power to use Super 301, without identifying Japan. But if the President wants to get tough quickly, he can single out Japan in that new executive order.
The advantage of the latter action, officials say, is that it would impose a deadline that would create immense pressure on Japan to make some concessions. The disadvantage is this strategy could lead to a cycle of retaliation.

HEADLINE: Public Advocate, Private Battle

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
On a recent morning in a midtown Manhattan hotel, Mark J. Green, New York City's new Public Advocate, stood before about 200 business and civic leaders and offered a treatise on turning some functions of city government over to private companies -- an issue that was a cornerstone of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's campaign last year.
Indeed, in the six weeks since his inauguration, Mr. Green has seized the issue of reinventing government with a passion. He has prepared position papers, met with a national expert on the topic, and traveled to Washington to share his ideas with Vice President Al Gore. 
 Mr. Green, a 48-year-old disciple of the consumer advocate Ralph Nader, said that embracing the issue was only natural, and that he had long been a champion of making government leaner and more efficient. But others suggest that it is one of many ways Mr. Green has chosen to make a mark in the city's second-highest post, a job that is ill-defined and widely perceived as just short of ceremonial.
 
'The Bureaucracy Beat'
 During the long campaign last year for the position once known as City Council President, Mr. Green promised to be "a quality-of-life cop patrolling the bureaucracy beat," to bring government closer to the people. Now he is grappling with how to make good on that pledge. In many ways it has not been easy.
For decades, the position came with a full vote on the powerful Board of Estimate, assuring the holder influence in important city matters. But after the board was abolished five years ago and the City Council was enlarged and given more power, many officials, including former Mayor David N. Dinkins, advocated abolishing the position.
Instead, the job was watered down, and now its only major duties are presiding over the City Council and serving as the city's ombudsman. While the former City Council President, Andrew J. Stein, commanded a staff of 65, Mr. Green can employ just 45 workers. The office's annual budget under Mr. Stein was $3.7 million, while Mr. Green's is $2.7 million.
Even the setting has changed. Instead of using the complex of offices in the east wing of City Hall, where Mr. Stein and his predecessors worked in close proximity to the Mayor and City Council, Mr. Green and his staff occupy a set of somewhat dingy rooms on the 13th floor of the Municipal Building, across the street.
But a larger problem for Mr. Green is making the powers within government -- and the public -- take his position more seriously. Mr. Stein, who was often accused of spending much of his last years in office preparing to run against Mr. Dinkins, was hounded by the perception that every report he released, and every investigation of a municipal operation he conducted, was motivated by politics. Moreover, under its new name, the job and its functions are not well understood by many New Yorkers, opinion polls have found.
 
Green's Ambitions
 Mr. Green, who is often mentioned as a potential mayoral candidate for 1997, is clearly struggling to be recognized for his work in his current job, rather than as a potential candidate for higher office. "No one, not my wife, staff, politician, or anyone, has ever heard me seriously discuss aspiring to run for mayor," he said.
"I have worked to counter this," he added. "It disadvantaged, if not disabled, predecessors of mine."
In an effort to give a nebulous post some muscle, he has chosen to focus on some contentious issues, most notably overhauling government. In his first two weeks on the job, Mr. Green issued a report on the economics of garbage collection, and suggested that the Sanitation Department compete with private companies, a move he said could save $250 million. He also created a 14-member commission to study 10 topics and agencies, from civil service and procurement to providing information on city government to citizens electronically.
Staff members say that in trying to identify himself with privatization, Mr. Green, a Democrat, has embarked on a strategy to give his position weight while not appearing to be the Mayor's No. 1 critic -- as was often the case with Mr. Stein.
"We've always gotten along well," he said of Mr. Giuliani, a Republican. "But the charter intended natural institutional checks and balances, and it's the Mayor's government that I'm supposed to be a watchdog of. But I'm trying to be a watchdog, not a scolder of the Mayor."
 
More Than Spending Cuts
 Mr. Green has also suggested that cutting government spending alone will not stimulate the city's government, and has recommended improving job-training efforts, lowering some taxes, developing industrial parks and reforming development-incentive programs.
To spread his message, he has met with business groups and traveled frequently throughout the city, speaking to everyone from the New York Leadership Conference and small-business organizations to churches in Harlem.
Under the City Charter, the Public Advocate -- like the City Council President before -- presides over Council meetings, although few of Mr. Green's predecessors did so. Mr. Green, by contrast, has presided over all the Council meetings since his inauguration. He plans to introduce a number of bills, and indeed has already introduced a bill seeking to establish competition in the city's waste-hauling industry.
"I count Council members as the public who can inform me and help me do my job well," he said. "Few if any people know a Council area better than the Council member elected there."
Mr. Green, who served as Consumer Affairs Commissioner under Mr. Dinkins, spent most of his career in consumer advocacy and as an author of books on government and policy. Apart from two unsuccessful attempts at elective office -- for the House of Representatives and the Senate -- he has not spent much time immersed in local-government issues. That leads to the question: is this former congressional hopeful satisfied with the limited duties of his current post?
Some officials within city government and Mr. Green's own staff members maintain that his ambitions for the office are far higher than those of most of his predecessors. "He is bursting with a million things he wants to do to make government more effective," said a staff member, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "But I think he is frustrated because there are some severe limits on staff, on money and on the attention he craves."
 
Criticism of Giuliani
 Mr. Green has so far been selective in his criticism of Mr. Giuliani. He disagreed with the Mayor on abolishing the Consumer Affairs Department and on weakening the city's program to encourage city contracts with businesses owned by women and members of minority groups. On the other hand, he agreed with several of Mr. Giuliani's budget-reduction proposals.
Many in city government say it is too soon to tell how effective Mr. Green will be. "The fact that he hasn't fired off a cannon every week means he is serious about fighting the perception that he views this job only as a stepping stone," said John D. Sabini, a City Councilman from Queens. "Everyone acknowledges that he's a serious student of the process and that there are a wide range of things he can do. But his approach to the job is still a work in progress."
No matter how many studies he undertakes or reports he produces, converting his ideas into policy will be difficult.
"How do I implement anything?" Mr. Green asked. "Through the power of persuasion. The strength of my office is that it's exhortatory. The weakness of my office is that it's exhortatory. You mobilize public and political support around a good idea. And hope you can have some impact."

HEADLINE: Special Elections Will Fill Nine Seats in the State Legislature

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Nine empty spots in the state Legislature -- seven seats in the Assembly and two in the Senate -- will be filled in special elections on Tuesday.
The elections will not change the balance of party power in the Democratic-led Assembly or the Republican-led Senate. 
 But they could have a marginal effect on the drive in the Legislature to override Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's annual veto of death penalty legislation. The Senate could pick up two more supporters of the death penalty, which would provide the 41-vote minimum for overriding a veto in that house.
But an override must pass both houses, and the Assembly will remain several votes shy of the 100 votes needed for an override no matter who is elected on Tuesday.
Here is a rundown of the races:
In the 21st Senate District in Brooklyn, Carl Kruger, 44, a Democrat and former Assembly aide, is running against Irwin Plascoff, who works at an industrial metal company, on the Republican and Conservative tickets.
The seat, in an overwhelmingly Democratic district, was vacated in October by Donald M. Halperin, who is now the state Division of Housing and Urban Renewal commissioner.
In the Senate race to succeed Anthony M. Masiello, who took office last month as the Mayor of Buffalo, Anthony R. Nanula, a real-estate developer and Democrat, is running against Dianna D. Henderson, a social worker and a Republican. The 57th Senate District is almost 70 percent Democrat, and about one-third of its residents are black.
Ms. Henderson, 37, until recently a teacher and counselor at the Clarkson Center for Human Services, is black. Mr. Nanula, 28, the son of the co-founder of the Tops supermarket chain, is white. Both are candidates for public office for the first time.
In the Assembly races, Philip M. Boyle, a Republican lawyer and former Congressional aide, is running in the Republican-dominated Eighth Assembly District on Long Island against Randall Hinrichs, a Democrat on leave from his job as a prosecutor in the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office.
Mr. Boyle, 32, was once an aide to John C. Cochrane, who left the Assembly last year after being elected Suffolk County treasurer. Mr. Hinrichs, 37, has been involved in Democratic fund-raising.
Also on Long Island, Marc Herbst, a Republican with ties to the Assemblyman who vacated the seat in the 14th Assembly District, is challenging Kevin C. Gorman, a former banker.
 
Backing for Queens Seat
 Mr. Herbst, 30, is a deputy receiver of taxes in Oyster Bay. Mr. Gorman, 42, is the owner of Dackland Pub in Levittown. They are fighting for the seat vacated last year by Frederick E. Parola, a Republican elected as the Nassau County Comptroller.
Two powerful Democrats, Alan G. Hevesi and United States Representative Thomas J. Manton, are squabbling over who will fill the 28th Assembly seat left open in Queens after Mr. Hevesi left the legislature to become New York City Comptroller. Mr. Hevesi is supporting Melinda Katz, a young lawyer who worked on his campaign last year. She is running on the Liberal ticket in the solidly Democratic district.
But Mr. Manton is behind Michael Cohen, the local Democratic district leader. John F. Haggerty Jr., on leave as an aide to Assemblyman Clarence D. Rappleyea, the minority leader, is running on the Republican ticket.
In the 46th Assembly District in Brooklyn, Jules Polonetsky, 28, a Democrat and an aide to United States Representative Charles E. Schumer, is facing Michelle Heitzner on the Republican and Liberal tickets. The district, controlled by Democrats, was represented by Howard Lasher, now a City Councilman.
The South Bronx seat vacated by David Rosado, who was also elected to the City Council, is being sought by Carmen E. Arroyo, a local school board member long active in Democratic politics, and Juan Nunez, a Republican. Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district, the 74th, four to one. Also running is Agustin Alamo for the Conservative Party, Federico Perez on the Liberal and Popular tickets and Melvina R. Smith on the Renegade ticket.
In the Riverdale section of the Bronx, Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Democrat, is going against Mark Friedlander, a Liberal who is president of the city Tax Appeals Tribunal. The seat, the 81st Assembly District, was vacated by G. Oliver Koppell, now the state Attorney General.
Mr. Dinowitz, 39, is the local Democratic district leader and an administrative law judge for New York State. No Republicans entered the race. Herbert McCay is running on the Conservative ticket.
In the 129th Assembly District in Ontario, Yates and Livingston Counties, Craig J. Doran, a Republican lawyer, is running against William J. Eddinger Jr., a high school teacher and Democrat.

HEADLINE: Neediest Cases: When Layoffs Replace Dreams

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
John O. remembers the exact moment he and his wife, Monique, decided to move from London to the United States.
It was during a vacation in 1985, when they flew into Houston and rented a car to drive west to San Antonio through the rolling Texas hill country. 
 "We stopped on the roadside that morning for breakfast at a small place," he said in a quiet voice with a distinctively clipped accent. "And they served us -- oh, my -- a plate of very thinly sliced beef with a sauce on it that I cannot describe. It was simply incredible."
On returning to London, the couple sought out the delicacy, barbecued brisket, at Harrods department store, but were sorely disappointed. "We found some but it was much more expensive and certainly not as good," he said.
In 1987, after several more visits, the couple moved to the United States, settling in Manhattan. Mr. O. found a good job with a real-estate company and the couple rented a roomy $1,500-a-month studio apartment on West 52d Street.
Then their new life collapsed. The real-estate company declared bankruptcy; Mr. O. lost his job, and he and his wife had to move to a cheaper apartment in Astoria, Queens. He found another job as an export manager for a smaller company, but that company, too, went bankrupt in 1992. "It seemed like all of America was going out of business at that time," he said.
Throughout 1993, he bounced from one part-time job to another, trying to make enough to keep his apartment and also to pay the mounting medical bills for his wife, who was told that she had colon cancer shortly after the couple moved to New York.
For a time, he walked door to door selling clocks. He took another door-to-door job in the winter selling heating oil, but fell ill with pneumonia. His taxable income in 1993 was $1,710, according to statements from his employers. This year, he has not had a paycheck to speak of.
At his lowest point, in early January, thousands of dollars behind in rent, he turned to the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, a beneficiary of the UJA-Federation of New York, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
The fund, which is conducting its 82d annual appeal for donations, helps tens of thousands of New York's unfortunate -- the unemployed, the homeless, former addicts and children whose parents are suffering from AIDS.
Because The Times pays the campaign's overhead, every dollar goes to the charities to assist the poor. But the fund's ability to help is in danger, as contributions continue to lag. The appeal continues through Feb. 28, so there is still time to give.
As for Mr. O., who paused at the Jewish Board's offices the other day on his way to yet another job interview, he still holds out hope that America will become the place he dreamed of. "Everything so far, I must laugh off," he said, "or I would probably go crazy."

Population Update

 BODY:
The population in New York City is holding steady while other northeastern cities, especially in New England and New Jersey, continue to shrink, according to new estimates by the Census Bureau that cover 1990 to 1992. The fixed boundaries of older northeastern cities and the lack of space for new housing inhibit their growthand prompt a population shift to the farther reaches of these metropolitan areas, census analysts say. While immigration has helped keep New York City's population relatively stable, the recession took its toll on cities like Hartford, Boston and Bridgeport. Suburban counties in the New York region continue to grow and the New York metropolitan area, by far the nation's largest, added about 120,000 people.

HEADLINE: A Demeaning Travel Ban to Cuba

 BODY:
It is hard to deny the value of a free trade in ideas and information across international frontiers. Yet for five years, successive Administrations have resisted lifting restrictions on travel by writers and artists during trade embargoes against countries like North Korea, Vietnam and Cuba.
Now the Clinton Administration appears to be playing the same game. It promised to review existing bans in order to fend off a liberalizing amendment put forward by Representative Howard Berman, a California Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee on international operations. But after the review, Cuba was still excluded from any relaxation of travel bans. 
 This year both House and Senate have adopted amendments by Mr. Berman and Senator John Kerry urging the President not to restrict travel whose purpose is informational, educational, religious or humanitarian. Yet these exhortations may not be enough to overcome Cuban-American hard-liners, who lavish campaign contributions on key lawmakers and who oppose any relaxation on travel bans to Cuba.
Under existing embargo laws, Americans, with few exceptions, need prior official permission to travel to Cuba. The exceptions are U.S. officials, journalists, U.S. citizens with close relatives in Cuba, professional researchers and expenses-paid guests of the Castro regime.
Though Fidel Castro's near-bankrupt island has ceased to be a security threat, this demeaning cold war restriction persists. And Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in seeking to deflect any legislation, faces both ways simultaneously.
The Secretary has assured Mr. Berman that "dissemination of information and ideas is a significant element in the promotion of democracy" and a "central tenet of our foreign policy." But he nevertheless insists the Administration needs the authority to control information flow, lest it be used as a "pretext for evasion of the larger financial purposes of economic embargoes." It would be hard to improve on the elastic nullity of those phrases.
The other day, the Administration completed its review of travel bans and decided that some liberalization was in order -- but not for Cuba. This frustrated hopes for an executive order that would extend the list of those who need no advance permits for Cuba. Such an order would have left in place the ban on U.S. tourism, as mandated by Congress, but would have lowered the barrier to teachers, writers, artists, physicians, human rights advocates and church leaders.
The time seems overdue for this small step to freer travel. If the Clinton Administration cannot effect this modest change by executive order, then why not make the Berman amendment binding?

HEADLINE: Who Pays Physicians

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Fond Memory: The Family Doctor Is Rarely In" (The Week in Review, Feb. 6): I agree that doctors seem greedy and arrogant, and that they "don't care about people as much as they used to." 
 The primary difference between the turn-of-the-century physician in your photo and myself is that he was paid by his patients. Patients are resentful because they do not have adequate quality control. They cannot fire their physician and hire anyone else they please.
Almost all my fees come from employer-paid insurance companies or the Government. America can return to a respected but less greedy and arrogant physician once physicians are again paid directly by patients and patient-bought insurance.
This would take a simple act of Congress equalizing tax deductions on medical care. Patients pay for their own care with after-tax dollars, while employers deduct the benefit of medical care as a business expense. Physician and patient behavior would change with this change in tax law. And the medical-care percentage of the gross national product would drop.

HEADLINE: Shock Therapy for the Pentagon

BYLINE: By Lawrence J. Korb; Lawrence J. Korb, a national security specialist, is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Only shock therapy can change the mind set that developed in the Department of Defense during the cold war. Since the tearing down of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the Pentagon has experienced a great deal of attempted therapy and next to no shock.
When the Bush Administration was treating it benignly, one of the Pentagon's severest critics was Les Aspin, then chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. 
 He criticized the proposed downsizing of the Pentagon to adjust to the "new world order" as simply defense by subtraction, and a response to the Pentagon's organizational needs rather than to threats to U.S. interests. He suggested that a radical -- "bottom-up" -- review was needed if America was to get the peace dividend it earned from spending $7 trillion to outlast the Soviet empire.
Candidate Bill Clinton endorsed the Aspin approach and President-elect Clinton selected Mr. Aspin to be Secretary of Defense to revolutionize the Pentagon. After slightly more than a year of the Clinton Administration, it is clear that there will be little real change.
Mr. Aspin is gone, and Mr. Clinton, after offering the job to such traditionalists as Adm. Bobby Ray Inman and Senator Sam Nunn, said in his State of the Union Message, "We must not cut defense further."
True, Mr. Aspin and his deputy and successor, William Perry, did carry out the bottom-up review, but it was bottom-up in name only. It resulted in a barely changed military force and a budget about 85 percent of the average cold war level.
The Navy will maintain the 12 carrier battle groups that it "needed" during most of the cold war. The Air Force gave up some 200 tactical fighters but gained an equal number of strategic bombers for tactical use. And while the Army lost two active ground divisions, the Marines gained one and the Army National Guard and Army Reserve were maintained at cold war levels.
Relics of the cold war like the SSN-21 Seawolf submarine, Trident II missiles, F-22 fighter and Milstar communications system survived the review even though the Soviet threat that brought about their development has gone away.
Bill Clinton will spend more on defense than Richard Nixon did two decades ago ($260 billion as against $230 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars), and the United States will spend more for national security than the rest of the world combined. Moreover, two years from now the military budget will begin to increase again.
How did this happen? First, instead of reinventing the Pentagon, the Pentagon reinvented the threat and downplayed the contributions of our allies. The service chiefs convinced Mr. Aspin and Mr. Perry that the regional threats from countries like Iraq and North Korea (whose military spending is $20 billion a year between them) are almost equal to that posed by the Soviet Union, which spent about $300 billion a year before its collapse.
They ignored the potential military roles of European countries in another regional war -- say, a second Persian Gulf war -- and minimized the South Korean military's contribution to its country's defense.
Second, Mr. Aspin and Mr. Perry did not tackle the 1948 agreement among the Joint Chiefs of Staff that allows the four armed services to duplicate one another's efforts in many combat and support functions.
Third, the revamping of our strategic nuclear forces was postponed for a year.
The Pentagon budget could easily be reduced to $200 billion a year from its present $260 billion. A budget this size would still insure the pre-eminence of our armed forces and their ability to handle any military threats to our national security. It would provide for 15 ground divisions, 20 tactical air wings and 9 carrier battle groups backed by an arsenal of 1,000 strategic nuclear weapons.
Bill Clinton was elected as the candidate of change. He endlessly exhorts the nation not to fear change. Why can't he take his own advice?

HEADLINE: Riders in the Storm;
Blasts of Winter Weather Drive Commuters to the Trains

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
In fair weather, mass transit officials plead and beg for riders; they advertise, they offer discount packages for sporting events, they even jot down license plate numbers of cars at highway toll plazas and write to the owners, offering them free weekly tickets.
But in the snow and ice, people flock to the trains. Sales of one-way tickets for peak-hour trains were up 11.5 percent on Metro-North and 8 percent on the Long Island Rail Road in January of this year compared with January 1993. Ridership was up on New Jersey Transit and on Amtrak, too, officials there report, although neither one has January figures yet. The Transit Authority said it would not know for a few weeks whether token sales for city subways were up in January. 
 "The weather was a sales promotion," said Daniel M. Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North. "But instead of being handled by our marketing department, it's handled by God, which is good, too."
Just how many foul-weather friends the railroads made last month is impossible to determine because it is not clear how many individuals bought one-way tickets, which serve to represent trips made by people who would not ordinarily take the train. Presumably most of those travelers bought at least two, and some may have bought far more. Sales figures indicate that Metro-North sold 82,000 extra tickets last month, showing an increase not only in one-way tickets but also in ten-trip tickets, which sell at a discount, too. The L.I.R.R. sold an extra 33,000 one-way tickets, while its sales of 10-trip tickets were flat.
If the L.I.R.R. made converts in January, it may have lost some of them last Friday, when snowdrifts covered the electrified third rail and shut down most of the railroad's operations.
But Susan McGowan, a spokeswoman, sought to minimize the impact of Friday's problems. "For the most part we're willing to stand on our record," she said. "We got through 11 storms. This was the 12th."
 
To Bus or Not to Bus
 The Port Authority, which operates the bus terminal in Manhattan, and bus operators said they did not yet have ridership figures for January. Bad weather induces some people to ride the bus, but other bus riders stay away because buses travel the same snowy highways as cars, and because they do not like waiting for the bus on snowy roadsides.
But the Port Authority said the number of cars and trucks crossing the Hudson and the Staten Island bridges was down 13.6 percent in January from the same month last year, falling to 7.5 million vehicles from 8.6 million.
National Weather Service records show that Central Park had precipitation on 15 days in January, and most days it was snow. The 5.59 inches of moisture last month created 19 inches of snow, which is about two-thirds of what falls in an entire winter in an average year. (The total for the winter, as of yesterday, was 41.3 inches.)
At Metro-North, which serves customers in Connecticut as well as New York, Daniel M. Brucker, a spokesman, said: "We made a million dollars more than usual in January. Of course, we probably spent a million in overtime."
But the importance of increased ridership, he said, is in getting new people on the trains. "This means more to us than helping people out in the snowstorm," he said. "We actually count every one of them as potential long-term customers."
Metro-North and the L.I.R.R., both divisions of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, have joint radio, television and print advertising campaigns. Both intermittently advertise package deals on train tickets and admission to shows at Radio City Music Hall, exhibitions at the Javits Convention Center and similar events.
Last year the L.I.R.R. used records from the Department of Motor Vehicles to trace the ownership of cars coming across toll approaches to the East River and mailed out offers of free tickets. The railroad gave away 1,700 weekly tickets, with an average value of about $44, a promotion that cost $75,000, not counting administration costs.
The January weather appears to have exposed several times as many riders to the system for a marketing cost of zero. (The number could be around 15,000, supposing that each rider bought two one-way tickets.)
Last month the L.I.R.R. announced it had hired a marketing specialist and assigned five managers to work with her in drumming up new business, especially among commuters to New York City, people traveling from one destination on Long Island to another, reverse commuters traveling from city homes to suburban jobs and leisure travelers.
Both the L.I.R.R. and Metro-North report that ridership has been generally growing for the last six months, which is a reflection of economic activity rather than the weather. Metro-North, the only railroad that made detailed statistics available, recorded declines in travel in January in only one category: one-way tickets sold at a discount to elderly people and the handicapped.

HEADLINE: Woman Who Lost a Right-to-Die Case in Canada Commits Suicide

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Sue Rodriguez, who fought unsuccessfully all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada for the right of the terminally ill to end their own lives, died Saturday in what the police are calling a doctor-assisted suicide.
Assisted suicides are illegal in Canada, as they are in the United States. Mrs. Rodriguez's death at her home in Victoria, British Columbia, has revived the debate over whether such activity should be criminal in Canada. 
 Her lawyer, Chris Considine, released a statement from his client in which Mrs. Rodriguez again pleaded with the federal Government to legalize assisted suicides for people suffering painful terminal illnesses. "I hope that my efforts will not have been in vain," she said.
Mrs. Rodriguez, 43, was an employee in a real estate office in Victoria in 1991 when she learned that she had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, an incurable and fatal nerve condition that slowly shuts down the body's muscular functions.
She went to court in British Columbia and finally to the Supreme Court, arguing that the ban on assisted suicide denied her constititonal right to life, liberty and security of the person.
Her death came four and a half months after the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 ruling, upheld lower court decisions that the criminal code sanctions did not abridge her rights. The majority said the state's interest in protecting life's sanctity took precedence over the right to a dignified death.
Television cameras, which followed Mrs. Rodriguez's court struggle while graphically showing her physical deterioration, made her into a national symbol for the cause of euthanasia.
The issue is not going away, said Marilynne Seguin, executive director of Dying With Dignity, a group lobbying for euthanasia for more than a decade. A Gallup poll last year placed the Canadian public's approval of assisted deaths at 77 percent.
The Federal Justice Minister, Allan Rock, said he favored a free vote in Parliament. Last year members voted overwhelmingly against a motion that would have required Parliament to consider euthanasia legislation, but Mrs. Rodriguez's high-profile struggle, and now her death, may have altered the political landscape.
Still, it is unlikely that Parliament will deal with the issue soon. Mr. Rock said the matter needed further study, and Solicitor General Herb Gray said economic issues were the Government's priority.
 
Parallels With United States
 The right-to-die movement here has parallels with the one in the United States, where Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who has helped 20 people commit suicide, is campaigning for a state constitutional amendment to legalize doctor-assisted suicide in Michigan. Washington and California rejected laws permitting assisted suicide in state referendums.
At the scene of Mrs. Rodriguez's apparent suicide was a member of Parliament, Svend Robinson, a New Democrat from Vancouver who, the police said, is under investigation, along with an unidentified doctor.
The Premier of British Columbia, Mike Harcourt, said Sunday that prosecutors would rely on new provincial euthanasia guidelines in deciding whether anyone should be charged.
According to the guidelines, it is illegal "to advise, encourage or assist another person to perform an act that intentionally brings about his or her death." But the guidelines also give authorities discretion over the laying of charges in individual cases.
Mr. Robinson told a news conference on Monday that he had held Mrs. Rodriguez in his arms on Saturday and "she peacefully lapsed into unconsciousness and stopped breathing approximately two hours later." He said she had died "with incredible courage and dignity." He declined to identify the doctor and did not go into detail on the procedure used to bring about her death. He did say he had no reason to believe he had committed any crime.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Sharply Vs. the Yen

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Accelerating a descent that began about 10 days ago as trade tensions between the United States and Japan intensified, the dollar plunged yesterday to a six-month low against the Japanese yen.
The dollar's 4.7 percent decline against the yen in New York trading to 102.25, from 107.20 late Friday, was particularly steep. In the last 10 days, the dollar has fallen and the yen has risen by about 10 percent. 
 "That is a meteoric rise for a major currency," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
The rise in the yen is the currency market's response to a long-simmering bilateral dispute that may yet boil over into some sort of trade war. In addition, traders and investors are pushing the value of the dollar lower and the yen higher because Washington does not appear ready to step in to stem the dollar's fall. Yesterday, for example, there was no apparent intervention by the Federal Reserve to support the dollar.
Yesterday's New York close was the lowest the dollar has been against the yen since Aug. 18, when the dollar hit 101.65 yen. A day earlier, the dollar hit its record low against the yen, closing at 101.11.
 
 
Further Decline in Tokyo
 In Japanese trading today, the dollar fell a bit further from its New York close. In late trading in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 102.05 yen.
On Friday, President Clinton said that top-level trade talks with Japan had ended without agreement, setting the stage for possible American retaliation against Japan.
Yesterday, while initiating sanctions against Japan for failing to allow Motorola Inc. access to the Tokyo cellular phone market, the President refused to rule out a broader trade war. But he said he would take "some days" to ponder options he might take before imposing sanctions.
"The market is saying that since other devices for reducing Japan's trade surplus with the United States are not working, Washington is therefore in favor of a higher yen as a way of cutting that surplus, and will do nothing to stop it from appreciating," Mr. Hormats said.
A stronger yen and a weaker dollar could reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States by making Japanese exports to the United States more expensive for Americans to buy. American officials have made clear that they are willing to resort to this blunt technique as a way to force Japan to consider opening its markets to more American products as an alternative way to cut the Japanese trade surplus.
In recent days, that perception has been reinforced by the lack of comments or actions by officials or monetary authorities in Washington or Tokyo that might brake the yen's rise.
Unless and until that happens, currency traders and analysts said yesterday, the market would continue to take the yen higher against the dollar.
"As long as the Clinton Administration leaves the perception in the market that it wants the dollar lower against the yen, it will go lower," Scott Pardee, chairman of Yamaichi International America Inc., said. "The moment they clear the air in a meaningful way, it will rise again to some more tradeable level."
A senior Treasury official said late yesterday that the Administration's exchange rate policy remains unchanged. "We do not believe in artificially manipulating exchange rates," the official said.
 
An Unclear Level
 At this juncture, it is unclear what that level might be.
About a year ago, C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, startled some when he suggested that the dollar needed to fall to 100 yen before meaningful improvement in America's $60 billion trade deficit would be seen.
But with Japan still mired in recession, Mr. Bergsten amended that view yesterday. "When I did the calculation it was based on the assumption that Japan would resume a 3 percent to 3.5 percent growth rate in the foreseeable future," he said.
Under current conditions, the dollar might have to fall to "90 to 95" yen, Mr. Bergsten said.
The dollar also fell against the German mark yesterday, finishing at 1.7240 marks in New York trading, down from 1.7535 on Friday.
Prices for gold, which is seen as a safe haven in times of economic turbulence, also jumped yesterday in reaction to the turmoil in currency markets. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery rose $3.90 to $385.60 an ounce. March silver gained 9.5 cents to $5.35 an ounce.
But Mr. Bergsten and others were quick to note that despite the decline against the world's strongest currencies, the dollar is far from weak. Economic recovery at home and continued recession or sluggish conditions in Europe and elsewhere in the industrialized world have been the leading forces behind the dollar's rise against other leading currencies.
As long as the yen continues to rise against the dollar, pressure from Japan's private sector on Tokyo to do something about the trade surplus will probably intensify. And that, the analysts said, is almost certainly what Washington wants.
"The high yen is a source of enormous pressure on Japanese industry, whose profits are already being squeezed by recession at home," Mr. Hormats said.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS SUPPORTING NEW HAITIAN PLAN

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration expressed its support today for a new plan to end the crisis and military dictatorship in Haiti, but it criticized the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's exiled President, for not endorsing the plan.
Parliament members agreed on Friday in Washington to call on Father Aristide to name a new prime minister and form a broad-based Government that would pass legislation paving the way for restoring democracy and getting the military to step down. 
 Unable to hide the Administration's frustration with Father Aristide, a senior official faulted him today for refusing even to meet with the members of Parliament who drafted the plan.
It borrows many elements from an accord that Haiti's military and Father Aristide signed in July that called for restoring democracy in October. But when the deadline arrived, the military refused to cede power, leading to the resumption of a fuel and arms embargo on Haiti.
A senior Administration official said the new plan was important because the embargo alone would not force the military to relinquish power until the economy had totally crumbled.
"We feel if you only use sanctions, you destroy the country, and you don't build a lasting political solution," the official said.
Advisers to Father Aristide criticized the plan for not specifying when he would return to power and when the military would step down.
Michael Barnes, a former Maryland Congressman who is the Haitian leader's top American adviser, said the plan ignored the dangers a new government faced. "President Aristide would be reluctant to name a government under these circumstances because there is a good chance government officials would be killed, just as the Justice Minister was killed last year," he said.
Under the plan the new government would work with Parliament to pass a law that separated the military from the police and granted amnesty to those who carried out the 1991 coup that ousted President Aristide.
Then, the leader of the military, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, would be expected to retire, and Michel Francois, the police chief of Port-au-Prince and a coup leader, would be transferred to another position. Those moves would open the door to Father Aristide's return.
 
Why Aristide Is Balking
 Father Aristide's advisers said he was balking at the plan because he saw no reason why it would cause the military leaders to step down.
But Administration officials said right-wing members of Parliament who helped draft the plan indicated they were confident that the embargo was biting so hard that the military would be ready to step down if the plan was carried out.
Some officials involved in the Haiti talks speculated that Father Aristide feared that any new government would be more conservative than he is and might shunt him aside.
Two of the Haitian Parliament members who were instrumental in drafting the plan are considered possible candidates for prime minister. One is Victor Benoit, President Aristide's Education Minister and head of the left-of-center Konakom party. The other is Julio Larosiliere, a conservative Senator with close ties to the business sector.
In interviews today, several of Father Aristide's advisers faulted the Clinton Administration for not moving faster to urge the United Nations to tighten the trade embargo. "That is precisely the wrong message to send to the thugs who continue to kill people every day in Haiti," Mr. Barnes said.
American officials said the United States, France, Canada and Venezuela had agreed on the text of a resolution that would make the embargo mandatory around the world and essentially ban all but food and medicine from entering Haiti.

HEADLINE: Leader of House Arms Panel to Visit North Korea

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
As a deadline in the Administration's standoff with North Korea looms, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee is to travel there this week on a secretly arranged trip at the invitation of the Government of Kim Il Sung.
In a brief telephone conversation today, the chairman, Representative Ronald V. Dellums, declined to comment on the trip. But Administration officials said Mr. Dellums hoped to help defuse the dispute over North Korea's nuclear weapon programs. 
 Mr. Dellums sought and received White House approval for the visit, which comes just before the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors meets in Vienna on Feb. 21. Unless North Korea allows a thorough inspection of its nuclear sites by then, the agency is expected to refer the issue to the United Nations Security Council for the imposition of sanctions.
It was unclear if Mr. Dellums, a liberal California Democrat who assumed control of the committee from Les Aspin last year, would carry a written message from President Clinton to Kim Il Sung. But the 12-term lawmaker received an extensive briefing from an array of Government experts on North Korea last Saturday.
"Dellums is not an emissary from the Administration, but he obviously knows our views," a senior Administration official said.
Mr. Dellums becomes the latest of a short list of American lawmakers who have visited North Korea.
Stephen J. Solarz, a former New York Congressman who headed the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia and Pacific affairs, visited in 1980 and 1991 to discuss reducing tensions on the Korean peninsula and urge North Korean compliance with nuclear treaties.
Senator Robert C. Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, visited North Korea in 1991 and 1992 to discuss an accounting of Americans still listed as missing from the Korean War.
Representative Gary Ackerman, a New York Democrat who succeeded Mr. Solarz as head of the House Foreign Affairs panel, visited last October, the last American lawmaker to do so.
Mr. Dellums received his invitation from Pyongyang in late December or early January, and told Administration officials he would like to accept it during the Congressional recess this week, said one senior Administration official.
But Mr. Dellums told White House officials that he would only go if they had no objections, and that his visit remained unpublicized. "He didn't want to be a cowboy on this," a Defense Department official said.
No Government agency objected and the Administration quietly arranged the briefing with diplomatic, military and intelligence experts. Only a small number of Administration and Congressional officials were told of Mr. Dellums's plan, these officials said today.
North Korea's invitation to Mr. Dellums is intriguing. While well versed on an array of national security issues from his long tenure on the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Dellums has said very little publicly on the Korean nuclear dispute in the past year.
Indeed, Mr. Dellums has kept a relatively low-profile in his first year as committee chairman, focusing on running the panel and working with his Senate counterparts to produce a military budget. Aides say that Mr. Dellums intends to stake out more public positions on foreign affairs and the Administration's long-range war-fighting strategy and budget that Mr. Aspin unveiled last year.
"Peace is my passion," is one of Mr. Dellums's favorite adages, and some Administration officials said today that North Korea may consider Mr. Dellums more receptive or understanding of its nuclear position than the Administration.
An Administration official said Mr. Dellums plans to leave as early as Tuesday, fly commercially to Seoul and travel by land to the demilitarized zone between the North and South.
In Pyongyang, Mr. Dellums is expected to meet with the North Korean leader and his top advisers. A Foreign Service officer familiar with North Korea is expected to accompany Mr. Dellums, who will return to Washington this weekend or early next week.

HEADLINE: Housing Chief Wields A Wrecking-Ball Plan

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Vincent Lane is the chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority, a post that is a lot like being the engineer of a train wreck. Every time he turns around something is going wrong, someone is angry with him, another car is flying off the track.
But after nearly six years as chairman, Mr. Lane has become one of the brightest stars in the nation's galaxy of public housing officials. He is a pragmatist, a businessman, a black role model, a registered Democrat with the soul of a Republican, a man who says he is willing to try almost anything to turn his dreary and dangerous patch of urban America into a safe and shining home where the poor can rear their children instead of burying them. 
 As he sees it, he is locked in a battle between peril and promise, and peril has a 30-year head start. The outcome could shape the future of public housing across the nation, and that worries his critics, who believe that his vision of progress disguises a prospect of more hardship and displacement for the poor.
 
Goal Is to Shrink
 Mr. Lane, 51, says he believes he can save public housing by shrinking it -- both the bureaucracy and the buildings -- beginning with the authority's vertical slums at the Cabrini Green development on the near North Side.
Backed by the local, state and Federal governments, he plans to demolish three buildings at Cabrini and maybe two other tattered projects closest to expanding neighborhoods of wealth. The plan calls for the cleared land to be leased by private developers to build groups of low-rise buildings whose residents would be 75 percent middle class and 25 percent poor. Cabrini's remaining buildings would be renovated and integrated with working-class families. So far, $50 million in Federal money has been set aside for the project, which is expected to cost $350 million in government and private money.
Since not all of Cabrini's 7,000 tenants could be accommodated, some would be moved elsewhere in the city and the suburbs. No one, Mr. Lane stressed, would leave until replacement housing was built or purchased.
At least that is the plan. Community advocates, tenants and others are more cynical.
"Obviously, the ultimate goal is to depopulate the area of African-American people and repopulate it with middle-class whites," said Robert Starks, associate professor of political science and inner-city studies at Northeastern Illinois University. "It's basically a land grab issue."
But Douglas S. Massey, a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago and a co-author of "American Apartheid" (Harvard University Press, 1993), said: "I think it's good for everybody. It should be a model for the elimination of this subsidized ghetto that has been frozen in concrete for 30 years. The conditions in these high-rise projects are ghastly."
 
Trouble Delivering Basics
 Developers have long lusted after the land, especially the 70 acres that is Cabrini Green, perhaps the country's most infamous housing project but not even Chicago's most troubled. It receives so much attention because it is just a few blocks from the glitter of the Magnificent Mile shopping district.
For Mr. Lane, the land is the only bargaining chip his poor tenants have.
"You can't rely on charity and altruism," he said. "They're here today and gone tomorrow. But self-interest is here forever. It will make people do a lot of things."
Whatever the future holds for Chicago public housing, first Mr. Lane and his 150,000 mostly black and desperately poor tenants will have to survive the present.
With more trouble than money, Mr. Lane says, his agency cannot always deliver the basics. The city has sued Mr. Lane's agency five times this wicked winter for not providing adequate heat to some project buildings.
The American Civil Liberties Union has also sued Mr. Lane, essentially saying he used the Constitution as a floor mat in the name of order when he sent in the police without warrants to search hundreds of apartments for weapons.
He has been called Uncle Tom and worse. But many of his colleagues call him a role model. Robert L. Armstrong, president of the National Association of Housing Redevelopment Officials, which represents 3,300 housing authorities, said Mr. Lane had brought fresh ideas to public housing.
"I believe," Mr. Armstrong said, "that he will have some long-term impact on the housing industry in general and in Chicago in particular. But the problems were so bad when he took it over that it will be quite some time before you see the real effect of what he's doing."
 
'This Is a Revolution'
 When he took the job in 1988, Mr. Lane inherited a haunted house of prejudice and failed policy.
Chicago's was perhaps one of the worst housing authorities in the country, he said, a sprawling system built largely in the 1950's and 60's to keep the poor tenants as far as possible from the centers of power and wealth yet close enough to find on Election Day -- an example of what Professor Massey calls American apartheid.
"The conditions I found were like third world," Mr. Lane said. "I'm trying to change the physical and spiritual environment of public housing forever. This is a revolution."
But even revolutionaries need a break.
Frank Sinatra was on the juke box late last month at Rico's, a trendy restaurant on the city's near West Side and an outpost for an expanding settlement of young professionals and powerful institutions hungry for land. It was the end of a long day for Mr. Lane, who sat sipping red wine and listening to "My Way," a metaphor for his life as chairman. Ten minutes earlier, he had been describing his vision of the future to 200 residents at the ABLA Homes, a public housing project, shrouded in snow and poverty, a few blocks away.
The meeting had gone well. No one had called Mr. Lane any names, even after telling the tenants that demolishing their apartments to make room for private development was their best shot at a "normal American life."
If they did not begin to plan and bargain now, he warned, market forces and land-hungry developers would surely roll over them, leaving them in the cold with nothing but bad memories.
The tenants, who already have plenty of bad memories, did not look happy about what they were hearing. The chairman had just used the dreaded D-word -- demolition -- but it could also stand for displacement and discrimination.
"Mr. Lane," a woman said, rising slowly to her feet, "we're all a little frightened."
He replied: "I know. But we can't keep patching these raggedy buildings together forever."
The next night, he made his case again at Henry Horner Homes, a weary project on the West Side.
He uses any edge he can get in his campaign. His race, he acknowledges, can be a shield and a sword. "The tenants would be ticked off if a white man said some of the things I say," Mr. Lane said with a sad laugh and another sip of wine. "Like when I say that sometimes we are our own worst enemies."
On the stump, "choice" and "privatization" are his mantra. Controversy is his fate. "I can't seem to let things settle down," he said.
Just this month he awarded a contract to a private security company owned by a senior member of the Nation of Islam to help protect, manage and heal one of the city's toughest housing projects, the Rockwell Gardens, on the West Side. The negotiations began long before the recent uproar over the anti-Semitic remarks made by a high-ranking Nation of Islam aide, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, who was dismissed this month by Louis Farrakhan, the group's leader. But Mr. Lane forged ahead.
"A lot of my friends are Jewish," he said. "But I know one thing: I was out at the Joliet Correctional Center and I saw Muslims working with the hard-core criminals and doing miracles. I want to see if they can do that for me at Rockwell. I'd rather deal with some people being offended by them being here than deal with these burials we have to deal with every other day."
Mr. Lane, who is divorced and has three grown children, was an infant when his family moved from Mississippi to Chicago, and he was reared on a block of working-class families right across the street from a housing development on the South Side. The housing project was as neat as the rest of the neighborhood.
So he can remember a time when public housing was not the prison of despair and decay it has become.
And it is that memory that keeps him getting back on the train.

HEADLINE: A Call for Economic Intervention by Government

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
President Clinton's economists want the Government to do more to tweak the economy, addressing areas like health care and technological research where they think the free market has failed.
They put forward their most comprehensive version of this view today, releasing their first annual Economic Report to Congress, a book-length document mandated by Congress since 1946. 
 While recent reports by Republican administrations have broadly criticized the Government, contending it played too great a role in the economy, today's document calls for a lower threshold for Government intervention. Instead of the typical Republican chapter bemoaning the price of Government regulation, the Democratic economists have a chapter entitled "Microeconomic initiatives to promote efficiency and productivity." They would have the Administration spend money on manufacturing research, to fight monopolies and to force companies to pay for their pollution.
"I think there is something different about the whole tone of this," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the report's main author. "There is a lot here implicitly about the role for the Government to do something that would be beneficial to the future performers of the economy, not harmful."
 
Republicans Disappointed
 Some Republicans say they are disappointed. "That was my special baby -- we had a special section on regulatory," said Murray L. Weidenbaum, who was President Reagan's first chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and is now an economics professor at Washington University in St. Louis.
Republican versions of the annual report called for two tests to be met before governmental action could be justified: first, markets have failed to produce optimal results -- as, for example, when only sick people buy health insurance -- and second, Government action must be demonstrably better than private sector action.
Today's report tends to include the first test but says less about the second. The report is optimistic that intervention can work once market failures are identified.
For example, both last year's economic report, released a week before President George Bush left office, and this year's identify a problem in health care insurance: sick people tend to buy the most comprehensive health plans, while healthy people tend to buy more modest plans or forgo insurance. This problem of adverse selection means that comprehensive insurance may be difficult to obtain, because insurance companies are afraid it will be used heavily.
The last Bush Administration report called for modest steps to tackle this issue. The Clinton report is stronger in calling for Government intervention, saying: "By compelling all insurers to cover pre-existing conditions and by eliminating limitations on lifetime payments, the Government could reduce the adverse selection problem in private insurance markets and thereby improve how they function."
But this year's report, while different in many ways from the Republican versions, is also much more cautious than some liberal Democratic prescriptions for broader Government involvement in the economy. Republican critics contend that the Administration has already adopted these liberal solutions, saying the Administration's plans for extra research spending amount to an industrial policy. Even some officials, like Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary, have suggested this was the case.
This report studiously avoids any such stand. "I think industrial policy has a particular meaning, which I don't think is very characteristic of what we are doing," Ms. Tyson said.
 
Some Free Markets Cheered
 And there are many places where the report shows an enthusiasm for free markets that work well. For example, the report includes a scathing criticism of laws aimed at stopping dumping, a practice in which foreign companies sell goods here for less than they are sold at home or for less than they cost to produce. The antidumping laws allow American companies to seek steep tariffs on low-priced foreign goods that cause them financial injury.
"Both in the United States and elsewhere, antidumping laws go beyond preventing anticompetitive practices -- which should be their rationale -- and often have the effect of protecting domestic industries from foreign competition," the report says. "For example, a recent study found that, during the Reagan Administration, nontariff barriers including antidumping actions probably reduced U.S. manufactured imports by around a fifth -- largely by discouraging foreign producers from entering the U.S. market or by discouraging those that do export here from lowering their prices."
The early draft of the report had even stronger language, which was watered down after a strong interagency protest from the Office of the United States Trade Representative, a Federal official who requested anonymity said.
 
Kantor Defends Laws
 Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, has been a defender of these laws as a way to combat collusive foreign practices that are hard to address with American antitrust laws.
Ms. Tyson personally wrote much of the trade chapter, while her two colleagues on the council, Joseph E. Stiglitz and Alan S. Blinder, helped write other chapters.
One of the biggest internal debates each year concerns the color of the annual report's cover. The reason, said Michael Boskin, who ran the council for President Bush, is that the council's economists and secretaries, "get sweatshirts and T-shirts and coffee mugs, and they sort of like it to be a color that hasn't been around for a year or two." The staff members pay for these color-coordinated accessories themselves. This year's cover is a fashionable teal blue.

HEADLINE: Along Digital Path, Dead-End Jobs

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
When Richard Baldomar of Flatbush, Brooklyn, was laid off in July 1991 after 14 years offering help over the phone as an A.T.& T. customer service representative, he -- like many of his peers -- assumed his experience at one of the world's leading telecommunications companies would open a lot of doors.
To enhance his chances for work in the rapidly changing communications industry, Mr. Baldomar finished his bachelor's degree in media studies at St. Francis College in Brooklyn. But now, after several months seeking customer-service jobs from communications companies as diverse as Time Warner, MCI and Metromedia, and even branching into other fields by approaching Hertz, Chemical Bank and Wells Fargo, Mr. Baldomar has concluded that his $28,000-a-year A.T.& T. job may not be convertible currency.
 
85,100 Lost Jobs
 "It did help me with initial contacts and put me in the first level of applicants," said Mr. Baldomar, 54. "But after that, nothing." He is now studying video production at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan. 
 Mr. Baldomar's case is far from unique. In the last 16 months, the nation's telephone companies have announced plans to shed 85,100 jobs, and experts say that many of those laid off will have trouble finding work, even though the telecommunications industry is rapidly growing.
This seeming contradiction stems from the fact that the telephone industry, feeling competitive pressure from cable television companies and other new rivals, is cutting costs by shedding layers of management and continuing to adopt automated, computerized network technology.
That means fewer maintenance people and telephone operators and fewer middle managers to keep track of them. And as the nation's communications system heads toward a future in which television programs, phone calls and computer services all mingle as digital bits of data pulsing through a single pipeline into American households, the workers whose skills are specific to running a plain old phone network may have trouble hitching a ride on the vaunted "information superhighway."

 
 
Not Very Portable

 
 "The jobs are not nearly as transferable as they thought they would be," said Laura Unger, president of Local 1150 of the Communications Workers of America in Manhattan. The local chapter, which represents workers at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, had shrunk from 2,600 members to fewer than 1,000 in the last three years -- even before A.T.& T. announced Thursday that it would shed 15,000 additional jobs over the next two years. About a third of the new layoffs will come at or around the company's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J.
Ms. Unger said that in past layoffs, clerical workers who earned about $25,000 a year and technicians who earned more than $40,000 were among those who had the most trouble finding jobs.
With all of the large phone companies announcing big job cuts in recent months, including A.T.& T.'s announcement last week, there are few cloistered workplaces left among the biggest companies in this once-stable industry. Since September, U S West said it would cut 9,000 positions, Pacific Telesis announced it would eliminate 10,000 jobs, GTE said it would cut 17,000 positions, and Nynex said it would shed 16,800 jobs in New York and New England.
Clerical, blue-collar and white-collar jobs are all being eliminated, creating markedly different challenges in finding work, even at lower pay. But all of the displaced workers share the dread that a telephone industry career may have prepared them for little else.
In particular, the thousands of managers whose positions are being eliminated from the phone companies will find stiff competition for jobs, whether inside or outside the telecommunications business. There are simply too many managers chasing too few jobs. A survey of 870 companies by the American Management Association last year found that for the first time the companies that cut jobs shed more salaried workers than hourly employees. Indeed, more than half of the cuts announced by A.T.& T. last week will be white-collar jobs.
And even as the telephone people swell the ranks of the job seekers, their situation may portend an uneasy employment future in other once-stable industries, where regulated monopolies may give way to competitive markets.
"You're going to see exactly the same situation in the electric power business," predicted Robert M. Tomasko, author of "Rethinking the Corporation" and a consultant with Arthur D. Little Inc. "You're seeing the beginnings of the consolidation of a lot more power companies." Mr. Tomasko also predicts a similar job shakeout in the health care industry.
Still, in many ways, the employees who are laid off from the largest phone companies have several advantages over workers dismissed from other industries. A.T.& T., for example, has an outplacement service that provides career counseling and training in interviewing skills and that prints professional-looking resumes at no cost to employees. A.T.& T. employees can also continue working at the company for many months, drawing down their severance pay while they look for jobs within the company or at other concerns.
"On paper, it looks very good," said Ms. Unger of the Communications Workers union.
 
 
New Opportunities
 Moreover, new opportunities for some types of work may open up. The largest phone companies are expected to invest as much as $50 billion in the next five years to build advanced networks that carry new voice and video services. Pacific Telesis in San Francisco, for example, has announced plans to spend $16 billion over seven years on a video network to serve many California markets.
Although the phone companies spend considerable sums each year to upgrade their equipment, laying the groundwork for the new technology will require them to spend more than they have historically. The Pacific Telesis plan, for example, calls for the company to spend $400 million a year over current levels.
Many analysts say the telephone job cuts were overdue, a delay made possible by the fact that the cash-rich phone companies were able to wait until they finally felt compelled to take action. The timing should mean, at the least, that many telephone workers will be hunting for work in an economy that is growing rather than shrinking or stagnant.
"If there is a time you've got to pick for losing a job, this is a good year," said Mr. Tomasko, the author and consultant.
 
 
MFS Is Hiring
 Many people who are losing their jobs at the established phone companies are looking for work at concerns like the MFS Communications Company, a telecommunications services company in Omaha. MFS provides local and long-distance phone service to corporate customers in competition with the traditional phone companies.
Some telephone people are indeed finding jobs as MFS expands. The company hired 500 people last year -- roughly 80 percent coming from the telephone industry -- and it expects to hire 500 to 1,000 people a year for the next three years. But James Q. Crowe, MFS's chairman, noted that despite the rapid growth of his company and other advanced technology start-ups, there would be a lag before enough jobs opened up to accommodate many of the displaced phone workers.
"Even if it doubles every 18 months, it will be some period of time before we will see large numbers of jobs created," he said.
And not all displaced phone workers are seen as equally valuable. Many telephone company workers seeking new work, for example, will be hamstrung by the cradle-to-grave mentality that long pervaded the phone industry. That culture is not nearly as ingrained as it was before the Bell System was broken up a decade ago, but it has not disappeared altogether. Some A.T.& T. clerical workers laid off in early rounds of job cuts, for example, have had trouble finding new work because they are skilled at using computer systems found only at A.T.& T.
"If they can't think outside of what they've been doing for all these years," said John J. Parkington, a consultant at the Wyatt Company in San Francisco, who has done consulting work for several telecommunications companies, "the transition to new employment will be very difficult."

HEADLINE: Clinton Faces Pressure to Remove Health Plan's Provision on Early Retirees

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
The sudden need to carve savings out of its health care plan is putting pressure on the Clinton Administration to drop or scale back its proposal that the Government assume companies' costs of health care coverage for early retirees.
Eliminating that provision could save more than half of the increase in the deficit that the Congressional Budget Office foresaw from President Clinton's plan. 
 The budget office analysis made public last week concluded that instead of reducing the deficit by $58 billion in five years, as the Administration predicted, the plan would increase the deficit by $134 billion over 10 years before it began saving the Government money.
That has prompted a search for economies both within the Administration and among its supporters on Capitol Hill. One of the biggest savings would be eliminating the coverage for early retirees already covered by their former employers. It was inserted into the plan in an effort to win the support of major companies, especially auto, steel and aircraft manufacturers with big health care liabilities for former workers aged 55 to 65. At 65, the workers become eligible for Medicare.
Many Administration supporters on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have contended that big manufacturers have been ungrateful and have not supported the plan as much as this boon to them would seem to demand. That impression was heightened this month as three major business groups -- the Business Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce -- spurned the Clinton plan.
But most supporters are reluctant to call for dropping the retirees provision because those companies' unions also have a strong stake in that proposal, and the unions have been solidly behind Mr. Clinton.
A Congressional Budget Office official said in an interview last week that the retirees provision would save business $85 billion through the year 2004, and cost the Government the same amount. He declined to disclose year-by-year projections that could be compared with the Administration's estimate that the plan would cost $14.8 billion through the year 2000.
The budget office report itself said this provision would cost $15 billion a year in 2004. The costs of the program, which would begin in 1996, increase gradually. In the first three years, under the Clinton plan, employers would have to continue paying part of their contractual payments.
The savings are inviting. Such a loyal Clinton supporter as Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, said, "I think we ought to look at it."
Stronger comments came from two other leading Congressional figures on health care whom the Administration counts on having with it eventually, Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, and Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California.
Senator Chafee, who led the Senate Republican health care task force that produced a bill calling for universal coverage by requiring individuals, not employers, to buy coverage, said these cost estimates showed the provision was "even worse than I originally thought it was."
 
'Generous Beyond Belief'
 He said he had never seen why "some drill press operator in Providence, Rhode Island, who is working quite near the minimum wage should have to pay taxes to relieve General Motors of the obligation it freely entered into."
Mr. Stark, chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on health, said the budget office's numbers showed that this provision was "generous beyond belief." Unlike Mr. Chafee, he did not call for killing the proposal outright, but said, "It is very unlikely that this provision, in its very generous form, will survive."
The health subcommittee may be the first to vote on any form of the Clinton bill. Mr. Stark said he might support a greatly reduced version of the subsidy to companies that are now obliged by contract to provide health insurance to early retirees.
At the White House, the spokeswoman for health care, Lorrie McHugh, defended the provision. She said workers who retire at 55 worry that they may not retain health insurance, even if their former employers now insure them. She called the provision "insurance against insurance company discrimination."
"There is no denying that this is a benefit for those corporations that have gone an extra mile in guaranteeing coverage for their employees," Ms. McHugh said. "But the real beneficiaries are those Americans who have worked hard all their lives and are now finding it difficult to obtain coverage that is affordable."
 
In Trouble From the Start
 But she argued that about 60 percent of the nine million early retirees were not insured by their former employers, and that it was important for the Government to assume coverage of people 55 and over who were not part of a working household. Under the Clinton plan, the Government would pay 80 percent of the insurance costs for those people. In working households, employers pay that 80 percent.
Insurance for early retirees has seemed to be in trouble from the start, even though Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Administration's chief health care advocate, had strongly defended it in hearings.
For example, Mrs. Clinton told Senator Chafee at the Finance Committee on Sept. 30 that the provision was important for two reasons. First, she said, many companies were abrogating or reducing their promised benefits to early retirees. Second, she said, "those companies that are continuing to provide retiree benefits are doing so at an extraordinary cost that we think should be more broadly shared by the general public."
Even so, Administration officials acknowledge that they will have to go along with some cost reductions in the program so that the Congressional Budget Office will consider it neutral or favorable in its impact on the deficit.
As Mr. Daschle told reporters on Tuesday, "It sure would be easy to trim the budget with that."

HEADLINE: California Loads Sprayers, Fearing Return of the Medfly

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CORONA, Calif., Feb. 14

 BODY:
At 9 P.M. Tuesday, a squadron of helicopters is to begin spraying the neighborhoods, parks, schools and farms of this Riverside County community 45 miles east of Los Angeles, with the insecticide malathion in a much-disputed effort to save California's $18 billion-a-year agriculture industry from the Mediterranean fruit fly.
If the spraying is successful -- preventing the insect's return in this area -- it will represent a small victory in the state's 20-year war to eradicate the Medfly, which lays eggs in fruit and vegetables, causing them to rot and become unfit for sale. 
 But state officials said that even if they never win the war, they must win this battle against the latest outbreak of the Medfly here in some of the state's richest farmland or risk a devastating quarantine of all California produce from states and nations that have not been infested.
Japan and other countries have threatened to impose an embargo if the state does not eliminate the pest, which has reappeared after a four-year absence.
The pestilence has been persistent and relatively long-term. Medflies have been caught in one of every three cities in Los Angeles County since 1975, and their range has extended from San Jose more than 400 miles south to Orange County and east to San Bernardino.
Environmentalists and local officials have tried to stop the spraying because of what they see as a potential health threat from the pesticide. William P. Workman, assistant city manager of Corona, said today that it had filed a petition with the California Supreme Court this morning seeking an immediate halt to the spraying.
Mr. Workman said California officials had not shown the city any documentation that the Japanese would impose a quarantine. "It's very frustrating to be at the end of this dog wagging a malathion tail," he said.
Carl DeWing, a spokesman for the California Department of Agriculture, said, "We are under pressure from our trading partners to stop the spread of the Medfly, and just like the earthquake, floods, and hurricanes, we are in a state of economic emergency to resolve this thing."
State officials and economists said that a quarantine on California fruit and vegetables would deliver a potentially lethal blow to the state's fragile economy, which has been depressed by big layoffs in the aerospace and weapons industries and a sharp decline in real estate prices, and hurt further by natural disasters including the recent Los Angeles earthquake.
Phillip Romero, chief economist for Gov. Pete Wilson of California, said that an embargo on the state's produce could potentially cost $6.2 billion a year in exports, $1.6 billion from foreign markets and the rest from other states.
At greatest risk is the $300 million a year that comes from exports to Japan. A senior official of the United States Department of Agriculture in Tokyo warned last month in a letter to the deputy administrator of the plant protection and quarantine division that the Japanese were "becoming very uncomfortable" over the discovery in December of a pregnant Medfly in Corona. As before, there have been sightings of other flies elsewhere in the state.
 
Differing Anxiety Levels
 The official, Ralph R. Iwamoto, director of the Tokyo office of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, expressed belief that the detection of a Medfly in a commercial production area would cause the Japanese "to change their quarantine regulations and put a ban on imports of Medfly host commodities from the whole state of California."
"This will trigger similar actions by other Asian countries at a great loss to the producers and exporters in California," Mr. Iwamoto said in the letter, which was provided to The New York Times by California agriculture officials.
The Japanese, he said, believed that "aerial spraying is imperative to stop the spread of Medfly and cause a turn of events to prevent the quarantine ban on California."
A lower-key response came today from a Japanese official in Los Angeles. Akihiko Nishiyama, an Agriculture Ministry representative at the Japanese Consulate there, said that while Japan was concerned about Medfly infestation in California, it would not, as a matter of policy, make any demands that a particular means of eradication be used.
Asked if his Government had threatened to embargo California fruit if the Medfly were not eradicated, Mr. Nishiyama replied, "As far as I know, Japan has not said such a threatening thing."
 
Connected Reprisals
 But Jerry Siebert, agricultural resource economist at the University of California at Berkeley, said today that "the Japanese play hardball when it comes to trade, and the Medfly provides them with a good reason to close down produce markets."
Referring to reports from Washington that the Clinton Administration had decided to authorize certain telecommunications sanctions against Japan, he added, "Given the current state of trade relations between the two countries, I believe the Japanese will jump at the chance to quarantine."
Mr. Romero, the economist in Governor Wilson's office, estimates that the loss of the Japanese market would cost the state 6,100 jobs and the loss of all foreign markets would eliminate 35,300 jobs. About half of those would be in agriculture and the other half in related fields.
"If California produce is not available, foreign buyers will find it somewhere else," Mr. Romero said, "and it could take years for us to regain lost markets if we are quarantined."
Among countries or territories that might follow Japan in quarantining California produce, according to growers in this area, are South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Australia. China, which recently began importing apples from Washington, has already quarantined California produce because of the Medfly.
 
Plenty of Housing
 There are more than 200 agricultural products that can serve as host for the Medfly, including oranges, grapefruit, avocados, strawberries, peaches, plums, nectarines, table and wine grapes and dates.
In battling the fly, state and Federal agriculture agencies spent more than $200 million from 1975 through 1993, using a variety of methods from quarantines to releasing sterile fruit flies. The Federal and state governments have split the cost equally.
Aerial spraying of malathion has been successful in eradicating the Medfly in Florida, but spraying in California has proved far less effective. The fly continues to spread into orange and grapefruit groves in some of the region's richest farmland, like in Riverside County.
State officials and growers said they think main reason the Medfly continues to thrive in California is the arrival of infected fruit and vegetables, typically in travelers' luggage. Agriculture officials regularly confiscate fruit from passengers arriving at Los Angeles International Airport.
William K. Quarles, president of the California-Arizona Citrus League, said his group was pressing for stricter Federal regulations preventing people from bringing in fruit. "Certainly, no one wants to encourage the use of any of these pesticide materials," he said, "but somehow, some way, this fly must be eradicated."
 
All for One Fertile Fly?
 Opponents of aerial spraying here in Corona say that the discovery of one fly in December does not justify the spraying of 18 miles of city blocks. Although no long-term health studies have been conducted on malathion, residents are concerned about the long-term effects of the pesticide and have organized protests. The City Council has taken the state to court to block the aerial spraying.
The last aerial spraying of malathion in Southern California was done for 100 nights four years ago over 500 square miles of Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties. Hundreds of people complained of respiratory problems and rashes, but the state said that tests conducted after spraying showed that malathion could not be blamed for most of the complaints.
State officials advise people with conditions like asthma or allergies to remain indoors during the spraying.

HEADLINE: Motorola, Long a Backer of Sanctions

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 14

 BODY:
It is not a surprise to see Motorola Inc. emerging as the first testing ground in the developing trade dispute between the United States and Japan. Motorola has long been a leading proponent in corporate America of the necessity of using sanctions to pry open Japanese markets and protect domestic ones from unfair import competition.
"We cannot allow our competition to have a sanctuary," Robert Galvin, then Motorola's chairman, said in a 1989 interview with Business Week that summed up more than a decade of battling in Tokyo and Washington to level the trade playing field. 
 Motorola, a microchip and telecommunications company based in Schaumberg, Ill., is the market leader in cellular telephones in the United States, and along with L. M. Ericsson of Sweden is also a leader in the European market.
In Japan the company's analog cellular service has picked up 49 percent of the Osaka region market. The fact that the same service has picked up just 10,000 subscribers in the far larger Tokyo-Nagoya corridor, compared with nearly one million for the Japanese systems market by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's state-owned telecommunications company, and Nippon Ido Taushin, has been cited by Motorola as evidence that Japan is preventing free competition.
The dispute traces to the Japanese Government's decision to assign the license to develop Motorola's technology to Nippon Ido, which was already committed to using a Japanese system and has been slow to invest in the infrastructure necessary to make the Motorola technology appealing.
Motorola's most visible success in Japan has been in pagers, and it came after a long battle to win acceptance. After years of resistance from Nippon Telegraph, Motorola has become Nippon's biggest supplier of the devices. It has sold more than one million of them.
 
Tariff Protections Won
 Motorola's most significant assist from Washington in combating Japanese trade practices came in the early 1980's, when it convinced the Commerce Department that Japanese manufacturers were illegally dumping pagers and cellular telephones in the United States. It won tariff protections of up to 106 percent.
Although the Japansese cellular phone market is one of the most important foreign cellular markets, the revenues involved in this dispute are not enough to play a major factor in the investment outlook for the company, some analysts said. But James L. Barlage, who follows Motorola for Smith Barney Shearson, does fret that investors might irrationally sell Motorola stock if they begin to fear that it will be at the heart of a trade war.
Over all, however, Japan plays a significant role in the company's earnings, accounting for about $930 million of the $13.3 billion in revenues in 1992, the last year for which regional sales statistics are available.
More importantly, by committing itself to match or top Japanese manufacturing quality, Motorola emerged during the 1980's as one of the nation's most highly respected manufacturers and the first winner of the Federal Government's Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award.
Motorola's combative attitude is based on profound respect. Motorola executives repeatedly toured Japan in the 1980's seeking partners for various ventures and studying Japanese manufacturing techniques. Mr. Galvin developed friendships with several Japanese businessmen, most notably Akio Morita, the man who built Sony into a multinational electronics equipment powerhouse.
Motorola helped Japanese industry get back on its feet in the 1950's after World War II, responding to President Dwight D. Eisenhower's urgings that American companies buy more Japanese products. But the resurgent Japanese companies played a major role in driving Motorola out of the television business -- it sold its Quasar line to Matsushita -- and even the car radio business that had given the company its name and first major product during the 1930's. During the 1980's, the company decided to fight back rather than give in when the Japanese attacked.
Trade battles have not prevented Motorola from forming alliances with Japanese companies. It has a joint manufacturing operation with Toshiba Inc. that markets Motorola semiconductors in Japan and provides Motorola with memory chips and chip technology. That agreement helped lift Motorola's semiconductor sales in Japan from 1 percent of Motorola's chip business in 1975 to more than 11 percent in 1992, or $522 million, according to Dataquest Inc, a market research firm.

Big Trade Deficit With Japan: Some Think It's No Problem

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
"America's trade deficit with Japan is not very popular with the American people or the American Government," President Clinton allowed at the news conference with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan in which the two agreed to disagree over trade. "It's hard to explain it, year in year out, always getting bigger," he added.
Most economists would undoubtedly agree with Mr. Clinton that mega-deficits are not popular, nor easy to explain to the great majority of Americans who prefer their economics lessons in easy-to-swallow gel caps. But it is equally safe to say that few economists think the chronic trade deficit with Japan is a problem in itself worth much of a fuss -- or, for that matter, an economic problem at all.
 
 
Individual Complaints
 This does not necessarily mean that individual American exporters don't have a legitimate gripe with the Japanese: Motorola may encounter a lot of static when it tries to sell mobile phones in Tokyo, and Chrysler may hit a brick wall when the company tries to sign up dealers for its nifty little Neon runabout. But there is no reason to believe that free trade nirvana -- an entirely open world trading system -- would balance the Japanese-American account or even change it measurably. 
 "The Japanese may be giving American exporters a hard time, but the bilateral deficit is not evidence of it," said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
By the same token, economists generally reject the idea that America's chronic trade deficit with the world (or Japan's chronic surplus) is linked to anyone's trade policy. "America runs a deficit because Americans spend more than they produce at home," said Gary Saxonhouse, a University of Michigan specialist in the Japanese economy. "We make up the difference in imports" -- or at least we do as long as foreigners are willing to finance the transactions.
The day may even come, Mr. Saxonhouse suggested, when America will regret demands that the Japanese spend more on themselves and lend less abroad to accommodate capital-scarce economies. "It would be better to build bridges in Tadjikistan that are badly needed than more back home in overbuilt Tohoku Province," he argued.
Start with the relatively easy part, the logic behind mainstream economists' near indifference to country-to-country deficits. "I have a chronic deficit with my barber, who doesn't buy a darned thing from me," said Mr. Solow, who still manages to get by selling his expertise to a university -- which sells him nothing in return. The economist is satisfied as long as he earns enough to pay his bills and save for a rainy day; to try to balance his accounts one by one with the butcher, baker and laptop computer maker would be nothing short of absurd.
Mr. Saxonhouse notes that Japan has virtually no energy or other natural resources of its own; much of its economy is devoted to manufacturing. Hence if, by accident or design, Japan were to buy exactly as much abroad as it sold each year, the island would almost certainly run surpluses with most countries (including America) that were not in the business of exporting oil.
Of course, Japan does not balance its trade with the rest of the world. It exports roughly a third more than it imports, making up the difference with loans to foreigners or direct foreign investment in factories, office buildings and the like. Wouldn't the trade surplus of Japan with America, along with its political problems, be smaller if Tokyo did what was necessary to pare its surplus with the world?
The answer is almost certainly yes. In 1989 and 1990, strong years for Japan's economy and weak ones for America's, the surplus of Japan with America fell roughly in proportion to the decline in its overall surplus.
That is why James Tobin, an economist at Yale University and another Nobel laureate in economics, argues that "the best thing Japan could do for us is to stimulate their economy," thereby sucking in more imports and giving Japan's traditionally export-minded manufacturers incentives to redirect their efforts toward the now-moribund home market.
 
A Diplomatic Deception
 This point has not been lost on the White House. Indeed, the sophisticated economists working for President Clinton quietly insist that they are engaged in a form of diplomatic sleight of hand, blustering about unfair Japanese trade practices so that Tokyo will be frightened into doing what many Japanese after all would want them to do anyway: spend more at home.
There's an immediate problem with this ostensible strategy, however: It has not worked. Japan's credit and monetary policy is already so loose that further loosening is apparently nearly pointless. What is more, the Ministry of Finance is deeply opposed to using deficit spending to increase domestic demand, and it has powerful political allies whose allegiances cut across the current reigning coalition and the out-of-office Liberal Democratic Party.
Thus when Prime Minister Hosokawa proposed a big three-year tax cut on the eve of his trip to Washington, he was forced to settle for a one-year reduction unlikely to bring Japan out of recession or bring down the trade deficit very much.
Badgering Tokyo to get its economy cooking may still work when the Japanese stop cheering Mr. Hosokawa for standing up to Uncle Sam and start remembering that fiscal stimulus is as much in Japan's interests as America's. But those who think that a reduction in America's deficit with Japan will make a significant difference in America's overall deficit with the world are probably mistaken, Mr. Tobin said.
 
Effect on U.S. Deficit Slight
 America's external deficit, remember, is the difference between what America produces and what it spends. Thus while a boom in Japanese demand may increase American exports, the change would be reflected in America's total deficit only if American output went up more than American domestic spending -- a possible but not especially likely occurrence.
There is another reason why keeping up the pressure on the Japanese to spend more like Americans could prove problematic, Mr. Solow said. It is one thing to encourage Japan to avoid recessions; it is quite another to accelerate the maturing economy's drift toward higher consumption and lower savings. For if Japan does not produce the flood of goods and good credit terms needed to finance the development of poor countries along with the renaissance of the former Soviet bloc, who will? Apparently not America, which itself has been feeding at Japan's credit trough.
In the final reckoning, Mr. Solow said, Japan's external deficit "is nobody else's business."
"All we can legitimately ask," he said, "is that they play fair on trade."
