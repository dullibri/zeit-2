HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Gap Widened to $6.97 Billion in April

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
The long-predicted plunge in American exports to the slowing economies of Japan and Western Europe finally took place in April, and the trade deficit widened to $6.97 billion, the Commerce Department reported today.
Only a modest increase in exports to poor and middle-income countries and a drop in imports from Japan and Canada prevented the overall deficit from expanding even further, from $5.58 billion a month earlier. Sales of American goods in Japan dropped 18.1 percent from March, while sales to Western Europe tumbled 13.6 percent. 
 Figures for any single month can be highly volatile, and a drop in aircraft exports and a rise in oil imports accounted for much of the deterioration. But trade experts were nonetheless surprised and disappointed that the deterioration had come so soon.
"For a long time, exports have been holding up whatever economic growth we've had," said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., the president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a liberal Washington research group. "And now, just when it's looking like the economy is getting going, the exports are losing steam. Shoot, why can't things all go right at the same time?"
Stephen S. Roach, senior economist for Morgan Stanley in New York, was more optimistic, pointing out that the United States now depends on Latin America and Southeast Asia for its growth in exports while sales to other rich countries bob up and down without showing strong trends in either direction.
The announcement of slumping exports to Japan came just a week after Tokyo announced its 17th consecutive increase in its monthly trade surplus, to $7.87 billion, and as the House is preparing to vote on a broad trade bill that would force the Bush Administration to pursue a more confrontational trade policy.
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan is due in Washington at the end of this month, and the White House is expected to play down conflicts that could embarrass President Bush before the November elections. President Bush's state visit to Tokyo in January turned into a public-relations disaster at home after trade issues came to the forefront, and both sides are eager to avoid a repeat of that experience by focusing on political and military issues this time.
Today's weak report is likely to sharpen the differences here over whether the trade gap is the fault of Japan or the United States, a debate that has droned on for more than 20 years with sometimes superficial changes.
How static the discussion has become was clear today at Congressional hearings and meetings on the nation's relations with Japan, including an appearance by Takakazu Kuriyama, the new Japanese Ambassador, before a luncheon of a group of lawmakers who advocate a more confrontational trade policy.
In his first appearance on Capitol Hill, Mr. Kuriyama was quick to chide the United States. "Your deficit, as you know, is not directly related to our surplus and has to be dealt with through macroeconomic management in this country," he said. "More and more people in this country are aware of it."
Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, immediately interjected, "A lot of it is our own fault, but a lot of it is your fault."
But Mr. Wolf then went on to ask Mr. Kuriyama about lobbying by Japanese companies in the United States, dropping the issue of how to reduce the trade deficit.
When a panel of Japan experts appeared this morning before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, the discussion this morning was similarly inconclusive and descriptive rather than prescriptive.
C. Michael Aho, the director of economic studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York, echoed the Japanese ambassador's remarks. "Our problems with Japan are home grown," he said. He elaborated later, saying, "What Japan is doing is exposing our weaknesses, in investment, in education, savings and all that."
James Fallows, an author and journalist, countered that the American trade deficit with Japan was not unique. "The Germans and the Koreans don't have the same problems dealing with their schools that we have, they do have the same problems dealing with Japan," he said.
Mr. Aho and Mr. Fallows agreed that the United States should pay more attention to Japan. But of the Joint Economic Committee's 20 members, only Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, and Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, bothered to show up for this morning's hearing.

HEADLINE: New Claims by Jobless Drop

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
The number of first-time claims for unemployment insurance edged down in early June, the Government said today in a report reflecting the painfully slow recovery.
The Labor Department said 407,000 Americans had filed applications for benefits, down from a revised 409,000 a week earlier. The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations. 
 Claims in the previous week had originally been estimated at 407,000. Economists expected an improvement to 400,000 to 405,000.
"It is beginning to look as if we have stagnated at these levels," said Steven Wood, an economist for Bank of America. The number of unemployment claims will have to drop, he said, to produce significant economic growth in the second half of the year.
A closely watched moving average of claims was 406,500 for the latest four-week period, the same as that for the four weeks ended a week earlier, which was a 19-month low.
The recent pause in improvement in the claims numbers does not foreshadow any immediate improvement in the unemployment rate, which jumped from 7.2 percent in April to an eight-year high of 7.5 percent in May.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Cuts Florio's Plan in Its Budget

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 18

 BODY:
The leaders of the Republican legislative majority announced today a $14.6 billion budget for 1993 that cuts Gov. Jim Florio's spending plan by $1.1 billion.
Reducing the Democratic administration's request for all but three departments and agencies -- the Personnel and Agriculture Departments and the Governor's office -- the Republicans made their cuts largely in programs intended to help the poor and the middle class. 
 The plan, submitted to the State Senate and the Assembly as a 216-page bill, would result in thousands of layoffs among middle managers and unionized workers alike.
 
Change and Fear
 "This budget is about change, which is why I expect it to receive criticism from those who support the status quo and fear change," said the Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian. "They want this budget to be everything to everyone, but the economic climate in our state does not permit that to be the case."
Under the State Constitution, the Legislature must present and the Governor must sign a balanced budget before July 1, the start of the fiscal year.
The Republicans, with two-thirds majorities in both houses of the Legislature, are expected to win approval of their plan easily. The Governor can delete items from the budget or try to persuade the Legislature to alter it, but he cannot restore any cuts.
After weeks of anticipation, members of both houses gathered today in the Assembly chamber to hear Mr. Haytaian and the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, deliver political speeches about the budget but offer no details.
 
'Betrayal' of Public Trust
 "The actions of this administration are a betrayal of the public trust," Mr. Haytaian said. "The Legislature has corrected the budget mistakes that have been made during the past two years and those that have been finally admitted during the past two days as well.
"And I have another message for our Treasurer and Governor: the Legislature is doing its part to solve our state's problems. It's time for you to stop sabotaging our efforts and to begin working in the best interest of our citizens."
Mr. Florio, who did not attend the joint session, issued a statement with a series of questions. "Is money being taken out of one pocket at the same time it's put in the other pocket?" he asked. "Is this a budget designed to be a solid blueprint for where New Jersey will go over the next 12 months, or is it something patched together to get us by through July 1?"
Wrangling over the budget is usually partisan, but the process has been especially bitter this year, and today's events were no exception. The speeches were clearly intended to put a Republican cast on the budget process and to deflect any blame for cuts toward Mr. Florio and his fellow Democrats.
 
'A Lot of Pain'
 One issue that quickly produced dispute was layoffs. Both Mr. Florio and the Republicans expect savings through the attrition of 2,500 jobs. In addition, the Republicans said their budget would result in 1,500 to 2,000 layoffs, mostly among managers, though some blue-collar workers would be affected. A senior administration official disputed those estimates, saying the total number of layoffs produced by the Republican budget would be closer to 7,500.
"It's a lot of pain for a penny," said Anthony Cimino, director of the State Personnel Department, recalling the Republicans' rollback of the sales tax to 6 percent from 7 percent last month, which cost the state $608 million in revenue.
Under the Republican budget, the Department of Human Services would lose nearly $190 million from the $3.7 billion Mr. Florio had requested. Included in the reduction is about $20 million in general-assistance services to the poor.
In many instances, the impact of the Republican plan is not so clear.
For example, the Republicans show what seems like a modest $5.5 million cut from Mr. Florio's $51.8 million request for the Public Advocate's office. But the bulk of the remaining money will go to the Public Defender's office, which is part of the Advocate's office. The savings are achieved by eliminating the public-interest advocacy program, the citizens' complaints program and $500,000 from the central office budget, which represents most of the staff. The result is that the Public Advocate no longer has the staff or the funds to take another state agency to court.
"They have kept the body, but they have made sure that the body can't speak or hear," said the Public Advocate, Wilfredo Caraballo.
The Republicans cut $24 million in direct services to welfare recipients. And they eliminated affirmative-action and equal-employment-opportunity programs in every department, consolidating them under the State Personnel Department. They also provided $200,000 for the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy for the disposal of dead deer.
The Republican plan also cuts $385 million from the $685 million Mr. Florio had recommended for the homestead rebate program.
Under their plan, Mr. Haytaian and Mr. DiFrancesco said, senior citizens remain eligible for the rebates they received last year, as much as $500. But they have limited the rebates to $90 for other homeowners with income of less than $40,000 a year and to $30 for renters. The plan eliminates rebates for those in subsidized housing and for some students in campus housing who had been eligible.
 
Emphasis on 'Savings'
 The Republicans released a budget summary and a sheaf of documents that spoke of "budget savings" rather than cuts and concentrated on increases in some programs instead of reductions that would cripple or eliminate others.
The Republicans listed "savings" in 21 of the state's 24 departments and agencies. The only areas granted increases over the Governor's requests were the Agriculture Department, which was given $941,000 more than the $13.3 million Mr. Florio sought, and the Personnel Department, with an additional $3.7 million, raising its budget to $34.2 million.
The Republicans did not alter Mr. Florio's request for $5 million to run his own office. And they cut $739,000 from the legislative budget but by eliminating such items as a County and Municipal Government Study Commission ($285,000) and paring $500,000 from a $2.3 million allocation for a commission to study sex discrimination in state laws.
Mr. Haytaian and Mr. DiFrancesco made only oblique references to layoffs. "We have achieved $65 million in budget savings through a thinning out of the salary-rich, middle-management bureaucracy in each department," Mr. DiFrancesco said.
"Our budget sends a clear message to state departments and agencies," Mr. Haytaian said. "Taxpayers are our No. 1 priority, not preserving state bureaucracy and excessive spending."

HEADLINE: Chicago Merc Plans Largest Trading Floor

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Moving to adjust to its explosive growth over the last decade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is expected to announce today that it plans to build the world's largest trading floor.
Exchange officials said yesterday that the expansion, which would cost $26.6 million and take a year to complete, would double the Merc's trading capacity to about 70,000 square feet. The Merc has outgrown its trading space three times in this century. 
 The plan underscores the rapid transformation of the Chicago futures markets. In the last decade or so, the markets have moved from an almost incidental financial arena for mostly Midwestern ranchers and food companies to a booming industry trading a variety of complex financial futures contracts that has overtaken many competitors in its innovation in new products and systems. Now, pork bellies and three-month Eurodollar deposits are equally at home on the exchange.
 
Electronic Trading System
 Word of the expansion plans comes less than a week before the planned start by the Merc of an electronic trading system. Known as Globex, it will open up a new era for 24-hour trading on an exchange.
Under the new building plan, which was approved Wednesday by the Merc's board, an unoccupied floor four stories above the current trading floor will be used for 16 new trading pits and 770 member firm booths. The Merc currently has 30 pits.
When the construction is done, the interest rate and currency groups, which now occupy about half of the Merc's trading floor, will be moved to the new floor.
The construction will be financed out of the exchange's cash reserves. An analysis of the Merc's financial position by the exchange with Goldman, Sachs & Company concluded that the project could be financed in that way without any special assesments on member firms or any increase in clearing fees, the exchange's main source of revenue.
The need for more space is largely the result of the Merc's expansion into a growing, increasingly esoteric number of futures contracts, based on everything from currencies to interest rates to stock indexes. In a little less than nine years in its current home, the C.M.E. Center, the volume of business at the Merc has grown 222 percent.
The exchange's growth has become painfully obvious to floor traders in the last two years. This year alone, an exchange official said yesterday, the Merc has spent $1 million on construction to relieve overcrowding in the trading pits.

Treasury Issues Advance in Price

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended higher yesterday after the announcement of weak United States trade figures that suggested the economic recovery would be slow and keep interest rates from rising sharply.
Led by shorter maturities, prices rose after the Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit surged 25 percent in April, to $6.97 billion, the widest monthly gap in 17 months. 
 Exports fell in April, a sign that overseas demand weakened, while imports rose, suggesting United States demand was being directed overseas. The report suggested "the economy is still struggling," said Charles Lieberman, director of financial markets research at Chemical Securities Inc.
The April trade data suggested to some economists that the gross domestic product for the second quarter may post a slower growth rate than the 2.4 percent annual rate seen in the first quarter.
 
30-Year Bond Yield Down
 The Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bond rose 8/32 of a point at 102 8/32 , pushing down its yield to 7.79 percent from 7.81 percent on Wednesday. The two-year note rose 2/32 , to 100 13/32 , yielding 4.90 percent.
Demand for short-term securities encouraged a further steepening of the yield curve to what economists said was the widest spread ever between the two-year and 30-year securities: 290 basis points, or 2.9 percentage points.
Much of the buying in the short end was linked to belief that the weak trade data improved chances that the Federal Reserve could further lower its Federal funds rate target, now presumed to be 3.75 percent.
"The market has been trying to get an assessment of what second-quarter gross domestic product is going to look like," said Matthew Alexy, senior economist at the First Boston Corporation. "It looks as if individuals with high forecasts have had to fold up their tents."
The Labor Department also reported that first-time jobless claims in the week that ended June 6 were nearly steady at 407,000. The number from the previous week was revised upward to 409,000 from 407,000.
"The market has been looking for claims to fall," said William Dudley, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The claims were still above the key 400,000 level, which some economists believe could portend weak hiring for the entire month of June.
"The failure of claims to decline reinforces the notion that the employment picture is only improving at a modest rate," said Dudley.
Economists say the United States recovery needed an improvement in the employment picture to increase lagging consumer demand.
Late in the day, Treasury securities remained firm after the Fed reported its key M-2 money supply was unchanged in the latest reporting week, which ended on June 8.
 
Money Growth Below Target
 The latest M-2 data meant growth was still $10 billion below the Fed's target rate of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent a year, said Kathleen Stephansen, an economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation.
Bills were mostly firm yesterday. The discount rate on three-month bills was unchanged at 3.61 percent; the six-month bill rate was down two basis points, at 3.70 percent, and the one-year bill rate was down three basis points, at 3.90 percent.

Supercollider Contractors Criticize Vote to Halt Work

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Halting work on the supercollider in Texas would have little near-term economic impact on the leading suppliers of components to the project, but the country could pay dearly in the long run, industry executives say.
The House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to block continued construction of the superconducting supercolliders. Suppliers to the $8.4 billion project contend that it is a means to develop the skill and capacity to build high-tech materials like superconducting magnets in large volumes and to demonstrate their reliability. The payoff, they say, would be in commercialization of such technology in a variety of applications in transportation and energy production and distribution. 
 "What we would be missing is the chance to build an infrastructure that would make superconductivity attractive in a variety of applications," said Richard Hora, vice president of energy business for the Space Systems division of the General Dynamics Corporation, one of three leading magnet contractors for the project.
Superconductors are materials that have no resistance to electricity and powerful magnetic fields. They are currently used in magnetic resonance imaging, which doctors use along with X-rays and CAT scans to diagnose what is going on inside a human body without surgery. Superconductivity researchers believe that the technology will one day be used for magnetically levitated trains, which would travel at high speeds without the friction of metal wheels on rails; for reducing energy losses in electricity transmission, and for storing electricity more efficiently.
Makers of superconducting equipment were not the only ones counting on the collider to open new business horizons. Construction companies see the project as a way to get valuable experience with new tunneling equipment and techniques at a time when the worldwide trend is to put more urban roadways and rail services underground, said Robert Prieto, director of corporate development for Parsons Brinkerhoff Quade & Douglas Inc., the New York-based firm overseeing engineering and construction at the site.
More than 18,000 contracts related to work on the collider have been let to thousands of companies and over 100 universities in 46 states, according to the National Association for the Superconducting Supercollider, a Washington-based lobby.

Platinum Posts 4th Decline On Weak Economy in Japan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Platinum futures prices swooned yesterday to their lowest level in a month on another round of bad economic news from Japan, the world center of platinum investment.
"The platinum market is suffering from the Nikkei blues," William O'Neill, Merrill Lynch's senior futures strategist, said, referring to a drop in the Japanese stock market's Nikkei stock average to a five-and-a-half-year low. 
 Platinum for July delivery fell $3.50 on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $358.40 an ounce, the lowest settlement for near-term deliveries since May 18.
Platinum has fallen $11.70 in four consecutive drops that halted a two-month rally from less than $340 an ounce to just over $370.
The selling has fed on a steady stream of negative signals involving Japan, where the metal is heavily used for investment, jewelry and -- as in the United States -- as a component in automobile pollution-control systems.
On Monday, Japanese Government officials said industrial demand for platinum was likely to fall this year because of the weaker market for Japanese cars.
Platinum traders in the United States expect large sales of physical platinum from Japan as investors there unload their holdings to raise cash for stock-market margin calls. In the last seven trading days, the Nikkei has fallen a total of 1,799.48 points, or 10.08 percent.
A weaker dollar supported gold and silver futures on New York's Commodity Exchange.
June gold rose $1.40, to $342.60 an ounce; July silver rose 0.2 cent, to $4.092 an ounce.
Lumber for July delivery soared the permitted daily limit of 5 cents to $244.80 for 1,000 board feet on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on news of a Canadian pulp and paper workers' strike.
July sugar deliveries tumbled 0.24 cent, to 10.81 cents a pound, on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange amid profit taking after a four-day rally that lifted sugar to its highest level in nearly a year.
Crude oil trading remained quiet on the New York Merc ahead of today's United Nations-Iraq meeting in Vienna, which could lead to a sale of Iraqi oil.
Crude oil for July delivery slipped 3 cents, to $22.26 a barrel; July heating oil rose 0.22 cent, to 61.21 cents a gallon; July unleaded gasoline fell 0.38 cent, to 65.21 cents a gallon; July natural gas fell 1.4 cents, to $1.591 for 1,000 cubic feet.

BYLINE: By Eric Asimov

 BODY:
It's a verifiable equation: when a Government falls anywhere in the world, restaurants rise in the United States. Let's face it, political change rarely cures poverty or resolves antipathies, but it almost always benefits American diners.
After the Vietnam War, Vietnamese restaurants opened all over the United States, run by new immigrants and catering to a ready market of refugees missing the tastes of home as well as to Americans. After Governments changed in Iran, Ethiopia and, most recently, Haiti, new restaurants sprouted up all over, replaying this centuries-old American process of immigration and assimilation. 
 Such was the case with Caravan, a four-year-old Afghan restaurant owned by Ibrahim Muhammed and Ghulam Haider. Mr. Muhammed had been the chef at the Afghan Embassy in Washington for four years when he decided to seek asylum in the United States in 1979 for political and economic reasons. Mr. Haider, his cousin, was then a refugee from the war in Afghanistan, staying in the United States Embassy in India. Mr. Muhammed helped Mr. Haider come to New York, where he attended City College. On finishing his studies, he and Mr. Muhammed, who had cooked at and managed a number of restaurants, decided to open their own place in New York.
Seeking a foothold in crowded, touristy midtown, they chose a steamy block on Eighth Avenue near the theater district, an urban counterpart to the barren, rugged terrain for which Afghanistan is famous. Adventurous diners must traverse a Khyber Pass of adult-video stores and similarly seedy establishments to reach Caravan, but their reward is a quiet, calm refuge where they can relax over savory kebabs and fiery stews.
The carpeted, rectangular dining room, seating about 85, holds neat rows of tables covered with soft tablecloths and bearing red linen napkins. Tapestries depicting folky mountain scenes line the walls, and sinuous music lilts quietly in the background. Mr. Haider, a gracious presence in the dining room, is quick to offer suggestions or recommendations as he brings over a basket of oblong wedges of fresh flatbread.
Ashak ($3.50), steamed scallion-and-meat dumplings covered with a refreshing mint-scented yogurt sauce, is a delightful way to start. Sambusa ($2.95) is a spicier appetizer, crisp fried triangular turnovers containing chickpeas, ground beef and mixed vegetables, served with a yogurt-and-lemon dipping sauce. Boulanee kadou ($3.25) is an unusual fried turnover filled with pureed pumpkin, fragrant with cinnamon and nutmeg and almost sweet enough for dessert.
All 10 kebabs come with enormous portions of nutty basmati rice and grilled tomatoes. The naan va kebab ($9.95), minced beef mixed with onions and spices and fashioned into a submarine-size cylinder, is spicier than the shishlick ($10.25), a domino row of tender chunks of grilled beef. Morgh ($10.75), bite-size chunks of chicken breast marinated in lemon and then grilled, was almost hidden in the rice. Only the bareh kebab ($10.75), grilled lamb marinated in yogurt, was tough.
Even the satisfying kebabs can't overshadow the delicious peppery slow-cooked stews, including chalow sabzi ($9.25), tender lamb served in a sauce scented with coriander and garlic over rice with spinach, and quorma badenjan ($9.25), another lamb dish, served with eggplant, onion, peppers and tomatoes. There is also an array of vegetarian dishes.
Desserts, including a creamy rice pudding ($2.25) and a gelatinous saffron pudding studded with nuts ($2) are a bit of an afterthought, a bland contrast to the spicy fare.
Four years at Caravan have taught Mr. Muhammed and Mr. Haider a lot about running a business in America, they say. Like the importance of ambition and expansion. They are now planning a second restaurant on the Upper East Side.

Melting Pot? Simmering Nicely

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Right-wing critics of public broadcasting should be cheered tonight by an essay, in prime time, that is upbeat about America from a man who has been known to consort with neo-conservatives.
"The First Universal Nation," at 9 P.M. on Channel 13, is an installment of "Ben J. Wattenberg: Trends in the 90's." It is Mr. Wattenberg's description of the American melting pot, which he finds to be poppling vigorously and productively. In this energetic hour, the author and television commentator looks at immigration, intermarriage and the worldwide taste for American pop culture. 
 Mr. Wattenberg, who specializes in mining the meanings of statistical data as a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, notes that the immigration rate is back up to a million a year, about the same as at the turn of the century. But the mix has changed: about 85 percent of today's newest Americans are not of European ancestry. At the Gaithersburg Intermediate School in Maryland, he finds students from 41 countries, apparently getting along just fine.
Although Mr. Wattenberg concedes that intergroup animosities have not vanished (a black New Yorker is seen shouting at a Korean New Yorker, "This is my country, not yours"), he accentuates the positive. While attending a wedding in Baltimore between a Greek Orthodox woman and a Presbyterian man whose mother belongs to the Daughters of the American Revolution, he notes that ethnic and religious barriers to marriage have all but collapsed in the last 20 years. He finds encouragement in the fact that black-white intermarriage, too, is climbing, although it is still relatively rare.
His conclusion: At a time when ethnic and racial divisions are being emphasized by press and television, "the melting pot is alive, flourishing, expanding."
One must hope so; the message is much more heartening than the general run of election-year coverage. But viewers may detect a certain wishfulness in this hour, which was financed in part by the John M. Olin Foundation and the Donner Foundation, prominent supporters of conservative causes. Mr. Wattenberg, sleeves rolled up, glasses on forehead, makes an energetic salesman for America, with a salesman's tendency to play down the less shiny aspects of his product.
Relying on history and faith, he promises that the current symptoms of group dissension will be ameliorated as the American dream takes hold among the new immigrants. Matters like the nation's economic prospects, the appearance in the inner cities of youths who are notoriously resistant to assimilation and the implications of the multi-culturalism are given scant attention.
Mr. Wattenberg's optimistic revisionism is most striking in the hour's final segment, on the Americanization of world culture. Along with Hollywood movies, soap operas and Euro Disney, America is sending forth values like individualism and upward mobility, he emphasizes. He does not pause to scrutinize the content of what is being exported.
The message being delivered to the world, he says, is this: "In America everything is possible." That is pretty much Mr. Wattenberg's message, too.
 
'States of Mind'
Channel 13
Friday at midnight
This seven-part PBS series on how people are getting along these days around the United States has a somewhat less optimistic spin. Workers in Idaho are trying to figure out how to keep their jobs in the logging industry without disfiguring the land, and leaders of a poor black community in Arkansas are trying to improve life for their children. A largely Hispanic community in Denver is trying to revitalize a neighborhood battered by industry, and old-time religion is holding together the residents of a rural West Virginia town. And people in tiny Shoshone, Idaho, have been hit by crime and poverty, just like people in Milwaukee and Philadelphia, the scene of tonight's intermittently interesting opening episode, direly titled "Crisis in Philadelphia."

HEADLINE: Last Stand for the Adirondacks?

BYLINE: By John B. Oakes; John B. Oakes, former Editor of the Editorial Page of the The New York Times, was a member of Gov. Mario Cuomo's Commission on the Adirondack Park in the 21st Century.

 BODY:
The 100th birthday celebration of the Adirondack Park may yet be turned into a wake.
Timberland owners with huge holdings, real estate speculators and their lawyers have converged on Albany, posing as "moderates" and friends of the "little man." They are, in reality, extremists who would weaken zoning rules, sell off shorefronts and brook no further interference with their "right" ultimately to devastate, for short-term gain, one of the great natural and scenic resources of the United States. 
 Yet New York's voters don't have a clue about what is going on.
The immediate question is this: Why does the majority leader of the Republican-controlled Senate, Ralph J. Marino of Oyster Bay, continue to allow the park's most implacable enemy in the Senate, deputy majority leader Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh, to wield absolute veto power over all legislation affecting the park?
Senator Stafford, whose district includes less than half the park's six million acres, has chosen to honor the park on its centenary by introducing a bill that would in effect abolish it. It would do so by wiping out the Adirondack Park Agency, which enforces the already inadequate regulations governing the park. Senator Stafford would also reduce the size of the park by eliminating privately held land from its boundaries.
Without Senator Stafford's consent, not even the mildest of bills to halt the park's downward slide has the slightest chance of enactment.
The economic bases for the park's 130,000 permanent residents are the forest products industry and the tourist industry. Both are threatened by the intense speculative pressure (slowed only by the recession) that will inevitably lead to a breakup of large holdings in the timber country and consequent loss of jobs, and of recreational and scenic quality, while at the same time increasing water, air and noise pollution.
This is not only the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Adirondack Park, it also the 20th anniversary of comprehensive land use regulations for the more than half of the park's area that is privately owned. These controls have proved increasingly inadequate.
Many of the most fragile areas, such as lakefronts, have already been subdivided, and houses have been scattered over hillsides and ridge tops, degrading the park's "unique open space and wilderness character," as Gov. Mario Cuomo describes it.
This decline of the park during the past 20 years has undermined the quality of life of the people who permanently live there, the economy of the people who work there and the recreational and spiritual enjoyment of the millions of people who visit there yearly.
Three years ago, Governor Cuomo appointed a commission, at least half of whose members were from the Adirondack region, to figure out how best to cope with the increasing pressures on the park and at the same time to help its chronically depressed economy, which has kept per capita income the lowest of any rural area in the state.
The Governor found the commission's recommendations regarding the park and its economy too strong and politically too hot to handle. But after two years of political give and take (mostly give by Governor Cuomo), he came up with a proposal of his own that would have at least protected shorelines and made a start on what the park and its residents need if its values and their livelihoods are to be enhanced.
Early this week, however, the Assembly approved a much more comprehensive bill that has the backing of the Speaker, Saul Weprin. It would give needed support to permanent residents of the region through community development, would strengthen protection of the shorelines and back country and would establish an Adirondack Trust Fund.
Passage of this bill would be something to celebrate for the park's 100th anniversary. The Legislature established the park, and now it has the opportunity to insure its survival.
But the Weprin bill won't get to first base unless the Republican leaders decide that what happens to the Adirondacks is not a local issue -- like, say, Plattsburgh's sewer system -- but of lively concern to the people of New York State and beyond: those who live in it, those who work in it, those who visit it and those who love it.

HEADLINE: As Bishops Meet, Catholics Voice Differences With Church's Doctrine;
Little Hope Seen for Letter on Women

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOUTH BEND, Ind., June 18

 BODY:
The chairman of the committee of Roman Catholic bishops that has worked for nine years to draft a pastoral letter on women said after a divisive debate among the bishops today that it would take a miracle to pass the letter when it came up for a final vote in November.
"We're going to give it a try, but that's going to be a miracle," said the chairman, Bishop Joseph L. Imesch of Joliet, Ill. 
 Pastoral letters, which require a two-thirds' majority of the country's 286 active bishops, are formal teaching documents that in recent years have dealt with how to apply the doctrines of the church to current issues. In recent years, the American bishops have adopted letters on war and peace and on the economy.
The effort to draft a letter on women has proved to be the longest and most difficult of these exercises. Other letters have been passed usually with only a few negative votes, and no one here could remember a case where a letter had to be abandoned.
Bishop Imesch's pessimistic assessment of the letter's chances of passage was reinforced at the end of the debate when the president of the body, Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, asked for an informal vote to determine whether to continue the discussion on the document when the bishops meet in Washington in November. While a majority of the bishops stood as a sign they were in favor, Bishop Imesch said it was clearly less than the two-thirds' majority that will be needed to adopt the document.
The third draft of the 81-page letter on women, which Bishop Imesch said was going to be the last, has tried to steer a moderate course between the demands of the Vatican and the voices of American Catholic women pressing for change. The document condemns sexism as "a moral and social evil," but follows Vatican dictates denying women ordination to the priesthood and condemning abortion and contraception.
An earlier draft, calling for a discussion on whether women can serve as priests, was rewritten after objections from the Vatican, which refuses to entertain the question. The revised draft allows for dialogue only on including women in lesser ministerial roles like deacon and acolyte.
 
Sentiment Against Letter
 Today was the first time in the process that the full conference of bishops had an open debate on the draft.
In introducing the third draft to his colleagues, Bishop Imesch acknowledged that it has forged "a unique alliance" of those on the left and the right against the letter "while not satisfying women's groups at either end." Still, he urged the bishops to look favorably on the effort, and added, "Do we dare say we have nothing to tell Catholic women?"
While many bishops like Joseph Cardinal Bernadin of Chicago called for adoption, bishops on both ends of the spectrum in the debate said it would be best to bury the letter now.
Bishop John R. Sheets of the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Ind., said the document failed to "alert the faithful" to the dangers of feminists who see God as both male and female and deny the maleness of Jesus.
Bishop Elden F. Curtiss of Helena, Mont., agreed, saying, "Radical feminist theology is a sin." Other conservative bishops criticized the draft for giving women "the false hope" that they could be ordained as deacons by inviting a discussion on the subject.
At the other end of the spectrum was Bishop Charles A. Buswell, the retired bishop of Pueblo, Colo. He not only called for dialogue on women in the ministry but also on their ordination.
Bishop Buswell said the pastoral letter should be dropped because it deals more with "our own concerns and the concerns of the Vatican than the concerns of women." He added that the church itself was guilty of sexism "in denying half of its membership" the priesthood.
Other liberal bishops did not go as far as to call for the ordination of women, but they too called for the dropping of the letter because it did not go far enough in dealing with the concerns of women.
Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee faulted the letter for not measuring up to the intellectual standards the bishops set in earlier letters.
But Bishop Austin B. Vaughan, an auxiliary from New York, criticized the document for being too weighty. "If I can use the current political rhetoric, this document is addressed to the intellectual elite," he said, "and that's not what we need at this time."

HEADLINE: RUSSIA AND I.M.F. FAIL AT AN ACCORD

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 19

 BODY:
Negotiators for the International Monetary Fund ended a round of talks with the Russian Government today after failing to win Moscow's compliance with several harsh demands for changes in its economy in return for billions in foreign loans.
Officials involved in the talks said that several major issues remain unresolved and that the next round of talks could occur early in July, before President Bush and the leaders of the other major industrial nations hold their annual economic summit. This year, the meeting will be held in Munich, Germany, and is to be attended by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. 
 Neither the Russians nor the I.M.F. commented publicly on the talks, beyond the statement of an I.M.F. official that "progress continues to be made."
But with most of the I.M.F. team members returning to Washington over the weekend, there was a feeling that an agreement was unlikely before the Munich meeting, and that the talks could spill over into August.
 
U.S. Frustrated at Delays
 Delays in the talks have been a source of open frustration among Bush Administration officials, who have begun calling on the I.M.F. to ease some demands on Russia and not delay an aid agreement provided Russia commits itself to broad changes.
In Washington this week, Russian and I.M.F. officials appeared to recognize that the Munich summit meeting might occur without an I.M.F. agreement.
Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, and Yegor T. Gaidar, Russia's Acting Prime Minister, issued a joint statement Thursday saying that the two sides were "in basic agreement on the crucial objectives of an economic strategy."
The Bush Administration has publicly pushed for an agreement ahead of Mr. Yeltsin's arrival in Munich on July 8 to meet with Mr. Bush and the leaders of the six other major industrial nations -- Britain, Germany, Canada, Japan, France and Italy. But today the Administration seemed resigned to the possibility that this might not happen.
A senior Bush Administration official in Washington said in a telephone interview today that while the Administration "very much wants an agreement to happen by July 6, not having one would not be fatal."
 
Asks I.M.F. to Ease Demands
 The official added that although the Administration had asked the I.M.F. to ease up on some of its demands, it was not asking the fund to compromise its standards so that Russia could become eligible for a $24 billion aid package.
An I.M.F. stamp of approval is also supported by Washington and Moscow to encourage foreign investment in Russia, which Mr. Yeltsin described this week as even more essential than the $24 billion in aid.
"What we are feeling, particularly after Mr. Yeltsin's visit to the United States, is that as soon as possible, we want an agreement," the Administration official said. "We are saying to the I.M.F. that if you can come to a solid agreement that addresses the fundamental issues, that is important."
Specifically, he cited the need by Russia to reduce its budget deficit, keep tighter controls over its money supply and establish a fixed exchange rate for the ruble so that the Russian currency can readily be exchanged for dollars or other western currency in international money markets.
The most significant remaining obstacle to an I.M.F. agreement, according to Western and Russian officials, involves the money supply and the exchange rate.
 
Questions on Ruble
 Some 13 republics of the old Soviet Union say they intend to use the ruble as their currency for the time being, and the I.M.F. insists that all agree to adhere to a common monetary policy -- preferably one that keeps interest rates high, loans hard to get and as few rubles in circulation as possible.
With such measures in place, the ruble's value in relation to other currency presumably would rise, and the ruble could then be exchanged for dollars and other hard currencies at a stable rate. Achieving a stable exchange rate is viewed by the I.M.F. as the first step to foreign investment, because profits from such investments could then be converted to dollars and sent home.
Endorsing the I.M.F. approach, the Yeltsin Government has asked the republics to agree by Sept. 1 to a single monetary policy, with the Russian central bank probably calling the shots.
Among them, only Ukraine is openly opposed to a monetary policy run from Moscow, but its opposition is considered a big problem.
The Yeltsin Government does appear to be on the verge of fulfilling its promise to declare a single exchange rate for the ruble by July 1 -- one that would replace the half-dozen rates now in use.
These range from 130 rubles to the dollar on the black market down to 55 rubles to the dollar that the Government gives to exporters for some of their hard currency earnings.
The unified rate is expected to float initially at about 120 rubles to the dollar. The Government would buy dollars from Russian exporters at this rate and sell them to importers to pay for foreign goods. This would also be the conversion rate to pay the interest on foreign debt and to repatriate profits from foreign investments.

HEADLINE: Rival of Haiti's Ousted President Is Installed as the Prime Minister

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, June 19

 BODY:
Marc L. Bazin was installed today as Haiti's Prime Minister in a ceremony that was attended by many of this country's leading politicians and businessmen but shunned by foreign diplomats and supporters of the deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Mr. Bazin, a 60-year-old lawyer and former World Bank official, was appointed to the post over Father Aristide's objections by Haiti's army-backed Provisional President, Joseph Nerette. 
 In a gesture that Haitian officials said is intended to leave open the possibility of Father Aristide's eventual return as President, Mr. Nerette resigned from office with the swearing in of Mr. Bazin. Father Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected President, was overthrown in a violent army coup in September.
In his inaugural speech, given in a sweltering, chandeliered hall of the National Palace, Mr. Bazin declared that his mission was to "take up anew the dossier of negotiating a national solution acceptable to all the parties."
"We will be ready to meet the Rev. Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, no matter where, no matter when, and without any reservations," he said.
United States diplomats and officials from the Organization of American States, which imposed an embargo on Haiti in October, have insisted that no internationally acceptable solution to this country's crisis will be possible without first allowing Father Aristide a say in forming a new government.
Speaking today in French Guiana, Father Aristide repeated his opposition to Mr. Bazin, a longtime political rival who placed a distant second in the December 1990 elections.
Foreign diplomats and Haitian political analysts said eventual acceptance of Mr. Bazin as Prime Minister was further called into question by irregular voting procedures used to secure his nomination in the Legislature. Mr. Bazin's nomination was approved last week by less than the majority of senators required by the Constitution.
In an interview at his home on Thursday, Mr. Bazin repeatedly stressed his aim of ending Haiti's diplomatic and commercial isolation as well as its violent political divisions by restarting negotiations with Father Aristide and the O.A.S.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes to Extend Jobless Aid, Creating Another Bush Veto Threat

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
Setting up another showdown with President Bush on a touchy election year issue, the Senate voted today to prolong benefits automatically to the long-term unemployed in times of recession.
The Senate measure, which was passed by a voice vote, would not raise taxes to pay for the benefits, as would a more expensive version passed on June 9 by the House. But a senior White House official said Mr. Bush would veto either form of the legislation, not only because he considers both too expensive but because he opposes making a permanent change in the unemployment insurance system now. 
 Should the President carry through with the threat, hundreds of thousands of unemployed people could lose their benefits after July 4, when the current extension expires.
Since many of the recently unemployed come from the middle class, Democrats say that Mr. Bush could suffer political damage if he vetoes the bill. But Administration officials counter that because the President is willing to extend benefits in less costly package, it will the the Democrats who ultimately take the blame.
 
Compromise Foreseen
 In the event of a veto, however, both sides foresee negotiations to come up with compromise legislation.
The Senate bill would extend the current unemployment benefits until March 6, 1993, and would automatically continue payments as long as the national unemployment rate remains at 7 percent or more. The number of weeks of benefits -- 33 or 26 depending on a state's unemployment level -- would be reduced once the unemployment rate fell below 7 percent for two consecutive months. The bill would cost the Treasury $5.4 billion over five years, but it includes tax collection provisions that would more than offset the costs by 1998.
"The hard human evidence of recession requires us to respond," Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is the principal sponsor of the bill, said during the floor debate. "So despite some positive signs the economy is on a gentle upswing, the situation remains grim for 9.5 million unemployed Americans. And the need for this new legislation is clear."
A senior White House official said the Administration was willing to consider permanent changes in the unemployment system but needed more time to study various options. Speaking of the Bentsen bill, he said, "We think it costs too much money. If they want the veto fight, they'll have it. It won't do them any good politically, and it won't help us either."
Before approving the Bentsen bill, the Senate rejected by voice vote an alternative proposed by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, which would have provided up to 20 weeks of extra coverage through January 2, and up to 10 additional weeks through March 6. At that point, unlike the Democratic versions, the program would have terminated.

 
Bills Must Be Reconciled
 Before it reaches the President's desk, the Senate bill must be reconciled with a House version that differs in a number of ways. While the Senate would give states the right to waive the additional benefits, the House bill sets an automatic national standard that would replace the current system of irregular extensions of benefits with one granting at least 13 weeks of benefits in states where the unemployment rate is 6 percent or higher.
In recent days, White House officials have spoken with Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, to discuss possible compromises. But today, Senator Bentsen and Representative Thomas J. Downey, the Long Island Democrat who was the chief author of the House bill, said they were in no mood to settle for less than permanent changes.
"If George Bush wants to tell unemployed workers to drop dead after July 4, that's his problem," said Mr. Downey. But he added that should the President veto the bill, the Congress would send him back another bill "with one or two accommodations."
Mr. Bentsen, in a separate interview, said he had been ready to compromise with the White House but "they did not come with any serious offer until we already passed the bill through the Finance Committee." The Texas Democrat said he was still hopeful the President would not veto the legislation.
Should the Administration be accommodating, Democrats are more likely to send the President the Senate version. A blanket veto threat, on the other hand, is likely to attract the more generous House version.
The Senate version attempts to avoid raising taxes by accelerating the collection of corporate taxes and penalties on withdrawals of money from individual retirement accounts and other annuities. But the House bill would reduce itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers by 2 percent for each $2,500 of adjusted gross income above $157,900 for couples who file jointly. It would also limit to $1 million the tax deduction a company could declare for wages paid to its executives.
The House version would raise the Federal portion of extended benefits from 50 percent to 75 percent. The Senate version retains the current 50-50 ratio.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin's Bandwagon Rolls Into Canada to Cheers and Applause

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OTTAWA, June 19

 BODY:
Stopping in Canada after his visit to the United States, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia was welcomed here today as a man of "courage and purpose" and won commitments similar to those obtained in Washington for more trade and investment.
The Russian leader, who arrived here on Thursday evening from his whirlwind tour of the American grain belt, spent a heady day visiting politicians, businessmen and just ordinary people and winning applause almost everywhere he went. 
 After laying a wreath at the National War Memorial, to the dismay of his security officers he took an impromptu stroll up Parliament Hill, telling one group of cheering onlookers, "I would like to embrace all the Canadians at once."
 
Speech Before Parliament
 In a speech before the Canadian Parliament, the Russian leader, continuing his plea for greater Western economic assistance to support democratic reforms, said he looks at Canada and realizes what Russia has missed because of its "nightmare of totalitarianism."
He noted similarities between the countries -- their vastness, multiculturalism and polar reach -- but said there are considerable differences in their living standards because of the damage that was done to Russia by 70 years of Communism.
While making no direct reference to Canada's unity crisis, Mr. Yeltsin said Canada's experiences in resolving differences between the central Government and the provinces hold great interest for Russia, itself rent by nationalist forces.
"We will be your students," he told the assembled legislators. The speech was punctuated with frequent applause and standing ovations, much as were his comments earlier in the week to Congress.
At a news conference, Mr. Yeltsin again called on the International Monetary Fund to be less demanding in the conditions it is setting for a big aid package and said his July 8 meeting with Western leaders in Munich will not be a success unless Russia is allowed to reschedule debts over the next two to three years.
Mr. Yeltsin has been invited to the economic summit meeting of the leaders of the seven most important industrial countries, as was Mikhail S. Gorbachev, as leader of the old Soviet Union, last year.
The Russian leader said he expects this participation to continue, making the Group of Seven a de facto Group of Eight.
As for the I.M.F., he told reporters and senior officials from both countries gathered at the news conference that the fund "cannot approach Russia like other countries."
 
Signs Economic Agreements
 "Russia is unique," he said.
Because of the magnitude of changes now taking place, he said, "it is impossible to go by the letter" on the various conditions the fund is seeking, like reduction of the Russian budget deficit to zero.
Although Canadian officials have recently pointed out that Russia has been falling behind on repayments of earlier credits to finance grain and other items, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Mr. Yeltsin signed a series of agreements today that further extend Canada's economic cooperation.
In one of the accords, Canada grants most-favored-nation trading status toward the Russians, lowering tariffs to levels that already apply to other friendly nations. This parallels action taken earlier in the week by Congress.
Canada will also take these actions:
*Raise its technical assistance to countries of the former Soviet Union from $25 million to $100 million over three years. Russia gets two-thirds.
*Offer $200 million of insurance to companies planning investments in the Russian petroleum and construction industries.
*Provide technical assistance and promote investment to help Russia convert defense industries to civilian production.
*Set up a Yeltsin Democratic Fellowship of $10 million to train Russian managers in Canada.
*Give a three-year $30 million aid package to Russia and other countries from the former Soviet Union and East Europe to help promote safety in nuclear power plants.
"The attitude of the Government of Canada is to help Yeltsin succeed," Mr. Mulroney said, standing next to the Russian leader.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
Father's Day is here, and a lot of fathers aren't. The flight of fathers from the home is one of the great social changes of recent years -- a vast ozone hole in the family ecology.
There is a debate among those who find the causes and the cures of this change in economic forces, those who emphasize government policies and those who point to basic American beliefs and moral standards as well as everyday culture. It is simply inconceivable that a shift of this magnitude, or a sensible discussion of that shift, could occur without involving all these things. 
 In 1960, 8 percent of American children were living with their mothers as the only parent. Today that figure is 22 percent. Another 8 percent live with a mother and a stepfather, and 5 percent more are in some fatherless arrangement. In short, a third of the nation's children live apart from their biological fathers.
In 1960, 1 out of 20 births was to an unmarried mother. Today the figure is more than 1 out of 4. If a change of that proportion took place in atmospheric warming, the world's seaports would have been flooded and its farmlands turned into deserts long ago.
"Never before in our nation's history have so many children grown up without a father's presence and provision," David Blankenhorn, president of the Institute for American Values, a small New York research organization dealing with family issues, said yesterday at a Washington meeting.
Homes without fathers can be models of love and courage, but homes without fathers are also among the likeliest to be visited by poverty, domestic violence, juvenile crime and teen-age pregnancies. "If current scholarship proves anything," Mr. Blankenhorn has written, "it is that children who grow up without their fathers are worse off -- economically, educationally, psychologically, every way we can measure -- than children who grow up with their fathers."
Yet in all the comedy and commentary inspired by Vice President Dan Quayle's recent speeches on "family values," the bulk of attention has been focused on "single mothers" rather than on the real issue of absent fathers.
Actually, the bulk of attention has been focused on Mr. Quayle himself. His critics call his oratory polarizing, and they say his crusade in fact puts up obstacles to a serious discussion of the topic. And he is an easy target for those who would prefer to avoid it.
Mr. Quayle says the breakdown of family structure is primarily a matter of our culture -- we are "reaping the whirlwind of decades of changes in social mores" -- and secondarily a consequence of poor government policies. He says scarcely a word about the economy.
Mr. Blankenhorn, in fact, argues something similar. His favorite metaphor in talking about fatherhood is a "cultural script" -- a social story, a set of cues, an ideal character and a classic plot line that shapes, guides and at time pressures men into a certain sense of who they are and how they should act. Like the Vice President, Mr. Blankenhorn emphasizes the role of opinion leaders and cultural elites in telling or reshaping the "prevailing story of fatherhood."
But that analysis is a far cry from Mr. Quayle's stark picture of "two cultures -- the cultural elite, and the rest of us," the one upright, the other "guilt free," respecting "neither tradition nor standards" and believing that "all life styles are equal."
In reality, America has not one but a number of cultural elites: the universities, the national news media, the makers and brokers of popular entertainment like movies, television and music, the presiding geniuses of advertising, religious leaders, foundation executives and so on.
They each not only honor certain traditions, standards and ways of life and reject others (and are anything but "guilt free"), but they are also often quite antagonistic to one another in their prevailing values.
If Hollywood and Harvard converge to give a particular twist to our norms about family, fatherhood and marriage, the reason deserves serious analysis. As Mr. Quayle himself says, "a sneer is not an answer."
What has emerged is a war of sneers. As Mr. Quayle assails his critics in the "cultural elite," they accuse him of hypocrisy, pointing to the Administration's opposition to measures that might arguably shore up economically endangered families, or launching attacks on the rich kid from Indiana (who can't even spell "potato") lecturing the poor on their morals.
The effect of these attacks is to sweep the cultural questions about fatherhood and family off the public agenda. And it is not true that everyone agrees on those more philosophical questions about family norms, disagreeing only on the practical means to strengthen them.
Last month, Mr. Blankenhorn shared the platform at a New York political meeting with Betty Friedan. Both agreed on many things, but where Mr. Blankenhorn spoke of "fathers," Ms. Friedan spoke of "parents."
Asked whether children were better off with two parents, she said "at least two parents" and went on to endorse "all kinds of families" and family "support systems." Presumably, two women, two men or half a dozen of either might be as serviceable as a mother and father. Tomorrow should not really be Father's Day but Second Parent's Day.
Mr. Blankenhorn believes that such a vague "cultural script," in which gender-neutral parents are celebrated rather than mothers and fathers, is doomed to failure. Ms. Friedan puts a higher priority on avoiding all appearances of stigmatizing broken or nontraditional families than on the need for a clearly defined "cultural script."
Both are debatable positions. Both should be debated thoughtfully, along with other questions about sexual ethics, government incentives, economic pressures. That discussion is not very likely in the atmosphere created by the Vice President's speeches.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Fall on Interest Rate Outlook

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday, depressed in part by a belief that interest rates will not fall anytime soon.
The price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 11/32 point, or about $3.44 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield was 7.83 percent, up from 7.79 percent late Thursday. 
 Bonds were initially helped by a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which said its monthly economic index declined in June. Signs of a sluggish economy generally produce higher bond prices because they improve the chances that the Federal Reserve Board will ease interest rates.
But the impact of the Philadelphia report was short-lived. Bond prices fell in part because of comments from a Fed governor, who suggested interest rates would not decline. The governor, Edward Kelley, indicated that inflation-fighting, not stimulating the economy with lower rates, would be the central bank's priority in coming months.
 
Hurt by Irish vote
 Bond prices were also dragged down by the approval of the European unity treaty by Irish voters. Concern over the fate of the treaty, which would create a common European currency, had caused some investors to move money from Europe to the United States bond market.
Another factor depressing bond prices was the rebound on the stock markets, which slowed the flight of money from stocks to bonds that occurred as stock prices declined in recent days.
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities were 3/16 point to 5/16 point lower, intermediate maturities were 3/8 point to 13/32 point lower, and long-term issues were down 11/32 point, Telerate Inc., the financial information service, reported.
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.11, to 1,233.36
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 3.72 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 3.88 percent. Yields on one-year bills climbed to 4.15 percent.98 percent.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 39/16 percent, down from 311/16 percent late Thursday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 9623-32, unchanged from Thursday. The average yield to maturity remained at 6.54 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Thin Trading; Gold Declines in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced in thin trading on world currency markets yesterday amid fresh hope for European unity.
Gold prices fell after advancing in overseas trading. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $340.80 an ounce, off $1.80. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped $1.40 an ounce, to a late bid price of $340.70. 
 Traders said the dollar was supported somewhat from Ireland's ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, which outlines a plan for European economic and political union.
But the vote did not entirely eradicate the uncertainty created two weeks ago by Denmark's surprise rejection of the treaty.
"This vote hasn't really clarified that much," said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "Traders are now looking past it and saying what about France?"
France is expected to hold a referendum in September on the treaty, which would create a single European currency and a central bank.
Any indications of cracks in support for the treaty have led investors to buy German marks, since Germany is perceived to be the most economically independent nation within the European Community. Indeed, Mr. Johnson said that there would have been a huge movement into marks had the Irish rejected the treaty.
Meanwhile, other factors continue to limit the dollar's gains. Traders remain disappointed with the pace of economic recovery in the United States, and interest rate differentials still favor other currencies.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 126.92 Japanese yen, from 127.63 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 126.90 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 127.00 yen, up from 126.80 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8595, from $1.8660 late Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.8590 to buy one pound, less expensive than Thursday's $1.8635.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5730 German marks, up from 1.5670; 1.4195 Swiss francs, up from 1.4135; 5.2960 French francs, up from 5.2785; 1,190.25 Italian lire, up from 1,187.00, and 1.1973 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1985.

HEADLINE: The Rise and Fall of the Floral Tie

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Father's Day fashion quiz: The bright floral-print tie you receive tomorrow will make you look:
(a) Out-of-date
(b) Floriferous
(c) Garnished
(d) Visible at night
(For answer, read on.)
Unlike most fathers, Bert Pulitzer will awaken tomorrow knowing that his gift won't be a tie. Mr. Pulitzer does not even need to buy a tie; he makes them. 
 This year, he can count himself among the lucky. The tie industry is undergoing a ritual fashion cleansing, and department store racks nationwide are dripping with the jetsam. The prime offender: those bright floral ties seen on men everywhere.
"They are finished," said Nonnie Moore, the fashion director for GQ, the men's fashion magazine.
Who is there to lament tie designs cruelly struck down in their prime? How mighty once the yellow power tie or the square-bottomed Rooster that so proudly crowed.
But even as the bright floral tie wilts under fashion's cruel gaze, the story of its creation, marketing and apparent demise remains vital if only because a few hours do remain to make suitable exchanges.
It seems almost ironic that Mr. Pulitzer, who will be relaxing tomorrow with his gift, should have played such a key role in the creation of the bright floral tie. But he is the first to admit it.
"We started florals in 1987," he said. "My wife, Betsy, said to me, 'You have to do florals in men's wear.' She brought in three old Oriental blankets, and those were the designs we started with."
Initially, these new and exotic designs by Bert Pulitzer Tiemakers commanded a heady price -- $52.50. But then some Italians, normally known for their impeccable taste in ties, stepped in and changed the course of history. "They are some mill owners in Italy that made brothers and sisters of our designs," Mr. Pulitzer said, using the trade term for copies. "The following season just about everybody had them."
It is not unusual for "everybody" to jump on a fashion bandwagon. But in the case of the bright floral tie, there were unfortunately more imitators than usual.
According to Robert Beauchamp, the fashion director of Esquire magazine, the forces of our nation's economic travails are impinging on the tie industry. Mr. Beauchamp said that suits are too expensive and people are buying ties instead. As a result, fashion companies are cranking out ties by the ton to try to make up the shortfall. "There has been an explosion of people doing ties," Mr. Beauchamp said.
Jerry Andersen, the executive director of the Neckwear Association of America, a trade group based in New York, agreed. "Ties usually perform well in a recession because it is the simplest way for people to upgrade their wardrobes," he said.
This type of competition can mean good things for the public, like cheaper ties. Last Father's Day, the bright floral tie was reaching the height of its popularity; the price began to plummet. Some were seen selling for as little as $37.50. Then this spring, the market collapsed. The current opening price at Macy's is $20, but the seriously interested are encouraged with a 50 percent discount.
That could be a signal for some to stock up. But even Mr. Andersen, whose job it is to say nice things about ties, has little hope for a bright-floral resurgence soon.
"As an association executive, I will never say that anything is dead, because I will get 27 calls from different people," he said. "But I would say that if the question is 'Is this where the direction is?' the answer is no."
 
Shrinking Shapes
 Those who receive a bright tie with a big geometric design tomorrow should not take heart from the bright floral tie's plight. As with many of the nation's industrial giants, downsizing is a popular theme among tie makers.
"The trend is toward neat little figures, little scenics," Mr. Pulitzer said, referring to squares, circles and others shapes that appear on ties. "A year ago they were three inches tall, now they are three-quarters of an inch tall. It was just overkill."
Speak to Ms. Moore of GQ about this trend toward traditionalism and her enthusiasm is visceral. "We think ties today are fabulous," she said. "We are showing updated versions of traditional reps, with two or three stripes. But they have new colorations like apricot with navy, not like the old ties where the colors were boring."
Yes, but even these updated versions of the classic rep may seem pale and tired soon, so the truly conservative gift giver might want to consider other options like cologne, golf tees or a metal toothpick.
As for Mr. Pulitzer's gift, Betsy Pulitzer is willing to share the secret: "Our daughter is going to give him a book about fly-fishing."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 25, 1992, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on the Consumer's World page on Saturday about neckties misidentified the company with which Bert Pulitzer is associated. Since 1987, Mr. Pulitzer has been the design director of XMI, a label owned by TBS Marketing Inc.; he no longer has any connection with Bert Pulitzer Tiemakers.

GRAPHIC: Photos: YESTERDAY -- Ties in bright floral patterns and big prints are everywhere, but some predict they will soon be found only in closets. TODAY -- Animals, endangered and otherwise, are the current rage in
ties. FOREVER -- The classic rep tie, an old reliable, has been invigorated with new color combinations like navy and apricot. (Naum Kazhdan/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
President Portrays Himself As Best Choice for Economy

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., June 19

 BODY:
One day after Ross Perot drew a rousing crowd in this bastion of conservatism, President Bush sought today to persuade skeptical Orange County business executives that he could best lead the nation to economic recovery.
 Mustering the power of his office to press that point, Mr. Bush announced that he would rescind a Federal rule that officials said would mean millions of dollars in savings each year for contractors converting technology to nonmilitary use. In a further attempt to make the case that he offered more than words, he waved a copy of a plan that he said was a roadmap for controlling Federal spending. 
But not every member of the Industrial League of Orange County, an business advocacy group, was swayed. While they crowded into a hotel ballroom in Irvine for Mr. Bush's luncheon speech, nearly every audience member randomly interviewed said he or she voted for the President in 1988 but was now torn between him and Mr. Perot, the Texas billionaire who is an unannounced independent candidate.
 "I supported Bush in the past, and I think the jury's still out," said Stan Taeger, a Republican who runs a high-rise property management company here. "I've been disappointed with what Government has been able to do with business and the economy. It might be time for someone else to try, someone who's really a businessman running the country."
 
'Strange Year'
It was not long ago that a Republican business executive would never dare admit to harboring an interest in a contender outside the party. But as Mr. Bush put it today, this is a "strange year," a year when the troubled economy has driven even staunch party loyalists to look for an alternative.
 After ticking off his usual economic remedies -- from passage of a line-item veto to a budget-balancing amendment -- Mr. Bush acknowledged that the economy has been particularly bad in California. Essentially, he told his audience that they should trust him to see the economy through to better days.
 "In California, as everyone in this room knows, it is a challenging time," he said. "It's been a tough time. But you've risen to the challenge before." He said "defense conversion puts Orange County back in the business of job creation, a skill that you mastered in the 80's with the high-tech start-ups that made this area famous."
 Senator John Seymour, a Republican from Orange County who met with Mr. Bush today, said in an interview that the popularity of Mr. Perot here could be linked directly to the economy. "He's a big threat," he said of the Texan. "I blame much of the Perot factor in California on a very painful, very painful recession. When people are hurting, they're going to strike out against whoever's in charge."
 In private meetings with Republicans here over the last two days, officials said, Mr. Bush was bluntly warned that the economy and Mr. Perot posed serious threats and that winning California might be hard for him in November.
 Mr. Bush sought to reassure the executives that he, too, was a businessman at heart.
 "Forty years ago I did start a business," he said, "and that made me, I think, have some sensitivity and understanding what it means to take risks, to meet a payroll and to add to the productivity of this great country."

 In 1978, Congress deregulated the airlines to allow a natural formation of highly competitive industry, encourage new entrants, create jobs, increase airline efficiency, hold down costs and make it cheaper to fly. What you call consolidation, and I term creeping monopolization, has halted entry by new carriers and sabotaged established carriers in deregulation and entrants (of the 14 relatively alarge new airlines estabished since 1978 only America West survives). The industry is losing jobs -- 150,000 in the last four years. Productivity and profits among the three major carriers are low and sinking lower; revenues are not keeping up with costs.
 I think readers will recognize that we need more competition, not less. I would also take issue with the following areas in your assessment:
 *To hold up Southwest Airlines as the little engine that could paints an incomplete picture. Southwest has indeed achieved one of the lowest cost structures in the industry, a record America West has matched. But neither America West nor any other airline has the leegislatively mandated advantage Congress gave Southwest in 1978, with the Wright amendment.
 Southwest profits significantly from the monopoly it has created at Dallas Love Field. Its fares in the Texas market are considerably higher, compared with those elsewhere in its system (particularly on routes also served by America West.) With artificially high profits from Texas passengers, this "special advantage" as you call it, contributes roughly $75 million to the bottom line annually and allows Southwest to subsidize its operation in markets where it competes with other carriers or loses money. Without this legislative monopoly, Southwest would be losing money like everyone else.
 Southwest has driven ticket prices on competitive routes way below cost. The carrier will continue to subsidize predatory pricing conditions in other markets as long as it holds onto its monoppoly at Love Field.
 * Rapid growth has been cited by many as a major contributor to the downfall or financial problems of a number of airlines, including America West. But America West, like Southwest and others, found that the only way for the smaller lines to survive was to grow beyond our original market niches. The more sucessful we were with new routes and new markets, the fiercer the competition was to grow or be swallowed up.
 * The competitive advantages conferred on the Big Three -- American, United and Delta -- by frequent-flier programs, computerized reservations systems and landing slots are hardly water over the dam.
 The proprietary Sabre and Apollo computerized reservations systems contribute $400 million annually to the bottom line for American and United, and offset losses from ticket sales. America West alone contributes more then $3 million a month to revenue transfers. Add to that the booking advantages and incentives built into the system, and you have an overwhelming cost advantage, a formidable barrier to entry and a dangerous concentration of air traffic in the hands of a few carriers.
 * The argument that competition among relatively few airlines will keep prices in line with costs is folly. It hasn't happened yet -- performance and profitability are down, and prices in no way reflect costs -- nor is there any indication from the United States oil and gas, automobile and steel industries that it will. Industrial consolidation has meant a market closed to innovation, job creation, productivity and fair pricing.
 * Optimism about new entrants is misplaced. Of the 14 large airlines formed after deregulation in 1978 only America West survives, and it operates in Chapter 11. Sure, the industry makes room for new entrants, but it penalizes those that become too big, too successful or too aggressive. By restricting access to airports, the large airlines quash those entrants who attempt to compete on the more popular routes.
 Monopolies represent and protect inefficient industries. Unless the Government uses its antitrust powers to preserve the airline industry's competitive integrity, the result will be even less efficiency, higher fares, fewer passengers, and, ultimately, re-regulation. And that's something no one wants.

Home -- and Corporate Expansion -- on the Range

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

DATELINE: BOISE, IDAHO

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH it was already mid-afternoon, the cafeteria at the 220-acre regional campus of Hewlett-Packard Company, on a grassy plain just outside of this midsized city, still reverberated with the buzz of talk.
The need for working space has grown fast at the regional campus here, said Don Curtis, general manager for the company's site operations in Boise, as he walked a visitor through the building. The vast cafeteria is doubling as conference space until a 180,000-square-foot building -- the seventh to go up since the Boise campus opened in 1973 -- is completed in the fall. 
 What is happening at Hewlett-Packard is the norm rather than the exception here these days.
The city is becoming increasingly attractive as a business environment because of its high-quality labor pool, low crime rate and relatively inexpensive land and housing. And retail construction has also been booming ever since a regional mall was built in 1988.
In the last five years, Micron Technology, which develops electronic memories for computers, has added 650,000 square feet to its 250,000 square feet of headquarters space and leased 100,000 square feet of manufacturing space downtown.
In May 1991 it bought an additional 197 acres for $2.2 million and in October it took an option on 110 more 110 acres, all adjacent to its existing campus in the southeast section of town.
The sites are all on grassland over which cowboys traditionally drove their herds. Today, the fence around Micron's swelling headquarters limits those drives, acting as a sort of symbolic arena where the old West confronts the new.
Moreover, Micron, aware that so many companies and developers in town are also contemplating expansion, recently created a new subsidiary called Micron Construction to bid for the work.
Little wonder, then, that cranes are beginning to outnumber corrals in this 40-square-mile city.
"I've seen more construction cranes in the last five years than I saw in the previous 30," said H. Wayne Gibbs, Boise's director of planning.
For a city that used to be the butt of jokes -- for its never-ending supply of sagebrush, sheep and potatoes -- Boise has come a long way on its contemporary journey from spuds to semiconductors. It is yet another example of the 90's economic miracle of middle America, reflected in the transformation of similar cow towns like Sioux Falls, S.D., and Omaha.
A record $125 million worth of commercial construction is due to be completed in Boise in 1992, the fifth year that the figure has been around $100 million, according to the Boise City Planning Department. In the mid and early 80's such construction rarely topped $35 million.
Between 1988 and the end of 1991, 6.5 million square feet of space was put up, more than doubling the retail space and adding 20 percent to the commercial space.
MOST of the new buildings low, with four stories or fewer, and covered with a sandstone-like stucco that blends easily with the city's rim of caramel-colored hills.
Some are further shielded from sight behind high banks of grass, a response to strict environmental regulations that characterize the attitude towards growth of a latecomer like Boise.
The $125 million in construction for 1992 represents a broad mix of office, research and development and retail space, virtually all of it being built to suit. What is missing is the speculative space that doomed commercial property markets elsewhere.
"We're too small to interest the spec builders," said H. Larry Leasure, chairman of White Leasure Clark Company, commercial brokers in Boise.
Moreover, during the bustling 80's, when that sort of development was popular, he said, all three of Boise's base industries -- farming, mining and lumber -- were depressed. Further dampening speculation was the stubborn refusal of the city fathers for almost 25 years to approve a regional shopping mall unless it was downtown. The major national retail chains refused to come to town unless the mall was built in the suburbs along a highway.
In 1987, a new administration finally compromised, with a million-square-foot regional mall called Boise Town Square approved for the very edge of the city. By then there was such a pent-up demand, said Mr. Leasure, that the first mall spawned spin-off malls around its perimeter.
Micron Construction, for example, is to be the general contractor for the expansion of Franklin Towne Plaza, a 328,000-square-foot shopping center owned by Gary Hawkins, a local retail developer. To be completed later this summer, it will add 58,000 square feet of retail space and fulfill the continuing demand by national chain stores for a presence in Boise.
The extension will provide Mr. Hawkins with his favorite kind of retail complex -- something he characterizes as a "category killer." It consists of large warehouse-sized spaces favored by high-volume discount retailers.
He likes them, he says, because each company take lots of space and is willing to prelease before construction. And they sign leases of about 20 years with predetermined annual increases, something a smaller shopkeeper is unlikely to do.
The retailers say they are attracted to the space because it gives them access to the exploding population of Boise, which grew 25 percent between 1980 and 1990, from 102,000 to 126,000, and is still rising fast.
The office expansion is a result of the growth of locally based companies like Micron and Albertson's (a supermarket chain), the expansion of outside companies like Hewlett-Packard -- which is based in Palo Alto, Tex. -- plus the rising prosperity of local people and the companies that service them.
These companies say they like Boise because utilities are relatively cheap and the quality of life attracts and holds the best talent.
"Our people can be on the ski slopes in an hour," said Mr. Curtis of Hewlett-Packard. "We've got rivers, lakes, mountains. The housing is still affordable. The cultural events are accessible. The crime is low. Boise's the way American was. It keeps people here."
Then there is the caliber of labor. "A lot of the people here come to us from farming and ranching," said Nick Edwards, plant operations manager at Micron, "and that makes them hardworking. We can attract a lot of outsiders, too."
Indeed, people like to remark that every time there is an earthquake or a riot in California the job applications start rolling in, with Boise -- with its low crime, big sky, colorful outdoor cafes, river walks and balmy climate -- looking more and more like Camelot.
BUT even paradise has drawbacks. From a commercial property standpoint, problems are arising in the number of small shops that now lie empty both downtown and along neighborhood strip centers. These vacancies are a direct result of the drawing power and discount potential of the malls.
Older office space has been equally wounded, said Mr. Leasure, by the glamorous new office buildings that the increasingly prosperous local companies have been seeking. As a result there is an overabundance of B and C space, which keeps rents as low as $10 a square foot, including services, a figure that has hardly changed in 10 years. The glut has also affected Class A space, keeping those rents under $20 a square foot.
All of which provides welcome ammunition for the folks who are lobbying for a cap on further growth -- people like the residents of a condominium next to St. Luke's Medical Center who are protesting a nine-story hospital expansion because it will include a four-story parking garage beside their backyard.
"We know we have a great thing going here," said Mr. Curtis. "You can't blame us for wanting to hang onto it for just a little longer."

HEADLINE: Merchants vs. Blind Vendors: A Battle Over Feeding Rights

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
SUNLIGHT poured through the windows of the State Department of Labor's employee cafeteria here while a steady stream of state workers bearing plastic trays picked up a sandwich here, a soft drink there.
At a row of tables near the windows, solitary diners removed cellophane-wrapped lunches from brown paper bags. In the center of the room, clusters of employees, their meals finished, chatted or played card games to fill the time before they would have to return to their desks. 
 For Henry Ingra, a 39-year-old blind man who manages the 165-seat cafeteria, the audible bustle of satisfied customers was music to his finely tuned ears.
But just three blocks away, in the offices of the Trenton Downtown Association, an organization of retailers, the success of cafeterias like Mr. Ingra's has evoked a different reaction. For the retailers, the idea of scores of state workers' spending their lunch hours indoors on a pleasant afternoon spells nothing but trouble for the local economy.
Those divergent perceptions have led to a battle between Trenton's merchants and the blind vendors who manage all but one of the 15 food service areas in public buildings scattered throughout the capital.
"What they're trying to do is just put us out of business," said Mr. Ingra, referring to recent demands by the retailers' organization that state officials close all employee cafeterias and snack bars in public buildings in Trenton. "We've been in this city for over 50 years, and nobody ever complained. But now that the good times are gone and some of the big companies have moved out, they're blaming us for their problems."
Mr. Ingra, who has been legally blind since birth, is president of the Blind Vendors Association, which represents the 65 blind men and women who manage cafeterias, newsstands, snack bars and vending machine locations in public buildings across the state. The association has collected 10,000 signatures on petitions to keep the cafeterias and snack bars open.
Robert Ricci, on the other hand, who is executive director of the Trenton Downtown Association, represents more than 200 commercial and professional establishments in the capital. Mr. Ricci's organization maintains that the blind vendors have hurt local businesses by making it a little too convenient for state employees to stay in their buildings during lunch hours rather than being out in the streets patronizing restaurants and stores.
The association recently commissioned a $10,000 study that concluded that the potential economic impact of the blind vendors' food services on merchants, restaurants, the City of Trenton and the state itself amounts to nearly $10 million a year.
"We're saying that the creation of this cafeteria space has provided these vendors with an unfair competitive edge against the private market through the use of public dollars," Mr. Ricci said.
At the core of Mr. Ricci's argument is the fact that the blind vendors pay no rent for the spaces they occupy. Nor do they pay for any of the equipment, like ovens and tables and chairs, or even for some supplies, like cups, plates, knives and forks.
"It's a turnkey operation; they literally walk right in," Mr. Ricci said. "That's some piece of change they're saving, sailor."
 
Operate Under 1937 Law
 The vendors operate their businesses under a 1937 state law that allows blind people retail space in public buildings rent free and sell prepared food, prewrapped sandwiches and other snacks to employees and members of the public who use the buildings.
Mr. Ingra says that the Business Enterprise Program, as it is known, provides blind people with meaningful employment, keeps them off public assistance and allows them to function in a sighted world with a greater sense of dignity.
"It creates the situation where you get employed and stay employed," he said. "You don't have to bounce around from job to job."
Currently, Mr. Ingra said, there are 14 blind vendors in public buildings in Trenton, including those who run two full-service cafeterias -- the one he runs in the Department of Labor building and another in the building housing the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy. The remaining locations are snack bars or vending machine locations.
 
Convenience for State Employees
 And though the blind vendor program clearly benefits the vendors themselves, Mr. Ingra said, it is also a convenience for state employees because it gives them a choice of staying in their buildings to eat -- including the chance to "brown-bag" their lunch and eat it in the cafeterias or snack bars -- or going out to restaurants.
Mr. Ricci, however, sees a trend. "The Labor Department building also has a little store in there, where they sell stockings and cards," he said. "What's the next step? Are we going to put a tire place in there so you can have your tires changed too?"
The state workers, he said, are receiving a hidden "fringe benefit" that was never contemplated when they were negotiating salaries and benefits.
"Where is it that the government stops baby-sitting and wet-nursing the employees?" Mr. Ricci said.
The blind vendors, he said, have an unfair advantage over restaurants in that the money the vendors save by not paying rent and other expenses can be passed along in the form of lower prices to customers. The cafeterias, he said, can afford to sell food at 20 to 50 percent less than ordinary restaurants.
 
Retailers Advocate Closings
 Mr. Ricci's organization recently called upon state officials to immediately close all the cafeterias and to phase out seven snack bars over a three-year period.
And though officials have not yet made any response to the demand, the blind vendors feel that the state is complying with the association's demands in a subtle though no less damaging way.
"The state says it's not closing anything, but their track record doesn't indicate that," Mr. Ingra said. In fact, he said, two cafeterias have already been closed -- the one in the State House Annex that Mr. Ingra managed until last year when it was closed while the building was being renovated and another in the old Legislative Office Building across the street, which is scheduled to be renovated.
Mr. Ingra said officials had no plans at this point to provide cafeteria space in either building when the renovations are complete.
In addition, Mr. Ingra said, a snack bar in the old Division of Motor Vehicles building is also scheduled to close once the division's new building is ready for occupancy. The new building, he said, will not include a new snack bar.
 
Concern About Finding Work
 Andrea Bartow, a 41-year-old blind woman who runs the snack bar there, said she was concerned about her ability to find another job when the snack bar closed.
"I guess I'd have to do like everybody else and go on an unemployment line," Ms. Bartow said, while greeting customers from behind her cash register, which announces the amount rung up. Most of the people who eat in her 40-seat snack bar, she said, bring their own lunches, while the snacks, soft drinks and coffee they buy provide her with a decent living.
"We're just trying to give a good service for the people in the building," Ms. Bartow said. "Nobody's tying their hands to keep them in the building."
Some state employees say the concerns voiced by the retailers association may be misplaced.
"I think they're being greedy," said Julia Roman, a Department of Labor employee. "And I don't think it would help them that much even if they closed these places. People would just eat at their desks. I can't afford to pay $5 or $6 every day to eat out."
Beatrice Leon, a co-worker, agreed.
 
Retailers Complaints 'Exaggerated'
 "The lunches out there are very expensive," Ms. Leon said. "But here, for $2 or $3, I can get a good meal."
Ron Parent, the assistant supervisor for the Business Enterprise Program in the State Division of Human Services, said the retailers association's complaints are clearly exaggerated.
"I find it hard to believe that 14 blind vendors keep 13,000 state employees in their office buildings at lunch time," Mr. Parent said. "It seems to me that they're just blaming downtown Trenton's economic conditions on us."
Meanwhile, Mr. Ingra said: "I'm constantly looking over my shoulder because the building I'm in is being renovated floor by floor. I've asked what's going to happen when they get to this floor. But so far I haven't gotten any answers."

HEADLINE: Guardian of the Newest Wildlife Refuge

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG

DATELINE: VERNON

 BODY:
THE skunk cabbages that dot the swampy sections of the Wallkill River flood plain were already as big as beach balls. Fiddlehead ferns, coveted by urban gourmets, were poised to unfurl, and yellow-and-black-striped tiger swallowtails fluttered over them in twos and threes.
Fifty years ago, trains passed by this lush growth on tracks running parallel to the river. And on a recent afternoon, Sylvia Pelizza walked along that old railroad bed, pointing out wildlife and plants, and spoke about preserving them. 
 Ms. Pelizza, a 32-year-old Pueblo Indian, is the manager of the still embryonic Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge in Vernon. Her goal, and that of her employer, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, is to "preserve and enhance" the Wallkill flood plain and adjacent uplands as a wildlife habitat.
The reserve is a Federal project, but it will become an integral part of New Jersey's "greenway system," a state plan to protect natural resources and foster economic development in northwestern areas of the state.
As it now exists, the refuge consists of about 190 acres of land, an avalanche of documents and a series of continuing negotiations. Ms. Pelizza, who is the youngest refuge manager in the Fish and Wildlife Service and one of only a handful of women in similar positions, will oversee its expansion and help to develop a management plan for the next three to five years.
If all goes smoothly, the Wallkill preserve will eventually encompass 7,500 acres along the Wallkill River, stretching from New Jersey northward into Orange County in New York State.
As early as the 1700's, the Wallkill River flood plain was referred to as "the drowned lands." The predominantly soggy topography (which makes it especially desirable as a waterfowl habitat) has, in the past, been both an asset and a liability.
Early settlers could not cultivate much of the rich soil because of heavy spring flooding. Damming eventually lowered the water table, but legal wrangles between millers and farmers that arose from that damming took a large part of the 19th century (1826 through 1871). Afterward, the New Jersey section of the fertile flood plain was used for growing corn, hay and other crops.
During centuries as an active flood plain, the Wallkill Valley protected itself from development. Now as industrial and residential building encroaches on the area, it is no longer immune from such activity.
 
Fifth One in the State
 By the late 1980's, the Fish and Wildlife Service began taking steps to make the Wallkill Valley flood plain (and adjoining lands) the fifth national wildlife refuge in New Jersey. The others are the Cape May National Wildlife Refuge and the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge at Cape May, the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge at Basking Ridge and the Supawna Meadows National Wildlife Refuge at Salem.
Recently, as Ms. Pelizza drove along the eastern perimeter of the refuge, she pointed out properties already acquired for the refuge and those still in private hands. The acquisition process may take up to 25 years, because acreage is acquired only from willing sellers. This means that even a property replete with the black ducks, redheaded woodpeckers and bog turtles that the Government seeks cannot become part of the refuge until the owners want it to.
But when landowners have the will to sell, the Government sometimes lacks the means to buy. In such situations, nonprofit organizations like the New Jersey Conservation Foundation and the Trust for Public Land buy specific tracts within the proposed refuge area and hold them until the Fish and Wildlife Service can find funds to cover the price.
"The first piece of land was an old dairy farm," Ms. Pelizza said. The acreage, which was put up for sale at a 1989 sheriff's auction, was sold to the New Jersey Conservation Foundation. The Fish and Wildlife Service finally bought the parcel from the foundation last January.
 
'We'll Keep the Good Barn'
 In a era when tales of wasteful government spending abound, Ms. Pelizza points to an example of thrift on the old dairy farm. Two barns stand on the property, one a solid structure, the other in an advanced stage of dilapidation. "We'll keep the good barn and use it as a storage space for equipment," she said.
The dedication ceremony for the Wallkill Refuge was held on May 2 at the West Valley Sports Club in Vernon. Ms. Pelizza drove to the club, which is slated for inclusion in the preserve. The club, she said, has two years to relocate (a Government-assisted process) before the property will be converted to its eventual use.
As she strolled through a pristine soccer field close by the river, Ms. Pelizza said that the field, which floods naturally each spring, would probably be underwater for most of the year when it belongs to the refuge. Reaching the muddy river bank, she spotted a profusion of raccoon tracks and spoke about the possibilities for public access to the area.
"There may be fishing and limited hunting," she said, noting that the hunting of waterfowl will probably be prohibited.
Like the raccoons, some refuge denizens make themselves scarce when humans are around. Ms. Pelizza has seen evidence of bears as well as the animals she most hopes to see -- bobcats. Neighboring farmers hear coyotes howl in the night, and abird watcher in the area has seen a barred owl (which is classified as endangered).
Like the waterfowl that will stop at the refuge on their spring and fall treks, the new manager migrated to New Jersey from distant parts. Ms. Pelizza was born in New Mexico a family of outdoor aficionados. After high school, she enrolled in pre-veterinary studies at the University of New Mexico.
A change in her major, to wildlife management, enabled her to take advantage of a Government-sponsored "co-op" program that enabled students in that field to combine course work with actual job training. After graduation, program participants are placed in Fish and Wildlife Service jobs.
Ms. Pelizza's first job, at the Attwater Prairie Chicken Refuge near Eagle Lake, Tex., changed her life, she said. She met a Fish and Wildlife Service biologist, Charles Pelizza, who became her husband. She also experienced a high-humidity environment for the first time and learned to tolerate it.
The couple pursued their careers, working at refuges in California, Delaware and Michigan. More than once, they faced the problem of finding two management jobs on the same refuge, or at least on nearby refuges.
The opportunity at Wallkill turned the Pelizzas' career paths in different directions. Mr. Pelizza took a job as a biologist with responsibility for New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania refuges, and Ms. Pelizza became manager of the Wallkill refuge.
"It's worked out well," she said. "I'm more managerial, and he's more field oriented." Both commute from a home in Pennsylvania, sometimes to the same place.
Decisions about usage of various parts of the refuge will not be made until the management plan has been completed. Beginning next month, experts from diverse fields -- biologists, land management, public access and the like -- will convene to assess, plan, discuss, argue and ultimately concoct a scheme for optimum use of the land. All usage must be consistent with the primary purpose of the refuge.
Now, like one of the fledgling birds it seeks to protect, the Wallkill Refuge is poised for takeoff. As Ms. Pelizza stood on a ridge watching a pair of turkey vultures swoop over a faraway pasture, she said, "There is no feeling more exhilarating than being part of a brand-new refuge."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Price Wars Are Not Good For Profits

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
All across America last week, money managers typed lower numbers into the spreadsheets on their personal computers and concluded the personal computer industry is in trouble.
When the smoke had cleared, Compaq Computer had lost 13 percent of its market value, Apple was down 18 percent, Dell had lost 33 percent and AST Research had shed 17 percent. The market value of the four had dropped by $1.9 billion in the week. 
 The reason for the decline was simple. Compaq said it would introduce a line of "aggressively priced" personal computers. Compaq, responded an executive of mail-order discounter Dell, "will not out-Dell Dell." Dell's margins, he said, will shrink.
The reaction reflected a belief that a battle of the titans is under way on the pricing front, with small competitors to be crushed as profits vanish for all. An index of six makers of I.B.M. clones was down 18 percent from its 1992 high even before last week. Now it is off 33 percent.
"Wall Street focuses on sentiment, and right now it is incredibly negative," said Roger B. McNamee of Integral Capital Partners, who owned Dell going into the bloodbath and who bought more. Eventually, he argued, the fear of collapsing margins will be replaced with greed for the prospects of higher sales.
For the economy, the personal computer industry may be providing another warning of a sub-par recovery in corporate profits. Consumers are far from eager to spend, and many foreign economies are weak. That will put pressure on profit margins in many industries, and companies that try to raise prices on internationally traded goods are likely to prompt a surge of imports and lose market share rather than gain profits. The trade deficit is likely to keep rising.
The fate of the computer stocks also provides a reminder that the stock market has not been all that healthy of late, even if the Dow Jones industrial average had been making new highs until three weeks ago. Even with last week's drop of 69.01 points, to 3,285.35, the Dow is up 3.7 percent in 1992, but many stocks peaked in the euphoria of early January and have since been falling.
The good stock market of 1991 reflected hopes for a better economy, but it also helped to realize them by opening the door to capital for many companies that needed it badly. It has gotten harder and harder to sell initial public offerings, as was shown by the withdrawal of a planned $1 billion offering last week by GPA, the big aircraft leasing company. GPA has promised to buy billions of dollars worth of planes in coming years, and it needs more capital. It is in no danger of collapse, but it needs investors who are willing to bet that airplane prices will continue to rise as they have in the past.
Unfortunately, the saga of the personal computer makers is an indication that deflation these days is a bigger threat than inflation. The stock market might be healthier if the reverse were true.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Trembling in Japan and Mexico

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
It was rough for stock markets around the world last week. But it was especially bad in Japan and Mexico.
One market, Mexico, has been a high-flyer. Japan was just trying to lift its chin off the floor. But both, like markets around the world now, are vulnerable because of economic uncertainty and coming elections. 
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell to new 1992 lows as it settled to levels not seen since the fall of 1986. The Nikkei index is down 57.6 percent since the market hit its all-time high of 38,915.87 on Dec. 29, 1989.
The market, the worst performer in the world this year, had rallied after slumping to 16,598.15 April 9. But last week it was undermined again by a sluggish economic outlook, a government that seems unwilling to provide some stimulus, expectations of sharply declining earnings and political uncertainty as key Japanese elections approach.
And although the Nikkei rallied 473 points to close at 16,519.87 on Friday, the outlook for Japan is still glum, even more so than in other weakening markets. The economy is not recovering as fast as hoped, so earnings expectations are crumbling. The French and British markets fell last week for similar reasons.
According to the Institutional Brokers Estimate System in New York, earnings in Japan are projected to drop for the third year in a row in the fiscal year that ends in March 1993. This would be the first three-year decline since World War II. The estimates as of last week showed a decline of 1.4 percent for the year ending in March 1993, compared with drops of 19.9 percent in 1992 and 2.7 percent in 1991.
To make matters worse, the estimates keep falling. In February, the earnings of the companies in the Nikkei index were projected to increase 1.3 percent. Since then, all the revisions have been downward. Rick Pucci, vice president at Institutional Brokers, said the pace of the decline was accelerating again in June. (The only reason the 1993 estimate has not declined even more is that it uses fiscal 1992 estimates for comparison, which were also were cut drastically.)
These numbers seem to be overshadowing one positive sign in Tokyo: that the nearly 60 percent fall in the market has exposed some stocks that are good values. "From a valuation point of view, the market looks good," said Mr. Pucci. "But the estimates are dropping at such a rapid pace that it is too early to get back into the market."
In Mexico, the outlook after last week's plunge is not as sour. Douglas A. Campbell, president of D. A. Campbell Company in Santa Monica, Calif., an institutional broker, said the 12 percent fall in the market over three days has made it a little more attractive because it is less overpriced.
The 5.9 percent fall on Wednesday -- the sharpest one-day decline since 1987 -- was an abrupt turnabout for the stock market that was the best performer in dollar terms in the Financial Times world index in 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991 and the second-ranked market this year. Although the market rose on Thursday and Friday to close at 1,686.25, it was still down 7 percent for the week.
The Mexican sell-off was prompted by concerns that included the slow progress of free-trade negotiations with the United States and objections raised to an agreement by Ross Perot, the likely independent candidate for U.S. President. The projected economic benefits of such an agreement have provided much of the fuel for the tripling of the Mexican stock market's value over that last 18 months.
In addition, the Mexican Government has been raising short-term interest rates, always a bad move for a stock market, to slow growth and curb inflation. With billions of dollars in new stock issued and billions more waiting in the wings, the market is glutted.
Most important, the market was undermined by a 12.5 percent drop in its premier stock, Telefonos de Mexico or Telmex, the privatized telephone company.
Telmex accounts for about 30 percent of the Mexican Bolsa index and about 30 percent of the market's capitalization. "The Mexican market depends on a single stock more than any other market that I can think of," said Luis Luis of Scudder, Stevens & Clark in Boston. "It often accounts for over a third of the daily trades and is the only major Mexican company that is liquid in both the United States and Mexico." Telmex is traded as an American Depository Receipt on the New York Stock Exchange.
And Telmex seems to be held in what Mr. Luis calls weak hands, apt to sell quickly at any sign of bad news, dragging the market down with it, as happened last week. Telmex is owned by many investors and institutions that are not used to the volatility of Latin American markets, he said. They have only bought the stock because they need some exposure to Mexico and it trades in New York.
The fall in Mexico has been especially hard on these new bettors, who came into the market as the Government raised interest rates to tighten economic policy and as many earlier investors, including Mr. Campbell, were becoming cautious and even taking some profits.
The market reached its peak on June 1, when the Bolsa index closed at 1,907.38. It drifted down since then and plunged last week. Those who bought the most recent Telmex issue of more than $1 billion worth of stock must not be pleased. The A.D.R. was issued at $56.50 and closed on Wednesday at $45.375. Even with a two-day rally since then, Telmex is just back to $47.75. The example of Telmex is a warning to investors interested in any popular market where one stock can play such a dominant role.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Temperature Is Rising for Mr. Brennan

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
When Edward A. Brennan took the helm of Sears, Roebuck & Company in 1985, the company's future seemed solid.
But it turned shaky as the retailing environment changed, forcing Mr. Brennan into the role of a cost cutter fighting a defensive battle. In the last few years, Sears slipped from its position as No. 1 retailer in the United States to No. 3, behind Wal-Mart and K Mart. And many shareholders have howled for the company's breakup to realize the value of its many parts, which include Allstate, Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker. 
 Things haven't gotten any easier lately. Last month, Mr. Brennan weathered a rocky annual meeting at which discontented shareholders showed surprising strength on a variety of issues. The company responded last week by loosening up a number of corporate governance rules. "It's a nice start," said one leading dissident, Robert Monks, adding, however, that more was needed.
Meanwhile, Mr. Brennan has been trying to cope in the last two weeks with charges by California and New Jersey regulators that Sears auto centers had duped customers.
The company's initial response -- denying the charges and calling them politically motivated -- was criticized by public relations and crisis management experts as not responsive to the consumer issue. Ultimately, Sears ran newspaper ads signed by Mr. Brennan pledging that the company would satisfy its customers.
Does Mr. Brennan, who is 58, feel like events are ganging up on his stewardship? He was philosophical in a telephone interview late last week. "I think that's part of the job," he said. "We have had a fairly full plate, and that seems to be the way things develop."
But he is not the only company chairman feeling the heat, he added. "The economy has been difficult for the last two years," he said. "It's simply a very busy time for everybody."
Maybe so, but his seat has got to be feeling a little hotter these days than the others.

HEADLINE: Czechoslovakia's Wall Street Brigade

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
"Okay, you ex-Commies, let's rock and roll!" The voice of Axl Rose of the Guns 'n' Roses rock band boomed across Prague's vast Spartakiadni stadium, built to display the prowess of Communist athletes but now hosting a hirsute mass of newly capitalistic youths apparently intent on recreating Woodstock. Strobes flashed, fireworks flared, videos rolled. The jeans-clad Czechoslovak crowd seemed suitably wowed.
But a small group of neatly coiffed gentlemen in the audience displayed a certain ennui. Ex-Wall Streeters rather than ex-Communists, they were plainly finding it awkward to rock 'n' roll. 
 What else to do, however, on a spring night in Prague when you have left your wife and children behind in Manhattan or Connecticut, abandoned the likes of Dean Witter and First Boston in mid-career, and given yourself to a lonely existence devoted to the transformation of a Communist state into a market economy?
"We play tennis and we've started a basketball group, but mainly it's work, work, work," said Thomas S. Douglas, a former director at Prudential Bache. "This is a deal junkie's heaven."
Mr. Douglas, 43 years old, is one of a 15-member group of American bankers and financiers who have formed the Crimson Capital Corporation. (Yes, echoes of Harvard.) Spurred by a mixture of midlife crises, vague idealism and simple curiosity, the 15 have dumped Wall Street and the Hamptons for Prague and one-room homes at the Forum Hotel here.
Paid by the United States Government, they have since September been Czechoslovakia's deal makers. Their goal: to find buyers for the thousands of companies the nation is selling as it hurries toward capitalism, to expedite deals while insuring that the state gets a fair price.
"Having worked 20 years on Wall Street, I asked myself whether I could go to my grave having done just one thing or, having hit 40, should I try something else?" said Alistair Keith, a 45-year-old former partner at Brown Brothers Harriman. "And the thing that decided me when I came here was that, amid a total shambles, there was this incredible enthusiasm coming from actually helping to transform a country."
 
Americans in the Lead

 
 The relationship between the Czechoslovak Government and Crimson is unique in Eastern Europe; nowhere else have Americans managed to reach a position of such decisive influence in the conversion of an economy. Whether there will eventually be a backlash against what a populist politician might portray as an invasion by Uncle Sam remains an open question.
For now, however, the team's results have been dramatic, and the group is popular. Total foreign investment committed to Czechoslovakia over the past year reached $5 billion, including almost $1.4 billion from United States companies that had previously shied away. The pace of privatization overall raced ahead faster than elsewhere in the former Soviet bloc.
A report this month from the Privatization Minister, Tomas Jezek, underscored the warm relationship. It estimated that the team's Wall Street-honed negotiating skills had achieved improvements averaging 353 percent on the value placed by the Government on assets to be sold.
Among the companies with which the United States group has negotiated deals on behalf of the Czechoslovak Privatization Ministry are Philip Morris, which has agreed to pay $413 million for control of the Tabak cigarette maker; American Standard, which is paying $25 million for the Keramicke zavody Teplice toilet maker; K Mart, which has acquired the Prior & Maj department store chain for $118 million, and Coca-Cola's Australian bottler, which bought the Prazske soft drink concern for $89 million.
"Our culture is closing deals," said Mart Bakal, a former Drexel Burnham director who leads the Crimson team. "We reckon if we we can't get things done, why be here?"
But the very pace of these and other transactions raises questions of central importance to all former Soviet bloc countries as they seek to switch to market economies.
Will the disposal of large swaths of an economy to foreign corporations inevitably provoke a political backlash? What alternative is there when domestic capital is scarce? Will the Czechoslovak method of pushing for rapid privatization, ardently preached by Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus, be vindicated? Or do the more cautious methods of Hungary and Poland provide a better model for Russia as it too confronts the core issue of disposing of state property?
A recent United Nations Economic Commission report on Eastern Europe pinpointed these problems. "Where the balance lies between the advantages of foreign direct investment and the potential for an erosion of economic sovereignty which it entails . . . is something that still needs to be worked out," it said.
 
Is Faster Better?

 
 Already, within Czechoslovakia, sharp differences have emerged. Vladimir Meciar, the populist leader who was the big winner in Slovakia in the nation's elections this month, opposes Mr. Klaus's rapid economic reforms. These reforms include a mass sale of shares in 1,446 state companies to the public through a complex voucher system, as well as the sales to foreigners. Indeed, differences between Mr. Klaus and Mr. Meciar on various issues are so great that a break-up of the 74-year-old Czechoslovak federation has been suggested.
Even in the wealthier, more populous, Czech lands, there is opposition to Mr. Klaus. "The privatization process speeded by these U.S. financiers must be slowed or the whole country will be dominated by international conglomerates," said Zbynek Kozel, deputy international secretary of the center-left Social Democratic Party. "It's a dangerous sellout."
Despite such uncertainties, the United States has adopted a firm position: the faster privatization goes in Eastern Europe, the better.
"Czechoslovakia stands out because it is the place where large-scale privatization has reached take-off stage," said Robert Barry, the coordinator for United States assistance to Central and Eastern Europe at the State Department. "The problem with proceeding case-by-case as in Hungary, or in stop-go fashion as in Poland, is that you end up wasting a lot of time and money. Our assistance is going to flow to the places where most privatization is taking place."
In fact, of the $35 million that Mr. Barry said had been committed to the region this year by the United States Agency for International Development (A.I.D.), close to half has gone to Czechoslovakia.
Some of that money has in turn gone to pay for the services of the team of American financial experts. "I can't tell you what exactly we're making," said Mr. Bakal, "but it's less than a fifth of what we could earn in the real world." One estimate in Prague is that they are each paid $500 to $950 a day, although that must cover all their expenses, including hotel, food and travel. Also, unlike the Wall Street experience, they make no commissions on their deals, or bonuses for their work.
It was the initiative of Mr. Bakal, a 41-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer, that brought the group to Prague. After the collapse of Drexel -- from which he emerged unscathed -- and a spell as president of a computer company called Tigera, he was casting around last year for something new.
The uncharted economic territory of Eastern Europe lured him, and in Czechoslovakia he found unbridled chaos in the embryonic Privatization Ministry. There were just 27 employees, including drivers and secretaries, and all deals were being hammered out around a huge, typewriter-littered U-shaped table.
Two major deals -- the $6.4 billion sale of the Skoda automobile works to Volkswagen and the $44 million sale of Rakona detergents to Procter & Gamble -- had already closed. But they had left Czechoslovak officials with an uneasy feeling that they were out of their depth.
"We realized we needed financial know-how and that foreign experts could pass on something of tremendous importance," said Miroslaw Zamecnik, economic adviser to President Vaclav Havel.
But, as John Rogers, an A.I.D. official in Prague, put it, "How many Czechs can sit down with a tough U.S. or German corporate lawyer without getting taken to the cleaners?"
A deal, initially for three months, was struck between Mr. Bakal and Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm that held an A.I.D. contract to provide financial expertise in Czechoslovakia. In effect, Deloitte subcontracted part of its work to Mr. Bakal. He proceeded to set up Crimson Capital (after his alma mater, Harvard), and gather a team to work for it.
"I felt it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform an economy and write the textbook as one went along," said Mr. Bakal. "I figured the chance of success was probably about 5 percent. But if we succeeded, we'd be big heroes; and if we failed, nobody would blame us."
On a personal level, however, it was not an easy decision. The move to Prague divided Mr. Bakal's family, leaving his wife and son in a newly acquired house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, while he and his daughter searched out the dubious comforts of the Forum Hotel.
In similar fashion, Mr. Keith left his wife and two children in Manhattan, and Mr. Douglas, his family in Connecticut. Michael Gold, a management consultant, left his wife and two children even further way -- in Los Angeles. As a result, they all tend to work three or four weeks nonstop and then return to the United States for a five-day break.
Why embark on such a crazed life? "The big change from Wall Street is that you feel good about yourself," said Mr. Bakal.
And it does seem clear that their frenetic activity is making a difference. Conditions in the Privatization Ministry were initially terrible. Indeed, Mr. Keith was obliged to negotiate Coca-Cola's $89 million investment on a bench in a corridor. But as trust grew, the ministry provided a series of rooms with personal computers for the team to use. Mr. Bakal even attends weekly cabinet meetings where he advises ministers on the privatization process.
The Privatization Minister, Mr. Jezek, has been generous in his praise of Mr. Bakal's team. In his recent report, he said, "They have both greatly facilitated the privatization process and substantially improved the terms of the transactions."
The report added that the bankers had been successful in insuring that technical and marketing know-how was transferred to the Czechoslovakian companies, that as many jobs as possible were safeguarded, and that in a highly polluted country the new owners would move factories to sounder environmental policies.
Charles Jelinek-Francis, the Privitization Ministry's director of foreign investment, said Crimson is "taking us on the fastest road from here to there, which we believe is the only way to instill a capitalist culture."
 
A Need to Say No

 
 At first, the tough negotiating stance of Mr. Bakal's group caused alarm. "We'd spend all day saying no to offers from foreign companies that had expected a walkover, and the ministry officials would get very agitated because they did not want to lose the deal," recalled Mr. Douglas. "But in the end they saw it worked."
Stewart A. Halpern, who worked eight years in investment banking at the First Boston Corporation before coming to Prague this year to work with Mr. Bakal, recalled how he lured competition into one deal in order to substantially improve an offer that had already been approved by the Czechoslovak Government.
The initial offer, from Lekyam Murtaler, an Austrian paper maker, valued Czechoslovakia's largest paper distributor, Ospap, at $24.2 million. It also said staff at the company would be cut to 570 from 700 by 1994. But by luring a much larger West European paper maker into the bidding, Mr. Halpern said, he persuaded Murtaler to raise its bid to $34.4 million and to continue to use Czechoslovak mills as suppliers of 90 percent of raw materials for three years.
Such successes have gained recognition. What is happening in Prague, said Mr. Barry of the State Department, "is a model for the kind of thing we would like to do throughout the region." Mr. Jezek, he said, had recently asked for assistance to be continued for another year and money had been found for this purpose.
But he acknowledged that political problems had emerged. "Clearly attitudes differ between Mr. Klaus and Mr. Meciar over the pace of privatization, and it is hard to evaluate how this will evolve," he said. "Our own view is that a slowdown will create stresses and strains."
As for Crimson Capital, it is settling in for the long haul. Mr. Bakal does not think the current political tensions will slow investment because he is convinced any change in the status of Czechoslovakia would be peacefully negotiated. And he argues that any violent backlash against the rapid push to private enterprise, much of it foreign-owned, "is at least a generation away."
 
 
 
NEXT: ALL OF EUROPE
 For the men of the Crimson Capital Corporation, moving to Czechoslovakia amounted to an escape from Wall Street and an opportunity to do something more worthwhile than merely make money. "It was a chance to make a difference," said Bruce P. Bybee, who quit a job at Prudential Bache to join Crimson.
Which is not at all to say they have lost their instinct for business opportunities and profit. After close to a year in Prague, they say that their long-term plan is to turn their operation into a private investment bank working throughout Eastern Europe.
"We've developed a commanding position in international banking in this area of the world and the greatest knowledge base of businesses in Czechoslovakia," said Mart Bakal, head of the group. "Our intellectual assets are unique and the opportunities enormous, so sure I'd like to develop this into a private bank." He suggested this could happen within two years.
Up to now, Mr. Bakal and his colleagues have scarcely lived like private bankers. Every time they visit the United States, they must vacate their rooms at the Forum Hotel and stash their things in a basement. On return, there is a a new room.
"There are some real sacrifices," said Alistair Keith, a Crimson man from Brown Brothers Harriman. These sacrifices, including long hours, amount to what the Crimson group calls its "sweat equity." The sweat has produced a reputation. Mr. Bakal has had inquiries from from Croatia to Hungary about helping in the privatization processes there.
Of course, this reputation has been built at the expense of the United States taxpayer. The people at Crimson are being paid by the United States Agency for International Development. Is it right, then, that they should go private with the expertise they have gained?
"When advisers in a foreign country want to stay there and go into private business, I don't know if there's a clear answer as to whether that is a good thing," said John Rogers, an A.I.D. official. He declined to comment further.
For Mr. Bakal, however, there is no doubt that the opportunities will eventually require independence. "There's an enormous amount to do in other countries," he said, "and as investment bankers, our instinct is to take charge."
 
 
 
THE MAKING OF A DEAL IN CIGARETTES
 The Crimson Capital Corporation's essential contribution to Czechoslovakia has been to provide financial and negotiating know-how that has enabled the state to make far more money off its asset sales than it might have otherwise. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the sale of the Tabak cigarette manufacturer to Philip Morris.
Tabak is not a very profitable company. It made about $2 million in 1990. But it is large -- annual sales total about $176 million -- and it has a 55.7 percent share of the 30 billion-cigarette Czechoslovak market.
With cigarette consumption stagnant or falling in Western Europe and the United States, such a big share in a growing market carries a premium. Moreover, many Western cigarette manufacturers saw Tabak as an ideal base from which to export to Russia and central Asia.
An initial public tender was organized last October by Nomura International P.L.C. It attracted bids from Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds and the French cigarette group Seita, among a total of seven offers for the whole of the company and four for a portion. The highest bid, from Philip Morris, valued Tabak's equity at $250 million, according to the Czechoslovak Privatization Ministry.
Intense lobbying of the Czechoslovak Government by several Western cigarette manufacturers now began. Sell all of Tabak? Only part with a a minority stake? By March of this year, the government, sensing the potential in such intense interest, decided to bring in Crimson Capital to help oversee the sale.
A revised tender was then organized by Crimson Capital with Nomura making clear that the state wished to cede control of Tabak and inviting higher bids. Philip Morris raised its valuation of Tabak's equity to $348 million and agreed to put a total of $413 million into the company, including modernizaton and a capital increase. The closest rival offer was from R.J. Reynolds at $291 million.
"We got an extraordinary price," said Mr. Bakal. "These kinds of multiples don't exist in the West."
Louis Camilleri, Philip Morris International's vice president for Eastern and Central Europe, would say only that "The bidding process was very open and transparent," adding that the company saw phenomenal growth potential in the East European and Russian markets.

Boris Yeltsin, Dove and Democrat, Comes to Call on Washington 

When Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin visited the United States last week, he came as a peacemaker and as a democrat. As a peacemaker, he entered into a nuclear arms reduction agreement of unrivaled proportions. As a democrat, he warned that democracy in Russia remains fragile. Mr. Yeltsin asked the West for aid. But freeing up the $24 billion America and its wealthy partners already pledged to help Russia become a market economy can only be done by the International Monetary Fund. In exchange for freeing the funds, the I.M.F. has demanded harsh changes, including a balanced budget in Moscow -- not even the United States is capable of that -- and removal of price controls on oil. Russia has not said nyet, but it has said not just now. Last week, the Bush Administration called on the I.M.F. to ease up or risk destabilizing Mr. Yeltsin's democratic government. The I.M.F. is not likely to act very soon.

The Maxwells' Serious Trouble
 
When investigators at Britain's Office of Serious Fraud arrested Ian and Kevin Maxwell, sons of the late media magnate Robert Maxwell, and Larry S. Trachtenberg, an American adviser to the family's businesses, it was part of a seven-month investigation. The charges included stealing from the Maxwell companies' pension funds and conspiring to defraud two Swiss banks. According to the investigators, $1.6 billion is missing from the Maxwell companies and funds. Inquiries will continue, the office said.

A Global Model of Slow Growth
 
The United Nation's blue-helmeted peacekeepers may be on the front line, but its army of number-crunching economists also do their part. Each year they feed data from 70 countries into a computer model and come up with their World Economic Survey and forecasts. The first global recession since World War II "will turn to recovery in the industrialized world this year,"said Barry Herman, a U.N. economist. But nowhere will growth be brisk. According to the survey, the U.S. will grow by 1.6 percent this year; Canada by 2.5 percent; Japan by 1.9 percent; and the industrial world as a whole by 1.7 percent. Eastern Europe and Russia "will continue with their difficulties," Mr. Herman said.

McDonnell Jettisons the Jumbo

For a cash-strapped company like the McDonnell Douglas Corporation to say it would bring out a new 500-seat jumbo jet in the midst of a global slowdown and a cutthroat shakeout among United States airlines, was a daring move, to say the least. But McDonnell failed to bring in a single order for its double-decker plane, and its primary investor, a Taiwanese group that included the Government, decided not to risk the $2 billion the company said it would need to do the development work. Last week, McDonnell announced it would delay its MD-12 program until next year. "All we're doing is recognizing the reality of the marketplace," said John Thom, a spokesman for the company.

The Fizzle in Buying American
 
Americans still love foreign-made goods, while recession overseas has dampened demand for American products, The result? The Commerce Department said America's trade deficit widened to $6.97 billion in April.

Is Detroit Inefficiency a Myth?

For all of Detroit's grumbling about foreign competition, a study by the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington said it costs the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation less than their Japanese rivals to build small cars. Ford can put together a set of wheels for $5,415 while it costs Chrysler $5,841. It costs Toyota $6,216 to make a small car. But critics contend America's overall advantage comes from a cheaper dollar, not more efficient plants. Toyota can still put together a car in less time any American company. And what about quality? "We did an evaluation," said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., one of the study's authors. "The Japanese have a slight edge. Several years ago, per hundred cars, the Japanese had 100 defects, we had 500. Today we have 25 defects per hundred. The gap is narrower," he said.
 
Last week a British media company controlled by a group of Saudi Arabian investors made a cash bid of $3.5 million for the United Press International news service. It is up to the bankruptcy court to decide the outcome.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Bellying Up to the Buffet
 
If you're going to dine at a Pizza Hut restaurant, it might be helpful to wear trousers with an elastic waistband. After testing the concept for four months, Pizza Hut, a unit of Pepsico Inc., began last week to offer all-you-can-eat buffets piled high with pasta, salads and pizza, for $3.99 at selected restaurants. The pastas and salads have been added to the menu to entice those who are seeking lighter fare. By the end of the year, Pizza Hut buffets will be tempting tummies and busting diets at 2,000 locations across the country. Initially, the buffets will be open for lunch, where Pizza Hut's business has been flat. Dinner buffets are expected to follow. "It is phase one of our effort to revitalize our dine-in business," said Steven S. Reinemund, Pizza Hut's president.

A Transition at Time Warner
 
Steven J. Ross, chairman and co-chief executive of Time Warner Inc., gained a reputation as a savvy deal maker with oodles of charm, a knack for managing creative people and a penchant for rewarding himself mightily. Mr. Ross made $78 million last year. But last week Mr. Ross informed Time Warner's stockholders that he would take an indefinite leave while he struggles to overcome cancer. Assuming Mr. Ross' duties will be Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner's newly elevated co-chief executive. But Mr. Levin has his work cut out for him. Mr. Ross was in the midst of finding foreign investors to help Time Warner reduce its huge debt. Wall Street believes Mr. Levin is up to the job. The company's stock opened the week at $106 7/8 and finished at $110 1/8.

And Next, Coals to Newcastle?
 
While the delegates were schmoozing in Rio at the Earth Summit about how to preserve the world's environment, United States Windpower Inc., based in Livermore, Calif., was busy making deals to sell its electric-power producing windmills to the Dutch. But unlike the wooden windmills native to the Netherlands, Windpower's machines are high-tech beasts big enough to scare off any Don Quixote. They have 100-foot wingspans. For about $25 million, Windpower will deliver 80 windmills to E.G.D., the Dutch power company.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
The Compromise on Urban Aid
 
After months of wrangling, Congress and the White House reached an agreement on an aid package to the nation's cities. The measure was approved last week in the Senate and the House. The package provides $1.3 billion for 360,000 summer jobs for youths in 75 cities. It also replenishes the coffers of the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the $495 million they lent to repair property damaged during the Los Angeles riots and the Chicago flood in April. But like most compromises, this one was not universally liked. "It's not sufficient," said Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader.

A Cable Turnabout at the F.C.C.
 
One thing the Federal Communications Commission doesn't seem to fear is concentration of ownership of the media. Last week it voted 5 to 0 to allow broadcast television networks to buy up local cable television systems. The ruling overturns a 20-year ban on such activity. With revenues of about $18 billion, the F.C.C. decided, the cable industry can tolerate a little competition. But the vote created fear among the networks' historic partners -- the broadcast affiliates. The affiliates worry networks could bypass them by putting their best programming on their wholly owned cable systems. "What if my network now all of a sudden becomes my major competitor in the marketplace?" said Mick Schafbuch, general manager of KOIN-TV in Portland, Ore.

Productivity's Factory Factor
 
Overall productivity growth increased by 2.7 percent, the largest jump in two years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week. But productivity fell by 1 percent in the nation's factories. "The numbers mirror the fact that manufacturing is still weak while services are strong," said Bob Bannon, an economist at Idea, a financial research firm in New York. "Manufacturing will turn around in the next three months."
 
The Recovery Pumps Iron
 
This recovery is certainly no Hulk Hogan, but it has at least a little muscle. Builders broke ground on new homes at an annual rate of 1.23 million last month. That was 11 percent higher than the April rate, the Commerce Department said, when housing starts fell by 17.3 percent. May's starts were the highest since February 1991. "There is a very definite recovery in place," said Edward Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. But he warned the recovery will not be robust.

Supercollider Support Atomizes
 
In last week's confrontation in Congress between big science and the bigger Federal deficit, the deficit won. Congress voted to halt work on the $8.4 billion superconducting supercollider. The collider was designed to smash tiny atomic fragments into even tinier bits underneath the sands of Texas in an effort to understand how the universe is put together. More than 18,000 contracts have already been let out to thousands of companies. But while Congress saves money, industry may suffer, because some supercollider technology has commercial applications. "What we would be missing is the chance to build an infrastructure that would make superconductivity attractive in a variety of applications," said Richard Hora, vice president of energy business for the space systems division of the General Dynamics Corporation, one of three big magnet contractors for the project.

HEADLINE: When Trucks and Trains Unite

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

DATELINE: LOWELL, Ark.

 BODY:
For decades, trucking companies and railroads have eyed each other as enemies. Truckers in many cases convinced shippers that railroads only knew how to move big loads of grain, coal and other commodities long distances, while trucks, they said, could move most anything better.
Railroad executives grumbled but were unable to stem the onslaught, and trucking made huge inroads. Trucks now transport about 25 percent of the nation's freight, compared with a little more than 5 percent at the end of World War II; railroads move 38 percent of the freight now, down from nearly 70 percent just after the war. 
 Recently, however, some trucking companies and railroads have begun to make peace. Instead of battling, they have been forming alliances, and the alliances have been transforming the way freight moves. The movement began less than three years ago with the emergence of long-haul deals. A new thrust into short-haul freight, if successful, could bring a huge shift of cargo to the nation's railroads.
The agreement that started both sides rethinking the old rivalry was forged in October 1989 between J. B. Hunt Transport Services Inc., the nation's second-largest long-haul trucker, and the Santa Fe Railway, the country's seventh-biggest railway.
Instead of moving trailers by truck from Chicago to the West Coast, J. B. Hunt now hands them over to Santa Fe, which lifts them onto flat rail cars on trains dedicated to transporting containers and trailers.
While such handoffs were made in the past by specialized carriers, like United Parcel Service, no major trucking company before the Hunt-Santa Fe deal would turn over its freight-filled trailers to a railroad unless the customer demanded it. Most trucking companies, in fact, still compete fiercely with the railroads, even for coast-to-coast moves, where the railroads have been able to make inroads against truckers.
But the executives at J. B. Hunt, which now has similar deals with the Burlington Northern, Southern Pacific and Union Pacific, have taken a pragmatic stance: If a railroad can provide service as punctual and as good as trucking, why not move loads by rail?
"We're combining competitive strengths," Kirk Thompson, Hunt's president and chief executive, said in an interview at the company's new headquarters overlooking pastures and gullies here in the northwestern part of Arkansas. "It's a perfect joint relationship."
This year, 14 to 15 percent of Hunt's loads will move by rail, and the business has been growing so rapidly the company projects up to half may move that way in five years.
Most of the new business involves loads that have been taken from other trucking companies -- a trend that is forcing major competitors of Hunt, like Schneider National, to seek their own alliances with railroads.
Since railroads can move the trailers more efficiently, using less fuel and manpower, Hunt and its rail partners have been able to offer rates lower than regular trucking rates.
Graeme Lidgerwood, a trucking analyst for the First Boston Corporation, said truckers will face ever-mounting pressure from the railroads and truck-rail alliances because the cost of moving trailers long distances was so much lower by rail compared with using tractor trailers on the highway.
"The handwriting is on the wall," she said.
So far, Hunt has concentrated on the very long trips where railroads, by improving their piggyback service, have been picking up business
Next month, however, Hunt, in combination with Conrail, will take on the heart of trucking: trips of between 700 to 1,000 miles, which make up the largest portion of moves.
"No one has been able to find an economic way to do it so far," Paul R. Bergant, the executive vice president of marketing and general counsel for J. B. Hunt said.
With Conrail having developed the ability to have most of its trains arrive on schedule, or within minutes of the expected time, he believes that the two will be able to persuade shippers to take a chance and try a combination of rail and truck for distances that are now almost totally dominated by trucking.
If the venture succeeds, Mr. Bergant believes, it will cause a big shift in the way goods are now moved, with rail regaining freight that most rail executives believed had gone permanently out of their reach.
"We believe it will work, and we believe we're the perfect catalyst," he said.
When Michael Haverty, the president and chief operating officer of the Santa Fe Railway, came to talk to Hunt about an alliance in September of 1989, Hunt's top executives were ready to listen.
The growing reluctance of drivers to go long distances and spend weeks away from home was causing havoc within the industry. Turnover was so high that Hunt and other major trucking companies had to keep rigs idle because they could not find new drivers.
Even with big wage gains and new allowances for drivers to return home more often, Hunt still has a turnover of 150 percent a year, a common rate among carriers.
Tom Williams, vice president of Hunt's trucking-rail moves, recalled that not only did labor costs shoot up in the late 1980's, but insurance fuel and road taxes all soared too.
Also the rapid growth that had come under trucking deregulation in 1980, which led to the failure of many trucking companies locked into high-cost union contracts, was slowing. Hunt, which had seen its revenues swell in the late 80's, saw a leveling off as it entered the 90's.
On the railroad side, labor costs were tumbling as concessions by unions allowed companies to cut tens of thousands of jobs.
The industry had also put together a formidable weapon that could be used to compete against trucking -- high-speed, punctual trains that carried nothing but containers, mostly from steamship companies, and truck trailers steered to the railroads, mostly by shipping agents.
For years, railroads had provided high-quality service to a limited number of customers, like the Postal Service, where shipments had to arrive on time.
"There was relatively no margin for error," said Stephen H. Mitchell, a Santa Fe executive who now heads the partnership with Hunt, known as Quantum.
The problem , he said, was that even though railroads had vastly improved their performance, shippers were still doubtful.
"The time-sensitive shipment still moved on the highway," he said, "even though we had trains that could do it." To wean shippers from trucking, he added, "was a hard sell."
At the same time, however, it was becoming clear that for freight moving long distances, like between Los Angeles and Chicago, where trains with double-stacked trailers could make the run in about 50 hours, trucking had trouble staying in the race.
To make the same run as fast, trucking companies had to have two drivers in the cab so they could spell each other while keeping the truck moving with only short stops. But then it was becoming harder to get drivers to put up with such conditions, and the cost of such runs was rising because of the need for two drivers.
"The railroads were getting better," John E. Philp, the vice president of merchandise marketing for the Union Pacific, recalled, "while the motor carriers were having problems. This has driven them together."
And it appears customers are pleased with the new service.
Doug Ely, manager of transportation for the Kransco Group, which makes Frisbees, body-surfing boards and battery-powered cars for children, has found that shipping by a combination of truck and train saves about 20 percent in shipping costs. About one-third of his shipments move through Hunt.
"It's working real well," he said. The company said many of its shipments must arrive on time and that the intermodal trains now meet their schedules.
He also likes dealing with Hunt because the shipment will be handled by Hunt drivers on both ends. "It's one-stop shopping," he said.
The team effort has proved so effective that it has forced many major trucking companies to begin to search for partners.
"Motor carriers are coming to us," Mr. Philp said. "They are feeling the pressure."
Schneider National, the nation's largest long-haul carrier, has begun to move some of its Los Angeles-to-Chicago freight on the Southern Pacific railroad and will soon have an agreement with Conrail for short hauls.
"I'm pragmatic," Donald Schneider, the chairman of the Green Bay, Wis., company said. Railroad operating costs were coming down, he noted, while those in trucking have been rising again. Thus, he said, on certain long-haul moves, the railroads now have the advantage and trucking will have to adjust.
He estimated from 5 to 10 percent of Schneider's loads could move by rail by the end of this year.
North American Van Lines, the nation's sixth-largest trucking company, is in talks with Union Pacific, which could result in one of the most far-reaching agreements.
Unlike the agreements between Hunt and its partner railroads, which do not allow any other trucking company to participate, the North American Van Lines alliance with the Union Pacific would allow in other transportation companies.
For railroads, the new business is largely gravy since they do not have to make any significant investment to move the added freight. There is plenty of room on their tracks to add extra trains. But, as Mr. Mitchell, of the Santa Fe Railway, noted, railroads have expensive plant and overhead costs.
"We have huge fixed costs out there that we have to maintain," he said, "and we want to get as much freight as we can."
 
 
J. B. HUNT: A TRUCKING EMPIRE BUILT ON CHICKEN LITTER
 Johnnie Bryan Hunt is a classic Horatio Alger character who turned chicken litter into his first fortune and then used that money to build a trucking company that has become the nation's second-largest.
As the owner now of J. B. Hunt Transport Services Inc., Mr. Hunt, 65, oversees a fleet of 5,500 tractors and 12,000 trailers that streak across highways in 48 states and in Canada and Mexico. He is also worth about $250 million.
Mr. Hunt grew up in the Depression and left school at age 12 to help support his family. His first long-term job was to deliver lumber for his uncle -- but first he had to sell it.
"That was my master's degree in selling," he recalled in a recent interview.
He joined the army in World War II, providing him his first look at the world beyond his rural birthplace of Heber Springs, Ark. When he was discharged in 1947, he was 20 years old. He returned to work for his uncle, but after borrowing $10 from a friend, he went back to Little Rock to look for job and eventually became a driver for East Texas Motor Freight.
On his runs through rice-growing areas, he noticed that farmers were burning off the rice hulls after harvest. But he had what he considered a better idea: Why not use them for chicken litter, which he had sold as a youth? He raised $105,000 by selling stock, borrowed $35,000 from a bank, and in 1960 built a plant to process the hulls.
The first year, the J. B. Hunt Company operated at a loss. Johnelle, his wife, said that was one of the darkest periods in their lives because they had risked everything the plant.
But eventually the company prospered and became the world's largest poultry-litter producer.
By the late 1960's, Mr. Hunt began to look for another challenge.
In 1969, he bought a small trucking company of five trucks and seven trailers in Stuttgart, Ark., and moved it to Lowell, Ark. The company grew, but slowly, until the early 80's when the trucking industry was deregulated. The growth after that was explosive as it became much easier to get route authority to all 48 states.
Mr. Hunt said that throughout the 80's, the company grew largely by getting new business and then building its trucking operations to handle it, an approach, he said, that reflected his salesman's personality. Mr. Hunt, who is over six feet tall and likes to wear big Western-style hats with his business suits, has some simple rules for his success at selling. "I groom myself to be presentable. Polish my shoes. Get my stuff together. I call on people without an appointment. I never sit down. I stand there hat in hand, ready to go for the door."
"I never stay too long but try to leave two seconds before they want me out," he added. "That way they're eager to see me again."

Legal Victories for Gay Workers

SERIES: First of two articles on gay and lesbian employment.

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
Gay activism has come a long way since those raucous evenings in the 1950's when a pony dancer used to jump onto the bar at a gay hangout in San Francisco and lead the crowd in choruses of "God Bless Us Nellie Queens." As the gay community prepares to celebrate its annual "pride week," which will culminate next weekend with marches in several cities, gay rights advocates say the effects of years of organizing and educating are finally being seen, nowhere more clearly than in the workplace.
Not only are gay men and lesbians variously stepping, sidling and leaping out of the closet -- according to personal style and the degree of risk they perceive to themselves -- many are no longer willing to tolerate the anti-gay policies and behavior endemic in some workplaces. "They are more willing to assert their rights than they ever were," said Paula L. Ettelbrick, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a New York-based group that does test-case litigation. 
 Lambda just won a suit on behalf of a deputy sheriff in Florida who had been dismissed for being gay. In a Federal district court in Atlanta, a lesbian whose job offer from the Georgia Attorney General's office was withdrawn after she disclosed she had married her female partner in a religious ceremony won the right last month to challenge the agency's decision. And in Massachusetts 10 days ago, a ruling recognizing the legal standing of an unmarried heterosexual couple in benefit claims laid the groundwork for a challenge by gay groups.
Paralleling successes in litigation are incremental victories in state legislatures. The rights of gay people remain a "balkanization of protections," said Kevin M. Cathcart, Lambda's executive director. But since 1989, five states have included sexual orientation among the protected categories in their civil rights laws, bringing the total to six: Wisconsin, Vermont, New Jersey, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Connecticut, plus the District of Columbia. More than 85 cities now have ordinances forbidding job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
And though the ultimate goal, a Federal anti-discrimination law, is likely to remain in its state of suspended animation at least until a more sympathetic political party moves into the White House, significantly more people are protected than they were when the first state law was passed in Wisconsin in 1982. "Besides the practical effects, there is the symbolism of the states," said William B. Rubenstein, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, which is litigating the Georgia case. "It's an implicit signal to Congress that a Federal law is more realistic."
Mr. Rubenstein attributes the acceleration of gains to the increasing focus on family issues among gay men and lesbians. "The AIDS crisis and the Sharon Kowalski case have made it clear for a lot of gay people the consequences of our relationships not being recognized by the law," Mr. Rubenstein said. "Hospitals have visitation policies for family members. A lover may not be considered a family member." After an eight-year legal battle with the family of Sharon Kowalski, a Minnesota woman who was left disabled by a car accident in 1983, her companion Karen Thompson was recently appointed Ms. Kowalski's guardian.
In the workplace, lack of recognition may not have life-or-death consequences, but it raises questions of fairness. Several groups report an explosion of calls from unmarried gay and straight employees interested in obtaining benefits for members of their households. Only a handful of companies offer benefits -- a form of compensation -- to nonmarried partners. "It's as if a job posting said, 'Lesbians and gay men: $30,000; heterosexuals: $40,000,' " Mr. Rubenstein said.
The demand for spousal benefits runs against a trend in business toward cutting benefits -- and against the might of conventional insurance plans. But the reason for corporate resistance gives gay-rights advocates cause for hope. "For most employers, it's not that they don't want to recognize gay and lesbian rights," said Ms. Ettelbrick of Lambda. "They find the arguments compelling, but they don't want to shell out."
But many companies face polite pressure from internal gay employee groups, and from heterosexual co-workers. "I see much more consciousness among straight employees," Ms. Ettelbrick said. Companies may eventually find that the price of the lock on the closet door is far too high.
 
 
 
A PATCHWORK OF JUDICIAL RULINGS
 The extension of rights to gay men and lesbians is a quilt of litigation stitched together issue by issue and jurisdiction by jurisdiction. Gay rights advocates got more fabric to work with earlier this month when a Massachusetts court ruled in favor of a heterosexual woman who filed for unemployment benefits when she left her job to follow her unmarried partner of 13 years to the site of his new business.
In the case, Reep v. the Department of Employment and Training, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled against the state's claim that only married people were entitled to the benefits. "They said you can't use marriage as a bright-line test," said Mary L. Bonauto, a staff attorney at Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, a Boston-based group. The court provided a list of factors to consider in evaluating the significance of a relationship.
Ms. Bonauto expects the ruling to be as significant as New York's landmark Braschi case, which allowed the lover of a deceased man to take over an apartment lease. "Now we have a building block in place to show that nonmarital gay and lesbian families also merit the protection of the law," she said.

HEADLINE: All About/Men's Fragrances;
Scents and the Modern Male

BYLINE: By TERRY TRUCCO

 BODY:
Men's fragrance is the classic Father's Day gift, particularly from wives and children stumped by what to buy for Dad. But while grateful for the annual sales boost each June, the men's fragrance industry is trying hard to take the seasonal spin off items like cologne, after shave and bath gel.
Manufacturers want to get men into the habit of buying fragrances. (Women currently buy 60 to 70 percent of all men's fragrances, often to wear themselves.) Fragrance makers are also exploring ways to persuade men to acquire wardrobes of scents, with different fragrances for evening, work and play. 
 Such efforts, fragrance makers hope, will inject a little life into a market that grew remarkably in the mid-1980's but has been flat for the last 18 months. Last year's estimated retail sales of $1 billion were in fact down four percent from 1990, according to Paine Webber, the investment firm.
Industry analysts credit this dip to the economy, which has been hard on luxury products. The spate of department store bankruptcies has also hurt the prestige end of the industry. Fernando Aleu, president of Compar Inc., which makes seven premium fragrances, estimates that bankruptcies have involved 586 of his company's prime outlets, or 25 percent of its customer base.
At the same time, manufacturers have lost profits with the increase in so-called diversions, premium products sold at a discount at mass-market outlets like drug stores and cosmetics emporiums, either with or without the blessing of the manufacturer.
The men's fragrance market, like the nearly $2 billion women's fragrance market, is also saturated with scents. Since 1978, when Ralph Lauren initiated the practice of splashy promotions with its Polo men's fragrances, more than 240 men's scents have been introduced, according from the Fragrance Foundation, an industry organization. At least 20 more scents for men are scheduled to appear this year, with names that include Enigma, Feeling Man, Safari for Men, Nautica (the bottle is shaped like a sail) and, this being 1992, Christopher Columbus.
The extremely sweet margin on a successful fragrance is the reason for this plethora of fragrance. Jack Salzman, a fragrance industry analyst at Goldman Sachs, estimates the gross profit margin can be as high as 80 percent for a successful prestige fragrance. Even when the market is flat, a fragrance can be hot. Calvin Klein's Eternity for Men, a three-year-old premium scent, had retail sales of around $38 million last year. "This market is more product-driven than sector-driven," Mr. Salzman said.
Yet the risks are high. "No one makes money the first year," said Andrew Shore, a cosmetics industry analyst at Paine Webber. "And it takes a year and a half on the market to determine if a product is a success." The failure rate of most cosmetics and toiletries is 90 percent, Mr. Shore added.
 
Promotions
First the Concept, Then the Fragrance
 The way a fragrance is introduced can be nearly as important as the way it smells. "You can have a great fragrance, but if it's not promoted, it won't go," said Mike Sweeney, vice president of sales and marketing with International Flavor & Fragrance, which produces fragrance ingredients.
Department stores are often reluctant to stock a new fragrance without a manufacturer's promise of advertisements, magazine scent strips and other promotional activities.
But an introduction with all the trimmings is costly. The initial promotional budget for Davidoff Cool Water, a leading European men's scent introduced here in September, was $6 million. And this year's budget could go up to $15 million with promotions tailored to individual department stores.
With increasingly aggressive promotions has come the practice of designing a fragrance around a concept. "In the past, the focus of a new product would be the scent," said Philippe Guerlain, president of Guerlain, the 164-year-old French perfume and cosmetics maker. "With the modern approach, it's the idea, which comes from top executives and the marketing department." Heritage, Guerlain's latest men's fragrance, which will be available next year, was designed as a classic, conservative scent "for a real man, who cries and eats sweets," according to its promotional literature. Bottle, packaging and name -- preferably something that can be pronounced by an international audience -- are central factors in building the product.
But a lavish launch does not guarantee success. The flashy introduction of Ralph Lauren's Monogram in 1985 included a party at Bloomingdale's, where salespeople dressed as butlers carried perfume bottles on silver trays. Industry members still aren't sure why the scent fizzled. "I don't think the name was exciting," said Annette Green, president of the Fragrance Foundation. "And the concept didn't appeal to American men. So much of fragrance is perception. If it doesn't fulfill your fantasies, it's not going to be a success."
 
Crossover Products
Male Versions Of Women's Scents
 The high cost of fragrance introductions is also responsible for a notable industry success -- men's versions of women's fragrances. Despite disappointments like Liz Claiborne for Men, Calvin Klein's Obsession for Men -- which helped popularize the genre in 1986 -- is still thriving, with sales last year of about $36 million.
"Using a name as an umbrella for men's and women's products is a brilliant concept," said Brenda Landry, a fragrance industry analyst at Morgan Stanley. "It spreads your ad dollar." It's also a way to keep new products in the stores. And since women account for most men's fragrance sales, the new products have names familiar to the audience scent makers want to reach.
Most women buy men's fragrances to give to men, but some actually wear them. Chanel's Egoiste, Eternity for Men by Calvin Klein, and New West, all light and fresh, are popular crossover fragrances. The latter proved so popular that its maker, Aramis, brought out New West for Women in a neat reverse. "Men's fragrances are good for women who don't want to stand out," said Allan G. Mottus, an independent industry analyst.
While women's fragrances often use exotic essences, men's are made from a smaller, predictable palette of woody, spicy and citrusy scents. "Attempts at experimentation with less traditional essences have not done well with men," said Ann Gottlieb, a fragrance authority who helped create Obsession and Eternity for both sexes. Ms. Gottlieb uses adjectives like fresh, green and bright to describe men's fragrances for the '90's.
But today's men's scents are more sophisticated than the single-note fragrances of the past, like bay rum or lemon. And men seem to want stronger scents. After shave, which accounted for 34 percent of men's fragrance retail sales last year, once dominated the market. But longer-lasting cologne now makes up 66 percent of sales, according to figures from Paine Webber.
 
Distribution
Prestige Brands at Discount Prices
 The financial troubles that beset so many department stores in recent years could change the way fragrances are sold. "The old channels of distribution are no longer in place," said Mr. Salzman, the fragrance analyst.
To increase growth and stem department store losses, manufacturers started selling more prestige products to duty-free outlets overseas at a discount. But much of this has found its way back into the United States, where it turns up in superstores, chain drug stores and cosmetics emporiums, among other places, priced more cheaply than at department stores. Department stores, in turn, have resorted to gifts as a way to make premium-priced fragrances more attractive.
Some industry analysts predict a growth in specialty retailers, like Cosmetics Plus and Cosmetics Center. "They don't want to give you an umbrella," said Mr. Salzman. "They just want to sell at a fair price." Men may be more likely to buy fragrance at such places or at the growing array of free-standing cosmetics boutiques, like the Body Shop, H2O and Origins. Men account for 10 percent of sales at Origins counters in department stores, according to the company, a division of Estee Lauder that sells natural skin products. But 20 percent of Origins' sales to men are at its boutiques in Manhattan and Cambridge, Mass.
At the same time, mass-market men's fragrance manufacturers are burnishing marketing strategies and promoting their products heavily. "Stetson is an example of a high-quality mass-market fragrance," Mr. Salzman said. "As mass-market fragrances get closer to prestige, the difference in price will seem way out of whack."
 
 
 
BLOND NO MORE
 Aging male baby boomers are creating a small but growing market for another type of grooming product -- hair color. "At one time, men were only getting color to match a hairpiece," said Dianna Reed Sandonato, technical director at Matrix Essentials, a hair products company. Now beauty salons even advertise hair color for men.
The hair coloring boomlet is driven by more than vanity, according to Diana Temple, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. "Men need to look younger for work in this hay and age of corporate reorganizing and frequent job changes."
Last year, retail sales of men's hair color products were $120 million, up 16 percent from the previous year. Men's hair color services accounted for $510 million in salon revenues, up 40 percent from 1990, according to American Salon magazine. (Hair color for women accounted for $5.7 billion.)
The latest men's products are semi-permanent. Clairol Option Instant, a do-it-yourself treatment, lasts six to eight weeks.L'Oreal's new Technique Equa-Ton Homme is applied like a shampoo. "That way men don't have to be seen getting hair color," said Renee Tilton, a L'Oreal spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: Where They Stand

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BOND had always mistrusted short men. They grew up from childhood with an inferiority complex. All their lives, they would strive to be bigger than others who had teased them as a child. Napoleon had been short. And Hitler. It was the short men that created all the trouble in the world. -- Ian Fleming in "Goldfinger"
The exact height of Ross Perot is still under debate. 
 "Six-two," said James Squires, Mr. Perot's press secretary, when asked about it.
"Very short," replied a young woman at Perot headquarters in Dallas, when someone inquired.
"O.K., we'll go with five-seven," amended Mr. Squires.
"Five-six," said Todd Mason, who wrote "Perot," a biography of the Texas billionaire. "I know because I'm five-six, and we're eyeball to eyeball."
Suffice it to say, Ross Perot may talk big about sissies and manhood and world-class campaigns, but he is the smallest major contender in a Presidential race in many years. He would just come up to the tie knot of President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton.
Mr. Bush is 6 feet 2 inches tall. Mr. Clinton's aides got the edge by saying their man is 6 feet 2 1/2.
Such quibbles are understandable. Height matters in a country that has elected the taller man in 18 of the last 22 Presidential elections.
And it has mattered since the Presidency was born. In his book, "Presidential Campaigns" (Oxford University Press, 1984), Paul F. Boller Jr. reports that just before George Washington took the oath of office, he asked advice at a dinner party about the titles under consideration for the first leader of the country: His Excellency, Elective Majesty, His Serene Highness and Elective Highness.
When Washington, who was 6 feet 2, asked about "High Mightiness," the other guests told him that the title would be all right as long as all of his successors were also powerfully built. But with a small man, they said, it would be ridiculous. (Washington finally decided on "Mr. President," much to the relief, no doubt, of most of his successors.)
Republicans and Democrats, flailing to cut Mr. Perot down to size, hope to emphasize the stature gap. As Torie Clarke, the President's campaign press secretary, noted mischievously: "I'm six feet tall, and I do have great visions, if and when there are any debates, of going over to give him a big pat on the head."
Political cartoonists are already having fun with the low mightiness of Mr. Perot. They portray him talking to opponents' knees, sitting with his feet dangling above the floor and sporting ears that are larger than his chest -- ears that are so big "he gets HBO for free," said James Carville, an adviser to Governor Clinton.
Walt Handelsman, a cartoonist at The Times-Picayune in New Orleans, said he loved to see Mr. Perot as "this little dictator in the White House, running around in a little Boy Scout outfit, giving orders to people." Mr. Handelsman has depicted Mr. Perot wearing a huge cowboy hat labeled "Perot popularity," with only his feet and ankles showing. They are tagged "specifics."
Mr. Perot, who has stood erect and thrown out his chest ever since he was a Boy Scout in Texarkana, Tex., does not seem concerned about his size. He told The Washington Post, "I never spent any time thinking about it."
Perhaps he agrees with Milton Friedman, the compact economist, who, when asked about his teaching sojourn among strapping Texans, quipped that he felt like "a dime amongst nickels."
Or perhaps, as Susan Estrich, who was Michael S. Dukakis's campaign manager in 1988, speculates, "Maybe your second billion eliminates any concern about your height."
Ms. Estrich believes that, while Mr. Perot's bragging and militaristic style may have hurt him with female voters, it has helped overshadow the issue of his size.
"If he was a short man who wasn't a man's man, you could say he was a shrimp," she said. "But I can't imagine calling Ross Perot a shrimp. I'd be afraid for my life if I did."
"Besides, Clinton's fat," she said. "So you have your choice between a fat man and a short man."
Unlike Mr. Dukakis and many other vertically challenged politicians, Mr. Perot waves away risers that would give him more height. With populist flair, he even complains about daises that put him higher than the audience.
Of course, Mr. Perot has a couple of inches on James Madison, who was the shortest President at 5 feet 4. And Mr. Perot's height has helped win him some friends in low places.
Mickey Rooney, the 5-foot-3-inch actor, who titled his autobiography "Life Is Too Short," said, "Mickey Rooney is supporting Perot." (Mr. Rooney likes to refer to himself in the third person.)
"If you're on the small side, everyone thinks you're pugnacious, but they're all Cary Grants at six feet," Mr. Rooney said from his home in California. "The Presidency is not a beauty contest. It isn't how big you are, my darling."
Belle Adler, a producer for CNN in San Francisco, who is 5 feet 1 and a director of the National Association of Short Adults, said that Mr. Perot was at the top of "our short list of candidates" and that, while the group would not endorse his platform, they would endorse "the platform he stands on."
But Mr. Perot's critics and rivals paint him as a man who has some ominous qualities associated with overcompensation for his height: they say he is a demagogue, a man with the potential to be dictatorial and authoritarian.
Elizabeth Drew of The New Yorker wrote that Mr. Perot has "the aura of quasi-fascism: Peron-style, or Mussolini-style fascism, with the hero-leader, backed by 'the people,' breaking down impediments to having his way -- all, of course, in their name."
Vice President Quayle has dubbed Mr. Perot "the temperamental tycoon," which conjures up an image of a child screaming in a highchair and banging his golden spoon.
"The record has been that short people who run for President are at a disadvantage when they do demonstrate qualities of great strength and fierceness and determination, because it's very easy to make the leap and assume they have a Napoleonic complex," said Michael R. Beschloss, who wrote "The Crisis Years: Kennedy and Khrushchev, 1960-1963" (Edward Burlingame Books, 1991). "It's very much like women who are strong are frowned at as aggressive, but in men it's considered attractive."
But in Mr. Perot's case, Mr. Beschloss asserted, it is not just stereotyping.
"He has an arbitrariness and an instinctive ability to act on the basis of his own will after consulting a wide array of people," the historian said. "He has a tendency to have excessive faith in his own powers of judgment. He's an iconoclast to the point where he doesn't take advice terribly well."
Washington has had its share of short, tyrannical personalities over the years.
When the late John G. Tower, the peppery Texas Republican lawmaker who liked to say, "My name is Tower but you can see I don't," was called "Shorty" by a Capitol elevator operator, the operator got early retirement.
David Myers, a psychology professor at Hope College in Holland, Mich., and Henry Biller, a psychology professor at the University of Rhode Island, wrote "Stature and Stigma" (Lexington Books, 1987) with Leslie Martel. The professors cite studies showing that in business, romance and politics, people tend to perceive a link between a man's height and positive personality traits.
"Not to get too psychological about this," Dr. Biller said, "but some of it has to do with looking up at daddy and assuming power and size go together."
Dr. Biller also said that studies showed that no matter how tall someone is, they usually want to be taller.
In an interview with Esquire magazine in 1983, Robert Mitchum said of John Wayne: "Duke was six-four but he wore four-inch lifts and a 10-gallon hat. He had a station wagon modified to fit all that paraphernalia. He even had the overheads raised on his boats so that he could walk through the doorways with the lifts on."
Tall people have been known to fuel the paranoia of the short by expressing some moral superiority.
John Kenneth Galbraith, the economist and author, who is 6 feet 8, recalled in his memoirs that when he met Charles de Gaulle, the 6-foot-2-inch French President noted with disdain that Mr. Galbraith had been speaking to a short man.
Mr. Galbraith wrote: "I said he obviously agreed with me that the world belongs to the tall men. They are more visible, therefore their behavior is better and accordingly they are to be trusted. He said that he agreed and added, 'It is important that we be merciless with those who are too small.' "
George Tames, the longtime White House photographer for The New York Times and author of "Eye on Washington" (HarperCollins, 1990), captured many memorable images of Lyndon B. Johnson using his height, 6 feet 3 inches, as a tool of political persuasion.
"As Barry Goldwater once said, if Johnson could not persuade you any other way, he would lean over you and breathe in your mouth and deprive you of oxygen," Mr. Tames said in an interview.
In 1988, USA Today noted that Mr. Dukakis, a slope-shouldered 5 feet 8, was the shortest nominee of a major party since the Republican Thomas E. Dewey, also 5 feet 8, lost to 6-foot-2-inch Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944 and to 5-foot-9-inch Harry S. Truman in 1948. The newspaper found those facts in a book called "Too Tall, Too Small," by John Gillis, a Canadian psychologist.
The dark-haired, mustachioed Dewey was wounded by a widely quoted witticism that he looked like "the little man on the wedding cake." Similarly, Mr. Dukakis faced a raft of insults about his size when headlines proclaimed the race between "the shrimp versus the wimp" and Republicans belittled him as "the little Duke." Roger Ailes, the Bush media guru, dismissed the Massachusetts Governor as "a narcissistic little fellow."
Mr. Dukakis did not help matters when he broke an unofficial rule of Presidential races -- make sure your Vice Presidential choice is shorter than you are -- and appeared tucked under the arm of Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, 6 feet 2.
(As Vice Presidents, both Lyndon Johnson and George Bush would instinctively shrink a bit when they were in the room with their shorter but more charismatic Presidents, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.)
Just as the petite Geraldine Ferraro had used a riser in her debate with George Bush, Mr. Dukakis tried to even the score with Mr. Bush by standing on a three-inch mound artfully built beneath the carpet behind his lectern. But it did not work to his advantage in the end, because it only made the six-inch difference in their heights more striking when Mr. Dukakis stepped off the mound to shake hands with Mr. Bush.
Johnny Carson joked that the Democrat wanted the candidates to debate from the crouch position. Republicans suggested that Mr. Bush's opening line at the debate should be, "Come down off that soapbox and look me in the tie!"
It was the same story in 1976. While Gerald R. Ford, six feet tall but known as a klutz, was worrying about getting his water glass braced to his lectern so that he would not knock it over, Jimmy Carter, 5 feet 9 1/4, was arranging to have lecterns of different heights.
Gerald Rafshoon, Mr. Carter's media adviser, recalled that the Carter camp agreed to a neutral-colored backdrop, which the Republicans thought would disguise Mr. Ford's thinning gray hair better than a blue backdrop would. In return, the Republicans agreed to place the lecterns farther away from each other so that the contrast in height between the two candidates would not be so stark.
"We said, 'We'll give you some hair if you give us some height,' " Mr. Rafshoon said.
The most famous lectern incident occurred last year, when Queen Elizabeth, who is 5 feet 4, stepped up to a White House lectern set for President Bush and virtually disappeared -- except for her bobbing broad-brimmed hat, dubbed "the Talking Hat" by the British press.
It has been suggested that as more women are elected, voters will become more accustomed to leadership coming in all shapes and sizes.
Representative Barbara Boxer, the 4-foot-11-inch California Democrat who is running for the Senate, is clearly banking on that. She advises audiences to elect her because Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat who is also 4 feet 11, "is really looking forward to working with someone she can look in the eye."
Senator John Seymour (5 feet 6), Republican of California, is being challenged by Dianne Feinstein (5 feet 9), former Mayor of San Francisco, in the November election, and is trying to keep his sense of humor about having to look up to his opponent.
"Abraham Lincoln was once asked how tall a man should be," Mr. Seymour said. "And he responded by saying, 'A man should be tall enough so that his feet touch the ground.' "

HEADLINE: For the Rich in the 80's Cost of Giving Went Up

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your May 24 discussion of a study by three Treasury Department economists who found a fall in average charitable giving by high-income Americans does not include one of the study's most fascinating findings. The authors show that if one assumes that the 1979 patterns of charitable giving among the rich persisted into the 1980's, one could predict almost exactly the decline in the 80's. 
 The 1979 data suggest that, with the changes in income and tax incentives of the 80's, average giving by millionaires should have decreased 42 percent. The decrease was 39 percent. That's about as close as decade-ahead economic projections ever get.
The accuracy of the projection is crucial because it suggests that the rich did not somehow become "greedier" in the 80's. Rather, they merely responded to incentives as their counterparts did in the late 70's. So why did average donations decline?
Although their incomes increased, changes in Federal tax policy made it 64 percent more expensive for millionaires to make donations. When some activity becomes more expensive, the rich, like the rest of us, do less of it.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
To Mexico, High Court Sounds Like A Bully

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
By nearly all accounts but his own, Humberto Alvarez Machain is an unfortunate choice as a cause celebre. Even to Mexican officials, the heavyset, 44-year-old gynecologist suggests the drug-related corruption that has stamped Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city. In Los Angeles, where he now occupies a prison cell, prosecutors know Dr. Alvarez as the man who in 1985 injected stimulants into a dying American drug enforcement agent, Enrique Camarena Salazar, to keep him conscious while Guadalajara drug traffickers tortured him with a red-hot pipe.
Yet to many Mexicans, Dr. Alvarez has also become a symbol of the arrogant and unbridled exercise of American power. Agents of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration arranged and paid for the bounty hunters who abducted Dr. Alvarez from his Guadalajara offices in April 1990. And last Monday, the United States Supreme Court ruled that since a bilateral extradition treaty did not specifically rule out such kidnappings, they were not illegal and Dr. Alvarez could be brought to trial. 
 A few weeks before negotiators are expected to complete a North American Free Trade Agreement, Dr. Alvarez was also an untimely reminder of the mistrust that American and Mexican leaders have sought to overcome in bringing their vastly unequal societies closer together. Mexicans have long been nervous about closer ties and stronger competition with the United States, which already shares more than two-thirds of all Mexican trade. But the Court decision served to jog commentators' memories of Ronald Reagan in Central America, the cold war and even of Teddy Roosevelt.
The concerns of Americans were amply illustrated in the saga of Mr. Camarena. For months after his murder, United States officials prodded their Mexican counterparts about the case and got nowhere. Eventually, the identities of Mexicans indicted in the case suggested good reason: one was the brother-in-law of a former President; another, a former head of the Federal investigations police.
 
The Imbalance of Power
 That the United States never bothered asking Mexico to extradite Dr. Alvarez is beside the point, American officials contend; Mexican policy has been not to hand over its citizens. Mexico's President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was in no position to hear such arguments, having been accused incessantly of selling out Mexican sovereignty for free trade. Within hours of the court ruling, his Foreign Ministry said it was suspending all D.E.A. activities in Mexico.
From then on, the case of Dr. Alvarez seemed to evoke nothing so much as the imbalance of power in the Mexican-American partnership. After complaints about the retaliation from Washington, Mexico retracted the suspension in an abrupt, embarrassing shift. Officials said they had received assurances of American respect for Mexican sovereignty and did not want to give drug traffickers a reprieve; therefore, the D.E.A.'s 39 agents in Mexico were reinstated "temporarily."
As for Mexico's demand that the 1978 extradition treaty be amended to rule out any more kidnappings, diplomats declined, noting that similar treaties with 102 other nations would probably have to be modified as well. To Mexico's renewed insistence that Dr. Alvarez be returned for prosecution, the most direct answer seemed to come from Los Angeles: Federal officials there were talking about trial dates.
The focus of Mr. Salinas's attention during the episode was obvious. From the startof trade negotiations, the agreement has meant infinitely more for Mexico than for the United States or Canada. But as the country's trade and current account deficits have ballooned, even the expectation of a trade accord among foreign investors has become essential to Mexican economic stability. Last week, as the flap over Alvarez Machain was added to the slowness of the trade talks and Ross Perot's apparent opposition, values on the Mexican stock market plummeted for three straight days.
In selling free trade to their respective constituencies, the two Governments have concentrated intensely on the future -- at times, critics say, to the point of closing their eyes. While massaging the deep, defensive nationalism of their countrymen,, Mexican officials have dropped their old talk about American imperialism. Whatever shortcomings American officials see in Mexico's democracy, environmental policies and justice system, they no longer talk much about them.
Substituting pragmatic management for principled stands, however, has solved only some problems. A recent spate of ransom kidnappings around Mexico, for instance, suggests that corrupt police officials may still pose a serious problem even if fired from their jobs. And Mexican diplomats insisted that they were not satisfied that the Alvarez abduction could not take place today.
In recent months, they noted, Mexico has lodged a series of protests over American police and Border Patrol agents crossing into Mexico in pursuit of fleeing suspects. And two days before the Court ruling on Dr. Alvarez, two American private investigators apparently hired by a bail-bond company crossed into the state of Sonora and seized a Mexican convicted in absentia on cocaine charges in Arizona. After protesting the abduction, Mexican officials sought what they called the logical remedy: They asked that the two American bounty hunters be extradited for trial in Mexico.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
For Clinton, Attention Grows, Problems Remain

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
Bill Clinton is getting 4,000 letters a day, fielding so many requests for broadcast interviews that he canceled plans to buy a half hour of network time last week and generally garnering more attention than he has been able to attract since the emergence of Ross Perot.
But the likely Democratic nominee is also hurting for cash, struggling to boil his message down into vote-getting form and carrying on a loud and nasty spat with Jesse Jackson. 
 It is not the best of times for the Arkansas Governor, who never seems to get very far past one piece of rough water before he is confronted with another. His campaign organization, beset with the growing pains that accompany every nominee's move from the primaries to the general election, is buffeted by rumors of impending resignations and internal strife nearly every week.
And the latest round with Mr. Jackson, who has made plaguing Democratic nominees something of an art form, has continued just long enough to risk becoming a long-term liability that could outweigh the short-term benefit Clinton strategists had hoped to gain in standing up to the not universally popular Mr. Jackson.
 
A Lasting Threat
 But temporary setbacks are one thing. The more enduring threat for Mr. Clinton lies with the problems that bedevil him personally. During the last several months, the pulse takers of conventional wisdom who reside in Washington ascribed Mr. Clinton's weakness to "character" problems while conceding that he was a good campaigner.
But, in reality, it took several crucial weeks for Mr. Clinton to realize that a key part of what constitutes good campaigning this year occurs in an arena he had been relatively unused to: the unfiltered eye of television talk shows. Since the California primary, he has learned this lesson with a vengeance, hopscotching from Arsenio Hall's late-night show to the morning network talk shows and then to glitzy MTV in rapid succession.
"You break through by having a message that's compelling about yourself," said Stan Greenberg, the Clinton poll taker who remains convinced that voters are far more open about learning more about Mr. Clinton than about George Bush.
Still, polls published during this period continue to show Mr. Clinton stubbornly entrenched in third place behind President Bush and Mr. Perot. Mr. Clinton said recently that even his Little Rock barber, summoned to the governor's mansion to cut his hair on a visit home a week ago, asked him about Mr. Perot.
And when he does get a platform from which to preach the undiluted message of economic reinvestment that he is convinced Americans want to hear, Mr. Clinton still finds that the most common response is infuriating. Even at this late date -- and even though he has all but secured his party's nomination -- voters are still unfamiliar with what he stands for.
In a recent interview, Mr. Clinton revealingly called it the "disability" he inherited by having survived a bruising primary process. In order to beat back one potential scandal after another from New Hampshire to New York, he became accustomed to giving exhaustive -- if not always direct -- answers to every question.
Some of this was in his nature. He kicked off his campaign by delivering three sober and now largely forgotten policy speeches at Georgetown University. And anyone who remembers the speech he gave to nominate Michael Dukakis at the 1988 Democratic convention knows just how long-winded he can be.
But in the age of the video campaign, his tendency to give a dozen reasons and justifications for every policy he proposes has hobbled Mr. Clinton's ability to reintroduce himself to voters prior to the convention. Ross Perot may not be much on specifics, but he is lively.
Mr. Clinton recognizes some of this.
"I was wrong to believe that if I went to Georgetown and gave these three really detailed policy speeches and put it together in a plan explaining and establishing me as a different kind of Democrat with traditional values and the interest of the Democratic Party at heart but a willingness to be pro-growth and demand personal responsibiity, offer some really new ideas for empowering people, that somehow all that would get through," he said as his limousine glided through San Antonio. "And I just don't think it does."
His strategists grit their teeth when they hear him speak in run-on sentences like this. So he has begun repeating the same points in shorter bursts, occasionally warning his audience that he is "beginning to sound like a broken record."
George Stephanopoulos, the campaign's communications director, called this part of "a constant and continual process" to hone the candidate's message. The campaign, he said, is not in desperate straits, even though 200 campaign workers were forced to forgo paychecks because of what the campaign delicately called a "cash flow problem" -- it was $2.7 million in debt to one bank as of last month. One reason for the shortfall is that the campaign does not accept contributions from political action committees, which are allowed to donate more than the $1,000 limit imposed on individuals.
Mr. Stephanopoulos and others in Mr. Clinton's campaign betray little nervousness over their prospects. Little more than a week ago, they point out, they were having trouble getting any attention at all. Now they feel they are getting the hearing they need.
"If you gave me $3 million today, I wouldn't spend a penny on TV," said Mr. Stephanopoulos. "We can't get any more than we're getting."
But for all their current optimism (Mr. Clinton's advisers are convinced they won last week's bitter little war of words with Jesse Jackson over the Governor's criticism of the rap artist Sister Souljah, who Mr. Clinton said had advocated racial violence), the Clinton strategists know they still have a long way to go and are counting on the three-way race to remain competitive. Although the polls show them a distant third, they still envision offering voters a choice between a strengthened Mr. Clinton and a weakened, exposed Mr. Perot. "The question is, is he too big a risk, or is Clinton too big a risk?" Mr. Greenberg said of Mr. Perot.
And although Mr. Clinton is happily talking more about himself than about Mr. Perot these days, it remains a real possibility that he will soon have little choice but to mount a frontal assault on the Texan.
"If the press doesn't push Ross Perot to say what he'll do for the country, Bill Clinton certainly will," said Bruce Reed, the Clinton campaign's deputy manager for policy. "The debate is still beginning."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Russia and Ukraine: Condemned to Get Along

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
It was scarcely an accident that while Boris N. Yeltsin was politicking his way through Washington, the President of Ukraine, Leonid M. Kravchuk, was in Paris on a state visit of his own. There, Mr. Kravchuk not only talked about aid but actually got a little -- credits of 500 million francs, about $95 million.
It must have amused Francois Mitterrand and Mr. Kravchuk, who are not normally known for their sense of fun. Mr. Mitterrand has been a cactus under Washington's saddle for many years now; Mr. Kravchuk, now the head of an independent state, is Mr. Yeltsin's biggest foreign-policy headache. 
 But just as France and the United States are condemned to get along on the most crucial issues of security and world trade, so are Russia and Ukraine. It's not only that Russia had its birth in the 9th century in Kiev, and that 13 million of Ukraine's 52 million people consider themselves Russian. Ukraine accounted for 18 percent of the Soviet Union's agricultural output and 20 percent of its industrial production, and the two economies are irretrievably interlinked.
Lenin went so far as to state: "If we lose the Ukraine, we lose our head."
There are many people hoping that Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Kravchuk, in their public spats these days, manage not to lose theirs. In fact the two seem to understand each other pretty well, having both risen through the Communist nomenklatura, and they will meet on Tuesday, in their own first, official summit at Dagamys, near Sochi, to ensure they understand each other better.
But there is always the possibility that the careful show Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Kravchuk must perform for their respective nationalists will somehow, one day, get out of hand, particularly if some Russian and Ukrainian villagers go at it.
Psychologically, it has been a particularly wrenching divorce, with many Russians, like a wronged or oblivious partner, refusing to believe that separation is forever. Pressed, no Russian will admit that Russia makes any sense without Ukraine or Belarus; many believe that in his Russian soul, Mr. Yeltsin agrees. And as Mr. Kravchuk reconstructs a system of apparatchik-style personal power without real political or economic reform, Ukrainians begin to wonder if independence will bring them more than provincial status.
Mr. Kravchuk's bargain with the nationalists who supported his election has been simple: He and his ex-Communist apparatus would build an independent Ukraine in return for keeping power and control of the economy, which is almost entirely unreformed.
For the nationalists, the current situation is a great improvement on Ukraine's three previous efforts at independence, most recently in the chaos that followed the Bolshevik revolution. For Mr. Kravchuk and his officials, they get to rule largely by decree, and the perks of independence, like Paris summit meetings, are not unappreciated.
Mr. Yeltsin's problem is different. His nationalists, including his own Vice President, Aleksandr Rutskoi, are part of a conservative opposition in the parliament and major state enterprises that resists Russia's diminished status and radical economic reform.
Thus Mr. Yeltsin has no desire to give his nationalists more ammunition on such difficult, Ukrainian-centered issues as the Black Sea Fleet, nuclear weapons and Crimea. Crimea is a favored resort (and home to the fleet), which the Ukrainian Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev capriciously handed over to Ukraine in 1954, in what was then a meaningless administrative decision. Now Crimea is the latest theater for the Yeltsin-Kravchuk show of public acrimony, mixed with calmer personal conversations.
After all the posturing, Crimea seems headed toward some finessed form of autonomy, allowing Russians to visit as they like, without visas. But Mr. Kravchuk's efforts to dilute the Russian majority in Crimea by welcoming the return of about 150,000 Crimean Tatars, a group deported en masse across the eastern Soviet Union by Stalin, could lead to a blow-up.
Economic problems, however, could be more serious. The Soviet foreign debt of $60 billion to $80 billion is to be shared among the successor states. But Russia complains that it is the only country paying, and that Ukraine in particular is not.
Ukraine also objects to Russia charging world prices for oil, as the I.M.F. urges. Traditional trade meant cheap Russian oil for cheap Ukrainian food, and Mr. Kravchuck's Government would like to maintain that deal, even if Ukraine's own inefficient agriculture is no longer self-sufficient in grain.
Moscow is also furious that its effort to control money supply is being undermined by Moldova and Ukraine, which are issuing large amounts of credit unsanctioned by Russia's Central Bank.
The currency relationship is crucial. Ukraine now says it will move from its weakening Ukrainian ruble coupons -- now worth only 70 percent of the Russian ruble -- to its own currency, the hrivnia, in August or September. But massive amounts of rubles still circulate in Ukraine, and Russia worries about them. If dumped into Russia, they would mean a 20-percent jump in money supply, which could produce hyperinflation.
These issues, unfortunately, are less easily finessed, even by politicians as skilled as Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Kravchuk. The hrivnia may create more problems than Crimea.

HEADLINE: A Trip And a Half;
Yeltsin's Visit Seals a Bond; The Details Will Test It

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Every summit meeting has its photo, and surely the one that will endure from last week's will be that cozy family snapshot of Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, standing on the White House lawn with one arm around Barbara Bush and the other around President Bush, with the Bush family dog Millie at their feet. The picture could be in a scrapbook labeled: "Uncle Boris Comes to Visit." And the caption would have Mr. Yeltsin saying to the Bushes: "So! Great to be here! What's for dinner?"
In that picture are hints of the many contradictory impulses behind this summit. There was an innocent warmth in the smiles of these two former adversaries, but it masked the frustrating, messy domestic realities in their respective countries that will continue to complicate the relationship. There was the big-hearted charisma of Mr. Yeltsin, who came to Washington tossing off tantalizing tidbits about American prisoners of war and his undying commitment to economic reform. He was the Russian Ross Perot, a blunt breath of fresh air without the details. 
 But there was something else in that photo too -- a bit of a wince in Mr. Bush's eyes as Mr. Yeltsin grabs him by the shoulder. It looked like the wince provoked when a distant relative comes to you for money -- the wince, perhaps, of Americans realizing that in winning the cold war what they have won is not a peace dividend but a bill.
In this case, though, the guest is offering to do a lot to earn his welcome. And that could make the bill well worth paying. The arms control agreement that Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Bush hammered out will, once implemented, effectively strip both countries of the first-strike nuclear weapons that left the world a hairbreadth away from nuclear destruction for 40 years. The economic agreements they concluded open paths that have never existed for trade and investment between Russia and the United States.
 
Details . . . and Courage
 The question now, though, is not whether this meeting made a difference -- it clearly did -- but whether it will make a lasting difference. The answer lies entirely in the follow-up. It is the details, off camera, in the hardscrabble reality of the Russian and American political landscapes, that will ultimately decide the lasting value of this summit. These details will determine whether Americans and Russians look back on this collaboration as the first of many, or as the high point of a summer friendship that didn't quite work out once the grind of daily life resumed.
Many factors will be in play, in three arenas.
First, the United States Congress. Mr. Yeltsin's performance there was a political tour de force. His speech was both a persuasive statement of his commitment to economic reform and a political challenge to American lawmakers to come up with their long-promised aid package for Russia. Having preceded his speech by forging an arms control accord with Mr. Bush that promises to slash the two countries' combined nuclear arsenals from 21,000 warheads to 7,000 by the year 2003, Mr. Yeltsin had put his missiles where his mouth was and he felt entitled to ask Congress to put its money where its mouth was.
The paradox for Mr. Yeltsin is that the more unthreatening he makes Russia -- the more missiles he scraps -- the more Congress seems to feel it can dawdle on his aid request. But there may be more at stake in how Congress meets the aid challenge than Russia's fate alone.
"Yeltsin's visit actually crystallized the fight for the soul of the Democratic Party now that the cold war is over," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, who loudly denounced fellow Democrats who oppose aid. One part of the Democratic Party, he said, is in danger of lapsing into a provincial, protectionist, isolationist mode, as the Republicans did in the 1920's, and one part wants to carry on the internationalist spirit of Presidents Wilson, Truman and Kennedy.
"One of the reasons that I think my party is in trouble," Senator Biden said, "is that it has not demonstrated to the American people that it has the raw political courage to do and say things that are not popular, like giving aid to Russia at this time.
"You know what came across to me and so many of my colleagues who were in that chamber when Yeltsin spoke? It was: 'Damn, that guy has courage.' What I want to ask some of my colleagues is: 'Why do we think that if we like that sort of courage in other leaders, our constituents won't like that same kind of courage in us?"'
It looks now as if the Senate may indeed approve the aid package. But in the House, where everyone is up for election, prudence rather than courage is still the fashion of the week. While they shouted "Boris! Boris! Boris!" as Mr. Yeltsin spoke, many House members mumbled afterward that they would still like to take the pulse of their own constituents before voting yes on aid.
Mr. Yeltsin faces complications in the Kremlin as well. Much was learned about him during this visit and most of it seems encouraging. The man is a leader. Just as he took a historic decision to defy the coup plotters last August, so he took an equally historic decision to abandon the doctrine of nuclear parity that had for so long existed between the United States and the former Soviet Union. When this new treaty is fully implemented by 2003 there will definitely only be one superpower in the world, since Russia will have given up its most potent and advanced missiles, while agreeing that Washington can retain many of its. When a Democrat as prominent as Senator Biden calls an arms treaty negotiated by a Republican President "maybe the best deal in the history of arms control," you know it is good.
But the year 2003 is a long way away, and a lot can happen between now and then, particularly in a Russia that is still disintegrating around the edges. This gets back to details and one troubling thing about Mr. Yeltsin: Like many visionary leaders, he is not big on details. The way he tossed around unsubstantiated reports about the possibility of American prisoners of war in Russia did not inspire confidence. He meant well, perhaps; but, as one Administration official put it, "he's got the whole damn Pentagon turned upside down looking for these people."
Mr. Yeltsin was no doubt feeling pressure to show Americans why a country that is no longer their enemy and is neither rich nor stable should still be treated as important. But ultimately this can't be done through gimmicks. It has to be done the old-fashioned way: Building free markets and democracy on sound foundations. That is what would earn America's attention and respect. But it will take a lot of detail work.
Adding to Mr. Yeltsin's problems, remarked Dimitri K. Simes, a Russian affairs expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is that the Russian President must start delivering soon. But he is dealing with a Government, a parliament and a country that are still not ready for radical reform, and still not aware that the hard part has just begun. So the only quick boost can come from the outside.
But that infusion of Western cash is tied to Mr. Yeltsin's ability to meet minimum International Monetary Fund standards of reform -- which gets back to the importance of the details. Eventually he will have to produce the economic equivalent of his arms control treaty -- reforms so sweeping that they irreversibly alter the status quo and prove to the world that his regime truly is an economic departure from the past. It is much easier, however, to cut warheads than wages.
Finally, over at the White House. What political impact will this successful summit meeting have for the stumbling Bush campaign? Probably not much. To begin with, few Americans have ever voted for a President on the basis of his performance on arms control, a subject so abstruse few officials understand it, let alone voters.
More fundamentally, Mr. Bush, like Mr. Yeltsin, is a victim of his own success. The more Mr. Yeltsin becomes unthreatening, the more Congress can feel complacent about helping him. And the more Mr. Bush puts the cold war to bed, said the Republican political analyst Kevin Phillips, "the less we have to worry about having a President who is an expert in dealing with such issues."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House Race;
WHITE HOUSE RACE AT EMOTIONAL PEAK MANY WEEKS EARLY

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 20

 BODY:
As if the general election were weeks and not four months away, President Bush, Gov. Bill Clinton and Ross Perot today engaged in the sort of full-blown campaigning that is usually reserved for the home stretch.
Mr. Bush, echoing the theme Vice President Dan Quayle has been sounding lately to woo conservatives, criticized "liberal elitists" in a speech in Los Angeles. Then he ventured here, into Mr. Perot's backyard, where in a reference to the Texas businessman he told the state Republican Convention that there was "too much at stake, as we say here, to buy a pig in a poke." 
 Mr. Perot, meanwhile, completed a three-day, four-city swing by taking his independent campaign to solidly Democratic Massachusetts, where he addressed a rally at the Boston Commons.
And Governor Clinton, the winner of the Democratic primary contests, campaigned close to home in Arkansas with an appearance in Conway, a town north of Little Rock.
 
Campaign Calendar Skewed
 Such energetic campaigning is unusual at this stage of a Presidential season. Party nominees ordinarily devote the late spring and early summer to resting, raising money and plotting strategy for their party conventions and beyond.
But Mr. Perot's candidacy has turned the race, and the campaign calendar, upside down. It has been hard to switch on television in recent days without seeing one of the three candidates, their wives or other surrogates.
Mr. Bush, in a three-day trip to the battleground states of California and Texas, sought to reassure environmentalists who may be enticed by Mr. Clinton, as well as conservative business executives intrigued by Mr. Perot.
At a few appearances, he departed from typical Presidential decorum by inviting questions, and he took a stroll among bathers on a California beach.
While an estimated 8,000 delegates at the Texas convention welcomed Mr. Bush with virtual nonstop ovations and chants of "four more years," the crowds at other stops in the last three days were polite but not particularly enthusiastic.
Mr. Perot, in his own three-day swing through California, Colorado and Massachusetts, drew mixed responses, from the excited to the curious. He went to Colorado and Massachusetts to recognize that his volunteers had gathered enough signatures to put his name on the general election ballots.
 
Muskets and Horses
 The trip had the trappings and feel of a full-fledged Presidential campaign. In Boston today, supporters, many in Colonial garb and carrying muskets, paraded with floats and bicycles to Boston Commons for the candidate's speech in the heart of the home state of Michael S. Dukakis, the Democrats' 1988 Presidential nominee.
Boxes representing Mr. Perot's petitions were hauled on an 1898 freight wagon, pulled by eight draft horses. The boxes actually contained packing material since the petitions themselves were turned in Friday.
Mr. Perot's speeches have evolved into a standard campaign set piece that he recites repeatedly, the way other candidates do. He exhorted the audience to remain involved in politics after the general election.
"Do you understand that if you send me to Washington and you go back to your lives after November, all of the things you've dreamed about happening will not happen?" he said. "You have got to stay in the ring, shoulder-to-shoulder with me, or this will not happen. Is that a deal?"
 
Clinton Shifts Emphasis
 Mr. Clinton, who has done far more campaigning across the country than his two rivals this year, has for the last two weeks emphasized television appearances in which he has made direct appeals to voters or interest groups. He has also spent time sparring with the Rev. Jesse Jackson over his comments about a rap performer, and he has worked on refinements in his economic proposals, which he plans to announce in coming days.
Today, he journeyed 30 miles north from Little Rock to Hendrix College in Conway, where he boasted to several hundred cheering students that his administration had done more for black people than any other in the state's history. "I'm proud of my civil rights record," Mr. Clinton said.
The major difference between the campaigning today and what might be expected in the thick of a general election race is that the candidates are holding back on direct personal attacks. Mr. Bush and Mr. Perot have avoided citing their rivals by name, preferring thinly veiled attacks.
In both of Mr. Bush's speeches today, he singled out an unnamed rival, asserting: "Unlike one of my opponents for President, I don't believe the only way to confront a massive deficit is with a massive tax increase. And that's in quotes because that's what he said."
At first, aides traveling with Mr. Bush said they did not know whether he was referring to Mr. Clinton or Mr. Perot or both, but they later said his comment was directed at Mr. Clinton.
Seeking to diminish Mr. Perot's reputation as the candidate with business experience, Mr. Bush at several stops recalled how he had started a Houston oil company. The President also sought to reassert his credentials as a transplanted Texan, pledging in Dallas that he would build his Presidential library in the state "and when my work is over I'll come back here."
Mr. Perot does not need to mention Mr. Clinton or Mr. Bush when he rails against the state of American politics. And Mr. Clinton takes pains never to mention Mr. Perot by name, though he has sought to present himself as the alternative to Mr. Bush and Mr. Perot: a Washington outsider with government experience.
While Mr. Bush told his Texas audience to "wait until August and we'll roll up our sleeves and get in that campaign mode," he seemed to be in it already. Abandoning the pledge he made on Thursday to hold his fire for now, the President shook his fists as he attacked Mr. Perot without mentioning him by name.
"Snappy answers and glib talk will not get the job done," he said. "Let somebody else become the darling of the talking heads on television."
Noting that some people ask him why he cannot "bring the same kind of purpose and success to the domestic scene as you did in Desert Shield and Desert Storm," Mr. Bush said, "The answer is, I didn't have to get permission from some old goat in the United States Congress to kick Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait."
Before heading to Dallas, Mr. Bush this morning addressed the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association in Los Angeles, a group that has carried on the spirit behind Proposition 13, the tax-cutting measure that California voters passed 14 years ago.
 
Bush's Favorite Target
 Although he has presided over the largest Federal budget deficit in history and abandoned his pledge of "no new taxes," Mr. Bush waged a rhetorical assault against his favorite target: liberals in Congress.
"Again and again," he told the audience of fiscal conservatives, "the liberals in Congress have said no to spending reform. It's no wonder that Americans keep clamoring for stricter limits on the power and cost of Government."
Then, glancing off the theme that the Vice President has been emphasizing, Mr. Bush said, "And when liberal elitists ridicule you and say we have social problems because of you -- because you're 'greedy' -- well, naturally, you stand up and fight back."
 
'Special Hall of Shame'
 The President denounced those in the House of Representatives who last week opposed a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. "And pay attention to the Democrats who belong in a special Hall of Shame," Mr. Bush said, referring to the 12 Democrats who listed themselves as co-sponsors of the amendment and then voted against it.
"They did that to curry favor with their party bosses in Washington," Mr. Bush said. "We know better than to expect these people to discipline themselves."
Mr. Bush also sought to bask in the afterglow of the arms agreement that he and Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian President, announced this week. But in the question-and-answer-sessions that Mr. Bush invited, hardly anyone asked him about Mr. Yeltsin. They wanted to know about the economy and domestic programs.
In another departure from ordinary Presidential behavior, Mr. Bush took an unexpected walk on the Corona del Mar Beach in Southern California. He drew hundreds of well-wishers, but caused so much disruption that Secret Service agents hurried him back to his limousine after only a few minutes.

HEADLINE: More Children Are Employed, Often Perilously

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
After nearly disappearing from American life, child labor has re-emerged and proliferated in the last decade. Even the recession does not seem to have stemmed the tide, and investigators say many of the children are working in dangerous jobs.
Federal statistics indicate that at least four million children ages 14 to 18 are legally employed. But about half that many other children work illegally, either because businesses or family members pay them in cash to avoid taxes and minimum wages, or, more ominously, because they work too many hours, late hours, at hazardous jobs, or are under 14 and thus too young to be working at all except on farms.
 
Children Working Everywhere
 No one knows exactly how many children work illegally, but Philip J. Landrigan, chairman of the Department of Community Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, estimated the number at about 2 million. Evidence from a variety of sources -- the Labor Department's strike force, the General Accounting Office, states' investigations and emergency-room records -- suggests that children work illegally in the fields, in the garment industry, in fast-food restaurants, on construction sites and in mines, sawmills and gas stations. 
 On the job, they suffer amputations, burns, deep cuts and electrocutions. At least several hundred a year are killed, according to investigators at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Other children work late on school nights, in violation of state and Federal laws, and sometimes fall asleep in class.
Jeffrey Newman, executive director of the National Child Labor Committee, a nonprofit organization founded in 1904, said he is seeing a return of child labor scandals reminiscent of those that occurred at the turn of the century. "I see the same kind of exploitation that occurred then, in sweatshops, in the fields, in unscrupulous business practices that occur behind closed doors," he said. "It's very sad and it doesn't speak well to our understanding and commitment to children."
Dr. Landrigan, who organized a recent conference on child labor, laid the blame for the growth of legal and illegal child labor on three factors:
*More and more families slipped into poverty in the 1980's and early 1990's and needed income from their children's work;
*Immigrants flooded the nation, often from countries where child labor is routine, providing a pool of people ripe for exploitation;
*And state and Federal governments cut their budgets for inspecting workplaces, making the discovery of violations less likely.
Mr. Newman said that economic factors over the past decade have contributed to the problem. "There are two times when child labor is really affected by the economy," he said. "When the economy is really in the doldrums or in an extreme recession, businesses often seek out young people because they can pay them less and take advantage of them." On the other hand, he said, "When the economy is up, child labor again begins to climb because businesses need more people and they can hire young people at lower wages."
 
Historically Defies Regulation
 Mr. Newman and others added, however, that a major contributing factor to the increase in child labor has been lax enforcement of state and Federal laws. Federal laws prohibit children under age 16 from working during school hours and limit the number of hours they can work after school and on weekends. Certain jobs, like mining, logging and roofing, are prohibited for anyone under age 18. In agriculture, restrictions are less stringent; hazardous work is prohibited until age 16.
But child labor has a long history that complicates attempts to restrict or regulate it, said Dr. David Rosner, a historian of medicine at Baruch College in New York. "We have very deep-seated social and cultural values that play against serious attempts at protecting kids," Dr. Rosner said.
Many Americans are deeply ambivalent about child labor, he said. "We see work as redemptive and as a morally legitimate method of self improvement."
The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, recently found evidence in data from the United States Department of Labor that the number of illegally employed minors had almost tripled since 1983, rising from 9,200 to 27,500 last year. But Dr. Charles Jeszeck, an economist who did the analysis, said those numbers grossly underestimate the problem because they derive from woefully inadequate surveillance and reporting systems.
 
166,000 15-Year-Olds WorkersIllegally Employed
 Dr. Jeszeck and his colleagues found one indication of underreporting when their search of 1988 census data revealed that at least 166,000 15-year-old childrenwere working too many hours or in occupations, like construction, that are prohibited for children that young. More than half were working in prohibited jobs, Dr. Jeszeck said.
A recent investigation of 4,700 businesses by the Labor Department found that nearly 5,000 minors at 1,300 businesses were working illegally.
Dr. William Halperin, the associate director for surveillance at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, called the magnitude of illegal child labor "astounding." And he said the statistics gathered so far are "the tip of an iceberg," because there is no systematic data collection and many injuries and even deaths are not reported.
One problem is simply discovering violators, given the relatively few inspectors the Federal Government employs for that purpose. For example, Dr. Landrigan said, the National Occupational Safety and Health Administration has 2,000 inspectors, and the Labor Department has another 1,000 wage-and-hour workers, who are responsible for detecting illegal child labor as well as violations involving adults. That combined force equals only a fourth of the 12,000 inspectors who work for the Fish and Wildlife Service.
 
84-Year Inspection Cycle
 Jay Mazur, president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, said that OSHA has so few inspectors that it would take 84 years to get around to inspecting all the workplaces for which it is responsible; it would take 25 years just to visit every high-hazard workplace for a surprise inspection. With such inadequate resources, he said, "we are fighting, to put it mildly, an uphill battle."
New York State, which has some of the toughest laws restricting child labor, also has the nation's only state task force to look for labor-law violations in garment-industry sweatshops. But there are only 15 inspectors assigned to inspect New York City's estimated 4,000 to 6,000 factories where small contractors hire workers to sew clothing. And the inspectors say that when they enter a building, factory owners on one floor quickly warn others in the building, and children are hastily sent away.
 
Suspiciously Young Workers
 Last Monday morning, while New York schools were still in session, two inspectors checked on J. J. Fashions, a 7th floor factory on West 37th street in Manhattan. Wires dangled from the ceiling of the room, where about 50 women and a few men toiled at sewing machines and ironed stacks of bright orange net jackets.
One of the inspectors, Angelo Valdevitt, thought that a few of the workers looked suspiciously young. He approached a solemn, chubby-cheeked girl who was nearly hidden by a rack of clothes and, speaking gently in Spanish, explained that he was not from immigration and was not there to report her if she was an illegal immigrant. Then he asked her name, where she was from and how old she was. The girl, who identified herself as Patricia Flores from Mexico, said she was too nervous to remember her birthday and that she had no identification with her.
One recent study, by Dr. Letitia Davis, director of the Occupational Health Surveillance Program at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, found that annual injury rates for child workers in Massachusetts are 3 1/2 times the adult rate of 8 injuries per 100 full-time workers.
Almost everyone who has examined the issue of child labor has uncovered sad stories of children who were maimed or killed.
 
Tales of Pain and Death
 Congressman Tom Lantos of Calif., the chairman of the Employment and Housing Subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Operations, held hearings last year where he heard testimony from Matthew Garvey, who worked in a car wash in Laurel, Md., when he was 13. His leg was ripped off by a blowing machine.
Mr. Lantos also heard from the parents of Michael Hucorne of East Stroudsburg, Pa., who was killed at age 17 while working in a supermarket, illegally operating a machine that compresses cardboard boxes. And he heard from the parents of Kevin Curley of West Pittston, Pa., who was killed at age 15 while working in a bakery. He was cleaning a dough mixing machine, a prohibited job, when he was pulled inside it.
Valerie Wilk, a health specialist with the Farmworker Justice Fund, Inc., an advocacy group, told of 14-year-old Joel Compos, who fell asleep while working in a farmer's field in Washington State at 2:30 A.M. and was run over and killed by a truck.

HEADLINE: Inquiry Into Sicilian Slaying Looks for Mafia Link to Colombia Drug Cartel

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PALERMO, Sicily, June 18

 BODY:
A month after the killing of Italy's top Mafia-buster, investigators are trying to unravel many mysteries. Possibly the most worrisome is whether the assassination was linked to his inquiries into a new and largely unchronicled drive by the Sicilian Mafia and Colombian drug dealers to flood Europe with cocaine and thus expand beyond what narcotics agents call the saturated market of the United States.
Initially, the slaying of the Mafia investigator, Giovanni Falcone, on a highway outside Palermo was attributed to a vendetta against him for bringing over 300 mafiosi to justice in the 1980's, and many still see this as the prime motive. Another goal was assumed to be preventing Mr. Falcone from taking a new job at the head of an anti-Mafia superagency this year. 
 Today, only a dust-crusted wreath at the roadside marks the place where a huge bomb tore through the blacktop as Mr. Falcone rode by, killing him, his wife and three bodyguards in an 80-mile-per-hour motorcade. The scope of the investigation has broadened with the involvement of the American F.B.I., Mr. Falcone's close ally in previous trans-Atlantic Mafia investigations, which sent a team of six agents to Sicily immediately after the bombing.
"We are trying to understand if there are links in this murder between the Sicilian Mafia and Colombians or between the Sicilian Mafia and Cosa Nostra in the United States, and for this contribution, the F.B.I. is essential," Justice Minister Claudio Martelli said in an interview in Rome.
 
His Last Cases Cited
 "One of the last cases that Falcone supervised was the trafficking of 600 kilograms of cocaine for the first time directly from Colombia to Sicily," he said. "Another was the recruitment of Mafia soldiers in Sicily and their transfer to Cosa Nostra in Philadelphia."
The link between Sicilian Mafia clans and the Colombian drug cartel has been known to European and American narcotics agents for at least a year, but it has only recently begun to raise alarms as the size of shipments has grown. The Mafia has paid for purchases with the proceeds of heroin trafficking in Europe.
"The curve of both shipments and seizures has just been going up all the time," said a Western narcotics official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Initially, narcotics agents seized small shipments of only a few pounds. But four months ago, the official said, a 600-pound cocaine shipment with a wholesale price of around $9 million and a far larger potential street value was seized in the port of Genoa, apparently destined for a new European market.
"The Colombians don't have a distribution network in Europe, and the Mafia does," the official said. "The U.S. is saturated. This is the new market."
 
Effect of Open Frontiers
 While Western Europe is heading toward open frontiers and a single market -- both advantageous to drug dealers -- Eastern Europe is also moving toward greater openness and free-market economies. "The Mafia and organized crime want to move in," the official said.
Possibly significantly, Italian investigators say the dealings with the Colombian Medellin cartel involve the Madonia, the Sicilian Mafia family that Mr. Falcone believed was behind an earlier attempt to kill him in 1989.
"There's some reason to believe that external links with the Colombians may have precipitated this," an American official said, "but there's no hardevidence for this."
In Rome on Thursday, Interior Minister Vincenzo Scotti suggested that the American Mafia may have also approved the killing.
"It was a Mafia crime that went beyond national borders," Mr. Scotti said. "This type of crime, the way it was carried out, the techniques used do not point to an exclusively Sicilian origin."
 
Inquiry Inconclusive
 The mystery about the motives has flourished with the inconclusiveness of the investigation. No one has been arrested, and four weeks of inquiries have apparently produced little more than six composite pictures of the supposed bombers -- unusual in a city where most people have traditionally refused to risk cooperating with the authorities -- and a "genetic fingerprint." This is thought to have been discovered by F.B.I. agents in saliva traces from cigarette butts left at hideout used by the bombers.
Moreover, many remain convinced that the Mafia's traditional imposition of "omerta," the vow of silence, will protect Mr. Falcone's killers as it has protected other murderers of public figures.
"Nobody's going to talk because they'll end up dead or someone in their family will end up dead," an American official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
"It will be very difficult to find the perpetrators, and even more difficult to find those who sent them," Giuseppe Ayala, a former anti-Mafia investigator and close associate of Mr. Falcone, said in an interview. "This is a signal of sovereignty for the Mafia. They are saying: whatever changes in the political system, we are in charge here."
 
Boss Escapes Detection
 For the Mafia, many argue, Sicily is the central base of operations, a sanctuary to be guarded at all costs. In its craggy reaches, some suspected senior mobsters, like Salvatore Riina, the head of the dominant Corleone family who is viewed as possibly the "capo di tutti capi," the boss of all bosses, has escaped detection for over 20 years, running exortion, narcotics and other rackets that have spread across Italy and into many parts of Europe.
The authorities, however, acknowledge that they no longer even know what Mr. Riina looks like. The last known photograph of him, on a Government-issued identification card, was taken about 30 years ago.
Investigators have long tried to determine who has greater prominence in the Mafia leadership, Mr. Riina or Lucciano Leggi, who has been imprisoned in Sardinia for many years but is believed to have directed Mafia operations from there.
Investigators say about 5,000 lesser mobsters control "families" of between 60 and 100 people, meaning that between 300,000 and 500,000 of Sicily's five million people are directly and irrevocably committed to the mob.
Additionally, the Mafia's political connections are widely believed to give it strong protection. "If we do not cut the links between the Mafia and politics, we will never defeat the Mafia," said Leoluca Orlando, head of the anti-Mafia Rete party and a former Palermo Mayor.
 
Prisoners Are Punished
 Over the last year the authorities have tightened anti-Mafia legislation, suspending 29 municipal councils in several parts of Italy because of their Mafia connections and barring suspected mobsters from seeking public office.
Since the Falcone killing, too, the authorities have started to punish known mafiosi in prison or free on bail.
The authorities this week withdrew jail privileges like contact with the outside world from imprisoned mafiosi who, up until then, had been living comfortably in their cells. When Mr. Falcone was killed, the police here say, Mafiosi in the Palermo prison were so well provided for that they toasted his death in champagne.
Last week, the authorities rounded up 1,400 convicted Mafia operatives who had been out of prison under various programs that permit house arrest or bail. Many were again freed, but around 200 were sent back to jail to press them to turn state's evidence, Italian officials say.
A result of the crackdown, though, has been such intense protest by Mafia and other detainees that prison warders themselves have staged demonstrations to say their lives are in danger from the mob, even inside jail.
 
Public Distaste Deepens
 Possibly the most obvious consequence of Mr. Falcone's killing has been a deepening of public distaste for the Mafia. An opinion poll taken before the killing but released after it indicated that 50 percent of Italy's 56 million people favor the death sentence for mobsters.
For the citizens of this port city, the killing has galvanized that same revulsion.
Every day since the killing, people have come to Mr. Falcone's former home on Palermo's Via Notarbartolo to leave bouquets of lilacs, orchids and roses and to pin condolence messages on the tall tree outside his home, at No. 23.
One such note, signed by Class 2F at the local Alberico Gentile junior high school, read, "For us children, you lit a ray of hope to show us how to fight the Mafia."

HEADLINE: To the Finalists: Don't Call Us . . .

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
It is not quite as urgent as David O. Selznick's search for Scarlett, or as spitefully competitive as team-captain selection in Little League, but New York City's hunt for a new director of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting has come to resemble a little of both.
"It's a rat's nest," said Alan S. Gordon, Eastern Executive Secretary of the Director's Guild, and whose candidate for the job was not considered -- despite his strenuous lobbying effort. 
 "It's pathetic," said one member of the nine-person search committee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, adding "I question the quality of those who applied."
"It's unbelievable," said Jennifer Kimball, a press secretary at City Hall, who added that there had been more scrutiny -- and second-guessing -- over this relatively minor position than ever occurred during the six-month search last year for a health commissioner.
There is an old Hollywood saying that seems just as apt in New York: everyone has two kinds of business -- their own and show business. And perhaps because the vacancy has occurred when New York City's film industry is in a slump, nobody seems pleased with anybody.
City officials estimate that film and television production is a $2.7-billion-a-year industry in New York City. After Jaynne C. Keyes resigned to become an agent at the William Morris Agency last April, 50 people applied for her job of coaxing studio and advertising executives to approve location shots in New York -- which, over the last few years, has become a little like trying to rent out summer houses in a resort town after sharks have been spotted.
The city's entertainment industry has yet to rebound from the seven-month boycott led by Hollywood studios last year to protest the city's high labor costs. This month, the director Sidney Lumet threatened to personally boycott New York after a minor labor dispute erupted on his last day of shooting on his latest film; he later issued a statement that said, rather peevishly, that he would consider shooting in New York, "on a script-to-script" basis, but that "I still resent" the local crew's threat (unrealized) of a work stoppage.
Because of its singular pool of actors, extras and technicians, as well as its vitality, the city has always attracted film makers. But the high labor costs and logistical logjams just as characteristic of New York have driven studios and advertising firms to cities like Los Angeles, Toronto and Orlando.
Even a longtime New York film maker like Martin Scorsese, who just completed several weeks of shooting in and around the city for his latest film, "The Age of Innocence," said he was worried about the industry's future in New York. "These days, because of economic problems," he said, "the first question from a studio is, 'Can you do this picture somewhere else?' "
The film-office job, which pays $78,000, is therefore not an easy one. "I can't lose," is how Rafael PiRoman, put it. Mr. PiRoman, the host of "Visiones," a Spanish-language television show, is one of three finalists, search-committee members say. "If I get the job, I get prestige and responsibility," he said. "If I don't, I avoid all those headaches."
 
'A Political Thing'
 Mr. PiRoman, who was an official of a theatrical electrician's union, is favored by labor. Management seems unhappy with Mr. PiRoman and both of his rivals, Lori Rosenfield, a former development executive at Fox Television, and Caitlan Buchman, a film consultant and former agent. The other two could not be reached for comment.
"It's all a political thing, and it continues to be a political appointment," complained Martin Bregman, a producer. "They are destroying the film industry." Mr. Bregman, the producer of "Serpico," and "Sea of Love," said he considered Ms. Keyes "inept," and said he was certain that none of the finalists would be any better. He personally implored Mayor David N. Dinkins to hire Nancy Littlefield, who had held the job during the Koch administration.
Ms. Littlefield, however, did not wish to be treated like an ordinary supplicant for the job. Now the executive director of Queens Public Television, Ms. Littlefield said she was willing to discuss the position with Mr. Dinkins or Mr. Sullivan directly, but added, "I felt that to be called the night before to talk to that group was not appropriate," she said, referring to the search committee.
Other candidates were less fastidious. "One candidate got big contributors to the Mayor to lobby for them," said the search committee member who spoke anonymously. Yet for all the lobbying and jockeying, many within the industry complain about the caliber of the candidates.
 
The Final Cut
 Ms. Littlefield said: "I agree that the people who are being considered are not heavy-hitters. They need someone who is not afraid to take the bull by the horns."
If that were the only criterion, then Jeanne P. Nathan, director of public affairs for the city's Housing Authority, might be a shoo-in. "I am a pushy, hard-working person," she said. "I am not afraid to deal with people at any level. I used to be a TV reporter -- we know how pushy and arrogant they are."
Ms. Nathan, who solicited recommendations from her own boss, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, and several big names in the film industry (Taylor Hackford, the director, was one), did not make the final cut. Undaunted, she said the Mayor was not obliged to follow the search committee's recommendations. "I don't think that's the end of the story," she said.
Jane Streich, who was Ms. Keyes's deputy and is currently the acting director, was also a candidate who did not become a finalist. She was less bold about her aspirations than Ms. Nathan, but she too seemed to hold out some hope of Dinkins ex machina. "I don't know the mechanisms of the search committee," she said. "But hopefully, who knows?"
"A lot of the things people complain about in New York are mythical," said Robert Greenhut, a New York-based producer who has worked with two consummate New York City film makers, Woody Allen and Mike Nichols. He allowed that production costs were still higher than elsewhere, but said union concessions that helped end the boycott had also "helped level the field." But he also said it would take someone "really dynamic" to alter Hollywood's perceptions.

HEADLINE: State Bar Acts to Limit How Lawyers Advertise Themselves

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 19

 BODY:
Can bad taste be regulated?
Proposed new advertising guidelines for lawyers in Connecticut appear partly aimed at just such a goal, raising prospects for a free-for-all over issues of image, money and free speech. 
 The rules, already endorsed by the state's two largest legal groups -- the Trial Lawyers Association and the Connecticut Bar Association -- would limit how lawyers can advertise themselves to a degree unthinkable in most other businesses.
A television or radio ad, for example, could feature only one voice, with no sound effects other than music allowed in the background, and no dramatizations.
No lawyer could send a solicitation to an accident victim for at least 40 days after the accident, and even then the form of letter would be strictly limited: letter-size paper only, with the word "advertisement" stamped in red ink on every page and on the lower left front corner of the envelope.
The proposals are under consideration by the State Superior Court, which is to decide sometime this summer whether to include them in the rules for professional conduct that bind lawyers' behavior.
 
More Ads, More Talk of Limits
 The rules, modeled after similar codes enacted in Florida and Nevada last year -- and already under challenge in Federal court in Florida as an abridgement of free speech -- have rekindled a debate that has smoldered since the United States Supreme Court first ruled in 1977 that lawyers could advertise.
Legal experts say the recession, which has forced many firms to scramble harder for clients, and increasingly sophisticated techniques of direct marketing have raised the stakes in the debate over advertising. During the 1980's, the amount of television advertising for lawyers also grew significantly, to $95 million in 1990 from $11 million in 1982, according to the American Bar Association. Figures for Connecticut were not available.
There are currently few specific restrictions on legal advertising in Connecticut, New York and most other states, other than the general standards that apply to all ads: that the information be truthful and verifiable.
Several of the legal groups' proposed restrictions, however, including the 40-day waiting period for personal injury solicitations, have already been passed by the Connecticut legislature and signed into law by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. The law will not take effect until next year, and there is disagreement over whether the legislature has the authority to set such standards.
In the last few months, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oregon have also begun considering restrictions patterned on the Florida model, according to the American Bar Association.
And the New Jersey Supreme Court earlier this year ordered a review of the rules on lawyer solicitations, as part of the public reprimand of a lawyer who sought clients among the families of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.
The questions go beyond how lawyers get work. Some opponents of the measure say the regulations are part of an elitist campaign by establishment lawyers, who dominate large legal associations, to put down street-fighter-type marketers like John Haymond, a Hartford lawyer who uses direct mail aggressively, especially to solicit victims of motorcycle accidents. Brochures from Mr. Haymond's firm show him and other members of the firm on motorcycles.
 
'An Anti-Competitive Impulse'
 "The establishment plaintiff's bar is being hurt by Young Turks taking away business," said Ralph Gregory Elliot, a First Amendment lawyer in Hartford. "It's an anti-competitive impulse that drives these rules."
But proponents of the rules say intrusive and sometimes misleading claims by lawyers hurt the profession and the public by alienating people from legal services that they might really need.
They say lawyers who promise to take no fee unless they win a case -- a common claim in television ads in particular -- often neglect to mention that a law firm's expenses, if only for such things as document duplication, are usually charged to the client win or lose. Some also resent what they see as a crass scramble for clients that demeans the profession.
"In the old days it was word of mouth and personal trust -- now it's bars of soap," said Thomas A. Weaver, a solo practitioner in Meriden.
 
Questions of Likeability
 The fight has raised a whole spectrum of questions. What should be the model for proper attorney conduct? Does a letter sent to an accident victim or his family, or a tacky ad by a lawyer about his services, hurt the public, or just the self-image of lawyers who see themselves as more than money-seeking tradesmen? And do people dislike lawyers because they are aggressive and tacky or because they're lawyers?
"It's more Freud than Federal Constitutional law," said Bruce Rogow, a law professor at Nova University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who represented the rap group 2 Live Crew in its obscenity trial in 1990 and is now leading the effort to overturn the Florida lawyer advertising code.
Mr. Rogow said he believes that the idea of limiting lawyers to certain kinds of presentations was motivated by a desire among lawyers to be liked, but that ultimately it deprived the public of needed information.
"People who respond to these ads don't know other lawyers," he said.
 
 
 
AT A GLANCE

 
New Laws for Lawyers
 Prohibitions on lawyer solicitation passed by the Connecticut legislature and signed into law by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., effective Oct. 1, 1993:
 Written communications to a prospective client must be only on letter-size paper.
 The lower left corner of any legal solicitation letter must be marked in red ink with the word, "advertisement." If the legal matter involves a personal injury, no solicitation letter may be sent until at least 40 days after the accident.
 Additional changes being considered by the Rules Committee of State Superior Court:
 Information in any radio or television advertisement "shall be articulated by a single voice, with no background sound other than instrumental music."
 No dramatizations of any kind permitted in any medium.
 Any illustration shall present information that "can be factually substantiated and is not merely self-laudatory."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
Perot Is Cited, but Not Embraced, as an Alternative to Clinton

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Like millions of other Americans, some politically prominent New Yorkers are flirting with Ross Perot for President, but it is far from clear that they want him to win. In the last few days, figures from Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem to Raymond B. Harding, the leader of the state's Liberal Party, to Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier, have said they could not rule out backing the nation's favorite undeclared candidate.
Mr. Harding, whose small party depends on political patronage for appointments and jobs, wants to be a player. Mr. Rohatyn, a lifelong Democrat and a perpetual prospect for a Democratic cabinet post, wants attention for his goal of rebuilding the nation's economy and infrastructure. Mr. Rangel wants respect for urban problems and for his friend Jesse Jackson. 
 Mr. Rangel was angry at Gov. Bill Clinton's decision to denounce the rap performer Sister Souljah in a meeting of Mr. Jackson's Rainbow Coalition last weekend. The Arkansas Governor, the expected Democratic Presidential nominee, said comments by the rapper in the wake of the Los Angeles riots about black-on-white violence had no place in the national dialogue.
"I don't have any knowledge that Clinton deliberately brought up Sister Souljah to distance himself from Jesse Jackson and other minorities in order to appeal to whites," Mr. Rangel said. "But a person who would allow himself to be used in that strategy does not deserve to be President, or to be the bearer of the Democratic standard. And we do have choices besides Bush."
But, Mr. Rangel, one of the state's most prominent black officials, added, "Let me be clear: The support Perot receives has nothing to do with his qualifications to be even a dogcatcher. It has to do with dissatisfaction with the other candidates."
Or as Mr. Rohatyn put it: "I'm a lifelong Democrat, and for the time being, I'm supporting my party and its nominee. But if somebody has a platform and a program that I identify more closely with, I'd feel free to do that, too."
 
Dinkins as Peacemaker
 Mayor David N. Dinkins, in Houston to attend a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, said on Friday that he was willing to serve as a mediator in the dispute between Governor Clinton and Mr. Jackson over Sister Souljah's statements.
On Thursday, Mr. Jackson said the Governor had made a clumsy bid for the backing of alienated white voters and had "again exposed a character flaw."
Mayor Dinkins said he thought the Governor "made a mistake in the way he handled" the situation. "He sort of put himself in a position of embarrassing his host," he said.
Mr. Dinkins said it was possible that Governor Clinton had not fully understood what Sister Souljah had meant, adding, "However, nobody would agree that one ought to kill white folks." Asked if he would mediate the dispute, the Mayor said, "Yes."
 
$250-an-Hour Inquiry
 Political warfare, it seems, is not waged on the cheap.
The Senate Republicans in Albany last week appointed a special counsel -- to be paid $250 an hour from taxpayers' money -- to investigate the machinations behind a bizarre redistricting lawsuit in which Democrats challenged new Senate lines without naming the Senate Republicans as defendants.
The special counsel appointed by the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, is Joseph J. Kunzeman, a retired justice of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court and a former Republican Assemblyman from Queens.
The lawsuit was filed in New York City by Democrats who named Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine as the lead defendant. Mr. Lundine, a Democrat, is officially the president of the Senate but serves mainly in a ceremonial role. The power in the Senate is vested in the Republican majority, which did not know about the lawsuit until a judge ruled for the Democrats. The case is now on appeal to the Court of Appeals.
The Democrats have charged that Justice Kunzeman's investigation will amount to a kangaroo court, and an expensive one. The Democrats say they do not expect to be surprised by the findings of a Republican judge appointed by a Republican Senator to investigate Democratic misdeeds.
But Mr. Marino's spokesman, John E. McArdle, said Justice Kunzeman, who was appointed to the bench by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, would be objective. And he said the investigation was driven by questions about potential obstructions of justice and civil rights violations, not by politics.
"They're serious charges," Mr. McArdle said. "People laughed at Watergate at first too."
 
The Women's Touch
 No one has ever accused New York's Attorney General, Robert Abrams, of trying to trade on sex appeal, but in this year of the female Senate candidates, he has been struggling to persuade women that he is the best Democratic candidate to take on Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. He began the race as the presumed favorite, but former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro has pulled ahead in polls, and City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman is nipping from behind, leaving him and the Rev. Al Sharpton the odd men out.
But for at least one morning last week, Mr. Abrams basked in the support of a number of prominent women who said he had "an unparalleled record of leadership on the issues of reproductive freedom, gender discrimination and sexual harassment."
Cora Fields, president of the New York Coalition of 100 Black Women said, "The gender of a person does not make that person the best advocate for women or other people in this country. It is the person's record on the issues that counts."
 
A Shot at Super Water Guns
 Joseph Azzolina, a New Jersey Assemblyman who last month voted for a bill to lift the state's ban on semiautomatic weapons, is going back before the Legislature to press for a measure that would ban the sale of super water guns in the state.
The Republican-controlled Assembly, splitting along party lines, voted 55 to 18 last month to repeal the state's ban on the sale and ownership of semiautomatic weapons, and Mr. Azzolina, a Republican from Middletown, was among those who supported the bill. The Senate has not voted on the legislation, which Gov. Jim Florio has said he will veto.
Mr. Azzolina said he introduced a bill to ban the sale of the water guns because of the violence last weekend in the beach front community of Belmar. Officials said the disturbance started when people began squirting strangers with the water guns.
"I'm the first one to admit that the removal of super-powered water guns from store shelves will not completely solve the violence in our streets," he said, "but I am convinced that there is a thin line between a water-gun fight and the real thing."

HEADLINE: ON PRO FOOTBALL;
N.F.L. Shoulder Pads Include a Chip

BYLINE: By Timothy W. Smith

 BODY:
Most of the time the National Football League displays its arrogance like a coat of arms. It's hard to be humble when you're a recession-proof billion-dollar corporation, a monopoly operating with impunity, and you have adoring supporters filling your stadiums and a willing labor pool that literally gives an arm and a leg to work for you.
This week the N.F.L. strutted into the United States District Court in Minneapolis wielding its arrogance like Excalibur, slicing through the plaintiffs during cross-examination in Freeman McNeil v. the National Football League for daring to take a stand against the league's Plan B free agency policy. 
 Under the policy, 37 players are protected or restricted by each team, while its remaining players are allowed to sign with the 27 other teams in the league. The eight players who sued were protected by their teams, prohibited from negotiating with other teams even though their contracts with their teams had expired. The players are suing for $3 million in damages and the right to offer their services on the open market to the highest bidder.
Frank Rothman, the N.F.L.'s attorney, is the point man in the league's defense. Rothman is the league's bulldog, attacking the players' lack of talent and the length of time they work in relationship to amount of money they receive from the teams.
After opening statements on Tuesday by Rothman and Jim Quinn, the players' attorney, N.F.L. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said: "Quinn convinced me that we are going to win. Whatever reason we had to settle is gone by the boards, because it's clear that we're going to win this case."
Call it posturing or confidence or arrogance, but that's the kind of attitude that the N.F.L. exudes. The league exhibited it in its previous collective-bargaining negotiations with the players and previous court challenges. It's what ultimately led the N.F.L. to this trial. And if it doesn't play well with the jury of eight Minnesota women, this attitude could be costly.
This is a middle-of-the-road jury, dipped from a 21-member pool of white faces -- no blacks, Hispanics, Asians or American Indians among them -- many of whom listed their church as their main social organization. It was the kind of jury pool that produced one prospective juror who, upon being questioned by the judge as to whether her being a victim of a crime would influence her attitude toward the five black plaintiffs in the case, said: "No. As a matter of fact my oldest son is an honorary Negro." No one around her flinched. She, along with all the union members and hard-core sports fans, was eliminated when the attorneys exercised their option to exclude jurors.
What was left was a group that could probably buy the league's argument that players make too much money to be complaining about not being able to move from team to team to make more money. When the jury finds out how much money the owners make in relation to how much the average N.F.L. player earns, sympathies may shift.
So far in the trial, Rothman has done a good job painting N.F.L. team owners as benevolent employers who cater to their players' financial demands, even though sometimes, as in his example of one of the plaintiffs, Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski, they don't play well enough to deserve the money they get.
The N.F.L. contends that the owners don't have to give the players loads of money. But they do, because they want to keep the players happy and it's the right thing to do. The owners want competitive teams for a competitive league, because without a competitive league the fans won't be happy, won't buy tickets, won't watch the games on television, and the league will go out of business.
In order to keep competitive teams, the owners ask the players to sign agreements that bind them to the same team until the team decides the player can no longer help them remain competitive. But the players, even the ones on the lowest end of the wage scale, are paid more money than autoworkers or school teachers or secretaries. And the players only work a few months out of the year. The restriction on movement is a minor inconvenience for which the players are handsomely compensated, the N.F.L. argues.
Wednesday during cross-examination of Randy Vataha, the agent for Majkowski and Dave Richards of San Diego, another plaintiff in the case, Rothman was in rare form, playing up the overpaid argument:
"The year that he was earning $1.5 million, Mr. Majkowski was benched because of poor performance, wasn't he? How many games was he benched? You don't know, do you?"
Following the same line of questioning, Rothman said: "I don't mean this to be facetious, and please don't take it that way, but after a player has an abysmal season, no one comes to him and says give us some of that money back, do they? Of course not."
Then, he spun around to face the jury, giving them an incredulous look; it has become a familiar move during the trial's first week.
The jury will ultimately decide whether freedom has a price tag, and who should pay the cost.

HEADLINE: No Wonder the Public Is Angry

 BODY:
Congress passed an urban aid bill last week and no one cheered. Cheer what? It was a simplified, stripped-down measure to provide emergency loans to victims of the Los Angeles riots and the Chicago flood. Yet even this limp emergency legislation took seven weeks to pass.
Rural legislators fought for a slice of the action. Liberals fought to load the bill with social services. Conservatives fought to spend less. After all that wrangling, Congress settled for less than $1.5 billion in emergency loans plus summer youth job programs in 75 cities. Given this slovenly performance, is it any wonder that voters look with interest to Ross Perot, who has no governmental record? 
 Having taken so long to do the easy part, Congress will now confront the task of finding a longer-term answer to urban blight. It's already clear that this legislation, too, will be lame as well as late. What appears to be in store is a stunted little Christmas tree, too little money for too many programs in too many cities.
The Bush Administration's package is built around enterprise zones, designated areas in over 100 cities, to which companies would be lured by tax breaks and regulatory relief. To this old idea Mr. Bush has added the "Weed and Seed" program, which includes money for law enforcement and social services.
But to judge by the record of enterprise zones already underway in 30 states, the idea is unlikely to work well. Companies move where they are offered modern infrastructure and disciplined workers. Tax breaks are secondary, and can't outweigh the deterrence of dilapidation and crime. Often, the companies that move into the enterprise zones come from nearby neighborhoods that are nearly as poor, and they hire mostly non-residents. President Bush says his Federal zones will work better than state zones. That's possible. Federal tax breaks are much more valuable. It's worth launching careful experiments. But Congress owes beleaguered cities more than an experiment.
The problem with Mr. Bush's idea is that it addresses the wrong problem. Ghetto residents aren't unemployed because of a shortage of nearby jobs. If that were true, they could readily be given transportation subsidies. The real problem is that many of the urban unemployed aren't capable of keeping steady jobs.
They need training. They need education. They need drug treatment, child care and medical insurance. They need, in short, the 1988 Family Support Act, which is supposed to provide all these services. Congress, however, hasn't put up enough funds to get the program rolling -- and isn't even thinking of doing so.
What's emerging instead is a bill that will dissipate a modest amount of money -- probably less than $10 billion -- on scores of unrelated programs in a hundred or so cities and, perhaps, rural areas. For example, a Senate committee decided last week to expand something called the Targeted Job Tax Credit, meant to induce employers to hire disadvantaged workers. Sounds good, works poorly. One study showed that the program stigmatizes participants and makes them less likely to find employment.
As Ross Perot might say, there's no mystery about how to provide truly useful urban assistance. It takes some courage, but no seductive new ideas or dazzling new insights are needed. All Congress needs to do is find the money to help poor ghetto residents find work. That means paying for the Family Support Act.

Veto Proof

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
My recollection of first registering to vote is that the process consisted of a young woman, a gymnasium and a clipboard. I could have told her my name was Vivien Leigh and she wouldn't have known the difference unless she'd seen "Gone With the Wind."
Voter registration, like solid waste management and zoning codes, is one of those issues that has a proven effect on people. ZZZzzzzzzz. But last week the issue presented itself in a fashion that made me think about the ways in which we really count ourselves Americans. And it presented itself in legislation so obvious and so right that George Bush could only deal with it in one way. 
 A veto.
The National Voter Registration Act was passed by the House on Tuesday, a month after the Senate had done the same. The measure is cutely called "motor voter" because it would register people to vote when they receive or renew their driver's licenses. And it would also enable people to register at the offices where they receive welfare or unemployment benefits. Right now only 60 percent of those eligible are registered to vote; with this measure the number could rise to 95 percent. As it is in so many other democratic countries, voter registration would become almost automatic.
This doesn't simply mean more voters. Voting and jury service are inextricably linked. In most states, voting lists are a major source, if not the only source, of jury pools. What that means is that if we enlarge the pool of voters, we will also enlarge the pool of jurors.
The average registered voter in this country is older, whiter and better off than the average American. That's usually true of jurors, too. It's one reason we hear so many complaints about impartial panels, about a jury of peers. While we've come a long way from the days when only white male landowners could serve on juries, the poor, the young and people of color are still often missing from jury pools.
On Thursday the Supreme Court ruled that defendants cannot use their peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors on the basis of race. Six years ago they said the same about prosecutors.
But what of the implicit societal peremptory exercised when the way we select them produces middle class jury pools that reflect neither the community nor the accused? A national motor-voter program could change that. Of the 70 million Americans not registered to vote, two out of three have household incomes below the median and many are minorities. Millions of them would likely register under the act and therefore be called to jury duty, too.
It is one measure of his isolation and supreme self-interest that the President would kill a universal franchise bill in a year of intense psychic disenfranchisement. For the people who would be registered are precisely the people who feel most estranged from government -- the people of South-Central L.A. and of MTV. They are precisely the kind of people who need to feel included in the resolution of disputes and the dispersal of power. To feel part of the program.
At the risk of sounding like a Jimmy Stewart character in a Frank Capra film, think of that sensation of accomplishment you get when you draw the curtain closed on election day and are alone in your personal democracy, or when you file into a jury box with your verdict. That's the closest most of us get to pushing the buttons of this country ourselves.
Republican officials have been consistently hostile to this legislation. They have cried fraud, as though a young woman with a clipboard were the height of high tech. Perhaps because they haven't applied lately for a driver's license or an unemployment check, they don't know that either is a virtual administrative decathalon compared to the way many of us register to vote.
Fraud, schmaud -- 30 states have some kind of motor-voter law, and there has been no evidence of serious fraud in any. But there is evidence aplenty that many of the new voters registered under the act would be poorer, younger, Latino, African-American -- to whit, possible Democrats. Not Our Kind, Dear, as they say in drawing room dramas. In a year of epic disenchantment, Congress passed a measure last week that would open up the two most important confined spaces in this country, the ballot box and the jury box. And that measure is destined to die on the President's desk. The fraud is not in the bill. It's in the veto.

HEADLINE: Jobless? Not Quite, but Might as Well Be

 BODY:
To the Editor:
If, as your Business Diary of May 31 notes, jobless claims have declined, it may be that many find themselves in a situation similar to mine. In January 1991, my hours at work were cut from 35 (considered full time) to 17 1/2. I have been unable to obtain either an additional part-time or a new full-time position. 
 I was able to collect low-income, supplemental unemployment ($32 a week, enough to buy groceries). Also, I could collect a small help on my health insurance, which had just risen from $682 a quarter to $759 a quarter. These payments were based on my 1990 earnings and reduced by the amount I was making part time.
When my unemployment claim ran out in January 1992, I was able to refile. Now my payments are based on my 1991 earnings (half of 1990's), but my pay is still too much to get any assistance. Also, the health insurance assistance has stopped.
I hope I can hang in for 10 months until I can start Social Security at age 62. Luckily, my children are grown and I don't have to worry about supporting them. I feel great empathy for those who do.

Target: Declinism

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
PESSIMIST-BASHING is again with us.
When people feel irritable about the lack of bounce in the economic rebound; when words like malaise and phrases like triple dip and creeping decrepitude are bruited about -- the moment is ripe for yeasayers to pop the pessimists.
As Republicans in 1936 charged that the New Deal had failed to lift the nation out of sustained Depression, supporters of F.D.R. called them disciples of despair floundering in a fountain of fear. As Republicans in 1952 blazed away at Harry Truman's "mess in Washington," Democrats -- led, I think, by Adlai Stevenson -- derided the prophets of gloom and doom. 
 Turnabout is fair play: in 1956, Clare Boothe Luce led the Republicans in denouncing Democrats as troubadors of trouble and crooners of catastrophe. As Democrats expressed their dissatisfaction with the lingering war and slow economic growth in 1970, a Republican wordsmith, recalling Mrs. Luce's alliterative ripostes, fed Vice President Spiro T. Agnew a nice bit of alliteration with which to castigate the castigators: he called them the nattering nabobs of negativism. (I was that wordsmith; that year, I was big on n's.)
Here we are, a generation later, with the ouching outcasts of outrage again in full cry, complaining that it's late afternoon in America. What affirmationist will turn the tables and smite them (perhaps with a little innuendo that it is unpatriotic to "run down America"), and with what catchy new phrase?
George Bush has volunteered. He took the 1987 book by Paul Kennedy, "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers," which offered a gloom-and-doom view of our future, and married it to Edward Gibbon's "History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" to come up with a new class of pessimist: the declinists.
Here it is in context, from President Bush's commencement address at Southern Methodist University in Dallas last month:
"I realize that I might not be taking the fashionable view." (This approach is how a speaker strikes the pose of an iconoclast, gutsily opposing the elites who set the fashions and settling instead on the side of the common people who vote.) "Much of the conventional wisdom these days portrays America in decline and its energy dissipated, its possibilities exhausted. . . .
"These declinists, as they are called, will hate to hear it, but they're saying nothing new." The President then recalled how even Walt Whitman had worried that the United States would "prove the most tremendous failure in history" only a few years before the dawn of the American century. "In the 1930's," Mr. Bush went on, "the declin ists told us the Great Depression had made capitalism outmoded. Our victory in World War II put an end to that talk."
Declinist, labeled a "nonce word" in the Oxford English Dictionary, had been used in 1831 by a British philosopher, William Whewell, in discussing the decline of science: "The only professor who has written at all on the subject is Babbage, the leader of the Declinists."
Rhetoricians wonder: Will an anti-pessimist coinage work without either rhyme or alliteration? It's a daring move, but the speechwriters are optimistic about it.
 
BEFORE COUNTRY WAS COOL
 THE LANGUAGE OF country music, a unique American art form, has not been given the sort of scholarly attention it deserves. The device of ironic interplay is worthy of a heavy doctoral thesis; while someone works on that, many of country's best lines have been compiled by Paula Schwed, a Gannett News Service reporter.
The title of her paperback is "I've Got Tears in My Ears From Lyin' on My Back in My Bed While I Cry Over You," from a 1949 song by Harold Barlow.
Other favorites include "If the phone doesn't ring, it's me" (Buffett/Jenn ings/Utley) and "Ever since we said 'I do,' there's so many things you don't" (Slate/Lane), the latter probably based on a 1950's comedy routine. And then Daniel and Ruby Hice wrote, "Worst you ever gave me was the best I ever had," and John Schweers combined metaphors with "You snap your fingers and I'm back in your hands."
This wording is far more linguistically complex than the old June-and-moon rhymings and often raunchier than rap, which I will not illustrate here.
One common denominator is the juxtaposition of contrary ideas: "I miss you already and you're not even gone" (Rainwater/Young). Another is the use of contrasting nouns: "He gives me diamonds, you give me chills" (Goodman/Kennedy). A third, written by Averal Aldridge, is the counterpoint of opposite verbs, and it sums up the way I feel about country music: "I hate the way I love it."
 
LISTING TO PORTMANTEAU
 A PORTMANTEAU WORD is a blend of two words to produce a third. This is just a guesstimate, but I'd say hundreds of words -- from brunch to glitterati -- have been coined under the label of the old French suitcase, or portmanteau, that folded in the middle.
Now we have the portmanteau name. In olden times, a woman getting married -- who did not like the idea of dropping her surname and taking her husband's -- would keep her surname in hyphenated form: Charlayne Hunter-Gault of PBS, for example, was born Charlayne Hunter and married a man named Gault. Along came Ms, and you no longer knew whether the woman is using her married name or not. But those were baby steps toward what is now the complete merger.
"Valerie Jane Silverman, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet H. Silverman of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.," read a society-page item last month in The New York Times, "was married yesterday to Michael Thomas Flaherty . . . on the campus of Harvard University.
"The couple changed their surname yesterday to Flaherman. Mrs. Flaherman, 26 years old, and her husband, 27, are 1987 graduates of Harvard." The item goes on to say, "Mr. Flaherman will receive a master's degree in city planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology next month."
The portmanteau choice was plain: it would either be Silverty or Flaherman, and they went for the man's name first.
Will this become a trend? It's good to see that the Flahermans have made the ultimate commitment; they are obviously not even considering the nomenclature difficulties in event of a divorce.
Try it yourself, dear reader, if you are or have been married: see what your spouse-merged name would be, and whose name would come first. Now, if the couple break up, and each partner marries again to a mate who has had a similar experience. . . .

At the Guggenheim, Bigger May Be Better

BYLINE: By Michael Kimmelman

 BODY:
Even while closed for more than two years of renovation, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum has been the subject of unceasing speculation -- so sweeping are the changes its director, Thomas Krens, has been proposing since 1988, when he took over this revered institution of 20th-century art on upper Fifth Avenue.
A litany has evolved: Mr. Krens will shortchange New York by dispersing its artistic treasures throughout branches of the Guggenheim. He is obsessed with deal-making and with courting high-profile businessmen, collectors, curators and politicians who can help him pull off those deals. The museum has become more about money, power and prestige than about art. 
 Now the renovations are done -- well, almost done, since money ran out before the auditorium could be completed. The Guggenheim spent roughly $60 million for the museum and for a warehouse with conservation studios on the West Side of Manhattan. With the warehouse the formerly cramped museum is now able to consolidate its holdings at three locations and eliminate five storage sites it has been renting.
The new museum opens to the public a week from today, and the litany of speculation will begin to give way to reality. It is far too early to reach a final verdict, but certain facts are becoming clear and they should allay some worries.
Far from abandoning New York, the expanded Guggenheim will have a vastly greater presence in the city than before. Bigger isn't necessarily better, but in this case, it can only mean an improvement. Mr. Krens has made the enlargement and exhibition of the permanent collection his top priority at a time when other museum directors are only slowly realizing the economic wisdom and necessity of this approach. Overseeing the renovation of Frank Lloyd Wright's building and the addition of new galleries, designed by Gwathmey, Siegel & Associates, Mr. Krens has also demonstrated a sensitivity to architecture and an awareness of the need for diverse kinds of spaces for displaying modern works, particularly from the postwar era.
These are encouraging signs, although they hardly wipe away all reservations. Troubling questions persist about the financial repercussions of the expansion and about exhibition plans. The emphasis in forthcoming shows on familiar names and mainstream movements fuels the charge that Mr. Krens is interested above all in size and power. It is noteworthy that educational programs have yet to be developed at the Guggenheim.
First, the expansion: the painstaking refurbishment of Wright's spiral masterpiece and the construction of an annex has nearly tripled, to 80,000 square feet, the space available for exhibition and added the sort of tall, straight-walled, flat-floored galleries that the Guggenheim desperately needed. Those new spaces pose problems: the narrowness of the annex means that elevators cut into the galleries, and none of the rooms are uncomplicated spaces in which to display art. But the changes are a good thing at an institution that could heretofore put on view the tiniest fraction of its more than 6,000 works, which include some of the great paintings by Mondrian, Kandinsky, Dubuffet and many other European masters.
In a move that should create an even more dynamic change in the cultural life of the city, the museum has rented three floors of a onetime loft building in the heart of SoHo, at the corner of Broadway and Prince Street. The site provides room for offices, a bookstore and a cafe, and an additional 27,000 square feet of exhibition space (more than the Whitney Museum of American Art has), designed by the architect Arata Isozaki.
The Guggenheim thus becomes the first major museum to embrace physically a part of the city that is home to much of the art community. The choice of a site diagonally across from the hugely popular Dean & DeLuca food store, and the decision to give the prime corner space to the museum's bookstore, may reflect the same marketing instincts that motivates businesses like the Gap. It's not every museum whose main entrance is through a bookstore. But the Guggenheim calculates that income from attendance and the bookstore will at least cover the rent, and that the exhibitions and the quality of the galleries justify the means.
The plan for SoHo is to emphasize not contemporary but older art, providing a historical context for the new and helping to break down the traditional barrier between uptown museums and downtown artists.
The exhibitions uptown and downtown slated for the next few years, which include shows of the Russian avant-garde, abstraction, Italian art of the 1950's and contemporary German photography, don't suggest much artistic risk, or attention to lesser-known and unconventional talents. The Guggenheim insists that these qualities will emerge, although the question is how prominently they will figure in the museum's profile. Because Mr. Krens seems to want to use exhibitions to entice artists who will donate works to the museum, he may be inclined toward the household names he seeks for the collection. Moreover, the ability of the museum to pay for its expansion rests partly on attracting large numbers of visitors. And that virtually requires blockbusters and big-name artists.
One of the biggest challenges for Mr. Krens is to dispel worries about the museum's integrity, worries that his actions have raised. There remains the sale at auction two years ago of three paintings, by Modigliani, Kandinsky and Chagall, to pay for more than 200 works from the 1960's and 70's owned by Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo -- a move that, because of the significance of the paintings and the dubiousness of trading one kind of art for another, greatly contributed to the skepticism and hostility toward Mr. Krens.
Moreover, his idea of adding branches has suggested a willingness to put works from the collection at risk by circulating them around the world. Most important, the museum must prove that it can pay off an unconventional $55 million bond issue. Bonds issued to pay for museum expansions elsewhere are usually secured by funds from endowments or other sources set aside as collateral, so that the collection is never in jeopardy. But with an endowment of only $31 million, which is smaller than the bond issue, the Guggenheim has left open the possibility that in an emergency its art could be used to cover the payments, although the museum vehemently denies such a step would ever be contemplated.
To meet its payments, which begin later this year, the Guggenheim hopes to increase attendance and income from the bookstores and membership, as well as to attract patrons through devices like "naming opportunities" -- that is, naming parts of the museum after donors. Admission has gone up from $4.50 to $7 uptown; admission is $5 downtown, with a $10 two-day pass for both sites. Both sites will regularly be open until 8 P.M.; SoHo will be open until 10 P.M. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays to cater to the neighborhood's late-night crowds.
Financial projections are based on attendance uptown of between 750,000 and 800,000 visitors annually, up from roughly 600,000 before the museum closed. About 250,000 people are expected to visit SoHo. Even if those projections are conservative for this year, will the museum sustain public interest, once the novelty of the renovation has worn off?
Officials at the Guggenheim insist that only an extended failure, over several years, to beef up attendance, membership and donations would put the trustees in a tough financial position. But the example of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts is ominous: payment for an expansion in the 80's was based on what seemed at the time reasonable projections about attendance and income. But the museum miscalculated, and lately it has had to lay off dozens of employees, cut back programs and undertake an agreement with the Japanese city of Nagoya essentially to rent out parts of its collection.
The Boston's museum's deal with Nagoya mirrors in part the agreement the Guggenheim has lately signed with the Spanish city of Bilbao. The agreement calls for a museum to be built there, run by the Guggenheim and financed by the city, with art from the New York collection as well as works to be bought with money also provided by Bilbao.
Endless talk about establishing branches of the museum in Tokyo, North Adams, Mass., and Salzburg, Austria, about Count Panza's villa in Varese, Italy, and about a second site in Venice in addition to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, so far remains just that -- talk.
But Bilbao, to open in 1996 in a building designed by Frank Gehry, is the first example of Mr. Krens's scheme for the new international Guggenheim in action: armed with its greatest asset, its permanent collection, the Guggenheim has persuaded a culturally ambitious city without a modern art museum to pay tens of millions of dollars for the privilege of borrowing parts of that collection (with the exception of the Justin K. Thannhauser bequest of Post-Impressionist and early modern masterpieces, which can never be lent abroad). In turn, the Guggenheim gets more space to expand its collection and its exhibition program, and presumably more power to attract donors.
Whether this is a good deal for Bilbao has been the subject of heated commentary in the Spanish press. To the extent that the Spaniards are satisfied that they are getting enough important works from the collection for their money, the museum will have to prove that New Yorkers are not suffering as a result, that there are enough great works to go around and that their dispersal does not represent a threat to their conservation.
In any case, the new Guggenheim represents an almost total rejection of the traditional museum as a fixed place where art is collected and preserved and studied. The Guggenheim will be a test case for the shape of future museums.
At this point, discussion about money and exhibitions and branches is still in the realm of speculation. Mr. Krens doesn't tire of pointing out that change, particularly big change of the kind taking place at his museum, always meets with resistance. He is probably right, and if nothing else he is to be credited for his ability to make things happen when many museums are grappling just to keep what they have. It will be a year or so before anyone knows whether the Guggenheim is struggling or a success. For the moment, it is good to have the museum back in operation, in such gleaming shape, and in SoHo as well.
 
 
 
COMING TO A MUSEUM NEAR YOU
 For the opening of the refurbished Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum next Sunday (and through Aug. 27), Frank Lloyd Wright's famous rotunda will house only a fluorescent installation by Dan Flavin meant to celebrate the architecture. This choice makes clear the museum's determination to use this difficult display space constructively by putting it at the disposal of artists who specialize in site-specific works.
The new annex, adjacent to the rotunda, will present highlights from the collection for the opening. The Justin K. Thannhauser collection of Post-Impressionist and early modern masterpieces, which is at the core of the museum's holdings, will remain more or less permanently on view; between annex and rotunda, a significant part of the museum's collection will always be displayed. There will also be regular exhibitions based on aspects of the collection, like a forthcoming show of Latin American art.
The inaugural exhibition at the Guggenheim's new branch in SoHo, also opening next Sunday and closing Aug. 27, will include works from the permanent collection by Brancusi, Kandinsky, Robert Ryman, Joseph Beuys, Carl Andre and Louise Bourgeois. Word had got around that the Guggenheim planned to open with an exhibition of only male artists, and the feminist group known as the Guerrilla Girls sent a postcard to the director, Thomas Krens, saying: "Welcome to downtown. We've been hearing all about your opening show: Four White Boys at the White Boys' Museum. Lotsa Luck!" Now Ms. Bourgeois (as well as Beuys, one more white male) is in the show.
In the fall, in addition to selections from the permanent collection, the downtown Guggenheim will present murals painted by Chagall in 1920 for the State Jewish Kamerny Theater in Moscow, and an exhibition of early works by Robert Rauschenberg that was organized by the Menil Collection in Houston. For early 1993, a show of contemporary German photography organized by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis is planned.
The big fall show uptown will be "The Russian and Soviet Avant-Garde: 1915-32," followed by an installation in the rotunda by the contemporary German artist Lothar Baumgarten. After that the rotunda will house a show of sculpture by Picasso, Calder, Giacometti, David Smith and Julio Gonzalez. Retrospectives of Rebecca Horn, Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Morris, as well as big shows devoted to abstraction and to Italian art in the 50's, are also in the offing.
Probably the most unusual part of the exhibition schedule is a series titled Osmosis, which will bring together European and American artists in collaboration. The first pair will be Haim Stainbach and Ettore Spaletti, the second, the performance artist Laurie Anderson and the film maker Wim Wenders.

HEADLINE: Tibet Without Going There

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF is the Beijing bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
AT the end of the world, where the Tibetan plateau suddenly teeters off a cliff in one direction and collides against snowcapped peaks in the other, the Xinsi Monastery looms unexpectedly from the golden wheat fields to preside over the landscape. The red-robed monks come bustling out, the dough on their hands an indication that they have been interrupted in their chores rather than their prayers, and they break into welcoming grins as magnificent as the scenery.
It is a scene from Tibet, more Tibetan than Tibet itself. Here there are no Chinese troops prowling in the background or Chinese tour leaders curtailing contacts with the monks. 
 This is Qinghai Province in the west of China, but it used to be the northeast part of Tibet until it fell under Chinese control centuries ago. The Tibetans regard Qinghai as part of Tibet, but the Chinese Government's restrictions on travel to Tibet do not apply here. Tourists are allowed into Tibet only as part of a costly organized tour -- although this can be a one-person tour -- while foreigners are free to fly to Xining, the provincial capital, from Beijing.
Qinghai -- pronounced ching-hi -- was opened to foreigners only in 1983, and it still is among the least visited parts of China. Only about 1,200 Americans go to the province each year, slightly fewer than visit Tibet, and the sight of a foreigner still turns heads even in Xining.
The single greatest splendor in Qinghai is the Kumbum Monastery, better known today by its Chinese name, Taer Si. Fifteen miles southwest of Xining, the Kumbum is a stunning collection of temples and compounds set against a hillside, the buildings all painted red and other bright colors, with pilgrims praying and spinning the large prayer wheels and prostrating on the ground. The monastery is as noteworthy for the Tibetan pilgrims who come to worship as for the architecture itself. When I visited in August, I came across a group of four sturdy young Tibetan men in bedraggled clothing.
We chatted for a bit in Chinese and they said they had come from their homes in Sichuan Province, by way of Lhasa. I asked how they had traveled. They looked puzzled.
"By foot," said the oldest of them, about 18 years old.
"How long have you been traveling?"
"Two years," the young man said. "But we'll be home in another six months."
The monastery was built in the last quarter of the 16th century on the instructions of the third Dalai Lama. The site is the birthplace of the founder of the Gelukpa order of Buddhism, Tsongkhapa. This was a center of learning -- one of the Tibetan Ivy League, so to speak -- for Tibetan and Mongolian monks, and at the time of the Communist revolution there were still 3,000 Tibetan monks. Now the Government has set a limit of 400 monks for the Kumbum, but this is not strictly enforced and there are about 500.
The most unusual sight in the monastery is the 50-foot-long carving made of yak butter. The workmanship may not be at the level of the Parthenon frieze, but there are elephants, flowers and religious figures, all in brightly colored deep relief. The carving is newly-sculptured each year.
XINING itself is of limited interest: a traditionally Chinese city of cement blocks whose hues are all shades of gray. The only important sight within the city is the Dongguan Mosque, which was built in the 14th century and is one of the largest mosques in China. The entrance arch is elegant and the plaza-like open space inside is picturesque. There is a large Muslim community in Xining -- the province was even ruled by a Muslim warlord immediately prior to the Communist revolution in 1949 -- and the mosque fills to capacity on Fridays for prayers.
Few people in Qinghai speak English, but if you have an evening free you might wander over to the English Corner on Sheng Li Road. This is where Chinese men and women gather, particularly on Sundays, to speak English to each other in a caliber ranging from a few words to fluency, and a genuine American is richly prized and quickly surrounded.
The best part about Qinghai is the Tibetan areas, and in general any road south or west will take you to Tibetan villages. The current Dalai Lama's native village, Takster, meaning Roaring Tiger, is apparently only about an hour or two by car from Xining, but the authorities told me that the area was closed to foreigners and refused to allow me to visit. Other foreigners have gone with impunity, however, and one may well be able to make arrangements with a taxi driver for a day trip. Foreign tourists who are caught in closed areas and who act surprised, innocent and apologetic are normally scolded and sent away. Occasionally a fine is negotiated, but normally there is no punishment.
One Tibetan area that is often recommended to tourists is Qinghai Lake, an immense body of water that is China's largest salt-water lake. Bird Island in the lake is supposed to be particularly beautiful and full of migratory birds in April and May. I didn't visit Bird Island, but I found Qinghai Lake itself about as interesting as one would expect a big salt lake to be.
THE highlight of my visit was simply a few days roaming the Tibetan villages around Qiapuqia, a town of about 30,000 in Gonghe County south of Qinghai Lake. Most of the townspeople are Han Chinese, but many of the nearby villages are Tibetan and the people are extremely welcoming.
"Uncle, are you a foreigner?" asked an eight-year-old girl who was startled to encounter me on a dirt path near her village. I explained in Chinese that I was a genuine foreigner. Since I was the first one she had ever seen, she led me to her home. Her family was enormously excited at my arrival, and pressed tea and bread on me, but the town was sufficiently remote that all they knew was that I was not Tibetan.
"Are you Han Chinese?" the grandmother asked me, after peering for several minutes at my face, which does not look in the least Chinese. I explained that no, I was an American. She nodded sagely, to show that she had heard of Americans, but I'm not sure she distinguished in her mind between Americans and Martians.
The best way to make friends in such areas -- in any Chinese village for that matter -- is to take a Polaroid camera. Few peasants own a camera, and if you can take some instant photographs and pass them around, the entire village will cluster around and observe in amazement, and peasants will compete to invite you into their homes. Of course, none of the villagers speak English, but sign language can be quite eloquent when necessary. If a non-Chinese speaker gets somewhere where sign language is insufficient, someone will get the school's English teacher to translate.
About 10 miles from Qiapuqia is the Xinsi, a Tibetan monastery that gets only a few foreign travelers a year. The path is not quite wide enough for a car, but it makes a nice all-day hike, or else you may be able to get a lift on a motorcycle.
There are about 100 monks at the monastery, ranging from 7 years old to the late 70's. The setting is spectacular: snowy mountains in the background, and an abyss and valley in the foreground. It really does seem to be the end of the world. The monks speak no English, and not much Chinese, but they were eager to show me around the many temples as well as the kitchens and living quarters. There are several courtyards and temples with large carved Buddhas. Each of the temples is surrounded by the familiar red prayer wheels.
I hiked back to Qiapuqia from the monastery in about six hours, stopping to talk to Tibetan villagers on the way, and found it an exhilarating walk. But one word of caution: the local police were aghast at my activities, because I was a journalist (as I had told everyone I had talked to), and later sent policemen to retrace my steps and interrogate everyone I had chatted with.
This was probably a special case that wouldn't affect an ordinary tourist, but it is a reminder that this is a sensitive region. The worst that can realistically happen to you is that you'll be fined and expelled, but it is possible to get local Tibetans in deep trouble if the authorities believe they are engaging in pro-independence activities. So avoid meeting in places like your hotel -- where local people may be questioned about why they are talking to a foreigner -- and be discreet in your conversations with Tibetans.
 
 
 
A REMOTE, LITTLE-VISITED AREA
Getting There
 Air China has flights every Friday from Beijing to Xining and back, all seats economy class, for $133 each way. First class trains are also available, but the journey takes 44 hours from Beijing. If flights are full, it is possible to fly to Lanzhou, and take a train, bus or taxi for the half-day ride to Xining.
It is possible to travel from Qinghai to Tibet, by bus or by hitching rides on trucks, but this is technically illegal unless you have a permit to enter Tibet. In fact, youthful Westerners do this regularly, and despite occasional crackdowns the authorities seem to tolerate it most of the time. The trip, by bus or truck, takes a minimum of three days from Xining to Lhasa.
Even in the summer, Qinghai can be chilly because of the elevation -- Qiapuqia, for example, is more than 9,000 feet above sea level. But if you forget warm clothes, yak wool sweaters are available for about $25 in Xining. Winters are cold but tolerable, with temperatures below freezing but little snow.
 
Accommodations
 The best hotel in Xining is the Qinghai Guesthouse, $32 a day for a double, and it is reasonably good, with a working bath in the slightly musty rooms, a television, and fair restaurants. Phone (971) 44-888. Wang Bingxi of the Qinghai Tourism Bureau, 42-721, can arrange to have you picked up at the airport for a fee. The second best hotel in Xining is the Xining Guesthouse, $15 a night for two, 215 Qiyi Road, phone 42-701.
A taxi to Kumbum Monastery costs about $9 round trip, including a wait of up to three hours at the site. The entrance fee at the monastery is $1.50, including a guide, or $1 without.
 
Excursions
 Mr. Wang of the tourism bureau can arrange tours of various sites including Qinghai Lake and Gonghe County. A two- or three-day car trip taking in Gonghe County and coming back by Qinghai Lake would cost a bit less than $200 for the vehicle, if arranged through him. A taxi could probably be negotiated for significantly less, and the uncomfortable bus that runs daily to Gonghe costs about $1.
In Qiapuqia, the best place to stay is the Gonghe County Communist Party Committee Guesthouse, which is perfectly tolerable, with private rooms with baths, but no telephones, and costs just $6 a night. Phone is 2773. The guesthouse restaurant offers local meals, such as tsampa -- roast barley flour kneaded into dough. Most restaurants in Qinghai are run by Han Chinese or Hui Muslims, and food tends to be spicy, somewhat like Sichuan food. Restaurants are mostly small, somewhat dirty, not particularly good and incredibly cheap.

HEADLINE: Insurance Plan Worries Beach Residents

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
LAST October, the raging winds and high tides of a sudden storm washed out homes in dozens of communities along the Atlantic coast. It was yet another reminder for shorefront homeowners of the fragility of their claim to the beach.
"We were lucky," said Andy Rudtke, sitting on the deck of his home in Davis Park, a Fire Island community where the Halloween storm swept away three houses. "In the 30 years that we have been here, we have seen some damage. We had our roof blown off. We lost our deck in a winter blizzard. There is no escaping the part that chance plays when it comes to the forces of nature. It can be frightening." 
 As fearful of hazardous weather as most of the summer residents of Davis Park and other shore communities are, on the horizon is a threat potentially more damaging than a hurricane. A measure now before Congress would restrict the availability of Federal flood insurance on beachfront properties vulnerable to erosion and flooding, raising the financial risks of a washout. The proposal, part of a housing bill, passed the House last year and is now being considered by the Senate.
Even without the threat of the loss of the Federal flood insurance, beachfront ownership is a bittersweet mixture of rewards, risks and expenses. Bank financing for waterfront property is difficult to find and insurance rarely covers all the costs of repairs or rebuilding after flood and storm damage. Some Long Island owners have seen not only their houses but also the dune lots on which they were built washed out to sea.
Yet the waterfront's appeal endures. On Fire Island, a 32-mile barrier reef off the South Shore of Long Island, there are 17 communities with 4,000 beach homes. Most of the development has occurred since World War II, and the houses that dot the scrub landscape range from cheaply built one-room cottages to highly styled multilevel dune residences.
"The availability of Federal flood insurance is not what leads people to own beach houses," said Henry Schwier, a real estate broker who specializes in properties on the Jersey Shore. "As long as there are beaches, people will want to live there."
The bill before the Senate has many components, including stricter building and rebuilding codes. But the piece of greatest concern to owners of beach homes is the part that would significantly change the Federal Flood Insurance Program.
THE insurance is now available to nearly every owner in flood hazard zones like beach communities. The policies provide coverage of up to $245,000 of the insured value -- $185,000 for the structure and $60,000 for contents. Premiums are based on property values and whether the house was built before or after local flood-level maps were drawn. The average cost for an older home is about $300 a year, but newer properties cost closer to $900.
Mr. Schwier, for example, says he pays about $600 a year for covering a waterfront property he owns valued at about $150,000.
The cost of flood insurance for properties closest to the water could rise as high as 10 percent of the value of a home, if it had to be insured privately.
The proposed legislation has given some who are in the market reason to pause.
"It seems to me that if flood insurance were not available," said Anthony Grella, who is looking for a summer home on the Jersey Shore, "the value of a property would be lower. We are still in the market but I will be paying attention to the insurance issue."
Alan Brockman, a lawyer who has represented sellers and buyers in beachfront sales on Long Island, said the loss of Federal insurance would affect more than new buyers.
"Some owners could lose their mortgages," he said. "The loss of flood insurance could be interpreted as a violation of the terms of the mortgage agreement."
Even with the Federal program in place, lenders are cautious about waterfront homes; although many make loans for second homes on easy terms, they have stiffer qualifications for beach properties.
"The theory of mortgage lending is based on a hierarchy of debt and the level of risk," said John A. Ward 3d, president of the Chase Manhattan Financial Services Corporation, a national mortgage company. "Most people would do anything to protect their primary home. But when personal finances are in trouble, the payment on the second home sometimes is the first to go. For loans made on waterfront properties, there is an added risk based on location."
He said his company requires borrowers buying beachfront properties to make higher down payments than on primary residences of equal value. And they must have the financial resources to cover any loss.
"That can be a personal financial capability to cover the loss," he said, "or substantial insurance coverage that goes beyond flood protection offered by the Federal program." Even if a loan applicant meets the financial requirements, Mr. Ward said, the loan could be rejected.
"The other factor that would come into play on a beachfront property would involve the concentration of risk," said Mr. Ward. "We would not lend to a strip of beachfront homes. The chance that all could be lost at one time would be too great."
Louis Pennachio, owner of a home on Fire Island since the early 70's and president of the Davis Park Association, said that in his community, the most vulnerable to the loss of Federal flood insurance could be people who bought 30 years ago or more, when some lots first sold for $3,000 and $4,000.
"Some homes here are now valued in the $200,000 to $300,000 range," he said. "Some people who have been here a long time are concerned because property values have risen to the point where rebuilding or repairing after weather damage might not be possible without insurance."
One of Mr. Pennachio's neighbors, whose home was washed away last October, is close to completing its replacement. It is rising on a part of the property just behind the house lost in the storm, at a higher level.
The builder working on the project last week declined to give the cost of the new two-story house but he acknowledged that it would be larger and sturdier. On the dune just below the new house are reminders of last fall's storm. There, twisted pieces of a wooden deck are embedded in the sand and the corner of a chimney pokes through it. And up and down the beach, staircases that last summer carried beachgoers over the dunes and down to the shore now end in midair.
EROSION damage threatens more than beachfront homes. Lawrence Kane, whose family owns a home on Long Island Sound in Wading River, L.I., has seen serious erosion of a seaside cliff bring their cottage closer to the water's edge. As a result the Kanes are learning that the costs of maintaining a waterfront home sometimes surpasses the original investment.
"My family bought here in the early 60's as a place that we all would share," he said. "The cottages were not expensive and are not fancy at all. They are not winterized, but we sit on a beach cliff with a fantastic view of the Sound."
Two years ago the Kanes invested $5,000 to restore an eroding portion of the cliff abutting their cottage, only to see the Halloween storm chew away the restored area and more.
"The restoration work we did in 1990 was totally obliterated by the storm," said Mr. Kane. "Instead of having a mildly sloped cliff, we now have a severe drop of some 10 or 15 feet and our cottage is now within 10 feet of the cliff."
Engineers have told him that a lasting remedy would be to reinforce the base of the entire cliff. The cost could be has high as $2,000 a linear foot. Because the Kane family cottage is on land that is owned as a co-op in which shareholders have joint ownership of about 25 acres, he is hoping to convince other owners that the cliff-repair project would benefit all. But Mr. Kane is not sure the inshore shareholders will agree to building up property in front of the shorefront cottages.
"As a community," he said, "we have been able to handle most of the common costs without many disagreements. But this is not a cheap project. I wonder if the people behind us will think that if we leave things as they are, the next big storm will take away even more of the cliff and make their homes waterfront property."
Waterfront property owners who strongly oppose the pending legislation assert that it is little more that a device of environmentalists to evict them from the beach. Proponents of the bill say the Federal treasury should not subsidize, through inexpensive flood insurance, the repair and reconstruction of homes in erosion hazard zones, which by their very existence are a threat to the nation's fragile shoreline.
But without the insurance subsidy, many shorefront homeowners would have to give up their homes. Either they could not get private insurance or the premiumn would be prohibitively high.
Because the risk zones have not been identified in the bill, no one can say which areas or how many property owners would be affected. But some shore communities in this region, including barrier islands like Fire Island on Long Island, which have emerged as summer resort areas, and Long Beach Island in Ocean County, N.J., are likely to be among them.
"I can understand an argument that asks, why should the public pay to protect the Whelans' home?," said Dr. Elizabeth Whelan, who recently renovated the Long Beach Island home with her husband, Stephen. "But the motivation behind the legislation is not financial fairness. It is being used to get people off the beach."
Any owner insured under the Federal flood program who loses more than 50 percent of his home can qualify for the insurance only if the reconstruction occurs above the flood level.
Currently, owners of beachfront properties built before flood level construction standards were set pay 55 cents for every $100 of coverage up to $45,000 of value, and 45 cents for every $100 of coverage beyond that.
The owners of beachfront homes built above the flood level for their areas pay 93 cents for every $100 of coverage. The rates drop by nearly half for coverage of homes built two feet above the minimum flood level requirements.
Since the initiative made its way into a housing bill last year, homeowners and real estate professionals have rushed to mount an aggressive lobbying campaign to block its passage in the Senate. One argument they make is that the threat of repeated damaging storms as well as the cost of protecting their homes against them has been overestimated.
GERARD STODDARD, president of the Long Island Coastal Alliance, said that the insurance program is not really a subsidy. "The flood insurance agency's own statistics say that coastal properties represent about 3 percent of the policyholders and make up less than 3 percent of the claims," he said.
Another argument they make is that rather than being a destructive force, beachfront homeowners in some areas, like the Fire Island communities, are guardians of the beaches and dunes there.
"It has been the painstaking buildup of the dunes with sand-holding plants over the years that has kept erosion from being as great as it could have been," said Mr. Stoddard. "Without plantings and snow fences, more of the beach and dunes probably would have washed away."
Fair Harbor, on Fire Island, is one of the communities has has imposed a local tax to pay for such preservation measures as snow fencing, dune-grass planting and beach raking.
Another issue some owners use to defend their presence on the beach is their economic contribution. Frank Jones, supervisor of the Town of Islip, which has within its jurisdiction more summer communities than any other towns on Long Island. Mr. Jones said that together they contribute about $8.5 million a year to Islip's tax base.
"The Fire Island communities pay their way," said Mr. Jones. "But their taxes are not a windfall for us."
Mr. Jones said that a significant portion of the property taxes paid by Fire Island owners goes to service their communities. The town is responsible for the boardwalks, which take the place of streets, and for the sewer and water systems.
"As far as impact on the economy," he said, "if these communities were to disappear it would hurt businesses that depend on the summer owners, like the ferry or restaurants. But Islip's economy would not be severely damaged."
"There is no doubt that the owners are very responsible," Mr. Jones added. "They really do their part to protect the beach and the dunes. But there is an aspect of self- preservation to all of it. If the dunes go, they go."
 
 
 
THE PROPOSAL'S RESTRICTIONS
 IF the National Flood Insurance, Mitigation and Erosion Management proposal becomes law, new construction standards and insurance rules would be adopted for communities in the Federal flood insurance program. For waterfront areas, three different erosion zones would be identified, taking into account the rates of erosion in 10, 30 and 60 years.
In areas most vulnerable to erosion -- the 10-year zone -- owners of existing properties would be required either to demolish their buildings or relocate within two years. If they relocate, they may qualify for continued Federal flood insurance benefits up to a maximum of $245,000 in coverage for building and contents. If they don't relocate, they are entitled to no more than 40 percent of the insured value of their properties on the first claim. After that, the owner could get no Federal benefits.
In 30- and 60-year zones, there would be limits on new construction and substantial improvements on existing buildings, but owners would not be required to demolish or relocate.
In New York, the Coastal Erosion Hazzard Areas Management Program limits reconstruction of waterfront properties in erosion zones that suffer more than 50 percent storm damage. Owners can be required to rebuild inland or prevented from rebuilding at all. The law is in effect in most areas, but not yet on Fire Island.
In New Jersey, most storm damaged homes can be rebuilt without restrictions. But larger structures, like hotels, are subject to laws restricting redevelopment in erosion zones.
In Connecticut the Coastal Management Act imposes rigid standards on the construction and rebuilding of structures in areas subject to erosion.

 BODY:

Using an Air-Conditioner
 
Question: I live in a rental apartment in a building converted to a co-op. I am 82 and do not plan to buy my apartment. The building has central air-conditioning but there are times before it is turned on in the spring and after it is turned off in the fall, or when it is not working, when my apartment is hot. 
 I would like to buy and install my own window unit, but the building's management has refused to let me do it. Do they have the right of refusal? . . . Gertrude Goldsmith, Jamaica, Queens
 
Answer: Maybe. It would depend on the terms of your lease and whether your apartment is adequately wired.
According to Joseph D'Agosta, acting deputy director for the office of rent administration, if your lease does not specifically prohibit it and the wiring is adequate, they cannot prevent it. Mr. D'Agosta said that if the air-conditioning system has been provided for rent-regulated tenants, the system must meet certain standards, including that coils be 58 degrees or lower. If your system does not meet this standard, you may want to file a reduction-in-services complaint with the Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
If your apartment is adequately wired for an air-conditioner, there should be at least one branch circuit outlet in the apartment. A standard electrical socket would not accommodate a plug-in air-conditioner. The code requires that the outlet serve just the air-conditioner. The problem is that in some centrally air-conditioned buildings, these outlets may be omitted.
 
Noisy Neighbors
 
Question: I purchased a co-op apartment a few years ago. After moving in, I discovered that the people who live above me are noisy. Their footsteps start becoming audible at 6:30 A.M. In the last 18 month the noise level has risen. Polite notes to them and the building's management agent have not helped. My letters to the co-op board have been ignored.
Our proprietary lease says that 80 percent of the floor area is to be carpeted. The noise upstairs has cost me the enjoyment of my apartment and deprived me of sleep. Is there anything I can do? . . . Karen Hochman, Manhattan
 
Answer: Yes. You can file a suit against the board seeking enforcement of the terms of the proprietary lease. Enforcing rules on noise is among the most difficult matters for boards and managing agents. But since the carpet rule is part of the co-op's documents, you have the right to see that it is observed.
Before taking legal action, you might ask a member of the board or management company to spend time in your apartment so that they can appreciate the disturbance. If you proceed with the suit, notify your board, in writing, of your intention.
 
Parking Fee in Co-op
 
Question: My co-op has a small parking garage for owners. There has been some dissension over the fees and how they could be used to generate income for the co-op. Are there legal or other guidelines a co-op board should follow in setting fees? . . . Ellen Stern, Manhattan
 
Answer: The board would have the right to decide what to charge unit owners who have parking or garage spaces in the building. But according to Philip Sharfstein, an lawyer who specializes in real estate matters, the fees may be subject to regulated increases established by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
"If the spaces were a required service for rent- regulated tenants," said Mr. Sharfstein, "any parking fee paid by them would be subject to regulated increases just as regulated apartment rents are."
However, tenants who purchased their apartments would no longer be subject to fee limits once they became owners.
The Internal Revenue Code requires that 80 percent of a co-op's gross income be derived from tenant-shareholders in order for them to deduct real estate taxes and mortgage interest rates paid by the co-op.
"But amounts received from tenant shareholders are considered part of that gross income," said Mr. Sharfstein. "Therefore the corporation would not be limited in the amount it may charge them."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: Model Tenements;
Far West on 42d St., A 1901 Innovation

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
SOME buildings, like the block of model tenements on the East River from 78th to 79th Streets that Peter Kalikow wanted to demolish, attract the fervid attention of preservationists.
In their efforts to save the complex they held walking tours and news conferences and won celebrity endorsements and landmark designation. 
 Others, like the model tenements at the southwest corner of 42d Street and 10th Avenue, just barely hang together, ignored by landmark activists. If they got some attention, they, too, might be saved, although a complex of conflicting interests stands in the way.
The movement for model tenements matured in the 1890's after decades of proposed reforms failed to change the way most poor people were housed.
In 1894, Ernest Flagg, a young, socially connected architect, published a plan proposing a switch to 100-foot front modules -- rather than the prevailing 25-foot front -- substituting large, central lighted courts for small, individual ventilation spaces.
A group of philanthropists established the City and Suburban Homes Company in 1896 to build model tenements and selected Flagg to design a series on West 68th Street, since demolished.
Flagg was a prickly, contentious egotist and City and Suburban retained other architects for their later projects, like the Kalikow complex, while still using Flagg's concept. So Flagg founded the New York Fireproof Tenement Company and in 1899 filed plans for 11 buildings, with 1,519 rooms for 470 families in a complex at the southwest corner of 42d Street and 10th Avenue.
He completed them in 1901, while City and Suburban was still struggling with its decade-long projects. The exteriors are intelligent but modest, salmon-colored brick with plain marble lintels and simple limestone doorways -- the antithesis of the showy glitz that private tenement developers paid for.
Each 100- by 100-foot unit embraced a large square central light court and had windowed stairways at each of the four corners. Four firewalls broke up the complex into compact cores of apartments without long hallways, anathema to Flagg.
These were the first fireproof tenements in New York, with a structure of steel and concrete instead of the conventional, less expensive wood joists.
Flagg's tenants were hardly the unwashed tenement dwellers of the lower East Side -- the 1905 census lists almost all of them as being born in the United States or England and with solid working-class jobs, with only a few laborers and factory workers. In a 1906 article, Flagg claimed the tenements brought in a 6 percent return.
Flagg and other tenement reformers failed to persuade private tenement developers to adopt their schemes. When the 25-foot module was effectively outlawed in 1901 by the Tenement House Law, private builders still clung to the minimum economic lot frontage, 40 or 50 feet, even when building on multiple lots.
Parts of Flagg's complex were torn down in 1935 but the four corner buildings have survived, owned by Flagg's heirs until 1971, when they were full of rent-paying tenants.
NOW the two buildings at the corner are closed, and 502 West 42d Street is half empty. Only 506 West 42d Street is full of tenants.
According to Fred Papert, director of the private, nonprofit 42d Street Redevelopment Inc., a succession of developers seeking to rebuild the site have harassed tenants to vacate the structures.
In 1991, the First New York Bank for Business took the buildings back in foreclosure. But the current owner can receive no rent until the harassment findings are cleared, to which all tenants must agree.
There are four tenant groups in the two occupied buildings, mired in bitter disputes about inside dealing, buyouts, services and other issues. Meanwhile, the buildings are slowly sagging into a gritty decay.
While most New Yorkers see the revival of far west 42d Street with theaters and apartments as a good thing, some of the tenants do not. Lawrence Flower, vice president of one of the tenant groups, says that the revival only makes the property look more attractive for demolition and redevelopment.
Ken Schechter, managing agent for the bank, calls the situation "a big mess" of competing interests that he has been unable to resolve. "This is a reason to give up on the city," he said.
On the one hand the remaining tenants have effectively preserved their buildings -- vacant structures would have been demolished long ago. But forces beyond their control divide them and this favors further decline rather than improvement.
"We don't know what will happen," said Mr. Flower. "I can beat the meanest landlord in the city but I can't deal with these tenants."

HEADLINE: Representatives Clash on Redistricting

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
Unaccustomed pawns in the game of redistricting, frenzied members of Congress from New York have been maneuvering with obvious desperation for the slightest advantage, provoking a series of barely concealed clashes within the delegation.
In one of the latest squabbles, the quintessential Brooklyn schmoozer, Representative Charles E. Schumer, squared off against Representative Jose E. Serrano, the Bronx reformer, who surprised his colleagues by supporting a redistricting plan inimical to incumbents. 
 The two Democrats declined to discuss the confrontation. But members of the delegation swear by the showdown. They say Representative Schumer was infuriated last month by Representative Serrano's written support of a Federal court redistricting plan to create three predominantly Hispanic districts.
"I hear you really did us," Mr. Schumer is said to have complained to Mr. Serrano, the Puerto Rican native who had been counted among supporters of a state court redistricting plan, which is more generous to incumbents. "You're making it very difficult for me to go and get you that seat on appropriations."
Delegation members point to the incident as an illustration of the explosive passions and unbridled power plays provoked by the continuing battle over redistricting. Since it will play a major role in determining which incumbents survive, redistricting has come to dominate the lives, conversations and meetings of New York representatives.
 
Careers at Stake
 "Two members from the delegation can't talk to each other without attracting a crowd," said Gary L. Ackerman, the Queens Democrat who may have to run against another veteran incumbent, James H. Scheuer. "It's like a super magnet: the more iron filings you get, the more powerful the attraction. You start talking and it attracts others. Everybody knows what you're talking about and wants to join. It's sort of a cordial paranoia."
But it has not always been so polite, many members of the delegation acknowledge in private. With careers and dreams at stake, the drawn-out tension has rubbed nerves raw. "This process makes Chinese water torture look like a quick and painless extraction of a tooth with Novocain," said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the veteran Brooklyn Democrat. "It just keeps going on and on and on."
Although the election is approaching, the end is not yet in sight. Earlier this month, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signed a redistricting plan passed by the State Legislature. But he forwarded it with a recommendation that it be reworked to the Justice Department, which must review the lines to insure they comply with the 1965 Voting Rights Act by giving adequate representation to minorities. The Federal plan remains in limbo until the Justice Department makes a decision.
The Governor's move has led tempers to flare. Publicly, the delegation has sought to present an image of camaraderie and shared suffering. But behind the closed doors of delegation meetings, members say, longtime friends have found themselves at each other's throats. "There are a lot of cruel things happening," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Harlem Democrat, who declined to go into details. "All the warts are showing. Friends today, adversaries tomorrow."
 
Pre-emptive Attacks
 Once or twice, the battles have become public. The most notorious is the skirmish between Mr. Ackerman and Mr. Scheuer. Their behind-the-scene feud broke into the open recently when Roll Call, a newspaper on Capitol Hill, suggested that Mr. Ackerman leaked the names of the main culprits in the House check-cashing scandal. In a pre-emptive fax attack, Mr. Scheuer, who was on the list, distributed the story to New York reporters. Mr. Ackerman denied the charge. And his staff retaliated by calling attention to an article in The Washington Times that noted that Mr. Scheuer was one of four Representatives to take their spouses to the Earth Summit in Brazil at taxpayer expense.
Delegation members, at least, gave Mr. Scheuer the call. "Ackerman's hurt himself very badly," said one New York City congressman. "Despite his denial, his fingerprints are all over the thing."
Feelings are particularly charged because many Representatives, who are accustomed to wielding power and who have donated tens of thousands of dollars to state legislators, now find themselves with little influence over the outcome. "It's very difficult, humbling to go into a new area" Mr. Rangel said.
Members of the delegation say the infighting can only become more bitter as the election approaches and members condemned to share a district are forced to begin campaigning against one another. "You're going to see a bloodbath," said one delegation member, who noted that some of the state's most powerful incumbents appear almost certain to end up in the same districts. "We haven't seen the worst of it yet by any means."
The skirmishing may not end with the election. Mr. Ackerman says the battles are not only the epilogue to national population shifts, but also a preview of the competition likely to dominate New York City politics as the fastest-growing minority groups, Hispanic people and Asians, seek to assert themselves. That, he predicts, will provoke confrontations with blacks, the city's dominant minority.
"Blacks were the protected class," he said. "Now, it's almost like move over boys, there's a new minority in town."
That is disputed by other delegation members. Mr. Rangel notes that redistricting is always contentious and predicts that the delegation, especially its minority members, will coalesce after the election. But for the moment, probably the only unifying threat is anger at the state Legislature. New York representatives complain that state lawmakers put too little emphasis on seniority and did not do enough to protect incumbents. That has been a major factor in convincing several Congressmen to retire.
 
Congressional Casualties
 Frank Horton, the dean of the delegation, two weeks ago interrupted a meeting of New York representatives to order them all to run for re-election. "We can't afford to lose anyone," said the Rochester Republican, the ranking minority on the Government Operations Committee. "I want to see everyone of you back."
The next week, Representative Raymond J. McGrath, the ranking New York Republican on the powerful Ways and Means Committee, announced he was retiring. Then David O'B. Martin of Canton, a veteran Republican who has used his seat on the Armed Services Committee to grab large slices of the Federal financial pie for his economically distressed district, said he would not return.
Finally, Mr. Horton gave up. Citing redistricting, which seemed likely to force him into a re-election battle against a longtime friend, Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a Democrat, the 72-year-old Republican announced he would become the sixth member of the delegation to retire at the end of this term.
 Yet the article acknowledged that both men had declined to discuss the conversation with a reporter. It implied that other New York Congressmen had done so, but it failed to make clear that they were the source of the direct quotation. Such a second-hand version should not have been placed in quotation marks; if paraphrased, it should have been described as an account from other Congressmen.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 25, 1992, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about Congressional redistricting depicted anxiety among members of New York State's Congressional delegation afraid of losing their seats. As an illustration, the article reported a squabble between two Democratic Representatives, Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn and Jose E. Serrano of the Bronx, who had supported competing plans for redistricting.
The article reported that Mr. Schumer was "said to have complained" to Mr. Serrano: "I hear you really did us. You're making it very difficult for me to go and get you that seat on appropriations."

HEADLINE: Mayors in Both Parties Voice Frustration

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 20

 BODY:
As the United States Conference of Mayors gathers here for its annual meeting, both Republicans and Democrats are voicing frustration with what they see as the Federal Government's inability to act on even the most pressing matters. But some hope that the need to gather support in a three-way Presidential race may help break the gridlock.
At a news conference to open the meeting on Friday, the organization's vice president, Mayor William J. Althaus of York, Pa., said the $1.3 billion urban aid bill passed by both houses of Congress on Thursday was "a fine down payment." But he added, "Until last night, seven weeks after the riots in Los Angeles, the Federal Government at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue had enacted nothing." 
 Mr. Althaus, a Republican, also criticized the Presidential campaign. "We have people shouting at each other," he said. "People criticizing TV characters. People criticizing rap singers. Everybody is criticizing somebody, and we're not getting anything done."
Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, a Democrat who is president of the mayor's conference, had to leave Houston on Friday to deal with a disturbance that erupted during a concert at Boston's City Hall Plaza the night before. But in prepared remarks that he left behind he bemoaned the "politics of paralysis" in Washington.
 
'Bread-and-Butter Issues'
 "There always seems to be some diversion," Mr. Flynn said, "a short-lived economic upturn, a fraudulent 'balanced budget' proposal or some visiting dignitary that keeps the President and Congress from dealing with basic, bread-and-butter issues for the American people."
The conference is a nonpartisan organization whose members represent cities with populations of at least 30,000. During its 60-year history it has become a major voice in Washington for the nation's cities.
The conference's six-day meeting here will become a focal point for the discussion of urban issues next week. On Monday, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the presumed Democratic Presidential nominee, as well as Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp will address the mayors. Both President Bush and Ross Perot, the undeclared independent Presidential candidate, declined invitations to address the conference, each citing schedule conflicts.
Also on the program are addresses by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, among others.
 
Inattention Is Criticized
 At the news conference on Friday, Mayor Bob Lanier of Houston was asked how Mr. Perot's candidacy might affect the cities' efforts to win attention. A land developer who was elected last year in a nonpartisan contest, Mr. Lanier said, "If I am selling shoes, I'd rather have three people out there wanting my shoes than just two."
While he said it would be logical to expect Presidential candidates to direct appeals at cities, Mr. Lanier expressed some exasperation that this had not occurred even after the rioting in Los Angeles. "I suspect it is because they have not fully thought out their programs," he said. "It's not because they are so wonderful that they want to keep them secret for a while."
The mayors have specific proposals of their own and are raising questions about ideas that have gained prominence since the violence in California.
A major component in the conference's urban aid package is a call to increase spending on Community Development Block Grants from the $3.4 billion already appropriated for this year to $6 billion for the 1993 fiscal year. The figure is based on a survey in which 184 cities were asked how much of an increase they could spend on specific proposals within a year.
First enacted by the Nixon Administration, the block grants provide Federal aid for a wide variety of local activities like job programs, public works and drug abuse treatment. Much of the grants' appeal lies in their being tried and true.
 
Skepticism at New Program
 "It is a proven program," Mr. Althaus said, "one that works, one that is there. You do not have to create anything new."
Many mayors were skeptical of the Bush Administration's new "weed and seed" program, which would start with tough law-enforcement efforts to remove known criminals from inner-city neighborhoods and then turn to crime- and drug-prevention programs along with other services aimed at revitalizing the community.
The Administration has asked Congress for $500 million in the next budget for such programs, which would be administered by the Department of Justice.
At an appearance before a conference panel Friday, Timothy Shea, an associate deputy attorney general, was repeatedly asked how much of the $500 million would be taken from existing programs. After saying that "games can be played with the numbers," he said the new financing totaled $290 million.
Mayor Norman B. Rice of Seattle said later, "That leaves a lot of mayors wondering whether signing on to 'weed and seed' just means they'll loose funding for programs that already exist and are successful."
In addition, a resolution submitted to the conference by Mayors Paul Soglin of Madison, Wis., and Paul Helmke of Fort Wayne, Ind., raised other concerns about the new program. Their resolution calls for the law-enforcement and community-help segments of the program to take place simultaneously so that the program does not appear to be simply a police crackdown. The resolution also requests that mayors rather than Justice Department officials be responsible for developing the local programs.

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 20

 BODY:
Jin Lee was one Korean shopkeeper who tried to do everything right. He held barbecue parties for his black customers, sponsored a neighborhood basketball team, donated money to an anti-gang youth group and was active in a black-Korean church organization.
But when rioting swept the neighborhood where he owned a grocery store, his efforts went for nothing. Like hundreds of other Korean shopkeepers, he lost his store to fire. 
 "We're not sure what we're going to do now," said Mr. Lee, whose family also lost five other small businesses in the inner city. "Financially and emotionally, we're not ready to go back. We are very frustrated and very angry, and also we are afraid."
 
Battered and Stunned
 Six weeks after the riot, in which some 2,500 Korean-owned enterprises were damaged or destroyed, the nation's largest Korean-American community is economically battered and emotionally stunned.
One after another, shopkeepers and community leaders said in interviews that they had been brought up short in their headlong pursuit of an American dream of success through hard work. They said they had learned a hard new lesson in stereotyping and political disenfranchisement.
"It has been a very rude awakening for many Korean-Americans," said Jerry Yu, executive director of the Korean American Coalition, a local advocacy group.
Abandoned by the overburdened police as their shops were looted and burned, many Korean shopkeepers now feel they are being forgotten by government leaders as they seek to recover from their losses.
Among other things, they are the prime victims of a new city ordinance aimed at limiting the number of liquor stores that reopen in South-Central Los Angeles, the area that was at the heart of the rioting.
 
'Lip Service'
 "Some of us thought we were participating in the political process in a way that was meaningful," said Angela Oh, president elect of the Korean American Bar Association of Southern California. "But when it came down to our hour of need, it became very clear that our participation and contributions were perhaps not very meaningful."
Korean merchants complain that government promises of immediate aid have not been honored and that Small Business Administration loans require documentation that most informally operated Korean businesses do not have. They also say they are unfairly stereotyped as successful, self-sufficient and politically irrelevant.
Local leaders say the mutual aid system in which Korean businesses support each other with group lending falls far short of the needs of a community that has suffered as much as $400 million in damage.
As Mr. Lee put it: "We are sick and tired of all this lip service. We want to see dollars in our hands. Our ears are happy but our stomachs are still empty."
 
'It's a War Zone'
 Like Mr. Lee, most Korean shopkeepers remain hesitant about reopening their businesses in the mostly black and Hispanic South-Central area that has come to rely on Koreans for its basic needs.
"Some are saying they would rather die than be back in South-Central," said Kyeyoung Park, an anthropologist at the University of California in Los Angeles. "It's a war zone there. Since 1990 about 25 Korean merchants have been shot by robbers."
But Ivan Light, the author of "Immigrant Entrepreneurs" (University of California Press, 1988), a study of Koreans in Los Angeles, noted that in the end, most shopkeepers would have little choice but to return.
Despite being stereotyped as prosperous, most of the shopkeepers are poor immigrants who work long hours and often remain in debt for years.
"There will be some pulling out," Mr. Light said, "but most of them don't have any options. That is their livelihood. If they walk away, they have to find a buyer, and who is going to buy their store now?"
About one-third of Korean businesses in the city are in the South-Central area, about one-third are in adjacent Koreatown, and one-third are scattered elsewhere, he said.
For the merchants who work in other areas, South-Central Los Angeles remains a fearsome place.
"I wouldn't do business in South-Central," said Mary Seo, who works in her father's auto parts emporium, California Auto Center, in Koreatown. "I've never even been there."
During the riot, with the police nowhere to be found, armed employees guarded her father's store and tossed back out several gasoline bombs that had come crashing through the windows.
 
Complaints About Rudeness
 Mrs. Seo said there was some validity to the stereotype of Korean merchants as brusque, a manner that draws frequent complaints from black customers.
"Some Koreans are rude," said Mrs. Seo, who is 27 years old and who came to the United States as a small child. "When I first went back to Korea I cringed, those people were so rude. Then I went to New York and I realized it's just like New York. It's really fast-paced and very loud."
But a Korean who works in the South-Central area, Neil Hun, said the stereotypes on both sides were false.
"It's just a matter of communication," said Mr. Hun, 23, who works at his uncle's gasoline station. "It's not prejudice, because I never have any problems."
The 1990 census showed that 145,000 people of Korean extraction lived in Los Angeles County, although local estimates put the number much higher. Nearly half of this population supports itself with small retail businesses.
 
Third of Businesses Affected
 By the community's own count, the rioting affected more than a third of the 6,000 Korean-owned businesses in the county. More than half of all businesses destroyed during two days of looting and arson were Korean-owned, Mr. Yu said.
Los Angeles, with its Korean newspapers, radio and television stations and restaurants, is the strongest magnet for the 20,000 Koreans who migrate to the United States each year.
But Mr. Yu said the intense publicity the riot received in Korea may have changed forever the rosy image of the United States and may slow the flow of immigration.
"People had these images of wide, tree-lined streets in mostly quiet neighborhoods, where most Americans are white," he said. "My parents live in Korea. They told me that like everyone around the world they saw the violence in Los Angeles, and they are wondering now, 'Well, do I want to go and live there?' "

HEADLINE: STATE DEPT. AIDE TO TESTIFY ON IRAQ

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
In a compromise with Congress, the Administration has decided to let a committee hear the testimony of a State Department official who warned his superiors in October 1989 of evidence that United States loan guarantees to Iraq had been diverted to weapons, including "nuclear related equipment."
The testimony by the official, Frank Lemay, a State Department legislative management officer, is a concession to the House Judiciary Committee made this week. The White House denied a committee request earlier in the week to allow the testimony of two Presidential aides: C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel, and Nicholas Rostow of the National Security Council. 
 The actions came as part of a debate over the Administration's Iraq policy, with critics asserting that American appeasement led to the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
Mr. Lemay's 1989 warning came at the same time as a directive by President Bush urging Government agencies to expand economic aid to Baghdad to help moderate Iraq's belligerent behavior. An additional $1 billion in loan guarantees to Iraq was authorized the following month, of which $500 million was committed before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
 
'Nuclear Fuel Compounder'
 The committee has scheduled a hearing Tuesday to consider whether to request an independent prosecutor to investigate the Government's policy toward Iraq before the gulf war, and subsequent allegations of a cover-up by Government officials.
Mr. Lemay is the author of an October 1989 "memorandum of conversation" of a meeting between officials of the State and Agriculture Departments concerning $2 billion in loan guarantees to Iraq made by the Commodity Credit Corporation.
Mr. Lemay, then a Special Assistant to the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, wrote that "although additional research needs to be done, it appears more and more likely that C.C.C. guaranteed funds and/or commodities may have been diverted from Iraq to third parties in exchange for military hardware."
Mr. Lemay said that "there was some indication that diverted funds and possibly direct bank lent funds were used to procure nuclear related equipment." In particular, the memo noted a "nuclear fuel compounder."
 
Officials to Testify
 Mr. Lemay's memorandum also noted "more and more indications of significant wrongdoing" on the part of the Atlanta Branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, which made $5 billion in illegal loans to Iraq, much of it backed by loan guarantees by the C.C.C. and the Export-Import Bank.
He said that Agriculture Department officials had said an investigation could "blow the roof off the C.C.C." He concluded the memo by saying that "If smoke indicates fire, we may be facing a four-alarm blast in the near future."
Some Administration officials have challenged Mr. Lemay's version of the meeting, saying it bore little resemblance to what was actually said. That raises the question of why the Administration would want him to testify.
In addition to Mr. Lemay, the Administration has also agreed to allow the Judiciary Committee to hear the testimony of Frank DeGeorge, the Commerce Department's Inspector General, who has acknowledged that the agency altered the documents it gave to a Government Operations subcommittee investigating the C.C.C. loan guarantees.
The Administration has also agreed to allow the testimony of two officials not specifically requested by the committee: Robert S. Mueller 3d, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the criminal division, and Laurence Urgenson, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in charge of the fraud division. They will dispute assertions by Representative Henry Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat and chairman of the Banking Committee, who has accused the Justice Department of delaying its investigation of the Atlanta bank.

HEADLINE: HAITI'S SPLIT SEEN AT A SWEARING-IN

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, June 20

 BODY:
His inaugural address was dedicated to the Haitian masses, but the new Prime Minister, Marc L. Bazin, spoke every word in French on Friday at the stifling official gathering of men in dark suits and perfumed women in white dresses.
The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, for his swearing-in early last year, had the presidential sash placed on his shoulders by a peasant woman. Throughout that day, the President, Haiti's first freely elected leader, gave his speeches in a proverb-laden Creole. 
 The choice of languages by the two men -- one the priest-President deposed in a military coup, the other, a conservative political rival appointed to replace him, is far more than a matter of style, political analysts say. Rather, they say, it is a vivid reflection of the explosive divide between rich and poor in this small country.
Partisans of Mr. Bazin -- 60 years old, a lawyer and a former World Bank official -- have long promoted him as a modern technocrat and political centrist who they say is uniquely suited to bridging the gap between a fanatical left and right in Haiti.
But for Father Aristide's supporters, concentrated among the 70 percent of the population that remains Creole-speaking, illiterate and desperately poor, such arguments ring hollow.
 
'Nobody Is Being Fooled'
 "We want Aristide, and Aristide is the only thing we will accept," said a Creole-speaking vendor of fruit drinks pushing his cart in a pulsing sun near the National Palace during the ceremonies inside. "Bazin is for the rich, and now they are playing games with us. But nobody is being fooled."
Except for a scruffy handful of people who waited outside during Mr. Bazin's inaugural ceremonies carrying posters praising the new leader, there was no enthusiasm for him in evidence anywhere among the poor in this city.
Among Haiti's tiny elite, the disdain for Father Aristide is just as palpable. Although Mr. Bazin, in one of his first announcements, declared his intention to restart negotiations for an internationally acceptable solution to the eight-month political crisis that began with a violent coup in September, few expect the new Prime Minister to work seriously toward Father Aristide's return.
"The secret is to make a proposal that Washington will see as reasonable and Aristide will be unable to accept," said a businessman who supports Mr. Bazin. "Let Aristide be President again, but President of the 10th Department. We don't want him here."
The 10th Department is the term Father Aristide used to describe the large number of Haitians living outside the country.
Although many wealthy Haitians express disdain for Father Aristide because of his fondness for provocative language that they believe often flirted with incitement to violence, many Haitian intellectuals say there is an overriding class element to their antipathy.
"The bourgeoisie here has been in decline for years," said Jean-Claude Bajeux, a Haitian human rights expert. "But those who remain cling to their privileges, and that was the origin of Aristide's difficulties."
Referring to Father Aristide's background as a poor, dark-skinned person raised in a tiny outlying town, Mr. Bajeux said, "The elites could not accept having someone who reminded them of their domestic staffs governing them."
Although many doubt the chances of his success, wealthy Haitians who have never had anything to do with him before were already lining up behind Mr. Bazin in the days before his inauguration.
There was even talk among many on inauguration day of paying taxes to support the Bazin Government, something many wealthy people freely admit they have avoided in the past.
But regardless of what the new Prime Minister says in public, for many of these people, his mission must be to indefinitely forestall Father Aristide's return and somehow unlock an eight-month embargo that is beginning to inflict serious pain.

HEADLINE: Chance of a Rail Strike Grows as Talks Bog Down

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Railway officials and union leaders made little progress in negotiations yesterday, increasing the possibility of a Wednesday strike at Amtrak, Conrail and other rail lines around the nation.
Union officials argue that a strike at Conrail, which carries most of the freight in the Northeast and links up with most major railroads, would cause only limited disruptions. But Conrail officials and railway analysts say its impact would be felt within days at power utilities and factories throughout the United States. 
 "There is a risk of a nationwide strike," said Graeme Lidgerwood, who follows the rail industry for the First Boston Corporation.
But she pointed out that in past nationwide strikes Congress had been quick to intervene and that it would probably act again if the major union involved, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, walked out. The association represents 7,800 workers at 40 railroads.
It is less certain, she said, whether Congress would halt a strike by the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, which is negotiating separately on the contracts of 4,000 workers at the Consolidated Rail Corporation.
In a third set of negotiations, Amtrak, the nation's largest passenger railroad, faces the same strike deadline by six unions representing 7,900 workers. Besides halting service around the nation, the walkout would close Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan to commuters who use the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit and shut down the Shore Line East commuter line in Connecticut.
The primary issue in the talks are changes in work rules imposed by a special Presidential board on other unions after a nationwide railway walkout last year.
Labor relations in the railroad industry are governed by a set of procedures under the Railway Labor Act of 1926. In the current talks the parties have exhausted the options under the act, and the unions can legally strike.
 
Congress May Intervene
 Under the act, the President has the option of appointing an emergency board to investigate the dispute, as President Bush did before a nationwide walkout in April 1991. If a strike occurs and Congress believes it would severely disrupt the economy, it can intervene and impose a settlement.
Congress acted within 24 hours of the April walkout, imposing the recommendations of the Presidential Emergency Board. Since then, Conrail has won agreements with most of its unions under the pattern established by the board. The board enabled management to make major cuts in crews and provided other work rule changes that led to greater efficiency.
The unions in the current dispute, however, say such rule changes are unacceptable.
Jed Dodd, the general chairman of the maintenance workers' union, said that little progress had been made in the talks with Conrail. "It doesn't look good," he said in an interview from Washington, where the negotiations are taking place.
Mr. Dodd said that the union was seeking job security for its members. He said that Conrail had laid off 1,000 workers in the last four years and that it had sought to lay off 1,200 more through its proposed work rule changes.
The unions have also rejected the wage increases proposed by the emergency board. Mr. Dodd said his union was asking for a 3 percent wage increase and a formula to keep up with inflation. He said the increase would cost about $3 million a year.
Conrail officials say the union has asked for staffing that would double the work force, to 7,077. It says the wage increases sought by the unions would cost the railroad $103 million a year.
The maintenance union has argued that a strike against Conrail would be regional and has asked Congress not to intervene if its members walk out on Wednesday.
But Conrail, which handled about 16 percent of the industry's total freight in the week of June 6, has warned that utilities in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Delaware would be harmed by the halting of coal shipments.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Business View;
Executives Are Lending Perot an Ear

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
On a vacation cruise off Alaska this month with the chief executives of four other large companies, John W. Teets, the chairman of the Dial Corporation, found that one topic came up over and over: Ross Perot.
The conversations were a small but perhaps telling indication that if President Bush believes he can count on support from the corporate executive suite, a solid Republican redoubt if ever there was one, he may be in for a rude surprise. 
 "Perot's obviously a credible candidate, and in the circles I walk in, that's on everyone's mind today," said Mr. Teets, whose company based in Phoenix makes soap and other household products. Unhappy with the performance of the Bush Administration, Mr. Teets said he was nonetheless unsure whether he would vote for Mr. Perot. But he made clear that the Texas billionaire's candidacy has struck a chord with him.
"There has to be some change, some shock to the system to get us back on track," Mr. Teets said.
 
'Leadership and Change'
 Similar messages are emanating from corner offices and board rooms all over the country. More than a dozen interviews with top officers of companies in a variety of industries and locations turned up evidence that the nation's corporate leadership, like much of the rest of the populace, is unhappy with the notion of politics as usual and is willing to consider setting aside traditional political loyalties to take a long, hard look at Mr. Perot.
"I'm very pro-Perot because he says things with a clarity and straightforwardness that is refreshing and because he has a tremendous opportunity for leadership and change," said Michael D. Dingman, the chairman of the Henley Group, a conglomerate based in Hampton, N.H. "In the board rooms I've been in, there's increasing interest in him, even though a lot of people aren't ready to stand up and be counted."
Perceptions of Mr. Perot among business executives remain somewhat fuzzy. Corporate chiefs are looking specifically for more information about how he would reduce the Federal budget deficit, whether he would support reductions in the capital gains tax or extensions of investment tax credits and where he stands on other issues likely to affect business and the economy.
"He says some refreshing things, and he's focused in on a lot of the issues that businessmen and the public are both disturbed about," said F. Kenneth Iverson, the chairman of the Nucor Corporation, the steel company in Charlotte, N.C. "But before I would vote for him, I've got to know a lot more. I've got to know specifically what he's interested in doing."
 
Question About Patience
 Many of the executives said they liked the idea of a business executive as President and admired Mr. Perot's accomplishments in building two successful data-processing companies, Electronic Data Systems, which is now owned by the General Motors Corporation, and Perot Systems, which the Texas billionaire founded four years ago.
Frank Cruz, the chairman of the Gulf Atlantic Life Insurance Company, the nation's first Hispanic-owned life insurer, said he was particularly hopeful that Mr. Perot would put higher priority on freeing growing businesses from government regulation and making government an agent of economic growth rather than an impediment.
But as business managers, most of whom have encountered dictatorial bosses or are such bosses themselves, they said they also worry that Mr. Perot might not fully understand that as President he could no longer direct change and action in the same way he could as the autocratic head of a company.
"My question and concern is whether he has the willingness and patience to deal with the broad spectrum of values he'd have to deal with," said Dennis Gormley, the chairman of the Federal-Mogul Corporation, a maker of automotive parts in Southfield, Mich. "From what I've seen and read, I haven't seen that he has the willingness, desire or capability to deal with that diversity."
President Bush, moreover, still has many influential and vocal supporters in the corporate world who are taking the offensive against Mr. Perot. Lodwrick M. Cook, the chairman of ARCO, the oil company based in Los Angeles, said he was bothered that Mr. Perot had no real experience in foreign affairs, that Mr. Perot had been vague on where he stood on many issues and that Mr. Perot, as an outsider with no political affiliation, might find it difficult to deal with Congress and build a consensus for any action.
"Frankly, it concerns me that a political novice should seek the Presidency of the United States as his very first office," said Mr. Cook, a Republican fund-raiser and a friend of Mr. Bush.
 
Shock Treatment
 But many chief executives -- a group used to making decisions and taking action -- said Washington is in need of the shock-treatment approach that Mr. Perot's candidacy represents.
Indeed, to Mr. Perot's supporters in business, his main appeal seems to be his reputation for taking decisive action, even when it involves risk, and for bringing common sense to a public policy-making process that to them often seems disconnected from the real world.
"I don't know which guerrilla group he favors in Afghanistan, and I don't care," said Alan Greenberg, the chief executive of Bear, Stearns & Company, the brokerage and investment banking condcern. "He's a doer, he's very smart, and that's enough for me."
Some executives said they considered Mr. Perot's reputation as a man of action and accomplishment to be overblown. Several of them, including Mr. Gormley of Federal-Mogul, pointed to Mr. Perot's contentious and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to work for change within General Motors. Mr. Perot became a major G.M. shareholder when the automaker bought his Electronic Data Systems, but he later sold his stock back.
"One can say he should have had an impact on General Motors, and he did not have an impact in a positive way," Mr. Gormley said. "That either says he wasn't willing to spend the time and effort, or that he took the wrong approach or that he didn't have the capability. None of those bode well for a guy who's got to get a consensus when it comes to governing."
Surveys of corporate executives have found widely varying opinions about Mr. Perot. In a poll of chief executives of the nation's largest corporations last month, Fortune magazine found that 78 percent of those responding said they planned to vote for President Bush, with 11 percent supporting Mr. Perot and 4 percent saying they would vote for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the probable Democratic nominee. But the magazine reported that even many supporters of President Bush said they would vote for him with little enthusiasm.
Mr. Perot's standing appears to be much stronger among people who run medium-sized and smaller businesses. A nationwide survey last month of its members by the American Electronics Association, a trade group, found that 55 percent of the chief executives who responded supported Mr. Perot. The survey found that 29 percent supported Mr. Bush and that 4 percent supported Mr. Clinton.

HEADLINE: The Tallest Fence: Feelings on Race in a White Neighborhood

SERIES: 2 Neighborhoods, 2 Worlds/First of two articles.

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 20

 BODY:
In a kind of simulcast version of blue-collar America, the mechanics and postal workers of Chicago's Mount Greenwood and Roseland sections emerge each weekend to start the sprinklers and trim the junipers outside prim houses with picture windows.
The two are churchgoing, workaday neighborhoods made up of people who put in overtime to pay the bills, who curse drugs and dandelions with equal indignation and who dream of a better life and maybe even college for their children. 
 The chief difference between the two is that Mount Greenwood is white and Roseland is black. They are separated by two miles, a highway and fear and suspicion so deep that many people in one community would not dare set foot in the other.
Their worlds are set up so that the races rarely intersect, coming together only briefly in the white sections of town at public places like the mall or at work, where people may know little about each other beyond names and job descriptions.
 
How It Should Be?
 "It's fine for them to live in their neighborhoods and us to live in ours," said Peggy O'Connor, a Mount Greenwood waitress. "I guess that's the way it's supposed to be. We don't need to mix."
"Blacks live in their section and we live in ours, and that's O.K.," said Elaine Pomper, who owns Bob's Service, an automobile repair shop in Mount Greenwood.
The races are left to see each other through the distorted lens of segregation, and the perspective is further warped by the competition for a shrinking supply of blue-collar jobs. Particularly for whites, it seems, what they learn about the other race often comes from television news or stereotypes passed down through the generations.
In many ways, social scientists say, the two neighborhoods represent a society that is still two nations in one, 24 years after the Kerner Commission first made its diagnosis, and as dramatized this spring by the Los Angeles riots.
"This is a country in perpetual civil war," said Andrew Hacker, a professor of political science at Queens College and author of "Two Nations" (Macmillan, 1992). "Whites are saying: 'Look at what we did for you. You let the team down.' It is as if black Americans are on probation and have to prove themselves. Blacks are saying, 'Don't expect us to be grateful just because we can sit on the bus with you.' "
More than 100 residents in these two South Side communities, interviewed by reporters of their own race, bore out this scenario, forming a picture of divided worlds where race and discrimination are defining facts of daily life for blacks and somebody else's problem for whites.
 
Differences
Two Enclaves: Separate, Unequal
 As similar as the two neighborhoods seem, their differences are telling. The gap in their median household incomes widened significantly in the 1980's. Essentially a working-class area, Roseland embraces a much greater range of incomes, including real poverty. One insurer estimates that the same policy for the same car, a 1990 Ford Taurus, would cost $1,445 a year in Roseland but $958 in Mount Greenwood, presumably because the crime rate is so much higher in Roseland.
Mount Greenwood, with a population of 19,000, is an insular, "Leave It to Beaver" world where white people can live out entire lives without ever getting to know a black person, where people rarely venture beyond understood borders.
Roseland, with a population of 56,000, is hardscrabble and rough-edged, made up of black homeowners who watched their dreams of integration evaporate in the 1970's as white neighbors moved out to places like Mount Greenwood.
The very mention of race unlocked a torrent of painful accounts from blacks in Roseland, who told of lifelong attacks and indignities and who said they felt discrimination was in some ways worse now than it was 20 years ago.
"Wherever you go you see hatred," said Clemmie Raggs, a forklift operator who lives in Roseland. "You never know where racism is going to stick its head up."
Robert Scott, a Roseland resident who is a sewer maintenance worker, said: "The institutions, the media, the politicians -- the whole system keeps the races divided. We got the opportunity to move out to white areas, but they don't want us there."
Despite frequent negative experiences with whites, most Roseland residents said they would still welcome a person of the other race into their home and would like to live in an integrated neighborhood.
The same questions drew either blank looks or impassioned diatribes about welfare and affirmative action from most whites in Mount Greenwood. Many said they would not want a black to live next door. And while many described the few blacks they knew from work as decent, they still harbored an almost instinctive animosity toward black people in general.
 
Hints of Deeper Gulf
 Some Mount Greenwood residents were at first visibly uncomfortable with the topic of race. Some declined to discuss the matter.
Their reaction suggests an even greater schism, social scientists say. "Being white in America means never having to think about it," said Joe R. Feagin, a professor of sociology at the University of Florida, who has written extensively on race relations. "The racist world is the real world for us. It's the dominant culture, the way we look at things. For blacks, whiteness is oppression."
The 1980's were much kinder to Mount Greenwood than to Roseland. The two started the decade at about the same place, with Mount Greenwood's median household income then at $21,996 and Roseland's at $18,540.
But as manufacturing jobs waned nationwide and service jobs predominated, Mount Greenwood profited. Its median income nearly doubled to $40,226 in 1990, according to Census Bureau figures. Roseland's rose at about half that rate to $28,601. When inflation is taken into account, Roseland's families were in effect making $2,700 less a year in 1990 than they were in 1980. Mount Greenwood's families were making $5,097 more.
Black people are hurt and resentful over these disparities. "Go into any white neighborhood, and you'll see businesses and parks and playgrounds with swings in different colors," said Myshawn Davis, a hairdresser in Roseland. "It's like Disneyland."
The differences can perhaps best be seen along 111th Street, the commercial strip that runs through both communities, changing personality as it goes. It is gritty and weather-beaten in Roseland, one liquor store and rib shack after another. It is fresh-scrubbed in Mount Greenwood with its appliance centers, denture clinics, drapery stores and taverns with names like Molly McGillicuddy's.
What follows are the voices of white Mount Greenwood residents, explaining how they came to form their impressions of blacks. An article on Monday explores Roseland residents' views of whites.
 
Stereotypes
Myths That Foster Wish for Isolation
 It is places like Roseland that Mount Greenwood residents ran from in the 1960's. They have little patience for talk of discrimination. And many say it is fine by them if there are no blacks around.
"I don't mind them, but I don't want them living next to me," said Peggy O'Connor, a waitress and wife of a police officer. "I don't want to be too close to them. I think they've been whining too long, and I'm sick of it."
Like other Mount Greenwood residents, Mrs. O'Connor is rarely around black people to hear the "whining" personally or to see what the trouble might be. It infuriates her that "blacks buy porterhouse steaks with food stamps, while we eat hamburgers," she said. She said she had never actually seen any blacks do this. But she has heard and read stories, and that is enough.
Stories like that take on mythical proportions in a place like Mount Greenwood. Here there is great pride in the legends of forebears who came over from the old country.
"My grandparents, when they came here from Italy, didn't ask anyone to speak Italian for them," said Adeline Barrins, a homemaker who runs a small T-shirt business in Mount Greenwood. "They became American, and they never asked for anything."
Most whites said they saw nothing stopping blacks from doing the same thing. "They feel they worked hard for what they got," said Robert T. Carter, an associate professor of psychology at Columbia University Teachers College, who specializes in the study of white racial attitudes. "It's a disguised way of saying that blacks are not worthy."
Slavery, a painful topic for blacks, is a sensitive area in Mount Greenwood, too. It comes up in conversation often as whites say that past and even current discrimination is irrelevant. "It's up to them to paddle their own canoe," said Catherine Nielsen, a longtime resident. "Don't always think about the fact that they were slaves."
The racial fear and suspicion work both ways. But the paradox, interviews show, is that black people were fearful because much of their contact with white people was negative; whites were fearful because they had little or no contact. Across this divide, stereotypes become reality.
"It's either a stabbing or a shooting," Bernadette Quinn, a hardware store clerk in Mount Greenwood, said of blacks. "Those people don't talk to each other."
 
Assumptions Without Experience
 She has never spent much time around black people to know whether this is true. But she is as convinced of this as she is that the perennials will bloom next spring. The few blacks she knows are "lovely people," she said. But she is skeptical about the rest.
That is why she would not want to live next to any. "I'd be afraid they wouldn't keep up the property," she said. "Who's to say they wouldn't rob you, or what kind of people they'd bring around?"
The disadvantages for blacks of isolation and discrimination are well documented. What is less talked about, social scientists say, is the psychic toll that segregation can take on whites. "Whites have to use a tremendous amount of energy to maintain the distortion," Professor Carter said. "Time, energy and money are devoted to creating safe environments away from black people."
When blacks appear where they are not expected, it takes some whites here time to adjust. Several years ago, Mrs. Quinn's teen-age son had a party and invited a black girl.
"She was a lovely girl when we met her," Mrs. Quinn said. "But our first impression was, 'What is she doing in our house?' We were shocked. Our son said, 'Don't worry, she's a nice girl.' And she was. She is a lovely girl. She has been back a couple times now."
But those positive feelings do not transfer to black people in general. Each time she meets a black person, Mrs. Quinn must be convinced all over again that this one is O.K.
"Where I work, we have some black people that shop there," Mrs. Quinn said. "I'm very apprehensive about it. But once you get to know them, they're very nice."
 
Suspicions
Bad Feelings Feed Themselves
 In many ways, William Knepper Jr. is the opposite of what the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had in mind in his "I Have a Dream" message. Mr. Knepper, a 23-year-old auto mechanic, is the product of an all-white world. His parochial school was white, his block is white, his friends are white. And television is his window to the other America.
All he knows about blacks, he said, is this: "They came from Africa, and they can get away with a lot of stuff because they're black, they're a minority."
Sometimes he has to drive to black neighborhoods to get auto parts for his job. When he does, he takes a baseball bat. His few direct contacts with blacks are mostly benign, and on his turf. "The one time I ever come in contact with them is in stores, and they seem all right," Mr. Knepper said.
He is aware that being white has its benefits. "I think we still have the upper hand," Mr. Knepper said. "If I was running a business and two qualified people apply for a job, one black and one white, I would probably go with the white guy. I'd feel safer."
To Mr. Knepper, that is the way the world should be. And attitudes like his are no excuse for blacks not to try. "We have the upper hand but they can go out and get a job," he said.
Mr. Knepper is not exactly against affirmative action. "You only need a certain percentage of them in jobs, and as long as you get that percentage, the rest can be white," he said.
Mr. Knepper's father, William Sr., an eighth-grade teacher at St. Christina's, said he never had a bad experience with blacks, and feels sympathetic toward them. "From my experience with them, they're like us," the elder Mr. Knepper said. "They have the same goals, the same aspirations, the same fears. When they blame something on racism, I tend to agree with them."
In raising his three children, he said he "never pushed race one way or the other." He said he let them form their own opinions of blacks, that he tried to correct his son when he could. "Any time he said something about race, I told him, 'You don't really know,' " Mr. Knepper said.
 
Relationships
Some Closeness, Little Friendship
 Most people said they had never had a friend of the other race.
Among the few who did, whites usually had a broader definition of "friend." Some were quick to say that blacks they met at work or in service roles were their friends. Some police officers called the blacks whose neighborhoods they patrol their friends. But they said they rarely, if ever, did the things that friends do, like having them over for dinner.
Blacks were more cynical. While white co-workers called them friends, blacks said they felt more like mascots than intimates. "On the job they will laugh and joke with you," said Sebron Jones, a postal worker who lives in Roseland. "When they get off work, they're through with you."
He remembers once seeing a white co-worker at a bus stop and walking over to say hello. The co-worker turned his back and refused to answer him, apparently afraid of what people would think. Another white co-worker told Mr. Jones that he wanted to invite him to his house but was worried about the neighbors.
"I told him, 'If I want to invite you to my house, I wouldn't give a doggone what the neighbors think,' " Mr. Jones said.
Neither relationship survived. And Mr. Jones is doubtful whether blacks and whites can ever be friends. "There's never been one I could trust," he said.
 
A Family Radical
 The few whites in Mount Greenwood who made friends across the color line became suddenly aware of the anti-black sentiment.
Mary Knepper, who works at a Kentucky Fried Chicken and is young William Knepper's sister, is considered a radical in her family. She made friends with a black girl at a public high school she attended. Some neighborhood children once yelled epithets at them as the two walked down a Mount Greenwood street. Since then, Ms. Knepper has been protective. "I worry about her when she comes over," Ms. Knepper said. "If she's coming over on the bus, and she's late, I go out and start looking for her."
What happens in places like Roseland and Mount Greenwood has resonance for the rest of the country, social scientists say. "Racial tension and hostility show up first and more intensely in the working class because this group is in the immediate line of fire," said William Julius Wilson, a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago and author of "The Truly Disadvantaged" (University of Chicago Press, 1987).
"Not enough attention is given to black and white working-class folks," he said. "If you could get these groups to recognize their common interests, it would go a long way toward alleviating racial hostility."
The elder Mr. Kneppers wonders if that will ever happen. He figures that even if white hostility toward blacks ended tomorrow, "we'd still find someone to hate."

A Revival for the Shakespeare Theater?

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT will soon select a private developer to revive the twice-failed American Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford as a nonprofit theater and May-to-October tourist destination.
 Sixteen developers have voiced interest in making proposals, to be accompanied by $100,000 security payments, by the July 29 deadline. The winner will be announced Sept. 1, although the sluggish economy raises doubts that there will be many proposals. 
The state will retain ownership, leasing the property to a developer for $1 a year. "We want to see a theater in operation for the 1993 season," said Joseph Cohen, spokesman for the state's Department of Economic Development, which has oversight.
 "State ownership is vital," he said, "to prevent a cultural gem from being developed into condos or commercial use if it fell into private hands. Furthermore, if the entertainment was distasteful or unacceptable by community standards, the state could sever the agreement."
 Founded in 1954 by directors of New York's prestigious Theater Guild on 14.5 acres on the Housatonic River, the American Shakespeare Festival Theater enjoyed initial success. Only Shakespeare was presented -- an American counterpart of the Globe Theater in Stratford-Upon-Avon in England and the Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Ont. Built to resemble the Globe, it attracted such performers as Katharine Hepburn, Helen Hayes, Alfred Drake and Maurice Evans.
 But audiences dwindled over a 25-year period until the theater went bankrupt and was taken over by CityTrust. In 1983, it was bought by the state for $1.3 million, designated a state park and operated unsuccessfully by a board of directors. Today, the building is boarded up and deteriorated. The grounds have gone wild and the bronze statue of Hamlet contemplates a river obscured by undergrowth.
 So far only two proposals have been made public. Louis A. Burke, a South African impresario whose American ventures include the recent Broadway production of "Meet Me in St. Louis," is preparing a plan estimated to cost $100 million. And David D. Reed, a director of audience development for the Shakespeare Theater from 1968 to 1973, and his partner, Peter Kosinski, a New Haven architect, would spend around $28 million on their proposal.
 While both plans envision first-class productions of the classics, musicals, 20th-century plays and works by new playwrights, performed by a resident company and guest stars, there is a crucial difference: Mr. Reed would build an inn on state land next to the existing theater; the Burke proposal calls for a hotel on an adjacent private site.
 "To build in the park would destroy public views and access," said Vincent Chase, Republican State Represenative from Stratford. "The selection committee will be concerned about that. Stratford prefers to see it remain greenspace."
 MR. BURKE would restore and modernize the existing theater with 1,400 seats for musicals and large-scale productions and add a 700-seat theater for straight plays and a 250-seat black-box stage for intimate drama, music and lectures. An academy for graduate theater students would be revived, and the grounds, parking lots and picnic areas along the river would be refurbished.
 Supplementary revenues would be generated by a 350-room hotel, a marina and restaurants, bed-and-breakfasts and boutiques. Resident company would be housed in several antique homes that are for sale next to the site. Overall, his proposal covers some 39 acres.
 "We want to create a New England village," said Mr. Burke, "where people can come from across town for an evening, or from anywhere in the world by car, boat, train or plane -- Sikorksky Airport is minutes away -- and spend a weekend or a week." Theatrical offerings would run simultaneously in three theaters, with programs changing every few days.
 Mr. Reed's plan is limited to the on-site inn of 128 rooms, restoration of the theater, academy, and grounds, and the addition of a black-box theater and restaurant.
 "The development of hotels, shops, restaurants and marinas, as proposed by Burke," said Mr. Chase, "bodes well for the town. It would be a boost for real estate values, particularly when coupled with the recent designation of the surrounding residential area as a National Historic District. And it would be a source of jobs."
 Competition for audiences would come chiefly from New Haven, where the Yale Repertory and Long Wharf Theaters have long been among the country's top regional theaters. N. Edgar Rosenblum, director of Long Wharf, was on a Governor's committee that made recommendations for the Shakespeare Theater's operation.
 "I think the state is flogging a dead horse," said Mr. Rosenblum. "It is not a good theater physically, the location is remote for the theatergoing public and the state should be spending its money on existing professional theaters that it has cut by 31 percent."
 "In healthier days we all prospered," he said, "and one more theater wouldn't have made any difference. Now we must be concerned about competing for corporate sponsors as well as government funds."
 MR. Cohen insists that "the state will not put up a penny," but Mr. Rosenblum believes that the state as owner has an undeniable financial stake in the property.
 ANOTHER strong competitor will be the new Stamford Center for the Arts, a $16 million theater of 700 seats, with a 150-seat studio theater, theatrical training facilities and a television broadcasting component, scheduled to open in late September.
 Randy Brion, executive director since its inception, has relinquished his post to Alexander Cohen, the Broadway producer, who began a three-year stint earlier this month.
 "Each theater has to stake out its territory," said Mr. Brion. "Local people make up 80 percent of all ticket sales, and since non- profits earn about 60 percent from the box-office, they need a substantial stream of other revenue. With the real estate market as it is, it's difficult to depend on other revenues. If they are business ventures, those businesses have to be successful."
 Connecticut's legitimate theater is rivaled by that of few other states. Other theaters operating in Connecticut are the Hartford Stage Company, Goodspeed Opera House-East Haddam, Shubert-New Haven, and Westport Playhouse.

Money Matters in Eastern Europe

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
TRAVELERS going to eastern Europe this summer will probably find money a source of concern: where to change it, which currency is preferred and where credit cards and traveler's checks are accepted constitute some of the potential hassles. Russia, other parts of the former Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the former German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania are gradually linking up with Western financial networks, but progress is spotty and irregular.
 This column contains a roundup of information from bureaus and contributors in Europe at the beginning of June, but it should be supplemented if possible with last-minute data from the place you are going. No guidebook can be up to date on changes, and this column too will age rapidly. 
Automatic teller machines that give you cash from your account at home through the Cirrus or Plus networks, although they are increasingly found overseas, have not yet made a big dent in the former Soviet bloc. The American Express company has set up a network to allow its cardholders to get money from accounts that they designate in advance and has installed 24-hour cash machines to dispense this money in Moscow, Warsaw, Budapest and Prague. But entry into this Express Cash network must be obtained before leaving the United States; applications may be obtained by calling (800) 227-4669. There is no charge for signing up, which takes two to three weeks, but individual transactions cost from $2.50 to $10.
 Here are the contributors' reports.
 Russia and other former Soviet republics. Hard currency, in dollars or German marks, is what makes the wheels go round here. In major Russian tourist hotels and some restaurants, charge and credit cards, preferably American Express, Visa and Mastercard, are also accepted. Under duress -- meaning you threaten to leave without paying -- hotels and restaurants will accept traveler's checks, preferably in dollars or marks.
 In other former Soviet republics, foreign hard currency is the medium of choice -- dollars, marks, British pounds, francs.
 There are two American Express automatic teller machines in Moscow, at the American Express office at 21-A Sadovaya-Kurindskaya, where rubles may be obtained, and one at the Mezhdunarodnaya Hotel at 12 Krasnopresnenskaya Naberezhnaya, where rubles or dollar-denominated traveler's checks may be obtained.
 There is no limit on the amount of foreign currency a visitor may take in and no requirement to buy a certain amount of rubles. However, visitors must declare all the currency they are taking in, and should hang on to the customs form because it, and any receipts for bank currency transactions, will be checked against the amount of currency on departure to be sure that you are not taking out more than you came in with.
 Two pieces of advice: First, rubles will be hard to convert at departure points. Second, with the uncertainty of credit cards and traveler's checks, thieves expect travelers to be carrying a lot of cash, so money should be well protected.
 Poland. The country is apparently moving rapidly into a free market economy, with lessening currency problems for tourists . Dollars as well as zlotys are accepted for major purchases, with the exchange rate set by the National Bank.
 American Express, Visa, Mastercard and the Air Travel Cards are reported to be accepted in hotels and major restaurants in main tourist areas. American Express has an automatic teller for its cardholders at its Warsaw office, Dom Bez Kantow, Krakowskie Przedmiescie 11.
 Traveler's checks in dollars, marks and pounds are accepted by the Orbis official tourist agencies, the American Express office in Warsaw and the National Bank of Poland.
 Poland's shift means that dollars can be changed into zlotys at exchange bureaus, known as kantors, at hotels, airports and rail stations.
 Travelers must still declare the amount of money taken in, and receipts should be saved for a possible check on departure.
 Czechoslovakia. Dollars are not so easily used for crowns as they may be for local currencies elsewhere in the former Soviet bloc, and crowns are not convertible outside the country at all. For travel outside Prague, it is wise to convert dollars in advance, as exchange offices may be sparse and may be shut on weekends.
 Most first- and second-class hotels -- the top two grades -- in tourist areas accept American Express, Visa and Mastercard. First-class tourist restaurants may also accept these cards and Diners' Club, too, but restaurants are less consistent, and it is wise to inquire.
 Traveler's checks in Western denominations may be used at first-class hotels but probably not in restaurants and shops. Western currency may be exchanged at hotels and banks and at exchange offices, which usually stay open until 10 P.M. There are no restrictions on the amount of foreign currency that may be brought into the country.
 Crowns may be obtained in Prague on American Express's Express Cash service at the company's new offices at 56 Wenceslas Square and from the 24-hour cash machine in front. Advances through the Visa, Mastercard and Diners' Club cards may be obtained at a Chequepoint office of the Cekobanka at Rijna 13, at the bottom of Wenceslas Square. There are two Cirrus automatic teller machines to dispense crowns being tested at the Komercini Banks at Prikope 28 and Prikope 3-5.
 Hungary. In Budapest and other major cities, most internationally accepted credit cards -- Visa, American Express, Diners' Club, Mastercard and Eurocard --may be used in hotels, high-priced restaurants and some stores. In smaller towns and stores, hard currency still reigns. American Express cards may be used to obtain Express Cash forints at machines at two company offices in Budapest, Deak Ferenc utca 10, and at the airport. Cash in dollars, through Visa and American Express cards, may be obtained at the Hungarian Foreign Trade Bank at Turr Istvan utca 9. There is a 6 percent commission .
Eastern Germany. The situation here is different because the Federal Republic, to which the former German Democratic Republic is now rejoined, was long accustomed to dealing with foreign tourists. Because this eased the way, leading credit card companies are said to be working feverishly to expand their networks into the former East German area.
 Travelers checks can be cashed at any bank or exchange office. There are American Express Express Cash machines in Schonefeld Airport in Berlin and at the Dresden and Leipzig central railroad stations.
Romania. Purchases must be made in the local currency, the lei, and hotels, restaurants and stores are generally quite careful about this. Not all hotels have exchange services, although they will try to help visitors find an exchange that is open when they are checking out.
 The most convertible currency in Romania at the moment, a correspondent reports, is German marks, with some exchange offices refusing to accept dollars for hours or days at a time. Hotels in Bucharest and a few other major cities will accept Visa, American Express and Diners' Club, but decals on a restaurant door are not reliable indicators.
 Traveler's checks can be cashed at a few exchange offices, but are even less likely to be accepted than credit cards at hotels and restaurants. There are no strictures on how much may be taken in, but customs officers may ask the amount and suggest that large amounts be declared.

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Travel Advisory column on June 7 referred incorrectly to the Lake Michigan Carferry Service. It is not the only cross-lake ferry operating on the Great Lakes. A reader's letter, dated June 18, points out that the Pelee Island Ferry crosses Lake Erie between Sandusky, Ohio, and Leamington, Ontario.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Romancing the Book . . . Once Again

BYLINE: By PAT H. BROESKE; Pat H. Broeske covers movies and popular culture for Entertainment Weekly.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
In story-hungry Hollywood, executives not known for reading are suddenly thumbing eagerly through the classics. But if Hollywood is desperately seeking material, it also keeps its priorities. In the film industry, reading and writing are not nearly as important as arithmetic. Ticket sales remain the ultimate goal, and the challenge is to please the mass audience, not placate scholars or connoisseurs of literature.
When Daily Variety recently announced the sale of a script for a new remake of "The Three Musketeers," it quoted a Disney executive who bragged about the script's "contemporary edge," the hip dialogue and a buddy relationship similar to that of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in "Lethal Weapon." What's more, the executive claimed, the remake would be faithful to Alexandre Dumas's 1844 novel. 
 In recent years, major studios have largely shied away from the classics, although they once pursued them with a passion. Adaptations of literary works have been handled mainly by small, independent companies. Recalling attempts to interest Hollywood in such books as late as the mid-80's, the director James Ivory says, "We were told the classics were poisonous." Mr. Ivory has collaborated with the producer Ismail Merchant to create a string of critically acclaimed adaptations of literary classics, most recently "Howards End," from the 1910 E. M. Forster novel.
In part, it was the unexpected critical and commercial success of some of the Merchant-Ivory films that triggered the current "classics revival." "Howards End," which was filmed for $8 million, has earned nearly $5 million on the art-house circuit, and Sony Pictures Classics, its distributor, expects the film to continue its run through next year's Oscar race. "A Room With a View," the 1985 Merchant-Ivory film that cost $3.5 million to make, went on to earn nearly $25 million and three Academy Awards.
As Mr. Ivory notes, "Good literature means good stories, good characters, good scenes."
And, as the Merchant-Ivory films illustrate, good literature can be filmed for far less money than so-called high concept fare, which is often laden with costly special effects, car chases and shootouts. What's more, studios don't have to pay fees for screen rights for works that have slipped into the public domain.
Discussing Hollywood's current penchant for literary works and the link to the industry's economic state, Fred Fuchs, a producer of the forthcoming film "Bram Stoker's Dracula," explains: "Studio executives are more conservative than they used to be. They aren't developing as many projects. When they do O.K. something, they want to know there's a story there to start with."
Certain titles also bring instant name recognition. Marketing surveys for 20th Century Fox's "Last of the Mohicans" show that while few moviegoers have read the book, most are familiar with the title.
At least two dozen literary classics are currently in development or production. They range from action-adventures such as James Fenimore Cooper's "Last of the Mohicans," opening in the fall, and Jack London's two-fisted seafaring saga "The Sea Wolf," now in development, to two Edith Wharton novels about turn-of-the-century characters stifled by social conventions. Wharton's "Age of Innocence," about an ill-fated love triangle, is being directed by Martin Scorsese and stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. The Columbia Pictures movie, now being filmed, is due in the fall. Also due this fall is Wharton's "Ethan Frome," an American Playhouse production starring Liam Neeson as the doomed title character.
As the Wharton films illustrate, both small and large companies are financing these projects. Several boast big budgets as well as big stars. "Bram Stoker's Dracula," for example, which Francis Ford Coppola is directing for Columbia, is budgeted at $40 million and stars Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves. "The Last of the Mohicans" will cost $35 million to $40 million and stars Daniel Day-Lewis.
Indeed, because of the high stakes involved, some of the forthcoming adaptations will undergo changes -- or rather, Hollywoodizing -- along the lines of what is envisioned for the hip but faithful "Three Musketeers."
One example is London's "Sea Wolf." Set in 1904 (the date of the book's publication), the story will be updated to modern times. "Audiences will be able to relate to it better," says Brian Grazer, who is head of Imagine Films Entertainment, the company handling the film. According to Mr. Grazer, the project was pitched to the company as " 'Deliverance' on the high seas," "a real mano-a-mano tale."
For "The Last of the Mohicans," Fox came up with an advertising campaign proclaiming, "The Last of the Mohicans Was the First American Hero." Though the story is set in 1757 during the French and Indian War, Michael Mann, the writer and director, eschews labels like "western" and "period piece." Rather, he describes the project as "a love story set in a war zone."
Not coincidentally, the story line has been altered to give the frontier hero known as Hawkeye (played by Mr. Day-Lewis) a love interest -- and a sex life. Another change involves Hawkeye's real name: Cooper may have christened the character Natty Bumppo, but in the movie he'll be Nathaniel Poe. "Natty Bumppo is kind of a silly name," explains Mr. Mann, who is best known as the producer of the television series "Miami Vice." And, perhaps predictably, the violence will be intensified. As a result, the film will receive an R rating.
Subtle changes will also be apparent in the forthcoming adaptation of the John Steinbeck novel "Of Mice and Men." Gary Sinise, the director and co-star of the MGM/Pathe film, acknowledges that his movie has some "new moments," especially in regard to the ranch foreman's lonely wife, played by Sherilynn Fenn, best known for portraying a sexually precocious teen-ager on television's "Twin Peaks."
Mr. Sinise, who stars opposite John Malkovich, emphasized that the novel's downbeat ending will not be changed: "You shouldn't do 'Of Mice and Men' if you change the ending." He went on to implore that a reporter not "give the ending away," so as not to turn off potential moviegoers.
Despite Hollywood's current coziness with literature, the industry's product is ultimately visual. Movies, at best, generally have trouble conveying the written word, even when the word is a classic. Moreover, film making is not an industry known for bookworms: during a recent visit to a studio's marketing office, a visitor notices stacks of Cliffs Notes for "The Last of the Mohicans."
When asked if Samuel Clemens scholars might approve of the adaptation of a Mark Twain novel in the works, the producer of the film replies: "Samuel Clemens? Is he a character in the book?"
Even Mr. Grazer, of Imagine Films Entertainment, admits that he hadn't read "The Sea Wolf" at the time he was first asked about about backing the project. ("I started reading it that weekend.") And James Ivory says that when studios were approached about financing "Howards End," most executives hadn't ever read the book.
In the early 80's, when Mr. Ivory and Mr. Merchant solicited studio backing for "A Room With a View," executives unsuccessfully sought to tamper with E. M. Forster's 1908 novel, about a young upper-class Englishwoman who was awakening to romance. "We were told that it had too many old characters," Mr. Ivory recalls, "so we were asked to make some younger." The film makers were also asked about giving one young character an American father -- so the cast could include a young American actor with box-office appeal.
It could be argued that it doesn't matter how Hollywood tampers with the classics. According to figures from Reading Is Fundamental, a Washington-based group that operates the nation's largest literacy program, as many as 21 million Americans may be illiterate. Statistics collected by the organization show that fewer than 25 percent of high school seniors read for pleasure; 90 percent of grade school children find television more appealing than reading, and 82 percent of these pupils prefer video games to reading.
Ruth Graves, president of the reading group, also points to an Associated Press poll, conducted earlier this year, showing that 30 percent of families earning more than $40,000 a year admitted that they had no books in their home. It's safe to predict, therefore, that many Americans will never have read the books Hollywood is adapting.
Because of the power of film, there is always the possibility that adaptations will send moviegoers in search of the originals. "That is what you always hope for," says Mr. Fuchs, the producer.
And Laurence Mark, who is producing "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," adds: "What you want is for your movie to be such a special excursion that adults, who've already read the book, will want to pick it up again, and kids will want to read it for the first time."
Thomas Hardy's 19th-century novel, "Tess of the D'Urbervilles," appeared on The New York Times best-seller list when it was reprinted as a movie tie-in after the release of Roman Polanski's "Tess." The 1979 adaptation won three Oscars. For the movie tie-in for "Howards End," Signet Books printed 100,000 copies of a work that had been selling 5,000 copies a year for the company.
"For those of us concerned about literacy," says Ms. Graves, "you hope that audiences will know that that book could be just as exciting -- if not more -- as the movie." At one Reading Is Fundamental book giveaway, she recalls, a youngster looked through a pile of books and chose "The Wizard of Oz," explaining, "Well, I saw the movie, but I don't think it told the whole story."
 
 
 
PAGING LITERATURE

HEADLINE: Schools, Losing State Aid, Ponder Sharing Costs

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
SEVERE losses in state aid to education, coupled with growing concerns over the future of local school districts, are prompting studies to explore reorganizing and consolidating districts.
The State Education Department issued a study a few months ago on reorganizing, including consolidation and sharing administrative and instructional services. Long Island is one of six regional groups in the two-phase study, which is in the first stage of examining alternatives in districts with minimum enrollments of 1,200, 2,500 and 5,000. 
 The superintendent of Boces 2 in Suffolk County, Dr. Edward Milliken, said the first phase of the study, to be completed by the end of the month, would not include recommendations but, instead, alternatives for consolidating contiguous districts and for other approaches to sharing services.
 
Cost Efficiency Stressed
 "In some cases it may be more cost-efficient for school districts to retain their local identities for instruction, but to reorganize central offices in management and administration," he said. "This is a form of reorganization that has not yet come to New York State."
Dr. Milliken said the second phase of the study would look at the choices, decide which would be best and make recommendations.
In April the Temporary State Commission for Tax Relief on Long Island recommended consolidating the 53 school districts in Nassau County to 29 and the 71 in Suffolk to 37. Each district would have an average enrollment of slightly more than 5,000.
The report, "School Operations for Nassau and Suffolk Counties," said "bigger is better" if expenditures are to be reduced, because "larger districts enjoy greater opportunity to capitalize on the greater concentration of resources, specialization and diversity, as well as a reduction in bureaucratic redundancy and fractioned authority that might be more likely to take place within and across smaller school districts."
Former Assemblyman Arthur J. Kremer of Long Beach, a member of the commission and chairman of the subcommittee on schools of the State Commission for the Future of Long Island, said the time had come to consolidate districts.
"There is naturally some resistance among local administrators who want to protect their turf," Mr. Kremer said. "But most administrators recognize that consolidation is the blueprint for the future.
"It can't be done overnight and can't be rammed down anyone's throat. Consolidation must be based on significant money incentives from the state. The Commissioner of Education has indicated that he favors a speed-up of consolidation and mergers, and I expect that he will recommend that the Legislature step up action to enforce consolidations in school districts where appropriate."
 
From 10,000 to 717 Districts
 In 1920, the state had 10,000 districts. By 1960 the number had shrunk to 1,293. Today there are 717.
Over the years, Long Island has experienced many consolidations, including the merger of 13 districts in the 50's to become the Riverhead District and the formation of the Southampton District from four smaller ones.
For districts to consolidate, voter approval is now required, and the decision is left to the individual communities. But the new state study will also be looking at whether consolidations should continue to require local votes or if the state could mandate them.
An associate for district organization in the Education Department, Suzanne Spear, said many districts feared that they might be forced to consolidate. "There is a sense of panic," Ms. Spear said. "We've received many phone calls from people looking to buy houses who are hesitant to sign contracts until they get assurance that there will be no merger in that school district.
"Based on the history of the state, it doesn't seem likely that the local vote will be taken away. As long as the vote is there, there is no reason for concern."
 
Fault Is Found in Premise
 There is some legitimate level of anxiety among administrators, said Superintendent Bert Nelson of Hewlett-Woodmere, president of the Nassau County Council of Superintendents. The premise that there are large amounts of money to be saved with consolidation is not necessarily true, Dr. Nelson said, adding that if consolidation is at the expense of the children, then it will be negative.
"The most important consideration in school-district reorganizations must be to serve the children," he added. "The greatest red herring is that superintendents are opposed to consolidation. Hardly. Superintendents will be supportive of consolidation where appropriate, provided that the children are put first as a priority. Each community should have the right to decide what's best for itself."
Dr. Milliken said studies by some districts on the Island had found that consolidation was not always financially beneficial. In Suffolk County, a study by six small districts on the North Fork found that creating one larger district would lower taxes in three communities but raise taxes in the three others.
 
Tax Relief Called Essential
 "If consolidation doesn't provide tax relief, it won't work," Dr. Milliken said. "It must not only improve educational programs, but also lower taxes to be a win-win situation."
Under the system of state aid, merging districts have to have similar wealth levels for consolidation to be successful, Dr. Milliken said. If they are not the taxes in at least one district will increase.
The Harborfields and Elwood Districts discontinued a consolidation study after preliminary findings that there would be no significant savings in either district. Superintendent Raymond Walters of Harborfields said his district had decided not to continue with the study, because it was not financially feasible.
For consolidating districts, the state raises operating aid 20 percent for five years. The supplement decreases 2 percent each year after that.
Dr. Walters said that the long-term benefit would be minimal, and that there would be no guarantee the tax rates would decrease.
 
Salary Differences Cited
 Ms. Spear said the expenses of consolidation could run very high, especially if there is a large difference in the salaries between the merging districts. The new district would be very likely to adopt the higher salary, she said.
To be cost effective, a consolidated district should be able to put all high school students in one building, Ms. Spear added, a plan that would have been impossible in Harborfields and Elwood. There are additional costs for textbooks and uniforms when merging student populations, she said, adding that for Harborfields and Elwood a consolidation would not have been economically efficient.
Dr. Walters said that he had met with the eight superintendents in the Town of Huntington and that they would look for ways to share more services.
When consolidation is not the appropriate solution, Dr. Milliken said, districts may find that sharing services is an effective and feasible alternative.
The Superintendent of Boces 1, Dr. Raymond DeFeo, said one of the best examples of shared services was Boces, which supplies services like occupational education to students in different districts, a service that he said would be impossible for any single district to perform.
 
Greenport and Southold Share Teams
 There are many successful examples of shared services, Dr. DeFeo said. Greenport and Southold have shared 11 athletic teams and a number of courses. The enrollments in both districts are low, but together they can broaden their programs, Dr. DeFeo explained.
In a television experiment, Greenport, Riverhead and Southold offer five high school courses to students in all three districts. The program has been very successful, Dr. DeFeo said, and hope to add districts.
Some districts are eager to consolidate, but have not found successful mates. Dr. DeFeo said that Greenport would like to merge with a compatible school, but that no district was interested, because Greenport is a low-wealth, highly taxed district, and a consolidation would mean higher taxes for the merging district.
East Rockaway, with 1,150 students, is the smallest district for kindergarten through 12th grade in Nassau, and it wants to find a neighbor for consolidation, said Superintendent Robert Parry. Consolidation would be logical for districts with financial difficulties and declining enrollments, he said.
A plan to send middle- and high school students to Lynbrook and pay their tuition was rejected by Lynbrook.
"The experiment with Lynbrook seemed like a perfect marriage, and we are very disappointed," Dr. Parry said.
 
Why a Plan Was Rejected
 A proposal to consolidate the Comsewogue and Middle Country School Districts was voted down last month by the Middle Country School Board. The Interim Superintendent at Middle Country, Frank Carasiti, said the board had decided not to proceed because the district, with almost 10,000 students, was already large enough.
But Superintendent Alan P. Austen of Comsewogue said that at an earlier meeting between representatives of the districts there had been support for a merger that would have improved educational programs and reduced taxes in both districts.
"Many communities are afraid to lose their identities, and there are many misunderstandings about consolidating," Dr. Austen said. "I am confident that if the public were better educated, they would vote to consolidate. Political leaders should have the courage to force school districts to study consolidation and then let the voters decide."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: Great Kills

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
GREAT KILLS, with its calm harbor and clean beaches on the south shore of Staten Island, has been adding housing since the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in 1964 made it easily accessible to Brooklyn and Manhattan. The recession has slowed construction and sales, but brokers and local officials expect sharp increases in both when the economy picks up.
"Housing prices will take off again because the Lord isn't making any more waterfront property," said Dorothy Fitzpatrick, district manager of Community Board 3, based in Great Kills. She said the next surge could start at one of the newest developments in the community, Port Regalle. This is a 50-unit, pink-stucco condominium town- house complex off Wiman Avenue, overlooking Great Kills Harbor. A three-bedroom unit with a waterfront view is currently listed for resale at $369,000, a two bedroom unit at $320,000. Local real estate agents say the owners may be unable to get those prices. 
 "It is unrealistic to think that a two-bedroom unit in Port Regalle would sell for more than $300,000 in this market," said Lydia V. Ragucci, owner of Ragucci Realty on Amboy Road.
The community extends from the harbor up to Arthur Kill Road and is bisected by the tracks of the Staten Island Rapid Transit System. The train, which goes to the Staten Island Ferry, stops on Amboy Road, in the heart of the 19th-century business district known as "The Village." It has an "apothecary," rather than a pharmacy, with antique bottles in its window, a small department store, a hardware store, three delis, several luncheonettes and half a dozen restaurants.
"Like 50 years ago," explained Theresa Petruzelli, owner of T.J.'s Luncheonette on Amboy Road, "people walk in from home for a few things or stop off on their way home from the train station."
Mrs. Petruzelli says business has been poor over the last year, leading to local layoffs. The downtown is also hurt by a lack of supermarkets, which forces residents to shop in neighboring areas, and by competition from the Staten Island Mall, three miles away in New Springville.
The name Great Kills dates to the 1660's, when the Dutch ruled Staten Island (the Dutch word "kill" means tributary). In 1664, when the British took over, a French merchant, Jacques Guyon, got 200 acres from the crown.
Great Kills remained basically a farming community until 1860, when the B & O Railroad linked it to St. George and the ferry to Manhattan. Housing spurted with the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in 1964.
Shielded from the Atlantic by a hook of land called Crookes Point, the harbor is one of the most desirable on the East Coast for pleasure boaters.
THE point is at the western tip of Great Kills Park, a 900-acre national park built on a former landfill. Part of the Gateway National Park system, it has five baseball fields, a model airplane field, a mile-long beachfront, a public boat ramp, nature areas and a 350-slip marina run by Nichols Great Kills Harbor Park Marina on a concession basis.
Edward Tomanek, manager of the marina, says it is the largest of the six in the harbor. There are about 1,000 slips in the marinas and two yacht clubs. Slips rent for $60 to $100 a boat foot; Nichols slips rent for $65 a foot.
"Usually, we have a waiting list for slips," Mr. Tomanek said. "Now we have a few empty at the start of the season."
Some of the most expensive houses are on the streets surrounding a tiny duck pond called Jack's Pond just south of Amboy Road. Custom-built tudors, colonials and sprawling ranches on large lots on Hillside Terrace or Dent Road overlooking the pond sell for up to $350,000.
By far the most common houses are three-bedroom high ranches and colonials. Several thousand have been built since the bridge was opened. According to Mrs. Ragucci, houses on streets such as Oakdale Street or Lamoka Avenue sell for $185,000 to $210,000.
"The houses are like the people here," Mrs. Ragucci said. "They are solid, practical, family-type houses, not out to impress anyone."
Many residents also live in semi-detached duplexes. Three-bedroom units in duplexes on Dewey, Katan or Colon Avenues sell for $150,000 to $160,000. Mrs. Ragucci said many recent buyers were New York City policemen, firemen and sanitation workers relocating from Brooklyn to escape crime and congestion.
The largest multifamily complex is Kensington Gardens, an 80-unit garden co-op on Amboy Road. Studios are about $45,000, one-bedrooms $60,000 and two-bedroom $70,000. Apartments in two-family houses rent for about $600 a month for two bedrooms and $500 a month for one.
Among the newer residents of Great Kills are Thomas J. Carchietta, an analyst at the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, and his wife, Veronica, an analyst at the New York Life Insurance Company. They bought a high ranch in April 1991, just after their wedding. He grew up in neighboring Eltingville and his wife is from Queens.
"We wanted to live near my parents," Mr. Carchietta explained. "And for me, this was like moving across the street. For my wife, it's great because she was an apartment dweller all of her life and owning a home is very satisfying for her."
Mr. Carchietta said he and his wife found the community to be extremely friendly and clean. However, he believes New York City has neglected Staten Island, especially when it comes to the transportation system.
"THE main roads here are just not wide enough to handle the volume of traffic," he said. "The city owes it to us to use some of the revenues from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to improve our transportation system."
Many long-time residents feel that the area is getting too crowded.
"I started to feel cramped about 10 years ago," said Eileen M. Brophy, who has lived in Great Kills for 17 years. "But it's still a family place. Now, many of the older people are selling to young couples, who are fixing up the homes."
Most children from Great Kills attend Public School 8 on Lindenwood Road or P.S. 32 on Elverton Avenue, both considered by residents to be excellent. This year, P.S. 8 scored highest of any elementary school on Staten Island in New York City's standardized reading tests. The principal, Robert Sheldon, said 93 percent of his students read at or above grade level.
"Our success is due to the excellent teaching staff," he said. "All but one of the teachers has a master's in education. Perhaps more important is that the children come from a solid, stable, supportive community. They arrive ready to learn."
There are two Roman Catholic parochial schools in town -- St. Francis, a K-12 school on Amboy Road, and St. Clare School, a K-8 school on Lindenwood Road.
The students go on to intermediate School 24 on Cleveland Avenue, and either Tottenville High School in Huguenot or Susan E. Wagner High in Seaview. More than 80 percent of the graduates of each of the high schools go on to higher education. Senior classes in each of the schools consistently win more than $1 million a year in scholarships. Early this month, Tottenville won both the city's golf and boys' baseball championships.
One of the town's most stubborn problems is graffiti. Recently, the community board's youth coordinator, Christine Flynn, sent fliers to organizations and businesses asking for money and volunteers to fight the problem. They raised $3,500.
"Sometimes, we'll paint over a spot and the next day the graffiti will be back," Ms. Flynn said. "So we go back and paint over it again and again."
Among the well-known restaurants are Windjammer Restaurant and Mansion Marina, both seafood restaurants on Mansion Avenue; La Galleria, an Italian restaurant on Hylan Boulevard; Buono Pasta, an Italian restaurant on Amboy Road, and La Candela Espanola, a Spanish restaurant on Amboy Road.

Crook or Crooke? In 1874, John Crooke, a naturalist and mining engineer for whom Crookes Point is named, bought the land from Joseph Brown, who had a shipyard on the site. Local lore has it that Brown packed a pair of ivory-handled revolvers given to him by gunrunners for looking the other way when schooners unloaded smuggled weapons at the point. Construction of Great Kills Park began in 1928, when the state gave a strip of wetlands to New York City. The site was filled with 16.5 million cubic yards of earth. In 1974, the park became part of Gateway National Park.

HEADLINE: Germans Shorten Workweek for Success

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In describing the German formula for national economic success in "The Wages of German Success" (Op-Ed, May 22), Norbert Walter makes a serious but common error. He fails to stress the major reductions in work time built into Germany's highly productive capital-intensive industrial system. Using technological progress simultaneously to raise wages and reduce work time has been postwar Germany's greatest economic achievement.
The standard West German workweek consisted of six eight-hour days in 1955. German unions then pledged themselves to translate the greater productivity made possible by new technology into higher wages and a shorter workweek. Unionized industrial workers in West Germany achieved the five-day, 40-hour week in the 1960's. By the early 70's, most nonunion German workers also had 40-hour weekly schedules. 
 West German unions began looking to extended annual leave in the 70's as automation continued to boost productivity. They have been remarkably successful. German law requires a minimum of three weeks' annual paid leave for full-time employees. But the 70 percent of German workers covered by collective bargaining agreements take six or more weeks off with pay, while most others get five weeks. Average full-time German workers have two and half times more paid leave a year than their American counterparts.
German unions began a new effort to reduce the standard workweek in 1984. The unions maintained that shorter hours would counter rising structural unemployment, which they attributed to continued development of capital-intensive production. The unions accepted a real-wage freeze and granted management greater scheduling flexibility in exchange for general reductions in average workweek. Long strikes by metalworkers, printers and paperworkers forced management to accept this bargain.
Once the 40-hour barrier was broken, a general movement toward a shorter workweek started. By the end of 1990, 90 percent of West German workers had weekly schedules of less than 40 hours, with unionized workers averaging 38.3 hours. Contracts assure at least one-quarter of the German work force a 35-hour workweek by 1995.
Reducing work time has been a key to West German economic success and social stability. Americans can no longer afford to ignore this lesson. Today, the United States suffers from its failure to translate technological progress into reduced work time. Here, so-called "permanent layoffs" have long been accepted as a necessary cost of investing in capital-intensive production. And the resulting structural unemployment has been routinely allocated to fall most heavily on minority populations in what were once highly productive industrial cities. Meanwhile, most full-time workers have been asked to put in more hours for less pay.
Technological progress does not have to continue to erode the quality of American life, but it will unless the longstanding trends toward longer workweeks and greater structural unemployment are reversed. Instead of looking to Japan for a model, Americans could all live better if we emulated our other great economic rival, Germany, and created a capital-intensive economy that simultaneously meant jobs and less work for all.

HEADLINE: ISRAELIS TO VOTE, FACING CHALLENGES, FEARING STALEMATE

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, June 21

 BODY:
When Israelis vote on Tuesday, they will determine the shape of a new government to shepherd them through what may be some of the biggest changes in their history.
Yet paradoxically, the final weekend of the parliamentary election campaign ended today with the politicians having discussed few of the dominant issues in any depth. 
 And as important as this vote is, opinion polls strongly suggest that Israelis may end up with a stalemate.
These surveys consistently put the opposition Labor Party ahead of the governing Likud, but without any guarantee of sufficient strength to stitch together a workable coalition with small left-wing and religious parties. Likud, even if it should confound the poll takers by getting more votes than Labor, would be similarly hard-pressed to form a sturdy parliamentary majority with the far right and with the same religious parties Labor would court.
 
Revival of Coalition Seen
 As a result, many political experts predict that Israel will end up with a revival of the broad coalition of the two major parties that prevailed uneasily and often ineffectually through much of the last decade.
Whatever happens on Tuesday -- and polls here are often imperfect guides -- it will simply be the opening bell for weeks of negotiations over possible alliances, always necessary in Israel because no single party has ever managed to win a majority in the 120-member Parliament. Like sausage-making, it is not a pretty process to watch, tending to be laden with blatant deals and even payoffs.
It raises serious questions even before the fact about how stable the new government will be to tackle some of the most important diplomatic and economic challenges this country has ever faced.
 
Touching on Bedrock Issues
 Above all, it is involved for the first time in wide-ranging peace negotiations with the Palestinians and neighboring Arab nations, touching on bedrock issues of land and security.
With the cold war over, Israel's relationship with the United States is in flux, and many Israelis worry that the Americans have turned inward and away from eternally messy foreign problems like the Middle East.
Domestically, the country is at a crossroads, having recently absorbed 360,000 arrivals from the former Soviet Union, the equivalent of nearly 10 percent of the Israeli Jewish population. Culturally, these highly educated newcomers will be an asset of incalculable proportions in the future. For now, however, they are an economic headache. There are not nearly enough jobs for them, and Israelis have watched nervously as overall unemployment has climbed to 11.5 percent.
Many Israelis are fed up, and while they are often unable to put their finger precisely on what troubles them, they sense that the country is not being run right. They are people like Shlomo Aked, who lives in southern Tel Aviv.
Normally, his working-class neighborhood is fertile territory for Likud, the right-wing party that has been in power for 15 years. This time, Mr. Aked, who basically considers himself a Likud supporter, says it is time to let the party sit on the bench for a while.
"They take all this money and give it to Hebron," he said, referring to a town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that is a center for ardently nationalistic Jewish settlers. "What do I care about Hebron? When was the last time I was in Hebron, or in Nablus? What I care about is my neighborhood. The money doesn't go to the right places."
 
Hoping for a Few New Seats
 Labor hopes that there are tens of thousands like him ready to switch allegiances. Its strategists are not looking for seismic shifts, for that rarely happens in the Israeli electorate of 3.4 million people. Rather, they hope to lure perhaps 100,000 to 120,000 votes from Likud -- enough to win an extra four or five parliamentary seats, putting Labor in first place and giving it the first crack at forming a governing coalition.
Labor has also been helped mightily in the polls by the Russian newcomers, who resent their joblessness and who say by margins of as high as 4 to 1 that they are ready to punish Likud for not having done enough to smooth the entry into their new society.
With people who have lived here longer, Labor's sales pitch is not its platform, which differs from Likud's in its calls for reduced settlement-building in occupied lands and for territorial concessions in exchange for peace with the Arabs. Instead, Labor has staked its future on its leader of the last four months, Yitzhak Rabin, a lackluster Prime Minister from the 1970's who nonetheless enjoys more popularity than the incumbent Likud leader, Yitzhak Shamir.
Both men, whose combined age is 146, are studies in gray, so lacking in magnetism that neither one would set off an airport security detector. But many Israelis have high regard for Mr. Rabin, a former army commander and no-nonsense Defense Minister whom they consider a solid protector of Israel's best interests. While many traditional Likud supporters find Labor as a whole too soft on security matters, they find Mr. Rabin reassuring -- a safe way for them to register a protest vote without feeling that they may put the country at risk.
This inherent division between a relatively dovish party and hawkish leader has contributed to a blurring of important issues. Most were scarcely debated in the campaign, which was uncommonly tame by Israeli standards, touching off discussions among Israelis about whether they had become appallingly apathetic or rather so politically mature that they no longer punch out those who disagree with them.
Mr. Rabin talked often about eliminating "political settlements" in the territories and shifting money to social needs in Israel proper. But he said barely a word about where exactly the money would go or how specifically he would invigorate an economy that he calls anemic.
Similarly, Mr. Shamir, who has championed settlement-building and presided over greatly accelerated construction in the last two years, played down the issue, apparently in recognition that his program is not popular with many Israelis. Virtually invisible was a related matter that had preoccupied Israel for months: the Bush Administration's refusal to provide $10 billion in housing loan guarantees because of Mr. Shamir's settlement policy.
Political commentators say the lack of real ideological conflict shows that the party leaders recognize that they may soon be working together. In fact, both men give every sign of being more comfortable with each other than with their natural coalition partners to the left and the right.
 
Gains on Far Right
 In looking at where disaffected Likud voters will go, political experts say it is far from certain that they will turn to Labor.
Many seem to be moving even further to the right, with polls showing substantial gains for two established parties on the far right, Tsomet and Moledet, which are both opposed to territorial compromise. Young voters are said to be moving to the extremes in both directions, in particular toward Tsomet, which appeals to nonreligious territory hawks, and to Meretz, a coalition of left-wing parties.
But it is also possible that at the moment of truth on Tuesday many Likud voters will find that they simply cannot leave the fold, whether for ideological, ethnic or personal reasons.
"Labor's the party they love to date," said Gadi Wolfsfeld, a political scientist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. "But when it comes down to marriage, they go into the booth and vote Likud. And the reason is they're scared. They're scared about security. They're scared about the P.L.O. And in the end they vote for what they know."
Even if the polls are on target, "Labor can win the election and still lose the government," said Yaron Ezrahi, also a political science professor at Hebrew University.
The crucial question is not whether Labor finishes first but whether it can scrape together 61 seats for a parliamentary majority. Most polls say it could do it only with the help of Israel's three Arab parties. But Mr. Rabin pledges not to form a government with them, thus honoring an unbroken political tradition.
Likud is in a similar predicament. Even if he is stronger than the polls say, Mr. Shamir will be hard-pressed to put together more than a slender majority, one dependent on the same far-right parties that walked out on him half a year ago for taking part in the peace process. It would be impossible for him to maintain such a coalition and talk peace at the same time.
That is why the experts are betting on a Labor-Likud coalition similar to one that existed, often in mutual unhappiness, from 1984 to 1990.
Who gets to sit in which chair will depend on the parliamentary seat distribution. Almost inevitably, some of the heaviest maneuvering will involve the rigorously religious parties, which will want to be included in any new government, for they exist to obtain state funds for their schools and other institutions. They are presumed to be in a weaker than normal position in this election because of the large numbers of overwhelmingly secular Jews from former Soviet territory.
Before long, the political game may get even rougher for these parties. The next vote, which is not scheduled until 1996 but could come sooner, will feature the direct election of the Prime Minister for the first time.
In theory, it should make the national leader a far more powerful figure and reduce the king-making leverage of small parties, including the religious.

HEADLINE: Black Neighborhood Faces White World With Bitterness

SERIES: 2 Neighborhoods, 2 Worlds -- Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 21

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, black hopes and white fears were on a collision course in picket-fenced neighborhoods around the nation as blacks pursued the dream of integration and whites ran from it. What resulted were places like Mount Greenwood and Roseland, two working-class neighborhoods in Chicago two miles apart, one now as black as the other is white.
Sebron and Marian (Mother) Jones did not want it this way. For them, Roseland represented a ticket out of the ghetto, and a yard of their own. They were one of the first black families on their block and could not wait to plant the irises and invite company over to see the neighborhood. 
 "It was trees meeting trees," Mrs. Jones remembers wistfully.
 
Integration to Segregation
 But in the end, integration meant watching white neighbors move out as fast as they could and services and businesses go with them. Twenty years later, without even moving, the Joneses are in a virtually all-black community again, back on the other side of the wall between the races now symbolized by the Los Angeles riot.
The white evacuation was so rapid that it left huge gaps in the neighborhood that have never been filled. Houses stayed vacant or were rented at rock-bottom prices set by absentee landlords. Department stores left and drug dealers moved in. Never seeming to get the money or attention they needed, the library, the schools, the parks went downhill.
Now the Joneses can hear gunshots from their dinner table and have seen drugs being sold next door. "You could sit in your kitchen and watch them selling drugs outside that back window," Mrs. Jones said. "They would look you due in the eye and keep stepping. It hurts your heart to pieces."
In many ways, people in Roseland and Mount Greenwood lead similar lives: blue-collar, bowling-on-Saturday, church-on-Sunday lives, passing each other only on street corners or in the produce line.
But it is Roseland residents who pay a high price for this segregation. They are rejected for mortgages at three times the rate of Mount Greenwood residents of the same income. They pay as much as twice the automobile insurance rates that people in Mount Greenwood do. They have to travel several miles, usually to white areas, to buy fresh meat and vegetables because there are no major grocery stores for Roseland's 56,000 people, while Mount Greenwood's 19,000 residents have two.
It is disparities like these that lead many in Roseland to regard whites with bitterness and distrust.
Even when the numbers look even, things still work against Roseland. The Chicago police assign the same number of officers to both communities. Not only does Roseland have nearly three times the number of residents that Mount Greenwood does, its crime rate is also much higher. As a result its police patrols number 51 per 1,000 crimes while Mount Greenwood has 118 patrols per 1,000 crimes, a study by the University of Illinois found.
Many whites in Mount Greenwood say that blacks in Roseland could pull themselves up if they wanted to. They point with pride to the new branch library that opened a year ago in Mount Greenwood after years of community efforts that won them the support of powerful officials in the state capital and City Hall to finance it.
People in Roseland say they do not have those connections. Both branches belong to the Chicago Public Library system. While Mount Greenwood's library has private typewriting booths and compact discs to borrow, there is not even toilet paper in the restrooms or doors on the stalls of Roseland's library. The children in Roseland read "Rumpelstiltskin" beneath gashes of peeling paint rising above the fairy-tale section. The staff is so small, with just two librarians on some days that if one is sick, the library has to close.
Every week, Roseland residents come in asking if the branch has computers or typewriters or videotapes to borrow like other libraries. The answer is always no.
"The reason they're coming to us is because they don't have them at home," said Melnee Simmons, the head librarian there. "They have sense enough to know that these things are available, but not to them."
For the past year, half the shelves at Roseland's library have been empty. Books have been packed away in anticipation of a promised renovation that for 15 years was supposed to happen any minute. Now there is talk that it might really happen this summer. Mrs. Simmons has been telling staff members to believe it when they see it.
 
Obsessions
Roseland Has Special Road Map
 Most blacks in Roseland do not have a lot of formal education but feel they have earned graduate degrees in race relations.
For them, race is a daily topic of conversation. What whites do and think and want is a life obsession and a matter of survival. Most of them have to work for whites, shop with whites and venture into white neighborhoods for services they cannot get at home.
They say they confront the stereotypes that Mount Greenwood residents seem to live by every time they step over the wall. They say they have come to expect a negative reaction, but they never get used to it. No matter how many times they are called a name or stopped by the police, one resident said, "It's like a bomb drops inside of you."
Elsie Melvin, a registered nurse, said she has had white patients who have refused to let her touch them. "They don't care how sick they are," she said. "They'll say, 'I don't want any colored nurse working on me.' "
Christopher Jones, a bus driver who is not related to Sebron and Marian Jones, said white passengers have spit on him on his bus route through white neighborhoods. As a child, whites chased him out of their neighborhood as he rode his bicycle.
Now when he and his wife, Regina, have to drive through white neighborhoods, they make sure they have a full tank of gas and enough air in the tires. "We look at it as if we're going to another state," Mrs. Jones said.
A few years ago, Jeannette Raggs, a postal worker, and her husband, Clemmie, were invited a few years ago to the wedding reception of one white co-worker. They walked in to see that the party was all white.
"The music stopped playing, everyone turned to look at us," Mr. Raggs said.
Then the father of the bride greeted them from across the room.
" 'What youse people want?' " Mr. Raggs recalled the man shouting. "Then the bride came up and said she had invited us, that she worked with my wife. Only then did that ugly, hatred look leave his face."
 
Ghosts
Stores and Jobs Are Memories
 As hard as Roseland residents work to keep the irises blooming, this is still a neighborhood defined in part by what it used to be.
Up and down Michigan Avenue and across 111th Street in Roseland, there are the ghosts of a once white neighborhood -- the Rose Bowl bowling alley, the old Gately's department store, the empty theater plastered with posters of missing children, the old flower shops and hardware stores that now sell wigs and Stroh's beer.
"This strip was booming, a gold mine," said Willie Lomax, executive director of a community group. "There were shoe repair shops, fabric stores, five hardware stores. We had restaurants with valet parking and A-1 service. Those were the days."
A few blocks away, young men sit out on porch steps with nothing to do. The occasional spit-shiny Cadillac, trimmed in gold, cruises down the street. Drug dealers, the homeowners say under their breath, cursing them as they pass.
The fathers and grandfathers of many of these young men were the meatpackers and steelworkers who came to Roseland to be near the plants and make a better life for their families. Now the plants are gone and so are the jobs.
Just outside Roseland's borders, halfway between Roseland and Mount Greenwood, is the steel plant graveyard.
Next to it sits a parking lot as long as an airport landing strip, now overrun by bushes and weeds. "All this was employees," Mr. Lomax said. "Three shifts."
Across the street are some concrete beams and rubble surrounded by grassland. "You're looking at Dutch Boy paint factory," Mr. Lomax said. "The young men you see hanging out on the corner weren't even born when this closed."
That has left residents like 28-year-old Darryl Gibson are at the economic margins. It used to ride take him two and a half hours on the bus to get to his last job earning $6 an hour as a forklift operator. He was laid off last August and has not found another job since. His family lives off his wife Linda's salary as a sales clerk.
"It's hard when you have a wife and family, and you want to do right, but don't have much education," Mr. Gibson said. "Everyone can't be a doctor or a lawyer. Everyone is not going to finish college. Everyone doesn't have connections. There should be something out there for people like us."
 
Scars
Years of Hurt Shape a Moment
 While many whites in Mount Greenwood look at race with detachment and broad-brush stereotypes, most blacks in Roseland see it is a very personal matter. They are convinced that whites neither know them nor care to.
Their attitudes are shaped by vivid, demoralizing encounters with whites from childhood to the present. For some, the wounds are so deep that seemingly harmless incidents can take on major significance.
Mr. Raggs once stood silently for several moments minutes after a white cashier put his nickels and quarters on the counter. A line formed behind him. The cashier, flustered, asked what was wrong. "You give me my money in my hand like I gave it to you," Mr. Raggs said.
Whites in Mount Greenwood see that kind of reaction as hypersensitivity. They say that something like that could happen to anybody. Blacks in Roseland can see such an incident as a final straw after a lifetime of indignities and one chance where they can demand the respect they may not get elsewhere.
"They can't even imagine what it's like to be black," said Myshawn Davis, a 25-year-old hairdresser who was chased off the schoolbus growing up in an all-white suburb. "They don't know what we go through. You try not to let this stuff drive you crazy. You'd be trying to kill every white person in the world."
While the great-grandparents of people in Mount Greenwood were learning the ways of America and starting small businesses in Irish and Italian ghettos, the great-grandparents of people in Roseland were earning pennies as sharecroppers in Mississippi or scrubbing white people's floors in Chicago.
And so blacks in Roseland say they do not want to hear about bootstraps and the work ethic. "Their fathers and grandfathers came of their own free will," Sebron Jones said. "Even if they didn't own slaves themselves, they didn't work for free," Mr. Jones said. "They got paid all those years we didn't."
There is quiet pain in the voice of his wife, Marian, as she remembers being 11 years old and going to do housework for a white woman. At about noon, the woman ordered her to stop washing the dishes.
"She made me go down into the dark basement," Mrs. Jones said. "Her husband had come home for lunch, and he didn't want any blacks in his house. I had to sit on the stairway and not move until he finished eating. When he was gone, she let me back up, and I went back to washing the dishes."
It has been more than 50 years, and she says she can still see the steps. "It gave me low self-esteem," she said. "I'm just now coming out of it."

In the end, however, integration meant watching white neighbors move out as fast as they could, taking vital services and businesses with them. The center of the south Chicago neighborhood is now dotted with vacant theaters and department stores. (Photographs by Andrea Mohin/The New York Times) (pg. B7)

HEADLINE: WALL STREET BOOM FAILS TO BOLSTER REGION'S ECONOMY

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Flush with profits that have surpassed the best years of the booming 1980's, Wall Street is offering glimmers of hope for the battered economies of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, but so far has failed to lift the region out of its recession.
For those who work at investment banking firms, brokerage houses and elsewhere in the securities industry, 1992 has so far proven a romp. Despite the steep decline in stock values last week, trading volume, profits and paychecks in the industry, which the Government said reached an average of more than $83,000 last year, have all set records. 
 Historically, when Wall Street prospers, so does the region.
 
Just Tunnel, No Light
 But for now, the securities industry shows few signs of sharing its resurgent wealth. Hiring is anemic, and even the brokers, bankers and financial advisers who are awash in lofty salaries and year-end bonuses have adopted a far more conservative approach to spending than in the go-for-broke period of the mid-80's.
"The spillover is not there yet," said Jeffrey M. Schaefer, director of research for the Securities Industry Association, a trade group that analyzes the results of the 316 firms that are members of the New York Stock Exchange.
A torrent of department-store closings and personal bankruptcy filings, high office vacancy rates and other economic problems across the region demonstrate that there is little hope that economic recovery is at hand, even while other parts of the country are starting to shake loose of the recession.
 
The First Step
 Still, "the securities industry has traditionally been a leading indicator," said David Brauer, an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Like other analysts, he points to the stock-market crash of 1987 as the blow that pushed the region into recession, now its longest since the 1930's.
According to economists and executives in many fields, if the resurgence in the securities industry continues, it is all but certain to spill over into law firms, financial publishers, restaurants, travel agencies, clothing stores and hundreds of other businesses.
"By itself, Wall Street cannot lift us out of recession, but it looks like it is going to make a start," said Matthew P. Drennan, an economist and urban planner at Cornell University.
Yet it seems unlikely that Wall Street will soon regain the economic clout it once had. Since 1988, firms have cut their employment with unbridled fervor, eliminating 38,000 jobs in New York City alone. That has left a lean industry of 125,000 workers in the city, and one that offers little prospect of hiring back the legion that was lost.
"Management is constantly questioning whether revenues will dry up, and they are keeping the head count under control," said Samuel G. Liss, an analyst for Salomon Brothers who follows the securities industry.
In contrast to the early 1980's, when profitability surged and employment rolls swelled by 20 percent a year, Mr. Liss estimates that hiring this year may add 10 percent more workers throughout the securities industry, but no more.
"A big reason that firms are doing well is that they have cut their payrolls extensively," said Peter Drummond-Hay, managing director of Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive search company on Wall Street. "They've learned a hard lesson and are not about to unlearn it quickly."
One sector of the economy that is benefiting from the securities industry upturn, if only slightly, is real estate.
"There is a bit more of a free-spending mood," said Clark Halstead, president of the Halstead Property Company, a broker of Manhattan apartments. He said demand had increased since January, particularly among executives working on Wall Street, who have shown a preference for five- to seven-room cooperatives priced from $400,000 to $600,000.
"It seemed like they were all getting fired in '90 and '91 and now they are getting bonuses again," he said. But he said the spurt of demand has fallen far short of resurrecting Manhattan home values, which have fallen by 25 percent since 1987.
 
Office Space Still Empty
 Huge amounts of office space are still begging for tenants, particularly on Wall Street and the surrounding blocks of the financial district. Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial brokerage, said the vacancy rate in the district's most modern and prestigious buildings had improved slightly in the first three months of the year, but remained at 16 percent, far above the level during most of the 1980's.
Office vacancy rates for regional centers of business activity supporting Wall Street also remain at much higher levels; 18 percent in midtown Manhattan, 22 percent in Stamford, Conn., and 33 percent in Jersey City.
In personal spending, Wall Street executives have done relatively little to pump up the local economy.
"These people are not buying art collections or Ferraris," said Perrin Long, a securities-industry analyst who left Wall Street in 1989 and now follows the industry for the First of Michigan Corporation of Detroit. "They are not trying to double or triple their salaries by jumping from one firm to the other, and they are even beginning to think it may not be ethically correct to brag about making over $1 million a year."
Austerity is too strong a word for an industry in which year-end bonuses often come in six-figure checks, easily exceeding the life savings of a typical American family. But on Wall Street, ostentatious displays of consumption are definitely out.
 
Fridays Only for Lunch
 At Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, one of the largest law firms serving Wall Street, associates received a memo recently spelling out when they can take summer law school interns to lunch. Only Fridays are allowed.
The firm also provided a list of recommended restaurants. Hamburger Harry's and Tommy Tang's are on it. But the far tonier Bouley and Montrachet are "discouraged," the firm said.
From Drake Beam Morin Inc., an executive placement firm, comes word of a new fashion statement by Wall Street's denizens, who in the past shopped for their workaday wardrobe at Brooks Brothers, Barneys, or, if a stopover in London allowed, on Savile Row.
"Suddenly these guys are going to Macy's or Abraham & Straus," said John A. Artise, the company's vice president. If the new view of fashion is causing confusion, he added, it is only for those who still think expensive tastes are in vogue.
"We're telling our clients that if they have a $700 suit, it's O.K. to wear it, but don't flaunt the label," he said.
Painting and sculpture, virtually de rigueur for Wall Street corridors of the 1980's, have lost some of their appeal.
"Almost all business has cut back on extras, and that includes art," said Irving Blum, co-owner of the Blum Helman Gallery in Manhattan. On Wall Street, he said, art purchases "are in a malaise."
 
'Power Office Is Out'
 Another insight into the new attitude comes in interior design. Where the executive of the 1980's might have expected a rich budget to refurbish his or her work space, often with a preference for leather couches and mahogany paneling, "the power office is out," said Margo Grant, managing director of Gensler & Associates, a large Manhattan architecture and design concern.
"The rule now is this: don't spend money on image building," she said. "They want computer terminals that work, air-conditioning and a little sprucing up. That's it."
While Wall Street holds to a more conservative ethic, at least for the moment, conditions have clearly turned robust.
One broad measure is provided by the Securities Industry Association, which said net income for the New York Stock Exchange's member firms soared in 1991 to $5.85 billion from a loss of $162 million the year earlier. No previous year has come close to 1991 in profitability, except 1986, when the industry had a net income of $5.51 billion.
The association said earnings continued to accelerate in the first three months of this year, when its member firms counted $2.06 billion in profits.
 
Back to the Basics
 Experts said the surging profits came in the absence of the wave of mergers, hostile takeovers and leveraged buyouts that accounted for a large share of the investment-banking fees of the 1980's. Instead, they said, the upturn was fueled principally by a spurt in initial public offerings and the the growth of Wall Street's most basic business: trading in stocks and bonds.
Paychecks on Wall Street have risen too. According to the Federal Government, the average earnings among New York City securities industry workers, including everyone from messengers and secretaries to the partners in large firms, was at least $83,000 in 1991.
But the figure was only an estimate, based on paychecks for the first nine months of the year, and did not include year-end bonus checks. "It is a good assumption that 1991 compensation was a good deal higher than in 1990," when it averaged $82,000, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The Government's data portray a securities industry that remains slow to hire and may still be eliminating workers. "The restructuring may not have run its course," Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
Although more recent data are not available, he said, employment in the securities industry in New York City fell by 5,000 last year, despite expanding profits.
Still, the downsizing of Wall Street since 1988 has been modest compared with previous periods of retrenchment, according to Federal studies. Between 1969 and 1975, a period of war, inflation, recession and listless trading on the stock exchanges, the industry cut its work force by almost 40 percent, from 106,000 to 66,000.
"This is the closest thing we have to an economic roller coaster," Mr. Ehrenhalt said. If the Wall Street upturn continues, he added, "it will create a wave that affects a very substantial part of the New York economy."
In one small spurt of expansion, Wall Street firms have returned to a summer ritual of intensively recruiting business-school students as interns. Although some of the firms decline to disclose their plans, industry executives estimated that 750 students have been hired for this summer, double last year's number.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Clinton Unveils His Economic Blueprint

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 21

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton, seeking to hone his campaign message, proposed an economic plan today that called for sharp increases in taxes on the rich and on corporations, and major revisions and reallocations of government spending of all kinds.
Mr. Clinton, the winner of the Democratic primary campaign, refined and attached price tags to ideas he has mentioned before, and he also made some significant new proposals. 
 He said that as President he would propose cutting the Federal deficit by $150 billion, roughly half the 1993 deficit estimated by the Congressional Budget office, by 1996.
Missing from the new plan was any mention of Mr. Clinton's claim during the primaries that he would be able to balance the budget within four years.
But he said that in that period he would come up with $200 billion, through tax increases and budget cuts, to expand or begin a number of Federal programs, including efforts to clean the environment and rebuild the nation's deteriorating transportation and communication systems.
 
Higher Taxes on Wealthy
 "It's time to put people first," Mr. Clinton declared when announcing his plan in a campaign appearance here.
He did not offer specifics on tax increases for the wealthy other than to say that the top 2 percent of the nation's taxpayers would be hit hardest, along with foreign corporations that had subsidiaries in the United States but now avoided many taxes.
As he did earlier in the campaign, Mr. Clinton also proposed relief for middle-class taxpayers, who he said had suffered special economic hardship in the past decade. But he has now abandoned the flat 10 percent cut he had emphasized in the primary campaign, proposing instead a system of tax credits based on family size. He offered no specifics.
 
Some Big-Spending Plans
 The Governor is a moderate who has spent much of the 1992 campaign condemning big Government spending, including programs enacted by a Congress his own party controls. But today, from the rear of a three-way Presidential race and struggling to define himself, Mr. Clinton offered some big spending proposals of his own.
"My national economic strategy puts people first by investing more than $50 billion each year for the next four years, while cutting the deficit in half," Mr. Clinton said. "These investments will create millions of high-wage jobs and help America compete in the global economy."
He caustically criticized the economic policies of the Reagan and Bush Administrations, calling them a selfish effort to help the wealthy at the expense of the rest of the nation, particularly the middle class.
"For 12 years," he said, "the driving idea behind American economic policy has been cutting taxes on the richest individuals and corporations and hoping that their new wealth would 'trickle down' to the rest of us. This policy has failed."
 
Old Ideas, New Emphasis
 The new Clinton economic strategy includes many previously proposed elements, like expanding education programs, tightening welfare rules, providing affordable health care and streamlining government programs and the Federal bureaucracy. Many of his ideas have been advocated in one form or another by other candidates in the 1992 campaign.
What was particularly different in today's plan, at least from Mr. Clinton's viewpoint, was the emphasis on taxing the rich and corporations, sharply reducing the budget deficit over four years and finding $200 billion for new programs, with almost half that money going into cleaning up the environment and renovating the nation's transportation and communications systems.
"To create millions of high-wage jobs and smooth our transition from a defense- to a commercial-based economy," the Governor said, "we will rebuild America and develop the world's best communication, transportation and environmental systems. As a prominent part of our commitment to put people first, we will create a Rebuild America Fund, with a $20 billion Federal investment each year for four years, leveraged with state, local, private sector and pension fund contributions."
 
Regulating Lobbyists
 The Clinton proposal also included new suggestions about ways to reduce the influence of lobbyists in Washington and ways to ease military personnel back into civilian life as the size of the armed forces is reduced.
He called for regulations that would require lobbyists to disclose more about their contacts and their campaign gifts, asserting it was necessary "to attack the problem at its source -- entrenched power and money."
He proposed hiring veterans to do much of the work building roads, phone networks and pollution control systems. That approach, he said, would insure "that the communities and the millions of talented workers that won the Cold War don't get left out in the cold."
All told, Mr. Clinton proposed almost $300 billion in Government savings over the next four years. Cuts in existing programs would account for about $140 billion of that, with the Defense Department taking the largest hit, more than $50 billion. He did not enumerate specific cuts in military agencies or programs.
Tax increases on the wealthy would account for another $90 billion of the $300 billion. And new taxes on corporations would bring in about $60 billion.
 
$60 Billion for Education
 The Governor also proposed spending about $50 billion over the next four years on urban housing, inner-city economic development and an extra 100,000 police officers nationwide. He proposed spending more than $20 billion on tax breaks for the middle class and the poor. And he called for spending more than $60 billion on education programs, including programs for preschool-age children and college loans for high school graduates.
Mr. Clinton said Congress must "guarantee every American the right to quality, affordable health care," and he proposed strict government monitoring of health-care costs and billing. But though health care is one of the hottest issues in the 1992 campaign, he gave only a very general description of his plan and set no costs.
 
Health-Care Plan
 "My health care plan is simple in concept but revolutionary in scope," he said. "First we will move to radically control costs by changing incentives, reducing paperwork and cracking down on drug and insurance company practices. As costs drop, we will phase in guaranteed universal access -- through employer or public programs -- to basic medical coverage. Companies will be required to insure their employees, with Federal assistance in the early years to help them meet their obligations."
Mr. Clinton said he would begin his overhaul of government at the very top of the bureaucratic heap, reducing the White House staff immediately by 25 per cent.
"Millions of hard-working Americans struggle to make ends meet while their Government no longer fights for their values or their interests," he said. "This betrayal of democracy must stop."

In the lonely shadows of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, hermit monks live in spartan huts and go for a week at a time without conversation. But the prayerful silence of the Carmelite monastery here is often shattered by fighter jets zooming overhead.
As troops and planes are being recalled from overseas, and the military budget shrinks, the Air Force is trying to expand its share of air space around the country for training missions. The Air Force reasons it can save time and fuel by holding these missions closer to air bases rather than in faraway areas designated for training. 
 But residents of Crestone and the surrounding San Luis Valley complain that the missions flown by Colorado Air National Guard planes destroy the quiet of these Colorado wilds, creating the atmosphere of a war zone.
"These jets come thundering out of nowhere and really frighten you," said Brother Thomas Crutcher, a member of the Carmelite monastery. In one case, he said, a monk was so startled by the sudden roar that he lost his balance and nearly fell from a 30-foot bell tower.
 
Blown Off Bicycles
 A schoolteacher said she had seen children knocked off bicycles by the force of the wind currents from flying jets. Others say jets have buzzed cars, pick-ups and cattle.
The Colorado Air National Guard's fleet of 26 F-16 jets flies out of the Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora, a suburb of Denver about 150 miles away. The F-16's, which were used in the Persian Gulf, are much faster and, residents say, noisier than the A-7 models they replaced. A sonic boom caused by an F-16 last month rattled windows and knocked dishes from counter tops.
The Colorado Air National Guard, a division of the Air Force, says the boom was caused by a pilot who flew over the region at an inappropriate speed. The F-16 jets can accelerate to twice the speed of sound. The pilot has been reprimanded, said Maj. Thomas Schultz, a Guard spokesman.
For almost two decades the Air Force has used the skies over this stretch of countryside as a pathway to more distant training areas. Now it wants to change the designation of the region from a training path to a "military operation area," to be called the Red Eye Complex.
 
More Planes at One Time
 That would increase the number of flights over the area -- there were about 1,000 last year -- by about 10 percent. But it would also provide for jet exercises that last 30 minutes and allow for air drills on 10 days a year involving up to 50 planes.
Finally, the new plan calls for training missions to drop a chemical substance from planes to confuse the weapons' guidance systems of enemy aircraft. Residents say the substance, called chaff, consisting of silica and aluminum with a stearic acid coating, would pollute the environment.
The military also wants new flight training areas in Massachusetts and Idaho as well as other parts of the country. Pentagon policy calls for the training areas to be away from buildings.
The Air Force has hired a private concern to conduct an environmental study to determine if a flight training area would do any harm here. If no hazards were foreseen, the plan would be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration for approval.
 
Hazard and Annoyance
 Residents here have formed what they call the Open Space Alliance to fight the Air Force's request. They contend that the proposal would add to the hazards and annoyances that the area already endures as a flight pathway. They also say that the flights would be a further hazard to the endangered peregrine falcon and bald eagle, as well as to a host of other wildlife. And they question the need for such military training, especially with the cold war over.
The switch to the F-16 jets created 80 new jobs at the air base. But residents here say they are reaping no economic benefit.
"To the contrary, it's hurting our economy, which is largely based on tourism," said Robert Phillio, a real estate agent who is running for a post on the county commission. A large draw for tourists in the area is the National Sand Dunes Monument recreation area.
As a concession to the residents, the Colorado Air National Guard has agreed that its planes will fly no lower than 500 feet if the training area is approved. The normal "floor" at training areas is 100 feet. At present the planes are supposed to fly no lower than 500 feet, but residents say they often do.
Major Schultz said the training area would be no more annoying for residents than the current flight conditions. "In fact, we will be doing more high-level flights," he said, "so they might even notice it less than they do now."
Major Schultz allowed that residents were justified to complain about buzzing and other inappropriate flying. The Colorado Air National Guard has set up a toll-free telephone number for such complaints.
But he added: "We have the obligation to provide for a strong, ready force. Some people say, 'Not in my backyard.' Well, whose backyard do they think should have it?"
The residents of this small community are so angry about the Air Force plan that they have started a newspaper, The Red Eye Sentinel, which includes a regular column of "eyewitness encounters" with jets. Some residents say the jets have flown so low that they can see the pilots' teeth.
 
$342,000 Injury Settlement
 "They keep telling us, 'Relax, it's not going to be any worse,' " said Kate Steichen, the leader of the opposition. "And we're telling them: 'It's already terrible the way it is. And you want to do more.' "
Groups that monitor military jet traffic offer evidence that the training flights pose a danger for residents. A Reno woman who was buzzed by a military jet won a $342,000 suit from the Government last year. The woman, Leslie Bunch, said she had been startled by a low-flying aircraft and lost control of her pick-up. Ms. Bunch, who was pregnant at the time, suffered a miscarriage and four broken ribs. Her two sons, ages 3 and 4, were also injured.
"We're seeing major plans for military air-space expansion around the country right now," said Grace Bukowkski of the Rural Alliance for Military Accountability in Nevada, a private watchdog group. "Rural areas are being asked to bear the burden of our national defense."
Brother Crutcher said his fellow monks at the Carmelite monastery would be forced to leave if the new flight plan is approved.
"We came here because we needed to get away from the noise," he said. "This is a matter of life and death for us. If they put this through, we simply won't be able to stay."

3 Dailies Join Hands to Cut Cost of News

BYLINE: By Alex S. Jones

 BODY:
INCREASINGLY, newspapers in a specific region sell advertising cooperatively. But three New Jersey dailies are trying to apply the same principle to news coverage.
The Record, which covers much of northern New Jersey from its base in Hackensack, and The News Tribune in Woodbridge, both owned by the Borg family, are on the verge of pooling some news coverage with The Asbury Park Press, owned by the Plangere family. 
 Malcolm A. Borg, chairman of his family's newspaper operation, Macromedia Inc., said he had already effectively merged the news operations of The Record and The News Tribune so that reporters from both papers do not cover the same event or issue separately.
"We're finally going to not reinvent the wheel," Mr. Borg said.
For instance, a single page for regional and national sports will be prepared for both papers; rather than having two papers cover Giants games, one will do the job. Mr. Borg said that reducing costs in a depressed advertising market was an objective of the effective merger.
Similarly, Mr. Borg and E. Donald Lass, publisher of The Asbury Park Press, plan to pool resources to cover the national political conventions and the Summer Olympics. If that works, the next step might be to produce a joint travel section that would cost more than either paper could afford on its own, and for each paper to swap articles of interest.
But Mr. Lass said The Press and the Borg papers would reserve the right to send their own reporters to the other's turf.
"We're very sensitive to losing control," said Mr. Lass. His paper would not swap enterprise and investigative articles with The News Herald, a direct competitor, or The Record, which is based about 50 miles away.
Reporters generally abhor pooled coverage because it blunts the joy of beating rivals. Editors often hate it because they have little ability to direct another publication's reporters and the standards of one paper may be quite different from another.
While newspapers within a chain routinely swap articles, the papers are rarely regional rivals.
Mr. Borg said the pooling effort was aimed at a common rival of all New Jersey dailies: The Star-Ledger of Newark, whose resources far outstrip the smaller papers.
"It's a defense against The Star-Ledger, no question about it," Mr. Borg said.
 
Hawking Papers
 "I'm seeing signs of an early spring thaw, but water is not cascading down the mountains," said Lee Dirks, a newspaper broker, of the climate for buying and selling newspapers, which has been in a deep freeze for three years.
Mr. Dirks, president of Lee Dirks & Associates in Birmingham, Mich., said that there had been a change in the market in recent months. Prospective buyers were beginning to sniff the air for prey, he said, and some of the stronger regional banks were aggressively making it known that they had money available to finance newspaper purchases.
But prospective sellers are still hanging back, disappointed at the prices that their papers are now likely to bring.
"Sellers are for the most part aware that they are unlikely to ever see the kinds of multiples in the late 80's," Mr. Dirks said. For instance, a 50,000-circulation newspaper in a growing market might sell for four to four and a half times annual revenues, compared with a 1987 price of five to six times revenues.
And these multiples would apply only to the most desirable papers, with a great potential for growth.
A very small daily with 9,000 circulation might bring as little as one to one and a half times revenues.
The difference in price reflects, in many cases, a big difference in the profit margins that the two types of papers could be expected to produce.
A study published in the spring issue of The Journal of Media Economics, a publication of California State University at Fullerton, found a great disparity in average profit margins among newspapers of different sizes.
The study compared papers of different circulations from 1978 to 1988, a decade that included both fat and lean years for advertising.
The study reported that average profit margins ranged from 6.4 percent at daily papers with less than 10,000 circulation to a high of 19 percent for those with 25,000 to 50,000 circulation. Those exceeding 50,000 circulation were almost as high, at 18.9 percent.
Mr. Dirks said these averages seemed generally accurate to him, though some papers might do considerably better or worse.
But, he said, profit margins of newspapers with circulations exceeding 100,000 would be lower than the 18.9 percent found for all papers over 50,000, because the overhead for the largest papers tended to squeeze profit margins.
 
Neuharth's Modesty
 In the matter of Allen H. Neuharth's thoughts on Ross Perot, it may have been a case of "it takes one to know a bigger one."
Mr. Neuharth, chairman of the Freedom Forum and former chairman of the Gannett Company, has never been accused of having low self-esteem. For instance, he titled his memoirs "Confessions of an S.O.B." Like Mr. Perot, he is a can-do maverick who ignores criticism and does not shrink from spending lots of money to accomplish his ends.
For example, in the last year, the Freedom Forum -- formerly the Gannett Foundation until Mr. Neuharth changed its name -- has become one of the world's most open-handed givers in the name of the organization's (Neuharth-inspired) slogan: "free press, free speech, free spirit."
The Freedom Forum now has six offices, including a new base in Zurich and a First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. And in Washington, the forum is planning to open a "Newseum," which will be a museum of newspapers and journalism.
The forum, with assets of $700 million and an annual budget of $35 million, has also financed a number of grants, fellowships, seminars and other projects, including a billboard with the message "Freedom Works" in Red Square in Moscow.
Such freewheeling and free-spending habits suggested that Mr. Neuharth might have special insights into Mr. Perot, and he was asked his opinion of the undeclared Presidential candidate last week at the Freedom Forum's trustees dinner.
After reflecting for a moment, Mr. Neuharth issued his evaluation: "His ego is even bigger than mine."

WALL STREET REBOUND COULD PAY DIVIDENDS 
 Flush with profits that have surpassed the best years of the booming 1980's, Wall Street is offering glimmers of hope for the battered economies of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, but so far has failed to lift the region out of its recession. Experts say that the resurgence could spill over into law firms, financial publishers, restaurants, travel agencies, clothing stores and hundreds of other businesses. "By itself, Wall Street cannot lift us out of recession, but it looks like it is going to make a start," said Matthew P. Drennan, an economist and urban planner at Cornell University. A1.
 
A CITY, A PROBLEM, AND AN ENIGMA
Fearing that an onslaught of ground food pulp would overpower its intricate, 13,000-mile underground network of water mains and sewers -- New York City remains the only major city in the United States to ban the use of the kitchen garbage disposer. Although many Staten Island residents and some in Queens who have modern sewer connections may use them, the reasons why the other six or seven million New Yorkers in Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn and most of Queens continue to lead disposerless lives are so varied, complex and confusing that it is nearly impossible to find a city official who can explain them. A1.
 
NOXIOUS ODORS RANKLE HARLEM RESIDENTS
Embittered by years of indifference and questionable promises, a consortium of New York environmental groups, community organizations and Harlem residents plan to sue the city to force an end to the incapacitating odors that have become the hallmark of the city's newest sewage plant on the Hudson River in Harlem. If it succeeds, the suit could force New York to spend as much as $100 million in immediate repairs to the plant, and millions more for the severe "physical and psychological discomfort it has caused" local residents. B3.
 
SLIWA ACCUSES POLICE OF FOOT-DRAGGING
Lisa Sliwa accused detectives from the Ninth Precinct in New York City of dragging their heels in investigating the shooting of her husband, Curtis, and has called on Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown to appoint detectives from another precinct to take over the case. B3.
 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOES TO COURT
Like many people in the region, Renee Coleman looked long, hard and unsuccessfully for affordable housing. But the Long Island resident's search did not end with her dissappointment. She filed a lawsuit, one that could transform local zoning regulations and racial segregation patterns in New York State. That was eight years ago. After endless rounds in lower courts her attorney is asking Court of Appeals to hear the case. Metro Matters, B2.
 
REGION
 
EXXON SUSPECT LOVED HIGH LIFE
Several days before his arrest on charges of kidnapping an Exxon executive, Arthur Seale visited the luxurious South Carolina resort of Hilton Head Island, reminisced about his life there in the mid-80's and mused about living there again and buying a a marina. "He was very likeable, very open, and very friendly," said a woman who had dined with him at the resort. "We had every indication he and his wife were considering moving here." B5.
 
SUFFOLK COUNTY POLICE JUMP SHIP
More than 250 Suffolk County police officers, fearing reduced pension benefits, have filed for retirement within the last two weeks as Suffolk legislators debated an across-the-board pay cut for all county employees. The Legislature is expected to vote this week on the pay issue and a proposal by the county executive to lay off 1,300 county workers, including 300 police officers. B5.
 
CONTRACT AGREEMENT AT CON ED
After 11th-hour negotiations prevented a possible strike by 13,000 Consolidated Edison workers, union officials confidently predicted that a tentative four-year pact would be overwhelmingly ratified by union members. B5.
 
SLOW TRAIN TO ROMANCE
Frank Field spent 20 years working for other people's railroads. Now, he runs his own. The six-and-a-half minute ride, at a maximum speed of 8 miles per hour, is an encounter with the romance of the rails and a monument to one engineer's search for perfection. B5.

New Linkage Hinders Aid for Russia

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
The concept of "linkage" used to be at the center of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, as concessions on one issue often had to be compensated by the other side's backing down somewhere else.
The idea now may be passe diplomatically. But it is at the heart of political dealings between President Bush and House Democrats over aid to the nations of the former Soviet Union. The Democrats insist they won't help Russia and the rest if President Bush won't support their efforts to help Americans. 
As they have demonstrated on issues from abortion to balanced budgets, each side can thwart the other. But they have little recent experience working together to get laws enacted.
So despite Boris N. Yeltsin's smash-hit appearance before Congress Wednesday, with the reassurance it offered lawmakers of his commitment to economic reform, hopes for fast action on a substantial aid package may actually have suffered a setback later that day. After weeks of argument, Democrats gave in to President Bush, agreeing on an emergency urban bill $1 billion smaller than they wanted.
High-ranking Congressional aides said Mr. Bush "nickel and dimed us" and now must prove his bona fides by accepting their permanent changes in unemployment compensation and a serious long-term urban program.
Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the appropriations subcommittee dealing with foreign aid, said it was not a question of legislative blackmail but of practical politics. If the country was not convinced that domestic problems were being attacked, there would never be support for aiding Mr. Yeltsin and his counterparts.
To the argument that the issues were not related, he scoffed that "the Administration needs a reality check." He said, "The guys who put this package together don't have to run for re-election."
One of the firmest supporters of aid to the former Soviet states, Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, was unimpressed. He accused the Democratic leaders of "gamesmanship" and said "the leadership is toying with U.S. national security interests." But he did see connection between cities and foreign aid, saying, "You can't aid the cities until you win the peace, and winning the peace requires a modest investment."
The issue will probably face two tests in Congress this week. President Bush's plan, centered on $12 billion in replenishment of the United States commitment to the International Monetary Fund, is likely to be voted on in the Senate. After some amendments to reduce Administration discretion in providing aid, it is expected to pass. "We have the horses for a very good vote in the Senate," said Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip.
The House is another story. There is $417 million in direct aid to the former Soviet states in the $13.8 billion foreign-aid appropriation scheduled for a Wednesday vote. That section may be attacked directly, but even if it is not, the whole bill might be defeated.
If it is beaten, Republicans will play a critical role in killing it. Because for all the public wrangling between Mr. Bush and House Democrats, foreign aid of all sorts is also held hostage by House Republicans. Few speak out in terms like those used by Senate Republicans like Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who said, "We have to support this man who is courageously fighting for change."
Representative Dave Nagle, Democrat of Iowa and another strong supporter of post-Soviet aid, said that to pass it, supporters would need 100 Republican votes of the 166 seats the minority party holds. Mr. Leach said he did not know how many Republicans would vote for the bill, but he insisted it would be irresponsible of the Democrats to hold back for lack of Republican allies.
Democrats are also peeved with Mr. Bush because they think he is not exerting himself to win Republican support. Mr. Obey said he saw no evidence of Presidential persuasion yet. "The President has to lead," said Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, the probable incoming chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
In the long run, and that may be as late as October when the Congress adjourns, everyone expects the proposal to be enacted.
"All of us recognize the politics of it are not easy," Mr. Hamilton said. But it is needed, he said, and in the long run it is "very difficult for me to believe that Congress will leave for the year without voting the package."

HEADLINE: Talk in Washington Heights: Fear, Drugs, and Now Corruption

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
Three generations of Adriano Espaillat's family have lived in the 34th Police Precinct in Washington Heights, a neighborhood where relatives' businesses have flourished and some still greet the family members by name when they walk down the street.
It is only when Mr. Espaillat thinks about the fourth generation -- his own children -- that he wonders whether it is time to concede that in the struggle between civility and the chaos created by the growing drug culture, the bad guys are winning. 
 Mr. Espaillat, a long-time community advocate, does not let his 11-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter play outside without him. He has witnessed shootings in broad daylight. His grandparents, in their 80's, were recently tied up and robbed at knife-point in their own apartment.
Fear, violence and, above all, drugs have come to dominate the streets of Washington Heights. Now, the Heights and the precinct, called in police argot the three-four, which usually leads the city in homicides, is the center of a Federal investigation into possible police corruption.
 
'It's a Little Discouraging'
 Mr. Espaillat and his wife have decided, as have many others who live and work here, that the best way to change their neighborhood is to stay and fight. And this is why reports of possible corruption among the police ranks in the 34th Precinct are especially disconcerting to them and other in Washington Heights.
"When you read stuff like that in the newspapers, it's a little discouraging," said Espaillat, who said he had no direct knowledge that such allegations are true.
Throughout the territory of the three-four, in the farthest northern reaches of Manhattan, residents and merchants say there is not an area in the city that is in more need of tougher and more effective law enforcement. Life in the three-four has become increasingly fearful, they say, and it will become desperate if not even the police are on the community's side.
Walking down Broadway, near 158th Street recently, Mr. Espaillat made his way through the noisy congested streets, past vendors hawking everything from fruit juices to brassieres. In the median park that runs through Broadway, men sat under trees, intent on dominoes matches. But even as lively Caribbean music wafted through the air along with the spicy scent of sancocho, the Dominican stew, there was an air of foreboding on this, one of the most notorious drug-dealing corners of the city, the police and residents say.
Young men linger on the sidewalk, lookouts for drug dealers. They call out, "Agua, agua," which means water in Spanish, when they see the police coming, or "Bajando, bajando," which means coming down.
"You see the drug dealers' sentries everywhere," said a juice vendor who would give his name only as Nicolas. "But what can we do? We have to work and there are few jobs." He said he would not be surprised if police officers were taking bribes.
In buildings that drug dealers have taken over, the police say, small, dirty apartments with little more than a table, white powder and the equipment to package it are the hub of a sophisticated network that provides one-stop shopping for an endless stream of customers.
 
Community Groups Join Fight
 Those in the community who are working to try to drive drugs out of the neighborhood also say they would not be surprised if some police officers had been corrupted by the drug trade, pointing out the openness with which it flourishes.
"I would rather not believe it but I wouldn't doubt it," said Lucille Bulger, who heads the Community League of West 159th Street Inc.
The group was founded 40 years ago by neighbors who wanted to raise money for children's activities. Now the group has found itself more involved, out of necessity, in trying to rid the neighborhood of drug dealers.
"Some of those drug dealers must have some sort of legal support to maintain their high level of income that they will kill for," Mrs. Bulger said, explaining why it would be possible that police are involved.
She has never seen it herself, she said, and in fact her group has actually worked together with the police to close down drug operations in the basement of buildings in the area. But she said the proliferation of drugs and the high stakes have filled many residents with terror.
"Citizens who may have information are afraid," Mrs. Bulger said. "The drug vendors involved in the whole operation don't give a damn about life. They'll shoot you in two shakes of a lamb's tail."
 
Community of Immigrants
 Washington Heights is a community of immigrants, many of them newly arrived and a great number from the Dominican Republic. Many are illegal immigrants and thus more vulnerable and less likely to go to the police with their complaints.
The neighborhood wasn't always so dangerous, Mrs. Bulger said. It used to be home to Irish and Jewish and later Puerto Rican and Cuban immigrants. Its elegant apartment buildings, especially along Edgecombe Avenue, were home to entertainers, writers and other artists, she said. Leslie Uggams lived there for a time, she said, when the area was referred to as Sugar Hill.
"I will never move out of here and I have never thought of moving out of here," Mrs. Bulger said.
"I believe that the biggest mistake that anyone who has enjoyed life in this community makes is to move out," she said. "Because if you move out, who would replace you? If people in the upper economic levels had been brave enough to live and stay here after they reach that level, this would not have become the community it is today."
 
Dominicans Faulted
 Many in the community also resent that when Washington Heights' drug problem is brought up it is often attributed to the growth of the Dominican population in the area.
"It is very easy to label Washington Heights the cocaine capital of New York," said Dr. Rafael Lantigua, one of the founders of the Alianza Dominicana, a civic group. "There are maybe seven or eight blocks that have a real drug problem, but the rest of the neighborhood is calm and quiet."
Dominicans now own many of the bodegas and other shops in the neighborhood, and they recently elected Guillermo Linares to the City Council when the revised city charter created a new district in Washington Heights.
Still, while Dominicans have turned parts of Washington Heights into a community of shared values and culture, the drug problem continues.
"When I walk down this street, I go very fast," said Marcia Botex, an 11-year resident, as she hurried down Broadway near 159th Street. "I don't look at anyone, or even window shop.
"I don't feel safe until I get to the hospital," she said, referring to Columbia-Presbyterian.
 
A Higher Degree
 Mr. Espaillat, who has lived in Washington Heights for 29 years, directs the Victims Services Agency there. He and his parents moved there from the Dominican Republic when he was 10 years old. His grandparents were already living in Washington Heights when he was born.
Mr. Espaillat ran against Mr. Linares for the City Council, and lost. During his campaign, he recalled, he saw a man shot in Washington Heights.
"It was a nice sunny day, and I saw a guy bleeding to death on the street. It was an ugly sight, and fearful," he said. "For families and people who have children, it's a very scary situation.
"I remember going down the stairs in the summertime to play stickball and then running upstairs when it was time to eat and my mother never worried," he said.
"Now you can't do that," he said.
"You can argue that it's that way in many New York neighborhoods, but the degree of fear and violence is higher here.
"But it's not like the community has given up," he said. "A lot of people are working to change it. I'm optimistic."

HEADLINE: Fearing Reduced Benefits, 250 Suffolk Officers Seek to Retire

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., June 21

 BODY:
More than 250 Suffolk County police officers, fearing reduced pension benefits, have filed for retirement within the last two weeks as Suffolk legislators debated an across-the-board pay cut for all county employees.
The County Legislature is expected to vote this week on the pay issue and an additional proposal by County Executive Robert Gaffney, a Republican, to lay off 1,300 county workers, including 300 police officers. The moves are required to win Albany's approval of a county proposal to borrow up to $91 million to close a $110 million budget gap in this year's $1.3 billion budget. 
 Police officers, uncertain about the outcome here and in Albany, have been filing in record numbers for retirement. Since their pensions are based on their salary at the time of retirement, a pay cut now would mean less for them in the future.
At a meeting of the Suffolk Legislature's Public Safety Committee here last week, Robert Creighton, the Suffolk Police Commissioner, said the pay cut could cost him up to 600 more police officers -- the number of officers with 20 years or more of service who are eligible to retire. He said that would leave "a disastrous hole" in his department.
"I feel like the leader of the dance band on the Titanic," he told the legislators at a hearing last week.
 
A 'Dire' Situation
 "This is not scare techniques," he said. "I'm telling you the absolute truth. We are facing a dire, dire situation."
In pressing for the wage and job cuts, Mr. Gaffney has said projected revenues from sales-tax and real-property-tax receipts are way below anticipated levels, while expenditures for social services and other programs for those most affected by the recession have increased sharply.
His office estimates that the 10 percent pay cut would save the county $20 million and the job cuts an additional $23 million over the remaining months of the current fiscal year ending on Dec. 31.
Fearful that county legislators will have enough votes to pass one or both measures this week, police officers have been lining up in record numbers to file their retirement papers. According to Suffolk officials, 197 officers retired last year. Between January and a few weeks ago, when Mr. Gaffney proposed the pay cut, 114 officers had filed. The day after Mr. Gaffney endorsed the pay cut, 80 officers filed, beginning a long line that by last Friday had grown to an additional 250 officers.
The biggest group showed up at Police Headquarters in Yaphank last Monday, when 129 handed in their papers. The Police Department's processing center became so overwhelmed that day that it moved its operations to the headquarters cafeteria to handle the crush of officers.
Police retirement pay is half the salary earned during the final year of active service, or half the average salary earned during the last three years on the job, whichever is higher. Many of the officers applying for retirement have also earned large amounts of overtime pay this year because of the shortage of officers and an increased work load.
 
Carrying Out a Promise
 Some of that overtime and other benefits now adding to future pension checks might also be lost as Commissioner Creighton, who was sworn in several weeks ago, carries out his promise to Mr. Gaffney and the legislators to reorganize the Police Department and reduce costs, including overtime.
Mr. Creighton warned the legislators at a hearing in Hauppauge last Thursday that should there be layoffs in his department, in addition to those who are retiring, then the county could be at risk. He said the county's 2,340-member police force now had the lowest officer-to-population ratio in the country for areas with more than a million people. The county's population is 1.3 million.

HEADLINE: Batman Is Back, and the Money Is Pouring In

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, June 21

 BODY:
Batman has indeed returned. The newly opened sequel, "Batman Returns," broke box office records over the weekend and is poised to turn into one of the largest-grossing films ever.
Executives at Warner Brothers, which produced and distributed the dark, perverse and hugely expensive comedy, said today that the movie would gross a staggering $46.5 million for the weekend, a record. The previous weekend record was held by "Batman," the 1989 film that hauled in $42.7 million and then went on to be the sixth-biggest-grossing film in history. 
 Terry Semel, the president of Warner Brothers Inc., said in an interview: "It's clear that the chemistry in and around this movie -- the subject matter, the characters, the look of the film -- appeals to children, to people in high school, to adults, male and female. The film has become an event. People want to get out of the house and see this movie."
 
The Cost and the Cast
 Officially, Warner Brothers puts the cost of "Batman Returns" at $55 million. But in the never-never land of Hollywood economics, the movie, with its German Expressionist design, big salaries and maniacal special effects, probably cost anywhere from $75 million upward. The film, directed by Tim Burton, is set in Gotham City (a mythically ugly New York), and stars Michael Keaton as the caped crusader, Michelle Pfeiffer as a tantalizing, witty and feminist Catwoman, and Danny DeVito as the Penguin, an evil, neurotic Mayoral candidate who was raised by the birds.
Robert G. Friedman, the president of Warner's worldwide theatrical advertising and publicity, said delightedly over the phone: "Unlike the first 'Batman,' we tried to keep the fires low and didn't start promoting it till relatively late. We focused on the individual characters that made up the whole of the movie, their uniqueness, rather than trumpeting the movie as the event of the summer, like the first one. We opened it the first real weekend when kids are out of school. The audience is everybody, but the engine that drives the charge are kids under 20."
The mammoth size of the weekend grosses, after an opening that saw huge lines at theaters in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta and elsewhere, can only be illustrated by comparing it with those of other films. "Lethal Weapon 3," the bloody buddy movie, which until today had this year's highest weekend gross, took in $33.2 million on its first weekend. "Patriot Games," the adventure starring Harrison Ford, opened two weeks ago to what was viewed as an impressive weekend gross: $18.5 million.
 
Multiples at the Multi-plexes
 To promote the film, Warner's actually opened it at many theaters across the nation on Thursday night, and unleashed the movie at a total of 2,600 theaters on Friday. Because many multi-plexes are playing the film in more than one theater, it is actually being shown on more than 3,000 screens, an unusually large number.
The summer is the peak time for moviegoing, and the season's other mega-expensive epics have already opened, to mixed results. Some movies been major disappointments, notably "Far and Away," the adventure love story starring Tom Cruise as an Irish immigrant in the 1890's, and "Alien 3," the science-fiction sequel in which Sigourney Weaver battles a slimy creature. The studio that is virtually popping Champagne corks is Warner Brothers, which produced not only "Batman Returns," but also the other summer blockbuster, "Lethal Weapon 3." (The studio has also had its share of setbacks, including "The Mambo Kings" and, especially, "Memoirs of an Invisible Man.")
On the other end of the spring-summer seesaw is Universal Pictures, which is enduring a bleak season. Disappointments range from "Far and Away," which may have cost at least $60 million, or far more, and "Kuffs," "The Babe" and "Leaving Normal."
 
Light, Airy 'Lethal Weapon'
 Brian Grazer, the producer of "Far and Away," and a founding partner of Imagine Films Entertainment, with Ron Howard, the film's director, said in an interview: "I've produced 23 movies. I feel this was a really good movie, but I think it just came out the wrong time of the year. On Memorial Day weekend, people want to party, they want to crack beer bottles and have a good time. I don't know if they want to watch a period movie that's 2 hours and 20 minutes. Look, I, myself, want to see a light, airy movie this time of year: "Lethal Weapon" or "Batman." He said that "Far and Away" would probably turn out to be profitable because of Tom Cruise's strong appeal abroad.
It is conventional Hollywood wisdom, though, that when a movie performs relatively poorly, its makers inevitably blame two factors: the time of year the film opened or interference by the studio. The actual problem with "Far and Away," reviewers said, is that the film never quite manages to turn into a sweeping epic drama, in the style of "Lawrence of Arabia" or "Doctor Zhivago." Instead, it resembles a television mini-series.
The biggest surprise of the summer is "Sister Act," a comedy with an average-size budget ($20 million) about a nightclub singer, played by Whoopi Goldberg, who hides out in a convent to escape the mob. The movie's musical numbers and cheerfully droll performances by actresses playing nuns have turned "Sister Act" into a movie that could gross as much as $100 million, far more than "Far and Away" or "Alien 3." For the Walt Disney Company, which has had its share of ups ("Encino Man" and "Medicine Man") and downs ("Newsies," "Noises Off," "Blame It on the Bellboy"), the triumph of "Sister Act" is especially sweet.
 
Long Run for 'Sister Act'
 "Audiences seem to love it, and there's tremendous word of mouth building on this movie," said Richard Cook, the president of Buena Vista Film Distribution, which releases Disney films. "It's going to run through the summer."
Gayle Anne Hurd, the executive producer of "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," the 1991 No. 1 box office success, and producer of the low-budget drama "The Waterdance" about men seeking to come to terms with their spinal injuries, said: "Generally, the summer is a time for big epic blockbusters, movies that are directed to the 14-to-18-year-old male audience. With 'Sister Act,' which is a fun night at the movies, it's a case of alternative programming. A film that finds another audience. It's like 'Dead Poets Society' a few years ago. It's counter-programming."
Because of the impact of the Batman films, every studio in town shied away from opening movies this weekend. Some executives were plainly concerned that their films would be overwhelmed by the Batman phenomenon.
But Mace Neufeld, who produced "Patriot Games" with Bob Rehme, said in an interview: "Even with the humongous 'Batman' business, we seem to be holding. A film like 'Batman' brings people into the movie theaters and there's a spillover effect. People arrive at the multi-plex, can't get in or don't want to wait on a long line, so they see other films. 'Batman' is actually helping."

HEADLINE: Good Health -- and Good Politics

 BODY:
Speaker Thomas Foley is committed to bringing health care reform to a House vote before next month's Democratic convention. Standing in the way of his election-year strategy is a fractured membership, split between contradictory approaches to reform.
But consensus may not be as far out of reach as it looks. Many Democrats have taken a hard second look at the approach called managed competition and like what they see. Managed competition, which has always seemed the best idea for insurance reform on the merits, may now become the best approach for political reasons as well. 
 The Democratic leadership has split over how to deal with the crisis in health care. Medical costs are rising three times faster than inflation, and almost 40 million Americans are uninsured.
Some members of Congress favor "play-or-pay," an approach that would preserve private insurers. Employers would enroll workers in private plans or else pay a tax to enroll them in a public backup plan. Other members favor single-payer plans, like Canada's. These would eliminate private insurers and enroll everyone in a single Government plan.
Play-or-pay appeals to members who fear turning health care over to government; single-payer appeals to those who want a universal system into which everyone pays for the same basic coverage. Democrats are coming to realize that, with managed competition, they can have it all.
John Garamendi, California's insurance commissioner, has proposed a plan, now working its way through the State Legislature, that provides the best of both worlds. Employers and employees would pay a payroll tax to a regional authority, or sponsor. The sponsor would contract with private insurers to offer basic coverage, defined by the government, to any applicant at no additional cost. The sponsor would also contract with private insurers to offer members more generous plans. But buyers would have to pay for the entire additional cost, a useful brake on skyrocketing premiums.
Because the Garamendi plan builds in competition among private insurers, it appeals to some advocates of play-or-pay. And because the plan taxes everyone for identical basic coverage, it appeals to some single-payer advocates. The tax, in effect, imposes a global budget on basic health care without imposing the heavy hand of price controls.
Unable to win consensus for comprehensive reform, Democrats like Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of the tax-writing committee back piecemeal measures. They at least want to curtail repugnant practices like discriminating against applicants with certain medical conditions.
Such reform would surely be welcome but is not enforceable if imposed piecemeal. Telling insurers to enroll AIDS victims at fixed rates in effect tells the companies to lose money. That compels insurers to find loopholes. The Garamendi plan, however, would allow sponsors to reimburse insurers who enroll disproportionate numbers of people who have costly chronic illnesses.
The longer the House looks at managed competition, the better it looks. The leadership has already decided to put a managed competition bill, sponsored by the Democrats Jim Cooper of Tennessee and Michael Andrews of Texas, up for vote next month along with play-or-pay and single-payer. That's welcome news.
It's still unlikely that Congress can complete reform legislation this year, even though the crisis in health care costs obviously roils the public. But now, at least, the House seems to be finding a path through the wilderness.

Baker's Guilty Knowledge

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A Foreign Service officer named Frank Lemay ought to be a hero. He was the first to warn his bosses at the State Department that Saddam Hussein was using U.S.-backed grain loans to build a nuclear bomb.
In his memorandum of Oct. 13, 1989, he recounted a conversation with four nervous Department of Agriculture officials who had been briefed on a probe into Iraq's multi-billion dollar abuse of the Lavoro bank's Atlanta branch. 
 "Payments required by Iraq of exporters . . . may have been diverted into acquiring sensitive nuclear technologies," Mr. Lemay wrote to his superiors two and a half years ago. He reported Agriculture's Inspector General to be concerned that "commodities were bartered in Jordan and Turkey for military hardware" and that the U.S. Attorney in Atlanta (a former C.I.A. man) had indicated that diverted funds "were used to procure nuclear related equipment."
But Frank Lemay is a pariah, not a hero, at State because his memo -- made public by Representative Henry Gonzalez -- proves that State policy makers possessed the guilty knowledge of Saddam Hussein's unlawful use of American financing.
Despite that written notification of likely diversion, Secretary of State Baker leaned on Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter to extend an additional $500 million to Saddam Hussein. And despite Yeutter's 1989 pledge to the Senate Agriculture chairman, Patrick Leahy, not to issue new credits until suspicions of corruption were resolved, Secretary Yeutter -- under heavy Baker pressure -- rushed the "grain" financing to Saddam.
Mr. Lemay is one of the witnesses scheduled to testify this week before the House Judiciary Committee, as it decides whether to request that the Attorney General determine in 30 days if evidence exists of high-level malfeasance requiring a court-appointed independent counsel.
Why is Secretary Baker allowing the young F.S.O. to appear, when the White House has refused to let higher-ups testify? The answer is provided me by a colleague of his at State: "Because Frank is being set up to be discredited by the cover-up crowd at Agriculture, who have already lied to Congress. And because Frank does not know to this day what happened after his memo went upstairs."
What did happen to the Lemay warning at State? Copies went to his boss, Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Richard McCormack, who has left Government, as has then-Counsel Abraham Sofaer; to Sam Hoskinson, who has gone to C.I.A.; to State's "Mr. Iraq," Jack Covey of the Near East Bureau, and to four participants in the meeting at Agriculture.
My mid-level State source believes that McCormack took his assistant's red-hot memo to James Baker and read sections of it aloud. Amazing result: the economic oversight was taken away from Economic Affairs and assigned to "Baker's man," Robert Zoellick. From that point on, the troublesome Lemay was out of the loop.
What motivated Baker, a lawyer of legendary caution, to ignore the written report of the way our money was being diverted to Saddam's nuclear program?
A better-placed source, who keeps my essays dated 11/30/89 and 3/19/90 in his or her desk drawer, says: "At the time, this was Saddam's only ready source of major cash. And it was the only string we had on him."
String to do what? To become, in President Bush's words, a respected member of the family of nations?
"That's extremely classified. All I can say is we were asked by foreign officials at the highest levels for help on a particular matter. There was a task we wanted Iraq to accomplish and this C.C.C. program was the only way we had to pay for it.
"Our goal," he adds, "was honorable; maybe it was a fool's errand, but it was worth a try."
Who else knows the Bush-Baker motive for knowingly allowing a dictator to divert a half billion dollars in supposed grain credits to military and nuclear use?
My source will say only that the motive was "sufficiently compelling" and the men closest to Baker, then and now, were in on it. But nobody that the Bush Administration is sending to the Judiciary Committee knows the secret motive for corrupting our export program to pay off Saddam Hussein.

HEADLINE: Briton Sees AIDS Cutting Population in Parts of Africa

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, June 15

 BODY:
A British scientist has predicted that because of the AIDS epidemic, populations in the worst-afflicted African countries will within 20 years switch over from their present high rate of increase to an actual decrease in numbers.
In Uganda, where 1.5 million people out of a population of 16 million are thought to be infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, the current 3 percent population growth rate is likely to fall to below zero after 2002, with more people dying than being born, the projections say. 
 In 15 years, Uganda would have 20 percent fewer people than if the AIDS epidemic had not occurred. The population would be 20.28 million, instead of 24 million. Tanzania, Malawi and Rwanda, all in the central and east African belt where AIDS has hit hardest, would be similarly affected, the results show.
The projections have been made by Roy M. Anderson, head of the department of biology at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, who is a leader in the growing field of mathematical modeling that is used for predicting the demographic consequences of AIDS.
The results of his predictions, done with Robert M. May of Oxford University, have been presented in medical and scientific journals in the last year and were expanded on by Professor Anderson at an international conference on infectious diseases in Nairobi last week.
 
Pessimistic Projection
 Professor Anderson's results are far gloomier than those of other mathematical modelers at the World Bank, the World Health Organization of the United Nations and the Population Council in New York. They have all concluded that population growth in Africa would be curbed by AIDS but would not turn negative.
The discussion of the impact of AIDS on Africa's population comes in the wake of an assertion this month by a leading AIDS research group, headed by Dr. Jonathan Mann of the Harvard School of Public Health, that the number of people infected with H.I.V. by the year 2000 would be far higher than the 40 million predicted by the World Health Organization.
There are already 6 million Africans infected with H.I.V., and according to what are generally considered the conservative estimates of W.H.O., 10 million will be infected by 1995.
In making his predictions, Professor Anderson said he has assumed that the prevailing patterns of sexual activity with multiple partners will continue in Africa. In contrast with the pattern in the United States, AIDS in Africa is spread mainly through heterosexual intercourse.
For African countries that have been hit hardest by the AIDS epidemic, the implications of Dr. Anderson's results are considerable, researchers say, especially because African leaders have generally been reluctant to take the AIDS epidemic seriously. Other than some education programs and attempts to distribute condoms, researchers say, there is little evidence that Africans have changed their behavior in a way that would lead to a slowing of the epidemic.
"Generally, there has been a failure in Africa to accept the magnitude of the problem," Professor Anderson said in an interview here. He said he hoped that his projections would awaken policy makers in the West and in Africa to the gravity of the situation.
"We must galvanize society," he said. "This the most serious threat to humankind in modern times and the situation calls for massive investment to find a vaccine."
 
Sentiment of Hopelessness
 But other researchers argued that the work by Dr. Anderson and other mathematical modelers could encourage sentiment that the situation was hopeless. Some officials in government already privately contend that family planning is not as necessary in Africa because AIDS will take care of the rapid growth in the population.
"Do we invest in population control when the population is about to be decimated?" asked a senior official in the African bureau at the State Department. "Do we invest in the training of people when they will die a few years later?"
Professor Anderson's findings are considered controversial by some AIDS researchers because they rely on assumptions about sexual behavior for which there is still only imprecise data, a situation the professor acknowledged. For instance, his figures assume a high degree of sexual contact between older men, who tend to be infected, and younger women, who tend not to be.
In the last several years, researchers have noticed a growing tendency by urban African men, infected with AIDS but unaware of it, to seek younger sexual partners who are free of the virus. This has become common behavior in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, where 35- to 45-year-old "sugar daddies" pay school fees and give gifts to teen-age girls in return for sex.
The infection of young women with H.I.V. would send the population growth rate plummeting not only because the women die but also because their children have a 30 to 40 percent chance of being born with the virus, Professor Anderson said.
 
Changes in Central Africa
 He said the most clear-cut changes in population would occur in Central African countries where the epidemic started earlier and has hit hardest.
Within particular countries, there would not be a uniform leveling of population but rather "patchiness." Some areas like the Rakai district in southern Uganda, where there are more than 20,000 children orphaned by AIDS, could see their population almost wiped out, while others would remain almost unscathed.
Dr. Anderson said that aside from alerting African countries to the demographic impact of AIDS, mathematical modeling was also useful for assessing how to best curb the rate of infection.
Significant resources, Dr. Anderson said, should be directed toward inducing behavioral changes early. In Nigeria, for instance, where the infection in the general population is still limited, education and condom distribution should be aimed at high-risk groups like prostitutes and their clients, he said.
But in countries like Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda, where there is wider distribution of H.I.V. infection among the general population, it is probably "too late" to reach already sexually active people, Dr. Anderson said. Rather, educators should focus on teen-agers who are not yet sexually active.
The United States Agency for International Development, together with Kenyan researchers, recently used mathematical modeling in an study on the the impact of AIDS in Kenya.

HEADLINE: Trail in Kidnapping Case Leads to Carolina Resort

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 21

 BODY:
Several days before his arrest on charges of kidnapping an Exxon executive, Arthur D. Seale visited the luxurious South Carolina resort of Hilton Head Island, reminisced about his life there in the mid-1980's and mused about living there again and buying a marina, a woman who said she had dinner with him on the island recalled today.
Mr. Seale was calm, casual, upbeat and apparently eager to resettle in Hilton Head, said the woman, who dined with her husband and Mr. Seale at Kyoto, a Japanese restaurant at the resort. 
 "He was very likable, very open, and very friendly," the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said by phone from Hilton Head. "We had every indication he and his wife were considering moving here."
Her account offered new details on the life of Mr. Seale and his wife, Irene, who were arrested on Friday after the authorities followed a trail of ransom notes and telephoned instructions stretching over three counties. The Seales are being held without bail, awaiting a second appearance in Federal court here on Monday.
 
Nomadic Existence
 Since their arrest, there has been no word on the whereabouts of Sidney J. Russo, the 57-year-old president of Exxon International, who they are charged with kidnapping.
From the mid-80's, the Seales' nomadic financially troubled pursuit of a grand life style brought them to resort towns, first in Hilton Head and then at Vail in the Colorado ski country. Their stays in each lasted only about two years, through late 1989, and eventually the couple returned to live with his parents, who are retired, at their home in Changewater, a hamlet on the Musconetcong River in western New Jersey.
While living in Hilton Head, the Seales owned a furniture and interior decorating store called Insiders. As the economy started slidding toward recession, the business failed and they lost the store, as well as their home.
F.B.I. agents spent much of the weekend in Hilton Head, questioning the Seales' old neighbors and acquantainces in Sea Pines Plantation, one of the wealthiest corners of the island. The arrests stunned former acquaintances of the couple.
 
Plenty of Shock
 "The mood around here is of absolute disbelief, shock, and confusion," said the woman who had dinner with Mr. Seale recently.
She said she and her husband met Mr. Seale for the first time at the restaurant. Mr. Seale's teen-age son, Justin, a friend of the couple's daughter, was staying at their home on Hilton Head and Mr. Seale had gone to visit him. Justin is said to have spent most summers on the island since his parents left here in early 1988, and he arrived there recently after completing his freshman year at college in Vermont.
The woman said Mr. Seale was relaxed and buoyant at Kyoto. "In fact, when we first met him at the restaurant, he was in the parking lot, throwing a ball to the owner's son, who is about 4," she said. The woman could not recall the date of the dinner. Other acquaintances, however, said Mr. Seale came to the island about two weeks ago.
That would have been about the time, the Federal authorities say, that the Seales had made a ransom call from a pay telephone at a gasoline station in Pooler, Ga., a small town near Savannah about 30 miles west of Hilton Head. Court documents say the call was made on Monday, June 8.

4 Airlines Will Settle Suit on Pricing

BYLINE: By Reuters

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 22

 BODY:
The nation's biggest airlines said today that they would pay more than $400 million in cash and ticket vouchers to settle a suit charging that they conspired to fix prices through a computerized reservation system.
Delta Air Lines Inc.; the American Airlines unit of AMR Corporation; the United Airlines unit of UAL Corporation; and USAir Inc. will pay $44 million in cash and issue $368.5 million in vouchers to settle the class-action suit without admitting liability. The vouchers will be valid on any of the four airlines for as much as 10 percent off the price of most tickets and 20 percent off round-trip tickets priced at less than $100. 
 The settlement is subject to the approval of a federal judge in Atlanta, where the suit was filed in 1990.
 Pitts Carr, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case, estimated that 10 million purchasers, about a third of them businesses, would be eligible for the program. He said ticket buyers "should receive significant economic benefits."
 Virtually anyone who bought a ticket on the airlines for domestic travel between Jan. 1, 1988, and June 30, 1992, could be eligible for the program, he said. "We've already heard from thousands, but we haven't publicized it that widely," Mr. Carr said. "We expect millions will participate."
The suit charged that nine airlines used the computerized listings of the Airline Tariff Publishing Company -- which the airlines own -- to control fares.
In their settlement, the airlines denied the charges of the suit, which said the carriers developed a code to signal whether prices were going up or down and to discipline airlines that failed to conform.
NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines and the Trans World Airlines unit of Icahn & Company previously agreed to pay a total of $37.5 million to settle the suit. Other defendants in the suit were Continental Airlines, which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, and Midway and Pan Am, which have gone out of business.
The suit initially was brought by about 50 individuals but was expanded to class-action status last year by Federal District Judge Marvin Shoob in Atlanta. At the time the airlines estimated that the suit covered some 50 million customers, making it one of the biggest class-action cases ever.
Buyers who think they may be eligible for the voucher program can send a letter to a clearinghouse set up by the airlines. The address is Airline Antitrust Litigation, P.O. Box 209, Philadelphia, Pa. 19107.

HEADLINE: Winning the Game of 'Global Smokestack Chasing'

BYLINE: New York Times Regional Newspapers>

DATELINE: SPARTANBURG, S.C., June 22

 BODY:
In choosing to build its first United States production plant in South Carolina, the German auto maker BMW is following a path taken by a number of prominent European manufacturers.
The state has courted international companies since the 1960's, when officials lured the German chemical and fiber company Hoechst A.G. to Spartanburg. The list of other foreign companies subsequently drawn to the area includes the Michelin tire group, which moved here in the early 1970's; the Robert Bosch Corporation, in 1985; Bertelesmann A.G. Distribution, in 1986; Adidas U.S.A., in 1988, and Hitachi Electronics Devices in 1989. 
 "By the 1980's, everybody was in the game of global smokestack chasing," said Doug Woodward, a research economist with the University of South Carolina's College of Business Administration. But he said north-central South Carolina, well positioned between Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta, had taken the lead.
 South Carolina has the highest per-capita foreign investment in the nation, according to the Spartanburg Area Chamber of Commerce. And the largest chunk of that investment comes from Germany.
"South Carolina has this great location," Mr. Woodward said, citing its three ports and extensive interstate highway system. "They say Atlanta is the capital of the South. It should be Charleston."
Officials involved in recruiting BMW, which is expected to announce its decision on Tuesday to build a plant here, say South Carolina's successes have been based on creating a favorable business climate.
S. Hunter Howard Jr., executive vice president of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, said of foreign companies, "They see incentives, they see the tone of the legislature being pro-business, and those things combined with the quality of life and labor issues -- I just think it's a composite decision."
 Incentives for new and expanding businesses approved by the state include tax credits for companies that locate their headquarters here or that create new jobs, as well as sharp reductions in property taxes.
"We've reduced the corporate income tax rate from 6 to 5 percent, the lowest rate in the Southeast and one of the lowest in the country," Mr. Howard said.
While South Carolina is known primarily for its textile-related industries, officials say the development of auto-related businesses had laid the groundwork for BMW's arrival. That industry, largely developed over the last 10 to 20 years, now includes more than 600 companies with more than 67,000 workers, according to figures provided by the South Carolina Development Board.
One of the first important auto suppliers to move to the state was Michelin, a French company, in the 1970's. Michelin now has four plants in South Carolina, including two in Spartanburg and Greenville that employ a total of 5,400 workers.
Michelin's arrival was followed by a wave of other foreign companies, led by the German and Japanese, that have moved into the state and established auto-related manufacturing plants.
But many in South Carolina considered BMW the crown jewel of foreign investments and went to great lengths to bring it here. BMW, which will build the plant on a 1,200-acre site near the Greenville-Spartanburg airport, is expected to invest $645 million eventually and employ up to 4,000 workers.
State officials were withholding comments today on specifics of the agreement with BMW until Tuesday's announcement, but incentives known to have been offered the German auto maker total $145 million. These include $30 million to buy and prepare land for the factory; $10 million for road projects near the site; temporary office space offered at reduced rates in Greenville or Spartanburg; 35 free apartments in Greenville and 20 in Spartanburg, and expansion of the Greenville-Spartanburg airport runway to accommodate 747 jetliners.
In addition, tax law changes would allow BMW to save as much as $50 million over 20 years in water and sewer costs. And a state income tax credit of $1,500 per employee would create savings of $2.7 million a year.

HEADLINE: A Plan for More Affordable Housing in Harrison

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARRISON, N.Y., June 22

 BODY:
Municipal workers and other middle- income residents of this affluent community will share homes with low-income residents of the town under a plan announced today.
The concept could become a model for development throughout the state, according to state and local leaders who gathered here to endorse the plan developed by Andrew M. Cuomo, son of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. The lack of affordable housing has become an acute problem in Westchester County, where the median price of a single-family home is $270,000. 
 The plan calls for the construction of 25 two-family homes, built for $154,000 to $184,000, on a 4.5 acre county-owned site on Main Street. The sale price of the homes will be based on the buyer's income.
 
Owners on the First Floor
 The homes would be purchased by municipal workers, school staff and young families working or living in Harrison who earn between $28,000 and $64,000. They would live on the first floor.
Upstairs, a second unit would be occupied by families who qualify for Federal housing subsidies, who would then use the subsidies, usually about $700 a month, to pay rent to the landlord living below.
The county has 7,000 families on a waiting list for aid under the Federal program known as Section 8, officials said, adding that 6,000 people who already get vouchers for rent under the program often can not find landlords willing to accept them.
Andrew Cuomo has become a familiar figure in Westchester as the president of Westhelp, a nonprofit corporation that provides temporary housing for homeless families.
But he said the transitional housing "only works if you have something permanent to move into."
"You have to help middle-income and low-income families in a way that allows them to help themselves," said Mr. Cuomo, who also heads a new company, Equity Homes, a nonprofit corporation that will seek government subsidies and develop the site. The project is eligible for state housing grants of up to $25,000 a unit, Mr. Cuomo said.
Calling the plan an example of "common sense" government, Governor Cuomo, who was present at the announcement today, said: "If you don't do this housing with the help of government, it won't happen. Why should anyone in private industry want to make less money by building housing for middle- and low-income families?"
Andrew Cuomo's plan comes three months after Harrison became the first Westchester municipality to endorse a proposal by Westchester County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, to build 500 units of housing on 20 county-owned sites for people earning $28,000 to $64,000 a year. Most other municipal officials, however, have remained wary of the plan.
Mr. O'Rourke's proposal followed a ruling in March by the State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, that gave counties the authority to build and finance low-cost housing and override local zoning if necessary.
Praising Mr. Cuomo's plan, Mr. O'Rourke said: "We'll have 25 brand new homes for people who could never have gotten a mortgage earning $28,000. They just don't make enough. With the Section 8 rental income help, they'll be part of the American dream of home ownership."

HEADLINE: 4 Named to Executive Posts at CUNY

 BODY:

JOYCE F. BROWN
Vice chancellor for student affairs and urban programs
Currently the City University of New York's vice chancellor for urban affairs, Dr. Brown will also assume the position of vice chancellor for student affairs and urban programs. As such she will oversee areas like financial aid, admissions and student activities for the 200,000-student CUNY system. 
 A 1968 graduate of Marymount College in Tarrytown, Dr. Brown received her Ph.D. in counseling psychology from New York University. From 1968 to 1983, she was director of instructional testing and research and director of tutoring at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, one of the 21 branches of the CUNY system. In 1983, she was named CUNY's dean for urban affairs, a post in which she was the university's chief liaison with the Board of Education and other city agencies. Starting in 1987, Dr. Brown served as acting vice chancellor for student affairs for two years, and she served as acting president of Bernard M. Baruch College in Manhattan during the 1990-91 academic year.
 
RICHARD M. FREELAND
Vice chancellor for academic affairs
Named as the City University's vice chancellor for academic affairs, the 51-year-old Dr. Freeland will have primary responsibility for developing and starting universitywide programs as well as for reviewing degree offerings throughout the 21-campus system. Dr. Freeland, a historian, has spent the last 21 years at the University of Massachusetts at Boston in a variety of teaching and administrative positions.
The dean of the College of Arts and Sciences there for the last 10 years, Dr. Freeland has also been dean of the College of Professional Studies, director of the Office of Educational Planning and assistant to the chancellor.
Like the City University, the University of Massachusetts has been beset with major financial problems in the last few years and Dr. Freeland has spent a large part of his time husbanding the College of Liberal Arts and Science's scarce resources. Nevertheless, he has managed to foster the growth of a small number of doctoral programs, revitalize the school's core curriculum and help restructure teacher education.
A 1963 graduate of Amherst College, Dr. Freeland received his doctorate in American civilization from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968.
 
AUGUSTA SOUZA KAPPNER
Acting president of City College
Chosen to lead the oldest and best-known branch of CUNY, Dr. Kappner is a highly respected City University administrator, considered diplomatic and tough enough to handle the often volatile City College campus. For the past seven years, she has served as president of Borough of Manhattan Community College, the largest of the the university's seven two-year schools. Like Dr. Bernard W. Harleston, the man she is replacing, Dr. Kappner has had to face deep budget cuts and militant student protests over tuition increases that have roiled the university over the last three years.
Before being named to lead the Borough of Manhattan Community College, Dr. Kappner served for two years as university dean for academic affairs with oversight in the areas of continuing and adult education and freshman skills assessment. From 1978 to 1984, she was dean of continuing education at Fiorello H. La Guardia Community College in Long Island City.
A graduate of Barnard College in 1966, Dr. Kappner received a master's degree in social work from Hunter College in 1968 and a doctorate in social work from Columbia University in 1984.
 
VERNON E. LATTIN
President of Brooklyn College
Dr. Lattin, 53, who will lead one of the flagship campuses of the City University, has for the past three-and-a-half years been vice president and provost of Arizona State University. As such he oversaw the development of academic policies and regulations for the 43,000-student university and had chief administrative responsibility for the ASU West campus in Phoenix.
Dr. Lattin received a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1960 and a master's degree in English in 1965, both from the the University of New Mexico. He received a Ph.D. in English from the University of Colorado in 1970.
Starting in 1965, Dr. Lattin held various teaching positions before becoming director for Latino and Latin American Studies at Northern Illinois University in 1978. In 1982, he became associate vice president for academic affairs for the University of Wisconsin.

HEADLINE: Confidence Index Rises

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A closely watched measurement of American consumer confidence increased in mid-June, economists are saying, substantiating evidence that the recovery from recession is strengthening.
The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment registered 80.6 in a preliminary reading, up from 79.2 at the end of May, 77.2 for April and 76 for March. 
 The Michigan survey is not publicly distributed but is sent by fax to private clients on Thursday evenings at the middle and end of the month. Talk of the results quickly circulates among financial market traders and economists. The final June reading will come out July 2.
Kathleen Stephansen, an economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation in New York, said results of the preliminary reading suggested consumer confidence was slowly improving, buttressing other statistical and anecdotal evidence of a gradually advancing recovery.
After an early-year spurt in spending, signs emerged that consumers were holding back this spring, which raised fears that the rebound from the 1990-91 recession might falter.
In May, for example, retail sales reported by the Commerce Department rose only two-tenths of a percent, instead of the surge that had been expected. Moreover, the gain for April was revised downward.
Still, other measurements of consumer confidence have continued to show signs of slowly growing strength. The Conference Board, a New York business research group that tracks consumer confidence on a monthly basis, reported last month that its May index grew for the third straight month.

HEADLINE: Court Lifts Barrier to Skyscraper Project

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
A Federal appeals judge lifted the last legal obstacle to a huge skyscraper project at Columbus Circle yesterday that opponents had argued would make Manhattan's air pollution problem worse.
Overturning a decision by Judge Shirley Wohl Kram of Federal District Court in Manhattan, the appeals court ruled that the two proposed towers would not violate the Federal Clean Air Act and that the developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman would not be liable for a $15 million fine that Judge Kram had threatened to impose. 
 The city's Corporation Counsel, O. Peter Sherwood, called the appeals court ruling "a complete victory."
Noting that the real-estate market had slumped since the project was first proposed, he said the developer might want to have further negotiations with the city. "But there is a contract with provisions that commit them to move ahead," he said. "They've put essentially a deposit down and they're obligated."
 
What's Next?
 It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Zuckerman, through his Boston Properties company, would go ahead with the long-disputed project, which has been revised and scaled down twice since he first proposed it in the mid-1980's. Robert Selsam, the vice president of Boston Properties, said no decision had been made on what to do next.
Jerry H. Goldfeder, a lawyer for coalition of neighborhood groups that brought the lawsuit, said they had not decided whether to appeal to the United States Supreme Court.
But officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which has a contract to sell the land to Mr. Zuckerman for $339 million, said they were looking forward to discussions with Boston Properties on closing the deal. "The case is basically over," said Susan Weiner, the authority's deputy general counsel.
The latest blueprint for the project calls for a 752-foot-high, twin-towered structure to be built at the southwest corner of Central Park on the site of the New York Coliseum. Because of the depressed real-estate market, there have been doubts in the last couple of years about who would lease the office space or whether Mr. Zuckerman would have to scale the design down again.
 
'It Made No Sense'
 The project has been controversial since it was first unveiled. The original proposal was for a 925-foot-high tower whose shadow, opponents claimed, would have blocked much of the sunlight over Central Park. That plan was defeated in court.
But opponents focused on the environmental impact of the Zuckerman proposal, even as Linda Young, an assistant corporation counsel, had argued that "it made no sense to hold this project hostage for a problem it has nothing to do with."
The opponents maintained that the city had reneged on a Federal mandate to draft an air pollution reduction plan by 1992.
The three-judge appeals panel disagreed. The opinion by Judge Jon O. Newman, who was joined by Judges Amalya L. Kearse and Richard J. Cardamone, said that the city had not "failed to fulfill its commitment" to meet a new 1995 deadline.
Opponents of the project had argued that it would worsen an air pollution problem caused by automobile exhaust emisions, particularly at a "hot spot" east of Central Park, on 59th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues. But after ruling that the proposed project itself would not cause pollution, the appeals court said it was up to the city, not the developer, to do something about the problem on 59th Street.
"Right now the city can continue to lease the Coliseum and make some money," Mr. Goldfeder said. "The Mayor would be well advised to speak to the developer and plan a much more environmentally sound project that would fit in with the neighborhood and that would be more in keeping with Mort Zuckerman's aversion to economic risk. That's a cumbersome way of saying what I mean, which is, it's probably in the developer's interest to do a smaller-scale project, given the economic situation."
Asked what size project the opponents would accept, Mr. Goldfeder said, "I never negotiate in the press." But he added, "We're open to a rationally planned, environmentally sound project that fits into our neighborhood."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends the Day Lower Except for Rise Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday against all leading currencies except the Japanese yen, which was troubled by a deteriorating economic scenario at home.
Gold prices advanced after falling overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $343.70 a troy ounce, up $2.90 from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold rose $2.50 an ounce to a late bid price of $343.20. 
 "All the economic data coming out of Japan are looking worse and worse," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Further putting pressure on the yen was another steep drop in the Tokyo stock market. The leading 225-issue Nikkei stock average fell 3.6 percent to close at 15,921.22, the first plunge below the 16,000-point level in five and a half years.
The dollar benefited as traders sold the yen against other leading currencies, Mr. Donney said. "The anticipation of an interest rate cut by the Bank of Japan gave people an excuse to sell the yen," he said.
Elsewhere, the German mark continued to strengthen. "It is shining as a bright light in Europe even with the uncertainty" surrounding European political and economic union, Mr. Donney said.
With no fresh economic data emerging from the United States, "people played the safe bets -- selling dollars and buying marks," he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.47 yen, up 0.55 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 127.10 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 127.15 yen, up from 127.00 yen on Friday,
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8615, from $1.8595 late Friday. In New York it cost $1.8615 to buy one pound, more expensive than Friday's $1.8590.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.5665 German marks, down from 1.5730; 1.4155 Swiss francs, down from 1.4195; 5.2755 French francs, down from 5.2960; 1,184.50 Italian lire, down from 1,190.25, and 1.1946 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1973.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.5665 German marks, down from 1.5705; 1.4050 Swiss francs, down from 1.4170; 5.2725 French francs, down from 5.2870; 1.7645 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7691; 1,184.00 Italian lire, down from 1,188.50, and 1.1945 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1978.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $342.40 a troy ounce, from $343.75 late Friday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Crude Oil Contracts Higher After an Iraq-Related Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Energy futures prices slumped early yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid speculation about Iraq's oil export talks with the United Nations, but prices closed higher after it appeared that a tentative agreement would not mean the swift return of Iraqi oil to the world market.
In New York, light sweet crude for delivery in July settled 22 cents higher at $22.48 a barrel; July home heating oil was 0.38 cent higher at $61.84 a barrel; July unleaded gasoline was 0.40 cent lower at 64.95 cents a gallon, and July natural gas fell 1.1 cents, to $1.545 for 1,000 cubic feet. 
 United Nations officials and Iraqi negotiators have been working since Friday on details of Iraq's proposed sale of crude oil. Iraq has been barred from selling oil under economic sanctions imposed in August 1990 during the Persian Gulf war.
Traders worried that if Iraq reached agreement with the United Nations to resume oil exports, prices already burdened by summer demand that had been lower than normal would slip further, said Stephanie Rzasa, a broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
Two previous rounds of talks failed to produce agreement on terms of a proposed one-time sale of $1.6 billion of Iraqi crude oil, with strict monitoring to insure that profits were used for Iraq's humanitarian needs. United Nations officials said late yesterday that they had reached tentative agreement with Iraq on technical conditions for the sale, subject to approval by the Security Council and the Iraqi Government.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, grains and soybeans futures prices ended lower in lackluster trading as investors shied away from those markets on reports of cooler weather and beneficial rain.
Wheat for July delivery settled down 3 cents at $3.5425 a bushel; July corn was 3.25 cents lower at $2.48 a bushel; July oats were down 3.5 cents at $1.2925 a bushel; July soybeans were down 7.75 cents at $5.955 bushel.
Cattle prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ended lower, under pressure from weaker cash-market prices and sluggish beef sales. Pork futures prices ended mixed as live hog futures were helped by lighter marketings, and frozen pork bellies were under pressure from position-squaring in advance of the monthly Agriculture Department cold storage figures.
Live cattle for June delivery were 0.15 cent lower at 73.15 cents a pound; August feeder cattle were 0.22 cent lower at 78.35 cents a pound; June hogs were up 0.75 cent at 51.05 cents a pound; July frozen pork bellies were 0.17 cent lower at 33.05 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: Aerospace Trade Gains

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
Despite the global recession and military cutbacks, the United States aerospace industry posted a trade surplus in the first quarter of the year.
The aerospace trade surplus increased about 2 percent, to $9.3 billion, in the first three months of 1992, from $9.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 1991, the Aerospace Industries Association said today. 
 Aerospace exports rose about 1 percent, to $12.5 billion, in the first quarter, from $12.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Aerospace imports increased more than 5 percent, to $3.3 billion from $3.1 billion, the trade association said.
Foreign orders for American-made commercial jets provided a source of strength for the domestic economy over the last several years. Demand, however, has sagged as the recession weakened airline traffic. In addition, Pentagon orders have tapered off since the end of the cold war.

HEADLINE: $880 Million Is Set for Cambodia, But Khmer Rouge Pose a Threat

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 22

 BODY:
The nations that served as architects of the Cambodia peace process committed over $880 million to reconstructing the country today, but said the effort could collapse unless Pol Pot, the leader of the Khmer Rouge forces, agrees to disarm and allow United Nations forces to deploy throughout the country.
The warning came at the end of a 32-nation conference here on reconstructing Cambodia, one that quickly turned from the details of financing the rebuilding of the country to a broad effort to keep the fragile peace from unwinding. But senior officials of the Khmer Rouge attending the conference refused to commit themselves to carrying out their obligations under the peace accord unless a long series of new demands were met. 
 Instead, they simply watched in stoic silence as representatives of a host of countries harshly criticized the faction for threatening to plunge the country back into civil war and said Khmer Rouge-controlled parts of the country would suffer most if the United Nations transitional authority in Cambodia was blocked from dispensing aid.
"There is no peace without reconstruction," said Yasushi Akashi, who heads the 16,000-member United Nations transitional forces in Cambodia. "But there is no reconstruction without peace."
The final declaration of the ministerial conference expressed "serious concern" over "the refusal of one party to allow the deployment" of United Nations forces throughout the country and called for "timely implementation" of the Paris accord.
 
Japan Seeks a Leading Role
 Despite the conflict over the Khmer Rouge, Japanese officials, who are making the Cambodia peace process into a test of their ability to take the political lead in an Asian crisis, declared that the ministerial conference that ended tonight was a success. The $880 million in pledges made by more than a score of nations today -- including $150 million to $200 million from Japan and $135 million from the United States -- was far above the $600 million that the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said was needed to complete the first phase of rebuilding the country.
"It exceeds the very urgent needs we have identified," said William H. Draper 2d, the administrator of the United Nations Development Program.
The funds will go toward the resettlement of more than 350,000 refugees awaiting repatriation from border camps in Thailand, the restoration of long-destroyed ports, roads and railroads, and a last-ditch effort to halt the disintegration of Cambodia's civil service, particularly teachers and health workers. Many are paid little or nothing now, and are leaving their jobs.
The other large commitments came from France, which offered $57 million; Australia, which offered $40 million, and Sweden, $38 million. A number of international institutions -- including the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program and the European Community -- offered a total of roughly $250 million.
The conference was overshadowed, however, by the challenge posed by the Khmer Rouge, who controlled the country in the 1970's and were responsible for the deaths of many Cambodians in a fanatical effort to build a wholly agrarian society; estimates of the number of victims have ranged from hundreds of thousands to more than a million.
 
U.N. Helicopter Attacked
 The guerrilla group's power to disrupt was underscored by an attack on a United Nations helicopter over the weekend, for which the Cambodian Government blamed Khmer Rouge forces. There were injuries but no deaths.
At a news conference tonight, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was restored as the head of state under the peace accord, charged that the Khmer Rouge's "final aim is to take power again by military means." He said they were trying to sabotage the peace process before it leads to national elections next year. "They cannot understand democracy," Prince Sihanouk said, "only totalitarianism."
Under the second phase of the Paris peace plan, all four factions should be entering United Nations-sponsored camps for disarmament and repatriation into society as civilians. While several other factions have begun the process, the Khmer Rouge have said they are refusing to disarm until there is proof that the Vietnamese Army, which ousted them from Phnom Penh in 1979, had left the country. They also maintain that the aid flowing through United Nations hands is propping up the Government of Hun Sen, who was installed by Vietnam.
Mr. Akashi said today that he would insure that funds were distributed "in an equitable manner" to areas controlled by each of the four factions. But he also issued what sounded like a warning that Cambodians under the Khmer Rouge's control would suffer the most for the refusal to comply with the peace accord.
 
Curbs by Khmer Rouge
 "The Khmer Rouge has not allowed any freedom of movement for United Nations military or civilians in areas they control," he said. "And it is very hard for us to distribute aid and assistance under we determine needs in those areas."
Some Cambodia experts have suggested that the Khmer Rouge is engaged in a negotiating ploy to obtain funds and more influence in the Supreme National Council, headed by Prince Sihanouk and made up of all the warring factions. But Mr. Akashi said in a brief conversation tonight: "I think it is more than just a tactical move. It is fundamental. It goes back to their deep suspicion of foreigners, of Vietnamese and of Prince Sihanouk."
Mr. Khieu Sampan, a veteran of the Pol Pot Government of the 1970's who has been living under guard in Phnom Penh since dodging a lynch mob there in December, seemed unmovable during the talks, perhaps because he was not authorized to make compromises.
"Khieu Sampan is a figurehead," Prince Sihanouk said. "And he cannot take a decision tonight until he reports to Pol Pot." Mr. Pol Pot is believed to be hiding in the mountains in territory held by the Khmer Rouge.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Mayors Applaud Clinton's Promise to Remake American Economy

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 22

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton took his new economic line of taxes for the rich and development schemes for the poor before the 60th annual gathering here of the United States Conference of Mayors today and won several rounds of vigorous applause when he declared it would remake America economically.
In a major revision of his earlier economic blueprint, Mr. Clinton promised to cut the budget deficit in half by 1996 by taxing the rich and foreign corporations, and by slashing military spending, the Federal bureaucracy and a sweeping collection of Federal programs he deems wasteful or unnecessary. 
 And at the same time, his plan includes a $200 billion program to rebuild the nation's highways, communications system and its inner cities, a program that he says will generate a million new jobs a year.
 
'It Is a Bold Plan'
 "It is a bold plan," Mr. Clinton said. "We can change. We can do better."
The Arkansas Governor also hopes the plan will help him do better. Mr. Clinton, who won the Democratic primary campaign, is at a critical juncture in his quest for the Presidency, running last in public opinion polls, short of money and frequently criticized as lacking a clear message.
The new blueprint sharpens the Governor's proposals. He urges direct spending on things like new roads, bridges and railroads, including a high-speed rail system, and on a national fiber-optic network.
In addition to aiming money directly at improvements in the environment, social services and education, he emphasizes steps to put 100,000 more police officers on the nation's streets.
Many of them would come from the "national service trust" he has proposed, in which young people who borrowed money for college would have the option of paying it back through a few years of community service, including police work.
Mr. Clinton said the financing for his proposals would come from increased taxes on the rich and on foreign companies, and from cutting Government costs.
 
Taxing the Wealthy
 "We can't ask the middle class to pay more," he said. In the 1980's, "their incomes went down and their taxes went up."
He added: "We must say to the wealthy, you have to pay your fair share. We also have to say to foreign companies, there's something wrong with our tax code, if your income went up 65 percent in the 1980's, and your taxes went down 15 percent. And that's exactly what happened. You've got to pay your fair share if you want to do business in this country."
In his speech today, Mr. Clinton did mention a change in his tax proposals for the middle class. During the primary campaign, he had urged both a children's tax credit and a lower income tax rate for the middle class, but in the new plan families may only choose one.
Mr. Clinton said 100,000 jobs could be eliminated from the Government by attrition "over the next couple of years." He vowed to cut the White House staff by a quarter, and to urge Congress to do the same with its staff.
The Governor also promised "the toughest possible system to reform the health care system," saying that Government spending cannot be reined in "until health care costs are brought in line with inflation."
The blueprint calls for cutting the Federal budget deficit by more than half in four years. Mr. Clinton said that it would be unrealistic to try to eliminate the deficit "until we invest in those things that will give us a high-wage, high-growth future."
 
'He Helped Himself -- Some'
 If the comments of mayors here are any measure, Mr. Clinton may have made progress.
"I think he helped himself -- some," said Mayor Bob Lanier of Houston after hearing Mr. Clinton's speech. "He talked about the things that concern mayors and had some solutions to propose. So at least here's one candidate who's come up with a definite plan for something." Mr. Lanier is an independent.
Several dozen Democratic mayors from cities large and small called a news conference and lined up to praise Mr. Clinton. The most effusive praise came from Mayor Maynard Jackson of Atlanta.
"This is a new day in the Clinton campaign, a benchmark," he said. "This is a definite plan. People are going to buy into this. Where are the other candidates? Where are their plans? Bill Clinton is the man with the plan."
Mr. Clinton has seemed for the last several days to sense that perhaps there is a change in the political air for him. He is notably relaxed, lingering longer than usual to banter with prospective voters, sometimes hanging around even after the cleaning crews have moved in. He is also offering up more humor than usual and even some self-deprecation, never an easy play for a politician.
 
Seeking Investment
 This morning he was preceded on the dais by Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, a former professional football player, and Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat who played professional basketball.
"I was jealous -- two great athletes," he said. "I was always the slightly overweight bandboy and I've resented them all my life."
Mr. Clinton told the mayors that the key to getting the United States back on its economic feet was investment, especially in people. That was a major theme of his economic plan and he says he will continue to hammer on it.
"You have to put people first," he said.
He asserted that Republicans had so mismanaged the country that there were now two deficits, one in the budget and the other in investment in people. He promised that as President he would not only reduce the monetary deficit but also the deficit in investment in people by injecting money into social programs, particularly education.
 
Political Danger in Plan
 "When you invest in the future," he said, "you create wealth. We cannot afford to ignore the investment deficit. We've got to do it. You've got to demand that it be done. We've got to restore belief and faith in the future." He pounded his fist on the lectern for emphasis. Some of the mayors broke into applause.
There is political danger in Mr. Clinton's plan, particularly in the specificity he offers in programs and their costs. It leaves him vulnerable to Republican charges that he is just another tax-and-spend Democrat.
But the Governor's aides said he and his top strategists decided the risk was justified, with the need to get the campaign moving again taking precedence over Mr. Clinton's usual on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand approach to issues.
In coming weeks, Mr. Clinton is expected to try to give his campaign a further boost by announcing his choice for vice president. He has refused to disclose his thoughts, but his aides say he is not limiting his deliberations to a running mate who would simply add geographic and ideological balance to the ticket.

Excerpts From Clinton's Speech on His Economic Proposals

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 22

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the text of a speech by Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas today to the United States Conference of Mayors here.
 
INFRASTRUCTURE
 My plan is a bold plan. It offers $50 billion in new investments over the next four years in each of the next four years. New incentives for the private sector, an investment tax credit, urban enterprise zones, new business tax incentives, research and development incentives and others. 
 It offers $20 billion a year in hard Federal dollars every year for the next four years, to build an economy for the 21st century, to invest in new roads and bridges, and streets and rail systems, to develop high-speed rail and a national fiber optic network, to develop new environmental technologies to clean our waters and our air, and to recycle more of our solid wastes. In short, to do those things which we are not doing today.
All of you know, as well as I, that our competitors for the future are investing far higher percentages in their income than we are. And it make me sick inside to think what's going to happen to the incomes in the future of the American people if we don't make a commitment to invest in our capacity and our economy.
This $20 billion will create a million jobs a year in each of the next four years, driving funds into your cities. It will help us to do the things you said you wanted, when you issued your call for a $35 billion program in one year. This will do more over the next four years.
This will enable us to fund those ready-to-go projects you want funded. It will enable us to spend more in infrastructure, and in law enforcement, and in education, and in social services. It will enable us to expand the community development block grant program, which, as a governor, I also believe strongly in. And this will happen without spending one red cent of state or local money or private sector money.
When we leverage that, we can dramatically increase this program. The Rebuild America Coalition under the leadership of one of your number, Mayor Maynard Jackson, has recommended a number of things which can be done to leverage more local money and private sector money with this $20 billion commitment, including state revolving loan funds for many projects, and a Federal infrastructure development bank, on-bank.
I support the recommendations of The Rebuild America Coalition, and I will work hard to leverage this money so that we can generate even more investments and create more jobs.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
TAXES
 How do we pay for this? About half and half through raising money and cutting spending at the Federal level.
We have to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share again. Their incomes went up in the 1980's and their taxes went down. We can't ask the middle class to pay more. Their income went down and their taxes went up. No nation would do what we have done willingly.
For the first time since the Roaring Twenties, the top 1 percent of Americans control more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. We must say to the wealthy you have to pay your fair share. We also have to say to foreign companies, there's something wrong with our tax code, if your income went up 65 percent, in the 1980's, and your taxes went down 15 percent. And that's exactly what happened. You've got to pay your fair share if you want to do business in this country.
 
CUTTING GOVERNMENT
 But we can't just do that. We also have to change the way the Federal Government operates, too. The General Accounting Office, Congressman Dorgan's commission on government waste, and my own experience as a governor working, repeatedly cutting budgets and restructuring government tells me that there is a lot of money to save there.
I have recommended that we eliminate by attrition, not by firing anybody, but by attrition, 100,000 people from the Federal work force over the next couple of years.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
HEALTH CARE
 And we're going to adopt the toughest possible system to reform the health-care system, and bring health care costs under control. You will never be able to control this government spending until health care costs are brought in line with inflation.
And you live in the only advanced country where your nation has not taken a national approach to controlling health care costs by reforming the insurance market, by reducing bureaucracy, simplifying the billing procedures, and doing those things which other countries take for granted to keep costs in line with inflation. We must do that.
 
DEFICIT
 Now, a lot of people say to me, and this is an important big idea that you have to decide whether you agree with, they say, "Well, Governor, why don't you take all this money and reduce the deficit?" Because under my plan, we will increase investment and reduce the deficit by more than 50 percent over the next four years, but not eliminate it entirely.
"Why don't you just take it all and put it against the deficit?" I'll tell you why, because we have two deficits: a budget deficit and an investment deficit. And we cannot grow this economy until we put people back to work, and until we invest in those things that will give us a high-wage, high-growth future. We cannot do it. . . .
This plan will dramatically reduce the deficit, and dramatically increase investment. That is the only way to get economic growth. You must demand a four-year investment plan. You must go beyond what you have asked for. Go beyond your $35 billion one-year plan and say we have to invest for four years.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Assessment -- Clinton's Retreat;
Change on a Tax Cut for the Middle Class Could Forestall Accusations of Pandering

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
In putting forward a major new economic blueprint to help pull his campaign out of third place, Gov. Bill Clinton has retreated from one of his most controversial proposals: calling for an income tax cut for the middle class.
His new economic program, announced Sunday, focuses on ways to rebuild America's economy, but its most significant change from previous plans was Mr. Clinton's scaling back on his call for a middle-class tax cut, which he had long insisted was needed as a matter of fairness. 
 Governor Clinton's plan aims to speed economic growth by investing $200 billion to improve education and job training and to rebuild the nation's highways, communications system and inner cities. His proposal won vigorous applause in Houston today from the nation's mayors. [Page A19.]
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, a rival in the early primaries, had accused Mr. Clinton of pandering to voters in supporting the tax cut, and some campaign experts said he had altered his position to solidify Mr. Tsongas's support and to forestall future accusations that he tells voters what they want to hear.
Previously, Mr. Clinton offered middle-class taxpayers both a children's tax credit and a lower income tax rate, worth about $350 per family. In the new economic plan, he is offering them one or the other, but not both. The original plan would have cost about $26 billion, and the new plan about half that, campaign officials say.
Bruce Reed, the Governor's deputy campaign manager for policy issues, said the chief reason Governor Clinton changed his position was his growing concern that the Federal budget deficit needed to be reined in. After he was criticized for pandering on the tax cuts, that would certainly be an important change. Concern about the deficit mushroomed during the recent debate for a balanced budget amendment, and Ross Perot has been lambasting the White House and Congress for expanding the Federal debt to $4 trillion.
With economic growth beginning to pick up, a middle-class tax cut is no longer as necessary to spur the economy.
Governor Clinton's plan calls for stepped-up spending to improve education and job training to give American industry better workers and to give American workers better jobs. He vows to reduce class sizes, set up a national examination system in math and science and develop a national apprenticeship program to teach a trade to students not going to college.
His plan also calls for building a 21st-century transportation and communications system to create jobs and a better environment for doing business. This would include 200-mile-per-hour trains linking major cities and a computer network linking every home, business and classroom.
"The only way America can compete and win in the 21st century is to have the best-educated, best-trained work force in the world, linked together by transportation and communication networks second to none," Governor Clinton said in his economic plan.
 
In the Party Tradition
 Mr. Clinton's package, notwithstanding a few conservative flourishes, is very much in the Democratic tradition: seeing an active role for government to supplement the free market.
His blueprint, which is far more specific than any economic plan offered by President Bush or Mr. Perot, seeks to do far more than outline his vision of a reborn American economy. It also aims to force his two main opponents to replace their vague economic oratory with specific plans and to shift the campaign's focus onto the area where he feels most comfortable: issues.
He vowed to cut the Federal budget deficit in half in four years. And to raise revenues, he said he wanted to increase taxes for the richest 2 percent of the population.
The Arkansas Governor argued that it was time to move on from the Reagan-Bush era's laissez-faire policies, which he said cut taxes for the rich in the hope that they would invest and create jobs for the less well-off. He said that this trickle-down approach has failed, and he instead backed what some call a trickle-up approach. His hope is that by strengthening workers' skills and by creating modern infrastructure in which to do business, his program will keep and attract industries that provide high-paying jobs.
 
Drawing Criticism
 But his plan quickly drew criticism from many Republicans. "His investment plan just sounds like it's high tax, high spend," said Lawrence Kudlow, a Reagan Administration economist who is now the chief economist with Bear Stearns. "I think he will have a devil of a time defending it."
Still Mr. Clinton took pains to show that he was not just another tax-and-spend Democrat. He pledged to cut the budget deficit to $141 billion in 1996 from close to $400 billion this year. He said he would eliminate 100,000 jobs in the Federal Government and would order Government departments to reduce their administrative expenses by 3 percent a year for four years.
His plan also called for cutting the White House and Congressional staffs by 25 percent and would save $2 billion a year by asking for the line-item veto "to eliminate pork-barrel projects and cut government waste." He also said he would cut the military budget by $37 billion more than President Bush plans to over the next four years.
"This is a governing program," said Robert J. Shapiro, a Clinton economic adviser who is vice president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a research group in Washington. "This has a level of specificity one expects from a president, not from a candidate."
Using language that the Republicans are bound to attack as promoting class warfare, Mr. Clinton said: "Millions of Americans are running harder and harder just to stay in place. While taxes fall and incomes rise for those at the top of the totem pole, middle-class families pay more and earn less."
For one of the first times in the campaign, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady attacked the opposition. In a statement on the Clinton plan, he said, "If you want to decrease jobs, increase taxes -- particularly on small business men and women -- discourage savings and investment, fuel the engine of big government and drive away foreign investment, this is the perfect plan."
The Governor's proposals share some of Mr. Perot's populism. Mr. Clinton called for limiting a corporation's ability to deduct more than $1 million for the salaries of chief executive officers. He would also eliminate tax deductions for lobbying expenses. In addition, focusing on an issue that Mr. Perot has hammered away at, he said he would require officials to refrain for five years after leaving office from lobbying government agencies within their responsibilities.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Poll;
Bush and Clinton Sag in Survey; Perot's Negative Rating Doubles

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
The two major party candidates show remarkable weakness in the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. President Bush's handling of the economy is now as unpopular as President Jimmy Carter's ever was, while only a third of American voters see strong leadership qualities in Gov. Bill Clinton.
Ross Perot, the all-but-declared independent candidate, is faring better with this disgruntled electorate, but even his apolitical allure is showing its limits. Mr. Perot is now essentially tied with Mr. Bush in first place when voters are offered a choice among the three. But the percentage of voters who view the Dallas billionaire negatively has more than doubled in six weeks. 
 The poll, conducted Wednesday through Saturday, showed nearly all politicians facing a landscape filled with peril four and a half months before Election Day.
 
4 in 10 Still Dissatisfied
 Four in 10 registered voters said they were still not satisfied with the three candidates now running for the White House and wanted more choices. Almost half said the Government might work better if the people voted into the Congress and the White House were all new. And 69 percent agreed with the proposition that there was no connection between what a Presidential candidate promised and what he would do if elected, suggesting that the candidates face a wall of cynicism this year.
The survey also gave new insight into the demographics of Mr. Perot's support: His backers tend to be younger, tend to have higher incomes and tend to come from the West. In addition, confirming earlier polls, the survey showed Mr. Perot drawing support more heavily from men, from whites and from the ranks of self-described independents.
Discontent with Mr. Bush runs throughout this poll, which was based on telephone interviews with 1,315 adults. Only 34 percent approved of the way Mr. Bush was doing his job, down from 39 percent in early May. Seventy-eight percent disapproved of the way he was handling the economy, surpassing the 74 percent who disapproved of Mr. Carter's economic stewardship in June 1980.
 
Wary of Economy
 Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, said, "It's clear that no matter what the economic statistics show, voters still do not feel the economy is getting better."
Mr. Bush gets far better marks on foreign policy, with an approval rating of 46 percent. And in the afterglow of the visit of President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to Washington last week, 69 percent said they approved of Mr. Bush's handling of relations with the Russians. Still, domestic issues remain a powerful drag on Mr. Bush's popularity.
In a three-way race, 32 percent of the registered voters said they would prefer Mr. Bush, 30 percent Mr. Perot and 24 percent Mr. Clinton. Since the last Times/CBS Poll, conducted in early May, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton have slipped and Mr. Perot has gained.
In a head-to-head race, Mr. Bush and Mr. Perot would be essentially tied, 42 percent to 43 percent. And in a head-to-head contest with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush is ahead, but not significantly, given the survey's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points: Mr. Bush is at 45 percent, while Mr. Clinton is at 40 percent.
 
Two Downward Trends
 Ominously for Mr. Bush, his personal ratings have also declined significantly in the past three months. In March, 42 percent said they viewed Mr. Bush favorably, and 41 percent unfavorably. The latest poll showed Mr. Bush was viewed favorably by 29 percent and unfavorably by 44 percent.
But he can take heart from Mr. Clinton's standing. The Governor of Arkansas had hoped to use this time before the Democratic Party convention next month to repair his image after a bitter primary season dominated by "character issues," including charges that he avoided the draft, which he denied. But Mr. Perot has largely dominated the limelight, and the survey showed that Mr. Clinton's favorable ratings had actually declined over the past few months.
In April, for example, Mr. Clinton was viewed favorably by 26 percent and unfavorably by 40 percent. The latest poll showed Mr. Clinton viewed favorably by 16 percent, with 40 percent holding unfavorable views.
At the same time, the percentage of people who saw Mr. Clinton having strong leadership qualities dropped from 56 percent in March to 35 percent today. In contrast, 61 percent said in the new poll that they saw those leadership qualities in Mr. Bush and 54 percent saw them in Mr. Perot. Bush strategists are still counting on this perception of leadership ability to save their candidate this fall.
James Carville, a top strategist to Mr. Clinton, sought a philosophical tone. "It takes a while for things to happen," Mr. Carville said. "But we've had a good couple weeks, and I think he's starting to define himself. We've had our primary season. This summer is Perot's."
Mr. Clinton is given points for detailing his positions. Forty-three percent said he was telling them enough about where he stood on the issues, while 30 percent felt that way about Mr. Bush and 22 percent said they were hearing enough detail from Mr. Perot.
Mr. Perot's recent offering of new detail in one area, with his suggestion that affluent senior citizens give back some benefits to help with the Federal budget deficit, seemed a resounding dud. Only 10 percent of the registered voters said they would be willing to give some benefits back, and Mr. Perot's supporters were no more willing to do so than anyone else.
Mr. Perot is showing other bruises from his season of scrutiny. In late April, 21 percent viewed him favorably, and 9 percent unfavorably. In the new poll, 26 percent viewed him favorably, and 20 percent unfavorably.
Still, he is clinging to his forthright, unpolitical image, more so than his rivals. Forty-three percent agreed that Mr. Perot said what he believed most of the time, while 34 percent said he was just saying what he thought the voters wanted to hear. Thirty-seven percent said that Mr. Bush said what he believed most of the time, while 28 percent saw that level of candor in Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Perot's success as a businessman seemed even more of a draw than his image as an outsider: 33 percent said they most liked the fact that he was independent of the two political parties, while 40 percent said they most liked his image as a wealthy businessman who could get things done.
Still, when people were asked what most concerned them about a Perot Presidency, the most frequently volunteered answer was his lack of political experience.
Mr. Perot continues to draw supporters from the ranks of Democrats, Republicans and independents, and his backing has a strongly centrist cast. On three issues, however, Perot backers looked distinctive: They were most in favor of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution; they were most likely to say the United States should have continued the fighting in the Middle East until President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was ousted, and they were least likely to support economic aid to the former Soviet Union.
The poll also indicated that 58 percent of those surveyed agreed with the idea that the "the country needs a new political party to compete with the Democratic and Republican parties in offering the best candidates for public office."
But by a margin of 4 to 1, those people said Mr. Perot should not be the one to start a new party, indicating that they preferred his continued independence. Perot supporters were particularly in favor of creating a new party, with 76 percent of them saying they supported that course.
On other matters, the poll suggested that not everyone considered this to be the "year of the woman." Fifty-two percent said it was "not so important" to elect more women to the Senate this year, while 43 percent said it was "very important." And fewer than a third said they wanted to see one Presidential candidate name a woman as his running-mate; 57 percent said it did not matter much to them.
Even women seemed to be less than consumed with the idea of adding a woman to the ticket: only 37 percent said they wanted a candidate to name a female running-mate, while 49 percent said it did not matter much and 12 percent rejected the idea flat out.
But women were far more likely than men to put a priority on adding women to the Senate: 50 percent said it was "very important," while 35 percent of the men said that.

"How the Poll Was Conducted"
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Wednesday through Saturday with 1,315 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, of whom 1,029 said they were registered voters.
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened so that calls would be placed to residences only. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll.
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age, and education.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
 The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for results based on those registered voters who said they would vote for Ross Perot for President, it is plus or minus six percentage points.
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. (pg. A18)

HEADLINE: Movement Builds to Fight Harmful Projects in Poor Nations

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN a broadening movement that could change the way poor nations develop, environmentalists and human rights groups are joining forces to give the people in those countries the same power to scrutinize and oppose damaging projects that citizens of richer nations enjoy.
In an era when environmental debate has often pitted the developing nations against the industrialized countries, this new trend is marked by cooperation across borders and income levels. 
 Human rights and environmental groups say they are joining forces because governments of developing nations put development ahead of everything else, neglecting both human and environmental consequences. The Natural Resources Defense Council and Human Rights Watch issued a joint report, "Defending the Earth: Abuses of Human Rights and the Environment," earlier this month in which they said: "Repressive governments often defend their practices by asserting that human rights -- particularly freedoms of expression, association and participation in decision making -- are esoteric, and must take a back seat to the need to preserve order or foster economic development. We believe otherwise."
The strength of the movement and the potential power it can wield over international organizations was demonstrated for the first time last week with the publication of an independent review commissioned by the World Bank that condemned in strong terms the human and ecological destruction being caused by a $11.4 billion hydroelectric and irrigation project in India.
 
Bank Reassess Role
 The bank is now reassessing the project, the Sardar Sarovar complex of dams and canals in central India, on which more than $1.4 billion has already been spent for preliminary work.
After receiving a copy of the team's report, Lewis T. Preston, the bank's president, said, "We should proceed only if a practical way can be agreed to insure that the pace of further construction of the dam is adjusted to whatever extent is required to permit a fully responsible approach to the resettlement and environmental concerns." He also called for remedial actions like the improvement of how the bank looks at such projects, including local consultation with people affected.
The Government of India has not commented on the report.
Earlier last week, the United States voted against World Bank financing for a $55 million hydroelectric dam in Malawi. The project was approved on Wednesday despite the opposition of the United State, which was alone in its stand, but environmental groups plan to step up pressure to make the project an issue.
The Environmental Defense Fund, the International Rivers Network and Greenpeace International said in a letter to the bank before the vote that the project on the Shire River near Blantyre would threaten an already endangered elephant population, flood part of a wildlife sanctuary and disrupt the livelihoods of fishing families downstream.
Malawians are denied the right of dissent by a one-party government. A group of donor nations recently froze aid to the country to protest a spate of violent repression this spring.
The joint Natural Resources Defense Council-Human Rights Watch survey looks at Brazil, Eritrea, India, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines and the former Soviet Union as well as the United States. In all cases, the survey tried to rely as much as possible on local sources of information, giving the people involved an outlet for sharing experiences.
 
9 Months of Research
 The team that conducted the independent review of the hydroelectric project in India for the World Bank was led by Bradford Morse, an American who was formerly Under Secretary General of the United Nations and head of the United Nations Development Program, and Thomas R. Berger, a former judge on the Canadian Supreme Court.
The team drew on the expertise of South Asian specialists in social sciences, health and engineering. The review had been prompted by a barrage of human rights reports in Europe, the United States and Japan charging abuses against those who protested the forced relocation of at least 100,000 people and the drastic alteration of the Narmada River valley with over 3,000 dams, one of them 535 feet high and nearly 4,000 feet long, and 47,000 miles of canals. In some areas that are expected to be flooded within a month as waters rise behind the dams, people have refused to be resettled.
"This has been a test case for the way international groups can work with grassroots organizations in developing countries," said Patricia Gossman, director of the Washington office of Asia Watch, which issued its own report last week on the Sardar Sarovar project, "Before the Deluge: Human Rights Abuses at India's Narmada Dam."
"The Narmada case had widest cooperation worldwide," she said. "Groups with many mandates came together because they saw their interests were closely linked."
Last year Japan froze its $230 million contribution to the project, under pressure from environmentalists and human rights groups.
India plans to generate 1,450 megawatts of power, irrigate 4.4 million acres of land and provide drinking water to 40 million people from the project, which would stretch into three states.
"We received over 500 submissions from people in India who wanted to comment," said Donald J. Gamble, a leading Canadian environmentalist and resources specialist who directed research for the World Bank's independent review. "Everyone from government agencies to small groups of women in tribal villages."

HEADLINE: While Broadway Is Feasting, Small Troupes Are Starving

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
It may be boom time on Broadway, but this has not been a good season for a number of New York City's small nonprofit theater companies. The 13-year-old Manhattan Punch Line will close its doors by the end of June; the 24-year-old AMAS Musical Theater has indefinitely suspended operations, and managers of the 25-year-old Negro Ensemble Company say they will have to shut down by the end of the year if they cannot raise $250,000 to keep going.
The Double Image Company, an ensemble of actors, directors and writers that ran the Samuel French One-Act Play Festival, has halted production. And a dozen other theater companies are in serious financial trouble but will not say so publicly. 
 "It's dangerous to make a public announcement that you might go under," said Douglas Turner Ward, the president of the Negro Ensemble Company. "It can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. We waited for a year, until we had no other choice."
 
Build Subscribers or Perish
 Other casualties in recent seasons have included Chelsea Stages at the Hudson Guild Theater, the South Street Theater Company, the Apple Corps Theater, the New Theater of Brooklyn and the Quaigh Theater.
There has always been an ebb and flow among arts groups, as declining older companies have been replaced by newer ones. And indeed some of the city's best-known nonprofit theaters, like the Manhattan Theater Club, Playwrights Horizons and the Roundabout Theater, are thriving, mainly because their productions have attracted a healthy number of subscribers, and donors to match.
But observers of the nonprofit scene say this is the worst crisis in years for companies that lack large subscriber lists and thus must rely almost solely on public and corporate financing for their existence. City, state and Federal arts budgets are being deeply cut, as are corporate, foundation and private donations.
"Clearly this is one of the most difficult times ever to be a nonprofit," said Virginia P. Louloudes, the executive director of ART New York, the trade group representing 140 theater organizations in New York City. (She said there were 200 nonprofit theater companies in the city.)
 
Bad Now May Be Worse Later
 Others worry about the future as well. "We are seeing the first wave of closures now, in response to the terrible pressures on small- to medium-size theaters," said Robert Crane, a foundation executive who is an organizer of the Arts Forward Fund, a consortium of 32 major private and corporate contributors that raised $1.6 million last year to support arts organizations in New York.
"But I suspect there will be a real shakeout in the next few years," he added. "A lot of theaters are at the edge even if they are properly managed."
For the Negro Ensemble Company, financial crisis has always been a way of life, but during the last year the company has faced the serious possibility of extinction. Although the company has customarily mounted four major productions a year, it has been inactive for more than a year. Its last major show was "The Little Tommy Parker Celebrated Colored Minstrel Show," in March 1991. The paid staff of 10 is now 4 volunteers.
"We haven't had the production money," said Mr. Ward.
The Negro Ensemble Company's Federal and state financing has been cut by $270,000 in the last few years, to $300,000, Mr. Ward said. "All of our financial problems were held at bay until finally, with these major cuts, our vulnerability was exposed," said Mr. Ward in the company's comfortably cluttered office at 155 West 46th Street in Manhattan.
The company has a deficit of $250,000 to $300,000, said Mr. Ward, and the group will close its doors by the end of the year if it can't raise enough to pay its creditors. "We're not crying wolf," he said. "This is for real."
Founded by Mr. Ward, Robert Hooks and Gerald Krone, the Negro Ensemble Company has won two Tony Awards, a Pulitzer Prize for "A Soldier's Play," by Charles Fuller, and a wall full of Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards. Among its other major productions were "Ceremonies in Dark Old Men," "The River Niger," "Colored People's Time," "The Great MacDaddy," "From the Mississippi Delta," and Mr. Fuller's four-play, 20-actor epic on black Americans during the 19th century. The company's alumni include Roscoe Lee Browne, Rosalind Cash, Larry Fishburne, Frances Foster, Danny Glover, Moses Gunn, Phylicia Rashad, Roxie Roker, Esther Rolle, Hattie Winston and Denzel Washington.
Though black performers, writers and directors have increasingly found their way into the mainstream -- three of this season's major productions on Broadway, "Two Trains Running," "Jelly's Last Jam" and "Five Guys Named Moe" have almost exclusively black casts and were written and directed by blacks -- Mr. Ward insisted that the Negro Ensemble Company had not outlived its usefulness.
"The country needs an institution that has as its goal the production of black works," he said, "and if our company ceased to exist it would be necessary for someone to create the whole thing again."
For the AMAS Musical Theater, at Fifth Avenue and 104th Street, time and money have run out. The company is suspending operations this month "until we can find the money to continue," said Rosetta LeNoire, the founder and artistic director.
AMAS mounted three to four professional productions a year that have included "Mama I Want to Sing," "Bubbling Brown Sugar" and "Gunmetal Blues." Ms. LeNoire said the company had lost 90 percent of its Federal funds and 65 percent of its city funds, and had to let go its paid staff of three.
One nonprofit company, the venerable La Mama Experimental Theater Club, seemed to be tottering on the brink of extinction in March, but has undergone at least a temporary rebirth thanks to a widespread flurry of fund raising, especially among the numerous artists who have performed there. "We raised enough money to finish the season, and we cut into our deficit a bit," said Meryl Vladimer, an associate director of La Mama. "We're not out of the woods, but at this point we are planning for a season next fall."
Manhattan Punch Line could not generate such support, and is closing "because there comes a point where you can't tighten your belt any more," said Steve Kaplan, the group's artistic director. Its financing from the New York State Council on the Arts had dropped from $55,000 three years ago to $15,000 this year and its total budget was $19,000 this year, compared with $250,000 in the mid-1980's.
The Punch Line, which has offered 250 productions since 1979 to more than 50,000 people, including original plays by Howard Korder, Ted Tally, Terrence McNally and Horton Foote, decided to go out laughing, with its Eighth Annual Festival of One-Act Comedies, which ended last Sunday in the Judith Anderson Theater on West 42d Street.
A number of other small companies are furloughing their employees for a while, hoping for a better fiscal future. "We're laying off five people -- our entire administrative staff -- this summer," said Woodie King Jr., the founding and producing director of the New Federal Theater, the 22-year-old company at the Henry Street Settlement. "After that we can keep going, but we won't have a four-play season. It will be only three, or maybe two."
To survive, said Robert Crane of the Arts Forward Fund, small theater groups "have to adapt to a new era in which, unlike the 1970's and 80's, they cannot count on the availability of growing Federal, state and corporate arts funding." He said they need to develop new sources of earned income, to market themselves more effectively to their target audiences, and to cut costs by sharing resources and space with other arts groups.
Otherwise, they may become what Mr. Kaplan of the Punch Line calls "an endangered species."

HEADLINE: Russians in Antarctica Stage Protest Over Pay

BYLINE: By WALTER SULLIVAN

 BODY:
SCIENTISTS at Russia's five stations in Antarctica say they have stopped sending data home to protest the difficulties their families face in Russia.
In a statement signed by Dr. Vladimir Nazarov, leader of the Vostok station, the Russians cited their nation's severe inflation and said: "The miserable salary of Russian polar explorers, working in the rigorous climate of Antarctica, is hardly enough for our families even to buy food. We cannot help them. We can only send moral support by telephone." 
 Since past pleas for more pay had no result, the scientists have stopped sending scientific information to Moscow and St. Petersburg, although they are still collecting data.
The Vostok station is the most remote of any in Antarctica. The site is 11,300 feet above sea level on the central plateau of the polar ice sheet, which is thousands of feet thick.
 
125 Degrees Below
 In past winters temperatures there have been lower than anywhere else on earth, falling below -125 degrees Fahrenheit. Winter, with its almost perpetual darkness, began on Saturday.
Officials in Moscow and St. Petersburg say they are aware of the protest and have already increased the pay of those in Antarctica. The scientists' request to be paid, at least partly, in hard currency could not be met, said Yuri F. Zubov, head of the Committee of Hydrometeorology and Environment Monitoring of the Russian Federation.
At Vostok the Russians have been drilling holes deep into the ice. The most recent, as well as an earlier one, has reached 8,370 feet. Dr. Michael Bender at the University of Rhode Island said that ice from the bottom of the hole came from snow thought to have fallen between 190,000 and 230,000 years ago during the next-to-last interglacial period.

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
When Patient's Life Is Price of Learning New Kind of Surgery

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

 BODY:
"SEE one, do one, teach one."
That is the classic doctors' description of the way new procedures and operations are taught.
But the credo seems destined for deserved oblivion. 
 Alarmed about rising numbers of deaths and serious injuries from a new method of gallbladder surgery, in which surgeons use miniature video cameras and instruments inserted through tiny incisions, the New York State Health Department has demanded tighter regulations. It has directed hospitals to be stricter in deciding which surgeons can perform the procedure and to pay more attention to their results.
New York's action is forcing doctors and health officials elsewhere to begin to deal publicly with a fundamental issue they have long failed to address: the learning curve.
There are at least two kinds of learning curves in surgery. One is when young surgeons first perform an established operation. The other is when established surgeons first perform a new operation.
For either, learning surgery invariably involves errors until practice makes near perfect. Usually the initial practicing is done on animals. But there comes a time for each surgeon's first patient. Although surgeons have long accepted the inevitability that some patients will be injured from the learning curve, rarely have they or health officials spelled out the limits or the rules. Instead the key decisions have been left to individual surgeons and hospitals.
But New York health officials were emphatic in saying that a learning curve was not justification for serious injury to patients. The Health Department insists that surgeons not be allowed to perform the new laparoscopic procedures independently until they have shown adequate skill in at least 15 supervised cases.
The learning curve is a complex policy issue. It involves the tangled web of medical politics -- turf battles between specialties, and town-gown conflicts between professors in teaching hospitals and practicing surgeons in community hospitals. It also involves consumerism and the economic interests of equipment manufacturers and the health insurance companies that pay the bills.
Doctors generally greet new techniques with caution because history teaches that initial waves of enthusiasm are often tempered by the discovery of unexpected complications. While a few new techniques succeed, many others fail, and it takes time to sort them out.
But any caution for the laparoscopic gallbladder operation among surgeons has been offset by surging patient demand of a magnitude rarely seen in medical history. The prospect of less pain and a return to work several weeks earlier leads most people facing gallbladder surgery to choose the new procedure over the traditional one. And not surprisingly, the laparoscopic procedure is rapidly replacing the older operation among the 500,000 Americans who have gallbladder surgery each year.
In the procedure, several small holes are cut in the abdomen. A laparoscope, a device with a light and camera that is attached to an external video monitor, is inserted for a close-up view of organs and tissues. Instruments are inserted through the other holes and manipulated from outside the body.
The learning curve for laparoscopy is important. One reason is that the required hand-eye coordination differs significantly from that used in traditional abdominal surgery. Laparoscopy is an indirect approach: when surgeons watch a television screen and pivot long-handled instruments through a hole, they lose the feel for the tissues. They have to adjust to new ways to judge how much pressure to apply in finding pathways and cutting through tissue.
Another reason is the restricted field of vision imposed by laparoscopes, even those with wider angle lenses. Operators have a much more limited view of the anatomy when cutting with the laparoscope than in the traditional operation, where they look directly at organs and tissues and can handle them.
While most operations go smoothly, the complications that can result from laparoscopy include some that are not generally seen with the older operation. Many complications are not recognized until days, even months, after laparoscopic surgery.
Strong economic pressures have compelled many surgeons to learn the new technique because those who can do only the old one risk losing patients to competitors who offer the laparoscopic procedure.
Most new operations have been developed in academic medical centers and some are scrutinized in scientifically controlled studies before being made standard for practice. Such introduction tends to be slow as younger surgeons, who learned the technique during training, go off and practice in community hospitals.
But the new technique, introduced by surgeons in France and the United States in 1989, is one of the few major procedures to come out of community hospitals. Its development and rapid acceptance caught most teaching hospitals off guard.
In a break from the usual collegiality in surgical teaching, some surgeons who performed it initially charged other surgeons $500 to watch them do one procedure. Responsible surgeons then practiced on animals and moved on to patients by assisting colleagues already skilled in the procedure. But some surgeons began doing the procedure on their own with little further training.
Soon courses were set up, often financed by equipment manufacturers as is customary. Most courses are conducted on weekends, where the tuition fees run up to $4,000. The curriculum and quality vary widely. Beyond lectures and videotaped instruction, the best courses offer hands-on practice on animals, often pigs.
Early on, few teaching hospitals offered courses to teach the laparoscopic gallbladder technique to practicing surgeons. Now, in an unusual twist, many community surgeons are teaching the professors.
From the start, there were warnings about the prospects of botched laparoscopic gallbladder surgery. But the exact rate of complications is not known because of the lack of scientifically controlled studies and a national registry.
A few regional and national surveys have been carried out. But because they were based on voluntary reporting, experts say the frequency of botched operations is probably seriously underestimated.
Several surgical groups have published their experience with laparoscopic gallbladder surgery. But because surgeons tend to report their best results, statistics in medical journals seldom offer a realistic picture of practice in all hospitals.
The American College of Surgeons in Chicago has said that laparoscopic gallbladder surgery should be performed by surgeons qualified to perform the traditional operation because they are the only ones with the skills to treat any complications.
Knowing how to do the traditional operation is critical because problems in about 10 percent of cases force surgeons to switch immediately to the standard one.
But an unresolved issue is that with the rapid disappearance of the older operation, few younger surgeons will know how to do it in the future.
"It is only when you feel confident with the older gallbladder operation, knowing where the ducts and arteries are, that you should be tackling the laparoscopic technique," said Dr. Christopher G. Eliades, a surgeon in Nashua, N.H., who has performed 50 laparoscopic gallbladder operations.
The college's statement also reflects the turf battle with gynecologists who learned laparoscopic techniques long before general surgeons picked it up.
The American College of Surgeons has never issued a document on the learning curve. And the college has not addressed the issue of how credentials are obtained to perform laparoscopic gallbladder surgery because it considers it a matter for individual hospitals, said Linn Meyer, a spokeswoman for the college.
Dr. Hiram C. Polk Jr., the chairman of surgery at the University of Louisville, said: "If the public has to wait a few months while a corps of people are being trained, that is not all bad, particularly since you are not talking about a cure for cancer. You are talking about a traditional treatment that was certainly safe and had good long-term results."
Many surgeons insist that the new gallbladder technique is safest when carried out by two surgeons. For example, Dr. Mohan C. Airan, associate head of surgery at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Chicago, said no major injuries to the common bile duct occurred among more than 1,000 cases in Chicago hospitals that adhered to strict criteria, including the presence of two surgeons.
But despite the widespread belief that the new procedure saves money, many insurers are not paying for a second surgeon, jeopardizing patient safety, Dr. Airan said.
Limited data from published studies suggest that most complications occur among a surgeon's first 20 or so laparoscopic gallbladder operations. Despite centuries of experience with the learning curve, surgeons seldom tell patients they are the first to undergo a procedure in their hands.
Now, as public officials and medical leaders tackle the learning curve issue, they might consider offering a steep discount to a surgeon's first patients and then work out a sliding scale of fees for successive cases.

HEADLINE: Now, Where's Their Beef?

 BODY:
So far, Bill Clinton is the only Presidential candidate to offer an economic plan. He has just issued a revised version, and it gives a sound answer to every important question:
How much must the deficit be cut? In half, Governor Clinton says, which avoids dogmatic calls to eliminate it no matter what the consequences.Should taxes be raised? Yes, he answers, with some political courage, by $150 billion. Can spending also be cut? Yes, by an equal amount -- and he would plow the savings into a $200 billion program of public investment. 
 The new plan, like the one he published last winter, trips over details and is full of election-year feints and evasions. Even so, it puts Mr. Clinton a full lap ahead of his opponents in the substance sweepstakes. Ross Perot is still hiding behind vapid promises to act smart. President Bush doesn't even bother to promise. By offering his plan, Mr. Clinton may constructively impel his opponents to tell, in some detail, what they stand for.
Mr. Clinton's new plan withdraws his pledge to eliminate the deficit within four years, proposing instead to draw it down to about $150 billion a year. At that level, the deficit would not strain private capital markets. But it would allow Mr. Clinton to pump money into public infrastructure, education and worker training. Facing up to fiscal reality, he also has reduced the middle-class tax cut he promised early in the primary campaign.
Mr. Clinton's document nevertheless reflects a high political polish. He would have voters believe that the deficit can be controlled by raising taxes only on corporations and the super rich. He proposes taking only a nick out of entitlements, even though they are expected to explode by 2000. He takes easy shots at unpopular targets like high executive pay, foreign corporations and domestic firms relocating abroad. The plan pretends that bold solutions will be painless.
But at least Mr. Clinton addresses problems, which is more than can be said of his opponents. Mr. Perot writes off social problems with empty assumptions. Whatever the problem -- health care, deficits, crime, urban blight -- the answer is the same: "Let's figure out what has to be done and just do it."
Does that mean older adults should be called on to give up cost-of-living adjustments to retirement benefits? Should middle-class families pay higher taxes, farmers give up subsidies and homeowners part with their mortgage-interest deduction? Mr. Perot doesn't say.
President Bush so far won't even make promises. He renews tiresome calls for pending legislation on crime, job training, enterprise zones, homeownership and school choice. Not one of these talking points includes serious dollars or matches the magnitude of the problems.
Beyond the specifics of his new plan, Governor Clinton now offers thoughtful voters the start of a credible debate. For the moment, alas, it's the sound of one hand clapping, and voters are left waiting to hear the other two.

Amid the usual boisterousness of its annual public meeting, the New York City Rent Guidelines Board passed rent increases Monday night, including a continuation of a 5 percent vacancy allowance that spurred the board's two tenant representatives to resign.
The board approved rent increases of 3 percent on one-year leases, 5 percent for two-year leases and a 5 percent vacancy allowance, the amount a landlord may raise the rent when a tenant moves out. Throughout the meeting at Police Plaza, the board's actions were greeted by jeers as landlords and tenants played out their customary clash at the annual meeting. 
 At its meeting on May 11, the board agreed to propose the increases on one- and two-year leases but dropped the vacancy allowance. When the vacancy allowance was agreed to by a majority of the board, the two tenant representatives, Galen Kirkland and Oda Friedheim, announced their resignations. Their replacements will be named by Mayor David N. Dinkins, who appoints all board members.
 
A Landlords' View
 "It became apparent we were not making progress toward establishing fair rents," Mr. Kirkland said yesterday. "I believe that the vacancy allowance is not necessary because the owners are able to cover expenses through other increases allowed under the rent-stabilization system."
But a landlord representative, John Gilbert, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, felt that the increases were inadequate. "The board committed economic suicide," he said. "The results of these votes are going to be more abandonment, more homelessness and reduced city services, because property owners are going to go out of business."
"Property taxes went up on average 11 percent; water and sewer taxes 18 percent," Mr. Gilbert added. "How can an owner pay these increases on a 3 percent rent increase?"
In 1991, the board adopted increases of 4 percent on a one-year lease, 6 1/2 percent for a two-year lease and 5 percent for a vacancy. The new increases will affect about 600,000 of the 900,000 rent-stabilized apartments in the city where the leases expire in the coming year.
The board's executive director, Timothy Collins, said the increases were "consistent with research indicating what is necessary to cover changes in operating costs on a dollar-for-dollar basis."
"We do the research and report the results," Mr. Collins added, "and let the advocates interpret as they will."

American to Lift Fares 4.4%

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

DATELINE: NEW YORK, June 23

 BODY:
American Airlines said today that it wanted to raise fares by at least 4.4 percent to cover higher fuel costs in what appeared to be a belated response to Northwest's attempt to push up prices by 10 percent across the board.
Although the move by American, a unit of AMR Corporation, sent the competition scurrying, the giant carrier from Fort Worth, Texas, said it was not concerned about creating any public perception that the airlines are rigging the fare system. 
 "We're not fixing prices," a spokesman, Tim Smith, said. "It's up to the others what they do with this. We think it makes good economic sense. Others will have to decide whether it makes sense for them."
 
Jet-Fuel Prices Take Off
 But American will likely abandon the higher fares, set to take effect July 7, if the competition does not match them.
The carrier said in a statement it would first restore all its prices to levels set on April 9, when American unveiled what it called a simplified pricing system. Since then, competitors have lowered fares in some markets and American matched the lower fares.
American said that once the April 9 fares were back in place, it would push up all fares by 4.4 percent across the board to cover jet fuel costs that have risen by 11.2 percent since winter. Oil has been more expensive since Saudi Arabia, the world's dominant petroleum exporter, recently said it was willing to see the price of crude rise this summer.
Mr. Smith estimated the overall increase would be less than 5 percent.
As a sample of the higher fares, American said passengers going from Dallas to Seattle would see the price rise to $400 from $350, either for a full-fare, one-way ticket or for a round trip on a 14-day advance purchase leisure ticket.
Passengers going from Washington to Miami would see prices rise to $300 from $290, on the same types of tickets, while passengers going from New York to Chicago would see such fares rise to $260 from $250.
American said it was rejecting the Northwest fare proposal because some of the cheaper fares introduced by competitors were not fairly based on the distance flown.
"A 10 percent overall increase at this time, as others have announced, would only perpetuate the inequity inherent in such pricing," said Mike Gunn, senior vice president of marketing at American. "We have elected instead to adhere to the principles of fairness and simplicity of the original value plan."

HEADLINE: STRIKE AT AMTRAK POSTPONED 2 DAYS

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
Rail maintenance workers last night postponed for two days their threatened strike against Amtrak after failing to reach agreement on a new contract by a midnight deadline.
After a day of intense negotiations during which Amtrak reached agreement with several of its smaller unions, the reprieve by the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees relieved mounting tension over the possibility of a nationwide strike against commuter, intercity passenger and freight lines. 
 "Despite the efforts by Amtrak to force us into a strike, and because we do not want to inconvenience the public, the B.M.W.E. will not strike Amtrak for at least the next 48 hours," said Jed Dodd, the union's top negotiator.
 
More Negotiations
 He said the union would continue to negotiate with Amtrak for the next two days.
But the late announcement did not clarify whether the union would strike Amtrak later, or whether its members would shut down Conrail, a large freight railroad that is involved in a separate dispute with its unions. Mr. Dodd said the union was continuing to negotiate with Conrail and did not intend to strike immediately, but was concerned that Conrail might unilaterally impose conditions on the union. A company spokesman said early this morning that Conrail had imposed new work rules effective immediately, but did not elaborate.
Nor is it clear whether the International Association of Machinists will continue bargaining with most of the nation's other freight railroads, which like Conrail imposed new work rules on the machinists.
The machinists union immediately began picketing CSX, a large freight railroad, but it appeared that the union was striking CSX alone as opposed to a nationwide action that might invite Congressional intervention.
Just before a midnight deadline, Amtrak initialed agreements with four of its unions.
The threat of a nationwide rail strike had raised the specter of serious damage to the economy, and had put Congress in the position of having to consider legislation imposing a contract settlement on the reluctant unions. President Bush yesterday urged Congress to stop any rail strike on the day it began.
But while the decision not to strike Amtrak gave immediate relief to travelers who might have been stranded by a strike, the outcome is no more certain than the union's motives in forgoing a strike against Amtrak.
 
Perhaps a Tactical Move
 For example, the union's decision may be simply a tactical move, perhaps one intended to keep the pressure on Amtrak and Conrail without risking a Congressionally imposed settlement, or perhaps one meant to delay a strike until Congress leaves town for the Fourth of July recess.
But officials following the negotiations said Mr. Dodd seemed pleased with the progress in the talks and did not want to break off talks and send his members onto the picket lines. Instead, it appears that the union will pause in its talks with Amtrak and continue the marathon sessions with Conrail.
President Bush did not give the unions any encouragement yesterday. After meeting with Transportation Secretary Andrew H. Card Jr., President Bush said, "The public good is not served by a prolonged strike, so it ought to end the day it begins."
Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, suggested at a news conference that Congress might take a few days to act in the event of a strike. "We will first find out what the facts are," he said. But he also said, "Congress will not sit idly by."
In April 1991, Congress halted a rail strike 17 hours after it began, imposing contract terms that had been recommended by a Federal mediation panel.
 
Criticism of Bush
 Mr. Dodd said he hoped Congress would not move swiftly to stop a strike this time, especially one that did not affect the entire rail industry. He accused Mr. Bush of intervening on the side of railroad management.
"When it looks like workers can lose a strike, President Bush supports the right to strike," Mr. Dodd said. "When it looks like workers can win a strike, President Bush opposes the right to strike."
The Senate yesterday passed a Republican-sponsored nonbinding resolution that "Congress needs to act immediately to forestall a possible railroad strike." It was not immediately clear what Congress would or could do to follow through on the measure.
 
Bitterness Among Workers
 Conrail employees interviewed at a job site in the New York area were unanimous in calling for a strike unless the giant freight railroad agreed to their demands, including a retroactive pay increase.
Wolfing down eggs, bacon, cereal and coffee in the makeshift quarters that the rail workers share during the workweek, they spoke bitterly of receiving no pay increase in five years, of lacking job security, and of proposed changes in work rules that they said would make their jobs scarcely worth the $26,000 a year that the average union member earns.
Every week Kevin Bellinski, one of the workers, drives from his home in Canton, Ohio, to join what the laborers call a "tie gang," a group of itinerant laborers who work four 10-hour days plus overtime before returning home. This week, the drive was to northeast New Jersey.
Mr. Bellinski and his fellow workers, most of whom also said they commute long distances, live in cramped boxcars austerely outfitted with bunk beds, bathrooms and kitchens. The cars periodically move along the rails, providing a base from which the workers deploy each morning.
According to the union, Conrail wants to change seniority rules in a way that will force many workers to travel even farther from their homes than they already do.
The union wants a benefit paid to employees on furlough to more than double. Workers with enough seniority can work almost year round, but those with less seniority often go months without work, collecting only $155 a week in benefits.


GRAPHIC: In the event of a strike by Amtrak workers, commuter lines plan these service changes:
 
LONG ISLAND
Chart: "Transit: Helping Commuters Cope"
 * The Long Island Rail Road would suspend service to and from Pennsylvania Station during a strike. Trains would terminate at Jamaica, Woodside, Shea Stadium, Long Island City and Richmond Hill in Queens and at Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, where riders could connect with city subways.
 * The Transit Authority recommended that commuters at Jamaica use a special stirke express train, the P train. It would run along the J line to Essex Street, then switch to the F line, ending at 34th Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan. In Jamaica, the P train would use the lower level of the Sutphin Boulevard station. In Manhattan, it owuld use the downtown E platform at 34th Street.
 * At Woodside and Shea Stadium, riders were told to use the No. 7.
 * At Long Island City, riders would take the G train; the No. 7 is extremely crowded.
 * Those who drive were told to park at the Kennedy Airport park-and-ride lot in Howard Beach and catch the A train into Manhattan.
 * Riders from Brooklyn were told to avoid the 2,3,4 and 5 trains, which are already crowded, and use the B,D,Q,M,N and R lines.
 
NEW JERSEY
 * There would be no service on the North Jersey Coast, Northeast Corridor and Raritan Valley lines of N.J. Transit. The Hoboken Division would not be affected. Bus service was planned from many N.J. Transit stations to Manhattan or Newark, where commuters could board PATH into Manhattan.
 * N.J. Transit would also run buses between the Garden State Arts Center and Newark and New York.
 * Officials warned that the extra buses would be able to accommodate only half the rail commuters affected by the strike.
 
CONNECTICUT
 * No disruption was expected on the Metro-North Commuter Railroad. Service on the Shore Line East, from Old Saybrook to New Haven, would be suspended, but bus service was planned. (pg. B4)

HEADLINE: ISRAEL'S LABOR PARTY WINS CLEAR VICTORY IN ELECTION; READY TO FORM A COALITION

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Wednesday, June 24

 BODY:
Israel's opposition Labor Party won a resounding victory over the right-wing Likud Party in Tuesday's national election, nearly complete results showed today. The vote creates the possibility of a center-left coalition committed to greater flexibility in Middle East peace talks.
For the first time since its tumble from political dominance in the 1970's, Labor was in a clear position to form a Government, although it fell short of a parliamentary majority of its own. 
 Given the party's stated willingness to exchange land for peace with the Arabs, its apparent victory seemed likely to be welcomed by the United States, which has grown weary of the Likud Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and views him as intransigent in the peace process.
 
No Security Lessons
 After his defeat became clear, Mr. Shamir strongly suggested that he might retire from political life.
Yitzhak Rabin, the Labor leader and almost certainly the country's next Prime Minister, pledged early this morning that the coalition he will begin shaping today will "include all the positive forces in the nation that identify with our way: furthering peacemaking while safeguarding our security."
In an obvious reference to Likud, which had accused Labor of being soft on Israel's defense, Mr. Rabin told cheering supporters in Tel Aviv, "No one will teach us what responsibility for security is."
 
Shamir Near Retirement?
 He then echoed a basic campaign theme, saying that "we will change the order of national priorities."
In recent months, he repeatedly said that high on his list of altered priorities would be a shift of Government money from settlement-building in Israeli-occupied territories to social and economic needs in Israel proper.
Although Mr. Shamir stopped short of announcing his resignation, he gave an unmistakable impression that his political career was about over.
 
Parliamentary Majority
 "It's natural and understandable that in political life, under these conditions, I am at the end of my personal road," he told an Israeli television interviewer this morning.
With 97 percent of the ballots counted, projections showed Labor winning 45 seats in the 120-member Parliament, far more than the 32 forecast for Likud and a sharp departure from the last election, in 1988, when the two major parties were nearly balanced.
The projections also gave 12 seats to the left-wing Meretz Party, a natural coalition partner for Labor, and a total of 5 to two Arab parties. Combined, Labor, Meretz and the Arabs have 62 seats, a parliamentary majority and more than enough to block Likud from regrouping the religious-right alliance that it led for the last two years.
A big complication is that Mr. Rabin has said he would not govern with the Arabs, thus leaving Labor and Meretz by themselves four seats short of a majority. Nonetheless, his lead was solid enough to put him in a commanding position to do much as he pleases in piecing together a working coalition.
The leaders of several small religious parties, which collectively lost ground this time, signaled almost immediately after exit polls were flashed on television screens that they were ready to deal even though their natural inclination is to align themselves with Likud.
In his speech to supporters early this morning, Mr. Rabin emphasized that he would seek a coalition that will "express the central current among our people, a coalition that will enable us to carry out our policy."
Some political analysts said it was possible that the Labor leader, who was Prime Minister in 1977 when his party first lost power, had not entirely ruled out a coalition with Likud along the lines of one that prevailed through much of the last decade.
While others thought that an unlikely development, many politicians in both parties are convinced that Mr. Rabin -- a former military hero and a man who is appreciably more hawkish than many in his party -- would feel more comfortable working with Mr. Shamir than with the ardent doves in Meretz and even in Labor.
"He doesn't want to be completely in the hands of Meretz," said Shlomo Avineri, a pro-Labor political scientist at Hebrew University. "He also doesn't want to be in the hands of the religious."
 
'No Bargaining'
 Whatever happens, the 70-year-old Mr. Rabin left no doubt this morning that he was in charge, a point that seemed directed also at Shimon Peres, a longtime archrival whom he displaced as Labor leader in February in Israel's first party primary.
"I will determine who the ministers will be," he said as supporters interrupted him periodically with a blast from a ram's horn and chants of "Rabin, king of Israel!" "There will be no bargaining," he continued.
At Likud headquarters, the mood was decidedly grim as senior officials acknowledged that they were about to enter the opposition. Some said that internal bloodletting would soon follow, especially if Mr. Shamir, who is 76, does leave politics after having served as Prime Minister for seven of the last nine years.
But through the gloom, Mr. Shamir cautioned that his party, while down, was not out.
 
Harbor for the Disaffected
 "We all know that tonight there are people all over the world and in the Middle East and other places who are happy and gleeful now that their dangerous enemy, the Likud, which raised the prestige of the people of Israel higher and higher in recent years, is coming down," he told Likud stalwarts in Tel Aviv. "I say to them, 'Your joy is premature."'
From the minute voting ended on a clear, mild election day, it became apparent that Labor's strategy to regain power had paid off.
It concentrated most of its energies on Mr. Rabin, holding him forth as tough about security and therefore a safe harbor for disaffected Likud supporters eager to register a protest vote but uneasy about swinging to Labor because they perceive it as overly dovish.
For many, Likud had overstayed its welcome for many reasons -- lack of clear progress in the peace process, a deterioration in relations with the United States and, perhaps most important, high unemployment and a general sense that the country is not being run right.
 
'A Lack of Trust'
 "We're talking basically about a lack of trust in Likud's ability to govern," said Gadi Wolfsfeld, a Hebrew University political scientist.
To a large extent, the inherent tension between a relatively hawkish Labor leader and many of his followers contributed to a blurring of key issues, which were not discussed in depth during the election campaign. Nonetheless, differences between Labor and Likud are plain on pivotal issues of peace and security, notably Mr. Rabin's willingness to give up some of Israel's occupied territories and his call for a reduction of Jewish settlements on those lands.
Those positions are certain to gladden the Bush Administration, which had made clear its unhappiness with Mr. Shamir's no-compromise stand on territory and his insistence on building settlements to "the horizon's edge."
"It's a decidedly unambiguous defeat for the Israeli right and its policies on all fronts," said Yaron Ezrahi, another political scientist at Hebrew University and a Likud opponent.
 
First-Time Voters
 Still, polls and pre-election interviews suggested that many Israelis were not focused on peace and security as much as on bread-and-butter concerns.
According to voter surveys at polling places, the several hundred thousand new immigrants from the former Soviet Union voted for Labor over Likud by a margin of 47 percent to 18 percent, mainly because of their unhappiness over failed economic policies that have left 40 percent of them unemployed. The newcomers did not vote for several ethnic Russian parties in sufficiently large numbers to give any of them a parliamentary seat.
First-time voters, normally hawkish, also shifted toward Labor and Meretz and away from Likud. Many of them, survey takers said, also voted for a small right-wing party, Tsomet. Although it demands that Israel not give up any territory, its greater appeal to many voters was as a good-government party interested in electoral change and an end to perceived abuses of state funds. According to projections, Tsomet will increase its parliamentary strength from 2 seats to 7.
Among Tsomet's targets were the religious parties, some of which in theory do not recognize the state of Israel but depend on it all the same for money for their seminaries and other institutions. They slipped from 18 seats to a projected 17, in good part because their strength was diluted by the overwhelmingly secular Jews from Russia and other former Soviet republics.
They were not the only losers as the welter of 15 parties in the old Parliament seemed likely to dwindle to 10 -- sparse by Israel's fractious standards.
Tehiya, a far-right party that had three parliamentary seats, did not qualify for a single seat this time, making it one of the day's big losers.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Ultimately, Nissan Calls Car 'Altima'

BYLINE: By Adam Bryant

 BODY:
WITHIN months, the Nissan Motor Company will roll out a replacement for its slow-selling Stanza compact with the ambitious goal of winning over car shoppers inclined toward the Honda Motor Company's popular Accord and the Toyota Motor Corporation's Camry.
Nissan faced an equally daunting challenge in 1987 when its executives sat down to name the car. The Stanza moniker was often criticized for being too much like Nissan's subcompact Sentra, which shares four of six letters with Stanza. "For some reason, the Stanza never stuck in anyone's mind," said Earl Hesterberg, vice president and general manager of the Nissan division of the parent's American arm. Many industry watchers considered Stanza the second misnomer from Nissan, which confused consumers in the early 1980's by switching its nameplate from Datsun to Nissan. 
 The new compact's name: Altima. Its derivation from the Latin "altus" suggests "a higher order," as does its similarity to the word ultimate, Mr. Hesterberg said. The "ima" ending may cause some confusion with the top-of-the-line Maxima, Mr. Hesterberg said, but that problem would be preferable to confusion with the economical Sentra.
Whether consumers find the name pleasing is no small matter. As auto makers improve the quality of their wares, car buyers increasingly decide among models by the emotional appeal of a car's styling and image. The role of the name, therefore, is "to trigger that emotion," said Charles Brymer, president of the Interbrand Corporation, which counts among its work naming Mazda's new luxury division, Amati. Nissan hopes to induce the right emotions often in September, when it will introduce the car with its most expensive new-car advertising campaign.
Is Altima, coined by David Wood Associates of New York, a good name? The reviews from other identity consultants are mixed, underscoring not only the highly subjective nature of this science-cum-art, but also some of the subtleties of fashioning marques in the hotly competitive auto industry.
The first point of disagreement appears to be whether the correct pronunciation of Altima is readily apparent. Ira N. Bachrach, president of Name Lab Inc. in San Francisco, says consumers generally tackle unfamiliar names by borrowing pronunciation from a similar word, such as altitude. That would suggest a straightforward AL-ti-ma. But others noted that consumers may also see "ultimate" in the wording, and venture another guess, maybe UL-ti-ma. In recent months, in fact, many Nissan executives and dealers have served up many versions. The official pronunciation, according to Mr. Hesterberg: Borrow the "a" sound from alternator. Thus, AHL-ti-ma.
The uncertainty of a new name's pronunciation can be both an asset and a liability, said Kate Moran, senior vice president in charge of naming for Lippincott & Margulies, whose work includes dubbing Nissan's Infiniti luxury division and the Cadillac Allante. Those who know how to pronounce an unusual car name may feel part of an exclusive group, but those outside it may be irritated by the uncertainty, she said.
Of course, many new car names are not easily discernible until they are trumpeted in commercials. For example, how many consumers knew how to say Camaro when they first saw the word, or Miata?
Ms. Moran applauds the Altima name for its "foreign and romantic" ring, while others say it sounds too much like other products. Ms. Moran also speculated that it might be among the last car names, at least for a while, that begin and end with the letter a. With Honda's Acura division, Oldsmobile's Achieva compact and Nissan's Altima, the device is "a little overworked," she said, much as the letter "x" was, when it caught corporate fancies, resulting in such names as Nynex and USX.
Given the plethora of concocted names for automobiles, Ms. Moran predicts that auto makers may start scouring dictionaries once again for words like Quest, the name Nissan has given to its new mini-van due out later this year. Indeed, Mr. Hesterberg said he would prefer to use existing names because they garner more immediate recognition. "You don't have to work as hard" to familiarize the public with the name, he said.
Nissan may not be entirely clear of confusion over the Altima name. The car's official name is Stanza Altima, and Government regulations apparently require the auto maker to include the Stanza name on the trunk, even though Stanza will not be included in Nissan's marketing. Mr. Hesterberg said the decal would also help ease the transition for consumers from Stanza to Altima.

HEADLINE: Philanthropic Giving Rose 6.2% in '91, Study Says

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Philanthropic giving across the nation increased last year to $124.7 billion, a 6.2 percent rise over 1990, a new study says.
Americans continued to demonstrate generosity to religious and educational institutions but slighted nonprofit hospitals and human service organizations, the study found. Major art museums did well, receiving important works, but dance groups suffered. 
 The study was performed by the Trust for Philanthropy, the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel's research arm, which annually estimates the donations from individuals, corporations and foundations to the country's nonprofit organizations.
That the total of giving rose to a record level despite the sluggish economy and high unemployment was welcome news for most larger nonprofit organizations, officials of the Trust for Philanthropy said. But some officials, noting that the increase was only 1.4 percent when adjusted for inflation, expressed disappointment.
"You would have to be a fool not to expect giving to be very healthy, because of two phenomena," said Martin Grenzebach, chairman of the Trust for Philanthropy. "There are 10 times more millionaires today than in 1980, and the baby-boom generation is moving into the 34-to-65-year age group, considered the prime giving years, when discretionary income goes up and individuals can be more generous. But the reality is Americans' per-capita giving to charity is much less than some of us anticipated."
But Ann Kaplan, author of the study, said a number of nonprofits and officials in the philanthropy field regarded the increases as remarkably strong. Giving by individuals in 1991 accounted for 89 cents of every dollar contributed to nonprofits -- $103.1 billion from living donors and $7.78 billion in bequests. Foundations gave $7.76 billion, an increase reflecting the growth of their assets because of improved stock market performance. Corporate giving totaled $6.1 billion.
 
Religious Groups Gain
 As usual, the largest share of philanthropic giving went to religious organizations: $67.6 billion, which came almost entirely from individuals. Education received $13.3 billion, giving to environmental groups increased to $2.5 billion, and giving to international affairs rose to $2.6 billion.
Giving to the arts rose from $7.9 billion in 1990 to $8.8 billion in 1991, in part because some donors hurried to take advantage of a preferential tax treatment that had been expected to expire last Dec. 31. That tax provision, allowing donors to deduct the appreciated value of the artwork instead of just their purchase price, was extended for six months, and Congress is considering a further extension.
Contributions for health organizations dropped to $9.7 billion last year from $9.9 billion in 1990. Giving to nonprofit groups providing human services dropped to $10.6 billion from $11.8 billion.

HEADLINE: Watts Organizer Feels Weight of Riots, and History

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 23

 BODY:
Terry Watkins was recently driving through Watts, past the low-income housing with the gardens, the senior center, the homeless shelter, all of them built by the community organization her father, Ted Watkins, founded 27 years ago. Here were glimpses of hope in a place that has never recovered from the first riot in 1965.
Then, as she turned onto Central Avenue, the skyline of downtown Los Angeles emerged through the smog. All those glass and steel skyscrapers full of bankers, lawyers and foreign investors were just eight miles north, while here, outside Ms. Watkins's car window, groups of young men were standing around on another weekday afternoon. 
 "Less than 30 years ago the tallest building you could see was City Hall, which is 27 stories," she said. "Now look at it. They built the whole downtown. And what does Watts have? A shopping center and a few houses. These men aren't here because of the riots. They're unemployed."
That view embodies all of the frustration of Ms. Watkins and her father over the contrast between what was promised for their community after the 1965 riot and what has been done. "Everyone kept saying, 'Watts will never happen again,' " said Ms. Watkins, who is 45 years old.
But it did, this spring in South-Central Los Angeles, which includes Watts. Among the hundreds of burned-out buildings this time were the headquarters of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee, which Mr. Watkins founded shortly before the first riot.
While his daughter, who works as her father's assistant, was giving a tour to a visitor, Mr. Watkins was in his makeshift office in what used to be the store where his organization sold modestly priced furniture to the community. All the furniture was gone, carried off by looters.
 
A Lot of Talk
 These is a lot of talk these days about rebuilding the South-Central neighborhood. President Bush, Gov. Bill Clinton and Ross Perot have been there, along with contingents of business executives and movie stars. The Ford Foundation even sent Mr. Watkins's group $2 million to rebuild.
Mr. Watkins, who is 68, has toughed out a double-bypass heart operation, the amputation of his leg because of diabetes and the loss of both kidneys, and now this, his second riot. He says he finds it difficult to think about the task of rebuilding. He says he remembers what happened the last time.
"Nothing like the riot had ever happened before," he said. "There were a lot of guilt feelings on the part of the majority community. Finally, they admitted all these things were wrong. Everyone came to Watts -- Hubert Humphrey, McGovern, the Kennedys, Martin Luther King Jr., Stokely Carmichael. They were all going to rebuild L.A.
"There were going to be Model Cities and urban redevelopment. There were reports done by different commissions, the Kerner Commission, the McCabe Commission, and recommendations for change. There were all these new opportunities."
For a while, Watts was alive with possibility. There was plenty of money, much of it from the Federal Government, for all kinds of employment, social and cultural programs. Mr. Watkins' organization alone put 1,000 youths to work every summer, clearing weeds, painting benches and planting more than 30,000 trees.
Another group, Job Power, taught painting and janitorial skills. Green Power produced Watts Walloper baseball bats. Operation Bootstrap made black dolls. The Watts Movie Theater opened, with first-run movies and 25 cents admission.
"Then all of a sudden it started flattening out," Mr. Watkins said. "They'd send a letter: 'This contract is ending.' Time had run out."
Some of the experiments in Watts had not worked, or were poorly managed. But many programs had transformed people's lives. Tommy Beard was 14 and living in Nickerson Gardens, one of Watts' most notorious housing projects, when he started working summers for Mr. Watkins.
"I wanted my own things," said Mr. Beard, who is 41 now. "The only way I knew to get it was to earn it. All the kids around here knew they could go every summer to W.L.C.A.C. and get a job."
Mr. Beard, who is rearing three children in Watts, still works for the Watts Labor Community Action Committee, as a cook in the adult day-care center. But the organization has had to cut its payroll from 3,000 at its peak to fewer than 300. And life in Watts, Mr. Watkins and his daughter say, is worse than before.
"This riot was much deeper, and more dangerous," Mr. Watkins said. "More ethnic groups were involved."
Ted Watkins had arrived in Watts alone at age 13 from Vicksburg, Miss., to escape a lynching threat. "I was walking on the sidewalk when a white Western Union messenger came along and told me to move," he said. Blacks "weren't supposed to be on the sidewalk. I hit him."
In Watts, he went from washing cars to a job as a body and fender man at the Ford Motor Company, where as an officer with the union he developed the organizing skills he would later put to use in his community. He has spent most of his adult life taking on politicians, developers, drug dealers and anyone else who got in the way of his crusade for a better Watts.
And so when 200 rioters swarmed into his headquarters, he held his ground, a man in the electric cart that serves as his wheelchair, physically frail, but with a powerful voice. Finally his son made him go home.
"I was shouting at them, 'This is a black organization, we're from the community,' " he recalled. "It didn't make any difference. A lot of them only spoke Spanish anyway. They weren't listening to anybody."
 
Lost History
 Now, in his cart, he was surrounded by 30,000 square feet of ashes and emptiness. Here, in addition to the headquarters, had been the food stamp office and what the looters had been after: a large supply of furniture, VCR's and refrigerators that had been available for sale at a fair price.
Everything had been taken, or burned up, including the historical record of one man's devotion to his community. The first cup, inscribed "Made In Watts, 1966," produced in the youth center kiln. The plaque from the residents of Benedict Canyon thanking the children of Watts for helping them dig out of the mud after the floods of 1968. The hundreds of letters from Watts residents who had found jobs or housing or a hot meal because of Ted Watkins. The photographs of Mr. Watkins shaking hands with Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Cesar Chavez, receiving the Medal for Entrepeneurial Excellence from Yale, being honored at the White House.
Last week Mr. Watkins received the Ford Foundation's check. Even so, he said, there are times when what is before him seems overwhelming.
"There is so much tension in the air," he said. "And so much work to do."
And, returning to his office, he got back to it.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Ted Watkins, who lost a leg to diabetes, also has suffered through two riots in Los Angeles. He spoke outside the ruins of his office of his fear of history repeating itself. After 1965, "They were all going to rebuild L.A.," he said. "Then all of a sudden it started flattening out." (Bart Bartholomew for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Manhattan Is in a Battle To Keep Unicef's Offices

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
An intense behind-the-scenes struggle that pits New York City against New Rochelle, Queens against Brooklyn, and private developers against public officials is being waged over who will house Unicef by 1995.
At the moment, the leading choices for the United Nations Children's Fund seem to have narrowed to the International Design Center New York, in Long Island City, Queens; the Renaissance Plaza office and hotel project in downtown Brooklyn; and two new proposals, one in Long Island City and one in downtown New Rochelle. 
 A decision may be made by Unicef's executive board as early as Friday.
 
A Plum Ready for Picking
 The United Nations agency, with its worldwide renown and 950 employees, would be a prize for any landlord at any time. But with New York fighting to retain its international stature (it happens to be competing with Germany for three other United Nations agencies now based in Manhattan), and with landlords battling ferociously for tenants, the stakes are even higher.
"Clearly, the city is committed to keeping the U.N. and all of its constituent agencies here," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. "It's essential not only because of the jobs and the direct impact on the economy, but because it's one of the factors that establishes New York as a premier international city."
Unicef's headquarters currently are in leased space at Unicef House on East 44th Street, between First and Second Avenues. It also rents office space in two buildings nearby, as well as in buildings in Long Island City and Secaucus, N.J.
 
A View to Expansion
 The agency, which is expanding, hopes to consolidate its operations in one or two buildings by 1995. Possible strategies range from keeping most of its space in Unicef House to moving most of its operations elsewhere and perhaps owning the space it occupies.
Since it invited proposals last September, Unicef has received 34 detailed responses, said Timothy E. Boakes, the agency's director of administrative management. These have now been winnowed to four, he said, and new proposals have come in from Queens and Westchester County.
Although Mr. Boakes would not identify the four, they are understood in the real-estate industry to be the following.
*The International Design Center. It was originally built for the furnishing industry but now has a variety of tenants. The complex has proposed housing Unicef in 318,000 square feet of office space in the Center One building, on Thomson Avenue between 30th Place and 31st Street, and in 115,000 square feet of warehouse space in Center Three, the former Executone Building, between 29th and 30th Streets.
*Renaissance Plaza. The Muss Development Company of Forest Hills, Queens, which has proposed putting Unicef in the plaza on a block bounded by Jay, Willoughby, Adams and Johnson Streets. There would be a 23-story office tower atop a seven-story base, including a 384-room Hilton Hotel.
*A new building in Long Island City. The Rockrose Development Corporation of Manhattan wants to put Unicef in offices it would erect on a parking lot it owns at 43d Avenue and Crescent Street. A company vice president declined to be more specific.
*Land in New Rochelle. The city government has proposed a 20-story, 575,000-square-foot building on what is now a two-acre municipally owned parking lot on Huguenot Avenue, at the foot of Le Count Place. This would be developed by the Starrett Housing Corporation-HRH Construction Corporation, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates and financed by 30-year bonds issued by New Rochelle.
 
Accessibility Stressed
 Officials representing all four sites stress that their properties are close to mass transportation, easily reached from New York airports and surrounded by ethnically diverse populations.
New Rochelle's commissioner of development, Joseph G. Madonna, said an entire United Nations district could be developed in the vicinity of what would be the new Unicef headquarters.

HEADLINE: Rabin Incentives: Spurred Talks, U.S. Guarantees

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Wednesday, June 24

 BODY:
If the Israeli Labor Party leader, Yitzhak Rabin, keeps his campaign pledges, a government under his stewardship would step up the pace of Arab-Israeli peace talks, curb settlement activity in the occupied territories and push for agreement on Palestinian autonomy in the disputed areas within several months.
Such policies would be a pronounced departure from the path taken by the departing Likud Government and could significantly improve Israel's soured relations with the United States.
 
Relations With U.S.
 Specifically, they could help Israel obtain $10 billion in badly needed American loan guarantees to resettle a flood of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The loan guarantees have been denied because of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's refusal to freeze settlement activity. 
 Throughout the election campaign, Mr. Rabin has promised to stop the construction of "political settlements" not vital for Israel's security, and invest instead in the ailing economy to create more jobs. Labor's party platform goes further, and calls for a one-year moratorium on construction of new settlements while peace talks are under way.
Though Mr. Rabin has not specifically defined "political settlements," he is known to oppose settlement in heavily populated areas of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Labor has supported settlement in areas like the Jordan Valley and the environs of Jerusalem.
Mr. Rabin has promised to conclude an agreement on interim autonomy arrangements in the occupied territories within six to nine months, as a first step to a peace settlement.
He says such a settlement can be reached through "territorial compromise," an exchange of land for peace, though he rules out a return to Israel's borders before the 1967 war or establishment of a Palestinian state in areas returned to Arab control.
Mr. Rabin also accepts the principle of territorial compromise in negotiations with Syria on the future of the Golan Heights, though he insists that Israel must maintain a presence there.
While suggesting a more flexible negotiating position toward the Palestinians and the Arab countries, Mr. Rabin has maintained a firm stance on questions of internal security. As Defense Minister, he pursued tough policies against the Palestinian uprising, and he has promised similar measures, including sealing off the occupied territories if necessary, to prevent Arab attacks inside Israel.
The flexibility of a Rabin-led government depends on its composition, and on the distribution of cabinet portfolios in a future coalition.
Mr. Rabin, a former general, is a hawkish leader of a party list peppered with doves. He served notice in confident remarks early this morning that he alone would determine the assignment of ministerial posts. And he insisted that he would work to form a centrist government, despite his party's alliance with Meretz, a coalition of liberal and leftist parties.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Clinton Asks Foes for Economic Plans

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton boasted yesterday that he had come up with the most sweeping economic blueprint for the country ever offered by a Presidential candidate and challenged President Bush and Ross Perot to match it.
At the same time, he promised that if elected President, his first 100 days in office would be governmentally "explosive," with Congress and Federal agencies under intense pressure to get the country's economic and social programs moving again. 
 "We have to make choices, and I've made choices," the Arkansas Governor and presumed Democratic nominee said yesterday morning in New York on the ABC News program "Good Morning America" as he promoted and defended his new proposals.
"We've got a President of the United States who's been President for four years and who has no program on any of this," he said. "We've got a guy who wants to be President who has no program. At least I've given you an indication of what I'll do. This is the most detailed program ever developed by anybody running for President. I'm telling you more about what I'm going to do than anybody else who's ever run."
 
Praise From Democrats
 Neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Perot, who is expected to become a Presidential candidate soon, has yet to put a major economic proposal before voters or commented substantively on Mr. Clinton's plan. But some Bush Administration officials have asserted that the Clinton plan marks the Governor, an ideological centrist, as "another tax-and-spend liberal Democrat."
By contrast, a number of Democrats have praised the plan, including several dozen mayors now attending the annual meeting of the United States Mayors Conference in Houston.
Mr. Clinton badly needs such endorsements because the latest polls, including one by The New York Times and CBS News, show he is still running behind the President and Mr. Perot and slipping even further back in "favorability" ratings. Equally bad, the latest campaign finance figures show he is out of money and almost $4 million in debt.
Yet Mr. Clinton has seemed notably upbeat in recent weeks, and yesterday he said that things were going well, including fund-raising. He credited an intense round of national television appearances -- ABC kept him on the air for two hours -- and the release over the weekend of his new economic plan.
"It's all clearly tied to the strategy of directly communicating with the voters," he said yesterday afternoon in Washington at an appearance with Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, one of the leading blacks in Congress. "It takes a long time to get known in this country, and I feel that I really started almost all over again two weeks ago. So I couldn't be more pleased with the last two weeks. The consensus around the country is that it's moving. I just need to keep hammering this plan, saying we've got to change things. I think we're going to win this race."
In his ABC television appearance and later in a series of interviews, Mr. Clinton said that if elected President he would present his economic plan to Congress immediately after taking office and demand quick action.
"I intend to have a legislative program ready on the desk of Congress on the day after I'm inaugurated," he added. "I intend to have an explosive 100-day action period."
He said later that he was confident he could get early action from Congress because the 1992 election would produce a Congress well aware of the electorate's deep frustration with inaction.
"The ones who get elected, or survive, are going to be elected on a promise to do something," he said. "They won't get elected unless they are committed to make and take new action."
Mr. Clinton acknowledged that major economic proposals he had touted earlier in the year were noticeably absent from his new economic plan or had been greatly modified. For example, a proposal made before the primaries to cut taxes on the middle class by 10 percent has been revised downward to about 5 percent.
He conceded such changes left him open to criticism, but he said that economic factors like deficit estimates and interest rates had changed and that he had changed accordingly.
The economy did not grow as fast as had been anticipated, he said, and so he cut back on the tax break for the middle class in order to save enough money to start up new programs to improve the nation's deteriorating highways, schools and communication systems. The improvements, he argued, would constitute "investments" that would get the country moving again economically and would correct neglect by the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
The new plan also calls for major new taxes on the wealthy and foreign corporations and cuts in a wide array of Federal programs that Mr. Clinton deems wasteful or unneeded.
"I said all along I was going to put out a plan early and would learn in the primary season and would revise as I went along," he said in a brief plane-side news conference at La Guardia Airport before flying to Washington for an overnight stop.

HEADLINE: Libyans' Patience With Qaddafi Ebbs

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya, June 21

 BODY:
The large yellow ship that makes the overnight trip to Malta leaves Tripoli harbor crammed full of passengers, watched by couples and groups of young men strolling along the wide corniche that hugs the city's Mediterranean coastline. Behind them, strings of green and white carnival lights blink in the gathering dusk, casting a soft glow over the white fronts of the city's buildings.
The scene is tranquil, but the daily departure is a reminder that the ferry is one of the few links this country has with the outside world, foreign flights having been suspended under United Nations sanctions imposed in April. Not only has Libya become an international outcast, its economy is in shambles, its Government is in disarray, and many of its people are seething with resentment at the erratic 23-year rule of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. 
 "He is finished," said one young man on the corniche. "Now we just wonder when and how he will go."
The imposition of United Nations sanctions came after Libya's refusal to turn over two security agents who are suspected of involvement in the deaths of 441 people in the bombings of a Pan American World Airways jet over Scotland in 1988 and a French plane over Niger in 1989. The sanctions have pushed many Libyans, usually cowed by the secret police, to call for Colonel Qaddafi's removal.
"Probably 90 percent of the Libyan people favor a turning over of the two suspects to the United States," one Libyan official said.
But the related issues of Libyan Government-sponsored terrorism and the sanctions are only part of a long list of complaints.
 
Questions in Parliament
 The discontent has even come to the surface in the country's Parliament, normally a rubber stamp for Colonel Qaddafi's policies. When one woman stood up during the current session to complain that her region of the country was "economically deprived," she was silenced by the Secretary General, who told her that "there are no deprived areas in the great people's republic." She did not appear at the next day's session.
"Colonel Qaddafi is cornered," said one European Ambassador. "If he fulfills the United Nations sanctions, he can combat the growing discontent among the populace. But if he extradites the two suspects, the security apparatus, the very pillar of his rule, will turn on him."
Because of the sanctions, 1,700 Russian military and technical advisers have left the country. Western diplomats contend that without the Russian specialists who ran it, the country's air defense system has been severely crippled by the withdrawal.
Colonel Qaddafi's costly political and economic projects, like the drive to produce an army of one million out of a population of four million people, have eaten up the billions of dollars in revenues from the 1.1 million barrels of oil produced in this country every day.
Despite the large number of failed gradiose projects, like the vast steel works at Misurata and an effort to build a $25 billion artificial river, many Libyans live without basic services like water and sewer systems. Hospitals lack equipment and qualified staff. Schools teach from the Green Book, the collection of the Colonel's thoughts, but they have no desks or chalk. Postal and telephone services operate only sporadically.
 
Attendance Down at Protests
 Government orchestrated demonstrations, like one a few days ago in front of the Saudi Arabian Embassy, are able to draw only a few dozen people, most of whom stand passively in the baking sun while a few militants unleash tirades into a megaphone.
"All we talk about is how to get rid of Qaddafi," said a young man at the City Sports Club. "The best thing that could happen is that the United States bombed again, only this time managed to get him."
United States planes struck Libya in 1986 after Libya was implicated in the bombing of a German nightclub that killed two American servicemen.
Libya, because of the sanctions, has been stripped of 1,700 Russian military and technical military advisers. Western diplomats contend that the country's air defense system, manned by Russian specialists, has been severely crippled, if not rendered ineffective, by the withdrawal.
"He is in trouble," said one senior diplomat. "Maybe he won't go this year, but he does not have the hold on power he once had."

HEADLINE: Medical Waste Divides Mississippi Cities

BYLINE: By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PASCAGOULA, Miss.

 BODY:
Beyond the long sandy beaches of Mississippi's Gulf Coast, among the moss-draped oak trees of the region's eastern industrial edge, two old communities, predominantly white Pascagoula and mostly black Moss Point, have coexisted for years in relative peace.
But now an unusual fight is driving a wedge between the two, with one side accusing the other of "environmental racism." 
 Doctors and parents, churches and labor unions, Republicans and Democrats, blacks and whites, are all rallying against Pascagoula's decision late last year to allow the city's garbage incinerator to start burning medical wastes for profit. The wastes, up to 50 tons a day, would come from all over the region to Pascagoula's incinerator -- which is in Moss Point.
 
No Fuss When Built
 Pascagoula, population 25,678, and Moss Point, population 15,771, sit side by side in Jackson County. Pascagoula is the richer of the two, and when its residents objected to garbage-truck traffic, the city looked elsewhere for an incinerator site. There was no fuss in Moss Point when the incinerator was built by a now defunct French company that designed it. And when it opened in 1985, Moss Point was simply pleased to have its own garbage burned.
But seven years later, the incinerator is prompting concern about health risks that could be created by exhausting toxic wastes from the smokestack. Although the state is requiring that the incinerator be upgraded before it can start burning tons of medical wastes each day, opponents say that more than 12,000 people have signed petitions protesting the plan.
"I have no choice but to fight it," Mike Vice, a white Moss Point alderman, said at an opposition rally last month outside the Jackson County Courthouse. "I think the city of Pascagoula has forgotten this is a democracy."
 
'Environmental Racism'
 Deirdre S. Janney, executive director of the Mississippi Civil Liberties Union, told the rally, "It's a classic case of environmental racism."
In a telephone interview, Helen Hershkoff, the A.C.L.U.'s associate legal director, said, "We all know about the wrong side of the tracks. It's where we put our poor people and people of color. It's where we put our toxic wastes."
Ms. Hershkoff said the Moss Point case was "unique, because it is so stark in its presentation of the issue."
At the time the incinerator opened, financed by a low-interest, $6.9-million Federal loan to Pascagoula, the economics seemed sound. The heat generated by burning garbage is used to produce steam, which is sold to a nearby chemical plant at a rate that is tied to the price of natural gas.
Pascagoula planned to repay the loan with its profits. But soon after the plant opened, the price of natural gas collapsed and with it, the price of steam. Now the plant does not make enough money to pay even the interest.
"We've asked for forgiveness of the loan," said Melvin Mitchell, the Pascagoula City Attorney. "The U.S. Government would not agree, but they haven't foreclosed."
 
Secretive Action Claimed
 Many people here say Pascagoula intended to start burning the medical wastes before Moss Point could muster the forces to stop it.
"We were never officially notified about this," Mr. Vice said. "I don't know of another case where the rights of an entire city have been violated by the politicians of another."
Mr. Mitchell said there was nothing secretive about the decision to burn the wastes.
Mayor Tom Hewlett of Pascagoula says he is confident the burning of medical wastes will not be a health threat, adding, "We want that facility to be able to pay its debt service. It gives us some control of our destiny in being able to control our municipal wastes.
"We're at a point now where the costs of landfills are going to be exorbitant," Mayor Hewlett said. "And the nature of soils in this region limits the practicality of landfilling. The water table's real high; if you dig a hole someplace, it fills up with water.
Two lawsuits have been filed to block the burning of medical wastes, one by Jackson County Physicians and Citizens for a Healthy Environment, the other by the city of Moss Point. The Jackson County Board of Supervisors has agreed to join Moss Point's suit against the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.
The incinerator is near the Escatawpa River and within two-and-a-half miles of three public elementary schools, a junior high school, two church schools and several day-care centers. Nearby are homes with vegetable gardens and chicken coops.
The lower Escatawpa was a fishing hole for Moss Point until industrial pollution caused most of the fish to vanish long before the incinerator arrived. Thanks to clean-up measures that began in the early 1970's, the trout and bream are returning. But now, Mr. Vice said, "The mercury levels in the fish are beginning to climb because of the incinerator."
John Adams, a retired paper plant worker who lives near the incinerator, said he paid no attention to it "until it began to put out an awful odor and people began complaining about sinus problems." He did not protest when the incinerator was built nor when it began to smell, he said, but he is collecting signatures now to protest the plan to burn medical wastes.
Mr. Adams, who is white, sees the issue as a symbol of big business dumping on the powerless. "They pick out little towns like us that don't have any money to fight it," he said.
Despite the outcry, the Pascagoula City Council voted in December, 6-to-1 -- 6 whites against 1 black -- in favor of letting a Tennessee company, CFB Inc., which runs the incinerator, burn the medical wastes.
 
Hired a Chemist
 Moss Point tried to fight back, arranging for an expert to testify against the plan. But when the expert, Dr. Paul Connett, a chemistry professor at St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y., was unexpectedly unable to meet the March 17 deadline set by the State Department of Environmental Quality, the department denied an extension.
Dr. Connett spoke here anyway, a few days after the deadline, to 350 people who had gathered to hear him. He said that the widespread burning of medical wastes, which contain high amounts of plastics, was a national crisis.
He said that such burning released dioxins and similar compounds called furans, along with mercury and cadmium. The metals "emerge from the stack as gases, tiny particles that can penetrate deep down into the lungs," he said, adding that some of the particles would be captured in pollution-control devices, but that inevitably some would escape into the environment in waste water or fly ash.
Unpersuaded, Mr. Hewlett, the Pascagoula mayor, insisted that the incinerator posed no health threat and said that the city was going forward with its plans -- in Moss Point.

HEADLINE: Civilian Mission Is Proposed For Military After Cold War

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee today proposed using military engineers, medics and other specialists to help civilian agencies and private groups address problems of inner cities.
The chairman, Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, cited the Los Angeles riots when arguing that the routine training of specialized military units should be coordinated with specific needs of American cities. Combat engineers, for example, might rebuild bridges or schools as part of their instruction. Army National Guard instructors might assist job-training programs for inner-city youths. 
 Under the plan, the military's primary mission would remain national security. But in recognition of its growing role in relief and other nonmilitary missions as the cold war wanes, the Pentagon would change its training programs to provide or supplement assistance where private or Government services are lacking.
"By using the capabilities we have in the military, we can assist civilian authorities in addressing the critical fundamentals upon which a healthy society and economy are built," Mr. Nunn said in a speech on the Senate floor, in which he outlined his plan and solicited comments and criticisms.
 
Pentagon Declines Comment
 Lieut. Col. Doug Hart, a Defense Department spokesman, said the Pentagon would not comment until it had reviewed Mr. Nunn's proposal. Colonel Hart said the military, including the National Guard Bureau, already performs many civic services, but only those that other agencies or private groups cannot perform.
Other senior Defense Department officials said the Pentagon is unlikely to support broadening its responsibilities to include social services.
With the demise of the Soviet Union, Congress and Pentagon planners are mapping out new missions for the shrinking American armed forces. In recent years, for example, the Pentagon has become increasingly involved in fighting drug trafficking and providing humanitarian relief to refugees.
In his speech, and in an interview afterward, Mr. Nunn said that his program would be operated at the discretion of the Defense Department. He said the aim of the plan would be for individual military bases around the country to share their particular talents with the surrounding community.
 
Serving Communities' Needs
 "In each community, the military, private sector, labor unions and other agencies would decide where the voids were and where military training requirements might meet local needs," Mr. Nunn said in the interview.
Senate Republicans expressed interest in the plan, but like Pentagon officials, they wanted to examine its details.
"In a peacetime situation, it's fully appropriate that these forces be used to enhance human and physical resources," said Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana.
Private groups expressed keen interest in the proposal. The Rockefeller Foundation in New York City, for example, has financed two research grants for a military-based domestic youth training corps, a proposal included in Mr. Nunn's plan.
 
Skeptical Voices
 But some military and social policy analysts questioned whether the armed forces should assume a role perhaps better left to local, state or Federal agencies.
"You have to be careful and decide whether you want the military to be the last resort for humanitarian aid or a social-services agency," said Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, an independent research organization here.
Mr. Nunn said he did not expect the plan to increase Pentagon spending.
Senate officials said the proposal might be deliberated as early as late July, when the Senate is to consider the military's $281 billion budget bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Finances;
Trailing in Polls, Clinton Campaign Falls Deeper in Debt

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
Trailing both Ross Perot and President Bush in public opinion polls, Gov. Bill Clinton reported today that his campaign fell deeper into debt last month and that it now owed an Arkansas bank almost $4 million.
The disclosure was another sign of how deeply Mr. Perot's independent candidacy has cut into Mr. Clinton's quest for the Presidency. 
 The latest figures, in a filing with the Federal Election Commission, show that at the end of last month the Clinton campaign had assumed an additional $1.2 million in debt and that it had cash on hand of $161,853.28, enough to buy about 10 minutes of prime-time television.
Mr. Clinton's money raisers say Mr. Perot's surge in opinion polls combined with the weak economy have discouraged donations. The primary campaign also took a heavy toll on Mr. Clinton's finances.
Even though the Arkansas Governor went into the June 2 California primary significantly ahead of his rivals in the delegate count and had all but locked up the nomination, he had to spend almost $1 million in California, most of it in May. The New York primary in April, his second most expensive race, cost $979,484.
And even though it was becoming clearer in May that he would be the party's nominee, Mr. Clinton raised $52,000 less in private contributions than in April.
In contrast, Mr. Bush's treasury grew by more than $1 million in May to nearly $8.2 million, and it is debt free.
Mr. Perot has said that he will spend $100 million or more from his personal multi-billion-dollar fortune and that he will take no taxpayer money to pay for his all-but-declared candidacy. Through May, Mr. Perot's campaign had spent almost $3.8 million, much of it donated or in the form of loans from Mr. Perot himself, according to a disclosure statement made public today.
Trailing in money-raising at this point in the election season is far from fatal, but it is a barometer of a campaign's condition. Four years ago this month, the campaign of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, with $3.6 million, held nearly twice as much money going into the conventions as Mr. Bush's campaign did that year.
After the national party conventions in July and August, the campaigns of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush will each receive $55.2 million from the Government for the general election campaign, and their parties will get $10.3 million each that can be spent for the conventions and the general election.
The loans for the Clinton campaign were taken from the Worthen National Bank of Little Rock, Ark. It is primarily owned by the Stephens family, an influential group that has helped Mr. Clinton raise money in his campaigns for Governor and has also contributed substantially to the Republicans.

HEADLINE: In Trial, M.I.T. to Defend Trading Student-Aid Data

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
It was the first week of April 1988, and officials from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the eight institutions of the Ivy League had gathered in Wellesley, Mass., for their annual rite of spring. They were deciding how much financial aid to offer about 3,000 students who had been accepted by more than one of their institutions.
A student accepted by both Cornell University and M.I.T. posed a fairly typical problem. Based on financial aid forms, Cornell figured that the student's family could afford to pay $12,249 of the roughly $20,000 annual tuition, room and board. M.I.T., where a year cost about the same, estimated the same student's family contribution at $13,550. 
 After a discussion that lasted no more than two minutes, the two financial aid officers got down to business. They split the difference. Cornell raised the student's family contribution to $13,000; M.I.T. matched it.
The same type of horse-trading went on for many of the 3,000 students on the universities' lists, just as it has every spring since the late 1950's. But was massaging the numbers illegal price-setting, or a way of stretching financial aid to as many students as possible?
That is the heart of an extraordinary trial about to start in Philadelphia tomorrow. M.I.T., and by extension the Ivy League, is accused of conspiring to violate antitrust laws, impeding competition and thereby denying students all the financial aid they might otherwise receive.
 
Vow to Fight Government
 The suit has already provided an intriguing glimpse into the inner workings of some of America's most honored institutions. While maintaining their innocence, the eight members of the Ivy League signed a consent decree last May in which they promised to discontinue the spring meetings and stop sharing information.
But M.I.T. called the Government's bluff. Institute officials refused to sign the decree, vowing that if M.I.T. had done nothing illegal, it had no reason to change its practices. Institute officials have argued that the suit by the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department will actually harm needy students, not help them.
While not a stated policy of M.I.T., a court victory could allow the university and the others to resume the spring meetings.
Many educators have praised M.I.T.'s tough stance, which they see as standing up to a kind of Government persecution. "I admire M.I.T. so much for fighting back," said David Riesman, a sociology professor at Harvard University and a respected authority on higher education. "They're defending an area where these institutions truly were doing something wonderful."
But preparing for the trial has already cost the institute almost $1 million, and the Government has shown no signs of backing down.
 
Confederation Challenged
 The Government's case involves the actions of the so-called Overlap Group, a loose confederation comprising the Ivy League members plus M.I.T. In contending that the Overlap Group unfairly restrained trade, the Government focused on the group's most sensitive practices:
*Agreeing to base financial aid awards on need, not on high grades or academic potential.
*Adopting uniform principles for determining financial need.
*Meeting regularly to discuss the financial situations of individual students.
M.I.T. acknowledges that these arrangements continued until 1990, when the Justice Department was in the middle of its investigation. But university officials say that the Government is applying antitrust laws blindly. The universities did not fix prices somehow to enhance their revenues, M.I.T. administrators argue; rather, they cooperated in the charitable act of providing financial aid.
"The effect of the overlap meetings was not to raise price, as is typically associated with price fixing," said Dennis W. Carlton, a University of Chicago economist, in an analysis he completed for M.I.T. and submitted to the court, "but rather to transfer dollars primarily from students with higher-income parents who would otherwise receive non-need-based aid to other students."
The reason for having the Overlap Group, M.I.T. court documents say, is to insure fairness in distributing financial aid. By awarding aid only to students who need it, the universities can spread their money further than if they gave merit scholarships based on academic performance.
Distributing financial aid uniformly also makes it possible for students to select the institution that best suits them over the one that offers the most money, university officials say.
Last year, 57 percent of M.I.T. students received financial aid. Twenty percent received merit-based scholarships from local civic groups, employers and others, according to institute officials. Only 20 percent of undergraduates paid full tuition.
M.I.T. argues that the Government's case is flawed because it allows the Ivies to continue to provide need-based athletic scholarships. Furthermore, the universities say, without the Overlap constraints they would eventually be forced into bidding wars to attract especially gifted students.
"We have no desire to get into bidding wars for 'stars,' " the former president of M.I.T., Paul E. Gray, is quoted as saying in the Government's trial papers.
Government lawyers point out that the Overlap universities are a Northeastern exception. Most universities do not restrict financial aid to need or share financial information.
Government lawyers also reject M.I.T.'s argument that antitrust laws do not apply to universities because they are nonprofit organizations. They said the Supreme Court has rejected numerous "social policy" justifications for price fixing in areas like bridge repair contracts or the costs of providing dental care. "M.I.T.'s defense that price fixing is necessary to achieve a social policy goal must also be rejected," the lawyers said in a court brief.
The trial, before Judge Louis C. Bechtle in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, is expected to last two weeks.


GRAPHIC: For about 30 years until 1990, nine universities, using a system called "overlap," determined the amount of money tat students and their parents would pay for a college education. These students, recently close to 3,000 each year, had been accepted by two or more of the universities using the overlap system and had requested financial aid form those institutions. The universities involved were the eight Ivy League colleges and universities -- Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, the University of Pennsylvania - and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is a simplified explanation of how the overlap system worked.
Chart: "What Happened Behind Closed Doors"
 1. A student, Jan Doe, applies to and is accepted by Cornell and M.I.T. With her application, she submits a request for financial aid. Financial aid applications are usually a combination of standard forms and the university's own.
 2. Each university puts the financial aid forms in a package that includes, among other things, data on Jane's assets, her parents' assets, notes from Jane's interviews with admissions officials or alumni, and sometimes Federal income tax returns. Her application to the colleges is kept separate.
 3. Each university then determines the portion of tuition that families and students must pay. Cornell, using the information it has gathered, deciees that Jane and her family will be responsible for $12,249 per year. M.I.T., using its data, decides on $13,550.
 4. Rosters are compiled by Student Aid Services, a for-profit corporation owned by the administrators of overlap colleges and universities. The rosters list the students who have been accepted by two or more of the overlap universities -- in Jane's case. Cornell and M.I.T. -- along with their financial aid packages.
 5. Financial aid officers from the nine universities meet in the spring for a two- to three-day session.
 6. The financial aid officers from all the universities to which a particular student's family contribution. The representatives either decide that their differences are negligible, negotiate a compromise or agree to disagree. Jane Doe is among the students discussed by officers from Cornell and M.I.T. The estimates of Jane Doe's family contribution differ by $1,301, enough to trigger a brief round of negotiations about how much financial aid she will be offered.
 7. After a two-to-three minute conversation, the two financial aid officers decide to split the difference and agree that Jane and her family will contribute $13,000 per year. The rest of the tuition at each university will be financed by some combination of grants and loans.

HEADLINE: BUSH CALLS ON FED FOR ANOTHER DROP IN INTEREST

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
Showing election-year eagerness to speed up economic growth, President Bush urged the Federal Reserve today to lower interest rates further, saying the central bank was wrong to worry that such a reduction would fuel inflation.
"I'd like to see another lowering of interest rates," the President said in an interview with The New York Times. "I think there's room to do that. I can understand people worrying about inflation. But I don't think that's the big problem now." 
 His call for the Federal Reserve to lower rates was by far his strongest jawboning statement this year on interest rates and shows the President's frustration over the slow recovery of the nation from its longest postwar recession.
 
Differing Views on Inflation
 The President's new pressure on the central bank comes after the Federal Reserve's governors signaled in recent weeks that they believed no further easing was needed because the economy was picking up steam. In recent interviews, several of the governors said they worried that the potential inflation danger from further rate cuts outweighed the need for added stimulus.
But in his remarks today, the President disagreed with their economic calculus. "I think inflation appears to be pretty well under control," he said. "I don't think the argument that lowering the rates will stimulate the long-term -- shoot the long-term rates up -- is valid anymore. And so, yes, I'd like to see it come down."
The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, would not respond to Mr. Bush's comments.
But in recent interviews, Federal Reserve officials said they feared that further cuts in short-term rates could push up long-term rates because investors might conclude that the Federal Reserve was not going to be tough in cracking down on inflation.
Various Federal Reserve officials have contended that reducing long-term rates is crucial for strengthening economic growth because home mortgages, home building and capital investment are largely influenced by long-term rates.
Administration officials have been encouraged by several economic reports, including the increase in industrial production and housing starts in May. But they were disappointed by the jump in the unemployment rate to 7.5 percent in May, even though they asserted that it resulted principally from more people returning to the labor force because they were encouraged by improved conditions.
In recent months, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, have spoken more gingerly than the President did today, often suggesting in speeches that the Federal Reserve should lower rates if the recovery falters.
President Bush's remarks did not have such hedging. While noting that he wanted "to be a little careful about Fed bashing," he said, "I don't know of any President that would like to advocate higher interest rates, and certainly I'm not one." He added that he would like to "see them as low as they can possibly be."
 
Frustration Over Perceptions
 The President also expressed frustration that most Americans believed the economy was still declining even though he said statistics showed that it was growing. His approval ratings have dropped sharply since the Persian Gulf war, largely because, White House officials acknowledge, the recovery from a prolonged recession has been so slow and weak.
A New York Times/CBS News Poll of 1,029 registered voters nationwide, conducted June 17 to June 20, found that 78 percent disapproved of the way the President was handling the economy.
The President's argument that inflation is so low that the Federal Reserve can reduce rates received some indirect support from Congressional testimony last week by Mr. Greenspan.
The Federal Reserve chairman said, "The U.S. economy has made considerable progress toward price stability over the past decade, trimming the core rate of inflation to below 4 percent, and it appears poised to make further advances."
But, seeking to nudge long-term rates lower, Mr. Greenspan vowed to remain vigilant, adding that the Federal Reserve "fully intends to guard against reigniting inflation."
The Federal Reserve last lowered rates on April 9, reducing the Federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend money to each other overnight -- to 3.75 percent from 4 percent. That put short-term interest rates at their lowest level in two decades. At the time, Federal Reserve officials said they worried that the weak growth in the money supply could slow, and perhaps even reverse, the recovery.
The central bank cut rates more aggressively on Dec. 20, lowering the Federal funds rate to 4 percent from 4.5 percent, and reducing the discount rate -- the rate at which the Federal Reserve lends money to banks -- by a full percentage point, to 3.5 percent from 4.5 percent. At that time, the central bankers were worried that the recovery had stalled and they faced private pressures from the Administration to ease monetary policy.
 
A Crucial Committee
 Federal Reserve officials say that at the May 19 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee -- the main policy-setting group -- the central bankers decided to adopt a neutral policy, favoring neither easing nor tightening. Before that meeting, the committee had adopted a policy in favor of easing.
Many economists say they doubt that the central bank will ease rates in the near future, partly because it might appear that policy makers were bowing to political pressures.
Some economists say that because several Federal Reserve governors remain concerned about continued slow growth in the money supply, there remains a chance that the Open Market Committee might decide to ease further at its meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Bush Administration has frequently looked to the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy as a means of stimulating growth because the huge budget deficit has limited the Administration's ability to use traditional pump-priming measures like tax cuts or increased spending.
More than 100 prominent economists, including 6 Nobel Prize winners, have urged the White House and Congress to speed growth by spending $50 billion more a year in public investment projects, like building roads. But Administration officials have said such a plan could worsen the deficit and spur inflation.

HEADLINE: Yields Lower On C.D.'s and Bank Funds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit moved lower for the week that ended today, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.
Analysts at the interest rate publication note that the steady erosion of bank yields indicate that there has been no substantial start to economic recovery. 
 "Without loan demands there is no need for banks to go out to drum up fresh deposits to replace cash that would ordinarily have been lent out," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor. "If the economy were to pick up, you'd see loans rise and bank deposit yields not far behind."
At Monday's closely watched auction of new three- and six-month Treasury bills, where many interest rate watchers view the results as a good barometer of what many banks could be paying their depositors in the weeks ahead, the average discount rates inched up after a four-week downward trend.
The average rate on a three-month bill was 3.66 percent, up a basis point from the previous auction, while the six-month bill was up 2 basis points, to 3.77 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Over all, returns at New York area banks were off slightly again, with a money market account down 2 basis points, to 3.36 percent; a three-month certificate of deposit off a basis point, to 3.49 percent, and a six-month certificate off 3 basis points, to 3.64 percent.
Commercial banks, which are part of the New York area average, were a little less aggressive this week than their savings-bank competitors. Commercial banks lowered the average money market account by 2 basis points, to 3.14 percent, and the average yield of three- and six-month C.D.'s was down a basis point, to 3.34 percent and 3.43 percent, respectively.
The higher-paying savings banks cut their money market accounts by a basis point, to 3.59 percent and their three-month certificate by 2 basis points, to 3.64 percent. Most of the deep cuts were in the six-month certificate, which dropped 4 basis points, to 3.86 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, June 24, 1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yield are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Narrowly Mixed

BYLINE: BY KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds were narrowly mixed and interest rates little changed yesterday as dealers placed bids at a record $15 billion auction of new two-year notes.
Prices of securities outstanding fell slightly in trading before the 1 P.M. auction, and the dip proved sufficient to stimulate good demand for the new notes.
The securities were sold at an average yield of 5.11 percent, down a touch from the 5.13 percent average yield at the last two-year note auction on May 20. 
 It is the lowest yield on a two-year note since the Jan. 22 auction, when the notes were sold at an average yield of 4.99 percent.
"The two-year was given an excellent reception, which shows there is still some buying power in the market as the second quarter comes to a close," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.
 
Banks Active Bidders
 Mr. Sullivan and others said commercial banks were active bidders, continuing a trend that began more than a year ago.
"There is a lot of interest in short-term securities," one government-bond trader said. "The fact that noncompetitive tenders totaled $1.3 billion at the auction shows that."
Dealers were only a tad less optimistic about the prospects for today's sale of $10.5 billion of new five-year notes.
"The five-year is a little bit harder," the trader said, "but there is so much interest in that sector that it should go well."
Late yesterday the five-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.47 percent, compared with 6.45 percent late Monday.
Aside from the auction, trading activity was influenced by comments from Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo of Argentina, who suggested to reporters in New York that his country, as part of its debt-restructuring agreement, might be more inclined to buy 30-year zero-coupon bonds directly from the Treasury than in the open market.
Those remarks pushed down prices of long-term Treasury issues slightly.
 
Rebound in Sales
 So too did a survey of chain-store sales by Johnson Redbook showing that sales for the first three weeks of June were up by 2 percent from May, a sharp turnaround from the 4.5 percent decline reported for the first two weeks of the month.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 10125/32, down 3/32, to yield 7.84 percent, compared with 7.83 percent late Monday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10129/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 7.22 percent. And the 5 7/8 percent three-year notes were offered at 1012/32 up 1/32, to yield 5.47 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose modestly.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.66 percent, up one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 3.76 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Louisiana Land and Exploration Company offered $100 million of unsecured 10-year notes through an underwriting group led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The 8 1/4 percent notes were priced at $100, or par, a percentage point over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The noncallable securities are rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
United Illuminating Issue
 Morgan Stanley also acted as lead manager for an offering of $100 million worth of five-and-a-half-year notes for United Illuminating, a utility based in New Haven.
The noncallable 7 3/8 percent securities mature Jan. 15, 1998, and were priced at $99.511 to yield 7.483 percent, a percentage point over the prevailing when-issued yield on the new five-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The notes are rated Baa-3 by Moody's and BBB- by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, participants said that prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged in slow trading.

HEADLINE: Nordstrom in No-Frills Arena

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
In the department store world, the Nordstrom name is synonymous with service. During a rainstorm, a shopper may duck into a store in search of waterproof boots only to leave with new heel taps on the shoes on her feet, too, at no charge.
Now, Nordstrom Inc. is about to try its hand at a completely different retail game -- what the industry calls the off-price business. Off-price stores sell brand-name merchandise at discounts of as much as 75 percent, as opposed to discount stores like Wal-Mart that for the most part sell high volumes of less expensive merchandise. 
 Stepping into the no-frills arena might seem an odd choice for a retailer that has refused to put merchandise on sale regularly. But as department store sales stagnate, the Seattle-based retailer has had to look elsewhere to continue the rapid pace of expansion it set in the 80's. And its entry into the off-price business is further indication that the budget-conscious consumer has come of age.
 
Price Becomes the Key
 "Less is the populist thing to do," said Paul Hunter, a Nordstrom vice president who conceived of the Nordstrom Rack, the company's chain of highly lucrative closeout stores that are the source of the new off-price concept. "The whole off-price business is expanding exponentially, driven by the consumer that has become sensitive to budgets and cost-consciousness and will probably stay that way."
Indeed, sales of apparel in off-price stores grew at a compounded annual rate of 15 percent from 1986 through 1990, compared with 6 percent for total retail sales and total general- merchandise sales, according to a report by Alex. Brown & Sons, a Baltimore-based investment company. Robert Buchanan, a retail analyst at Alex. Brown, estimates that about 5 percent of the $200 billion Americans spend on apparel each year goes to off-price stores.
 
Service Is Expensive
 Also motivating Nordstrom's new venture is the high price of delivering the kind of intensive service it built its reputation on, particularly as retailing sales have leveled off and profits have dwindled.
"Like everyone else, we're faced with the fact that the cost of doing business is growing faster than sales," said John A. Goesling, the earnest and solemn chief financial officer whose plainspokenness epitomizes the culture of Nordstrom's upper echelons. "But unlike everyone else, if we cut any more, we might cut into what we are and do irreparable damage to our service culture."
Jim Nordstrom, co-chairman of the family-run business, elaborated on that idea in an interview at company headquarters: "The more high-end the merchandise, the more it takes to sell it, so you have to have salespeople to drive those sales. That means higher operating costs, which is something we can't afford right now but also something we can't sacrifice in our existing business."
 
A Surprise Announcement
 The announcement of Nordstrom's new strategy came casually. Mr. Nordstrom jolted the retail community -- and most of his siblings, in-laws and offspring who populate various rungs of the corporate ladder -- when, in an off-the-cuff remark at the company's recent annual meeting, he said Nordstrom planned to open two stores a la Loehmann's and Filene's Basement sometime this year. Still, Mr. Nordstrom says that it is just an experiment and that the press has made too much of it.
The two off-price stores, which will probably not have an overt link to the Nordstrom name, will show up later this year in areas far enough away from Nordstrom's existing stores to avoid cannibalizing their business. They will carry some of the same brand-name merchandise as the regular Nordstrom stores, though the goods will be there later in the season. The discounts will be 20 to 70 percent off the regular Nordstrom price. And the staff, Mr. Nordstrom says, will cater less to customers than in the regular stores.
Nordstrom's clearance merchandise will continue to go to the Racks closeout stores; the new stores will offer goods bought expressly for them.
Nordstrom has been one of the few retailers making a concerted effort to maintain its prices, refusing to mark down clothes to increase volume, and at times it has paid the price. Refusing to hold sales, it eventually had to ship unsold goods to its closeout stores, which cut its profit margins. Through the Racks and the new off-price format, Nordstrom hopes to have it both ways.
"This is a hedge that can be a good thing for them," said Cynthia Cohen Turk of Marketplace 2000, a retail consulting firm in Coral Gables, Fla. "They're figuring that, net-net, they probably won't do badly in both price segments at the same time."
Ms. Turk said the off-price stores would also increase the company's influence with suppliers, who will get bigger orders, and will aid Nordstrom's own cost efficiency in shipping. Nordstrom will also be able to buy more opportunistically, taking manufacturers' overruns and canceled or returned orders that would not normally find a home in its stores.
Nordstrom's is not the first chain to try this strategy. In 1987, Bealls, a Florida department store chain selling moderately priced goods, opened off-price stores selling brand-name goods at an average price of $8.
Even as the Bealls department-store business has lost momentum because shopping center builders lack financing for development, the company's 65 outlet stores have been selling $75 million of goods annually and making a handsome profit, said Robert M. Beall, the company's president.
"Your investment and your risk is a lot lower, because with a five-year lease at a good rate in a strip center, if you don't do well, you can just pick up and leave at very little cost," he said.
 
Sticking to What They Know
 In 1984, Bealls tried a chain of outlet stores that sold higher-priced goods but scrapped the plan after it decided it did not really know how to sell more expensive merchandise. It took the idea in a different direction.
"I think the off-price business may be headed for a little bit of a shakeout," Mr. Beall said. "But given the economy and a whole feeling by people that they just don't want to pay retail prices, I think it's still a good idea."
While off-price operations will help Nordstrom cut costs, Mr. Buchanan of Alex. Brown said the company already had a fairly lean expense structure, spending about 25 percent of its total sales to pay salaries and other administrative expenses.
"Given the way their stores look and the service level they provide, they're very productive for the high end," he said. "They can't shave too much more off their regular business, so off-price doesn't seem like a bad idea."
 
Target of Lawsuits
 Nordstrom, some charge, has used a compensation plan that has allowed it to keeps expenses low. The company has been named in two class-action lawsuits in recent years, charging that its managers encouraged employees to work extra hours without pay to meet sales goals and provide customers with the vaunted service. The lawsuits are pending. Litigation analysts say the suits are unlikely to affect the bottom line, but Nordstrom has established a $15 million reserve for wage claims to redress the problems. By the end of 1991, it had paid about $3 million to employees making claims.
The company sees an additional benefit to its nascent off-price business. Its expansion in regional shopping malls across the country has been impeded by the difficulties developers are having in getting financing. And Nordstrom's proposals to open stores are facing increasing opposition from its competitors, who are filing lawsuits and environmental complaints that delay the company's expansion plans, said David Mackie, vice president for real estate.
The May Department Stores Company, for example, has opposed Nordstrom's plans to rebuild its store in the Washington Square mall in Portland, Ore., saying the project would cause parking and other traffic problems. Woodward & Lothrop filed a complaint when Nordstrom said it would open a store in Annapolis, Md.
"Most of these delaying tactics are simply that, but walking away becomes a possibility when you consider the time and legal costs," Mr. Mackie said. "We don't like it because it lessens our already constrained opportunities."
Some analysts contend that real estate issues are simply a smokescreen that Nordstrom is using while it slows expansion to reassess and refine its strategy. In 1988, Nordstrom was a regional chain with 53 stores in the West. Since then, while other retailers were closing stores or halting growth, Nordstrom has added 15 stores, a 28.3 percent increase.
 
Basis for Expansion
 Having stores outside the Western region has helped mitigate the harm from the economic downturn in California, where about half of Nordstrom's stores are. "People have criticized us for expanding in a down economy and for our decentralized operations, but it means that when we make a mistake in one region or when the economy is worse in one part of the country, it doesn't hurt us quite as much," Mr. Nordstrom said.
The company will open a Nordstrom in the Mall of America outside Minneapolis later this summer, and another store in Freehold, N.J., in August. It has plans for opening a few others in the next year.
Mr. Nordstrom acknowledged that the company had dragged its feet on technology but he said most computer systems designed for retailers worked to centralize inventory and accounting functions -- antithetical to Nordstrom's decentralized culture.
At Nordstrom, each region or cluster of stores makes its own buying and planning decisions, a strategy that analysts generally praise. Other retailers, including the Dillard Department Stores Company and Federated Department Stores Inc., have used technology to consolidate buying and planning, which sharply cuts expenses but eliminates some individuality as well.
Nordstrom is testing a system it designed in one of its divisions, and Galen Jefferson, one of the company's four co-presidents, said she was seeing benefits like improved inventory management and sales analysis.
"The key reason for doing it is that it has enhanced customer service," she said. "Others invested in technology to save costs; we've invested in it to support our salespeople and increase their ability to serve the customer, not to replace them."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed on Quiet Day; Gold Is Higher Worldwide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday in light, uneventful dealings on world currency markets.
Gold prices advanced worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $344.50 a troy ounce, up 80 cents from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold added 90 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $344.10. 
 Traders began selling the dollar sporadically in foreign markets overnight. When activity shifted to domestic markets, many were inclined to take profits in the wake of the dollar's advance in the previous session.
Sentiment toward the United States currency has been bearish recently as traders turn their attention toward Europe. Speculation about the ultimate success of European political and economic union has dominated trading.
 
No Fundamental Reason
 The dollar gained ground in a rare across-the-board showing on Monday, but not for any fundamental reason.
"People are just waiting for more impetus to trade," said Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Boston.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 126.96 yen, down 0.51 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 127.10 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 127.28 yen, up from 127.15 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8620, up from $1.8615 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.8625 to buy one pound, more expensive than Monday's $1.8615.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.5660 German marks, down from 1.5665; 1.4175 Swiss francs, up from 1.4155; 5.2710 French francs, down from 5.2750; 1,184.00 Italian lire, down from 1,184.50, and 1.1968 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1946.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.5650 German marks, down from 1.5665; 1.4150 Swiss francs, up from 1.4050; 5.2710 French francs, down from 5.2725; 1.7635 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7645; 1,184.00 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.1965 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1945.
Gold traded in London at $344.35 an ounce, up from $342.40 bid late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to $343.80 an ounce from $342.10. In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.41 an ounce to close at $343.68.

HEADLINE: Pass the Spelt. A Little Ketchup With Your Algae?

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
PEOPLE who eat strange foods like blue-green algae and spelt bread may seem like eccentrics who have nothing to do with ordinary Americans who toss burgers on the grill at night.
But avant-garde eaters often serve as a testing ground for innovative foods, and what they like to eat now may be the trendy new food on the kitchen tables of mainstream eaters tomorrow. After all, foods that now appeal to millions of people, like yogurt, granola bars and rice cakes, were once favored by fringe eaters and available only in natural-foods stores. 
 It is hard to say which unusual products will be the next foods to find their way into ordinary supermarkets. But suppliers and retailers say certain foods are selling so well that they may eventually have wide enough appeal to interest the big food companies.
The impulse driving sales in natural-foods stores is an enduring one: the desire for health and long life. But unlike 20 years ago, there now are vast numbers of people of diverse economic means who are simultaneously discovering that mortality is not an abstract concept.
"There's a wave of baby boomers hitting the big 40, and their bodies are talking back," said John Goodman, the vice president for sales and marketing for Arrowhead Mills in Hereford, Tex., which makes organic grains, cereals, breads, flours and baking mixes. They are looking for foods that might help them live better and longer, he added, and they are looking outside the mainstream.
To that end, sales are booming in foods that are fat free, or free of ingredients like milk and wheat that cause allergic reactions in many people. Organic ingredients are sought after, too, because many people consider them to be tastier, healthier and more ecological. Selling very well, too, are Chinese herbal and homeopathic remedies, said Frank J. Lampe, the editor of Natural Foods Merchandiser, a trade journal published by New Hope Communications in Boulder, Colo.
But customers in natural-foods stores are also affected by the same forces that shape supermarket shoppers. Busy and not always willing to cook, they are seeking convenience, but with a twist: they are snapping up prepared products, both frozen and on the shelf, made of organic and natural ingredients, even if they are slightly more expensive than their mainstream counterparts.
Manufacturers of natural foods, previously unsophisticated in the art of marketing, are now much more attuned to convenience and packaging. "They are starting to think like big companies," said Kathy Ordan, the director of marketing for the Fresh Fields natural-foods stores in the Washington, D.C., area. Even cooking accessories are being made in natural but convenient forms. Fresh Fields, for instance, is selling charcoal made from wood in an instant, easy-to-light form with none of the chemicals found in the usual instant-light charcoal.
Despite a concern with health, many people are not willing to give up snacks. "Chips and popcorn and permutations thereof have gone bonkers," said Chris Kilham, a consultant to natural-foods companies. "It's like walking down the snack aisle of a regular supermarket, but all the ingredients are good." Aside from organic blue-corn tortilla chips and organic air-popped popcorn, there are yogurt and green-onion potato chips made from unpeeled potatoes, and cheese puffs made from natural blue cheese and cheddar. Also flourishing are popcorn cakes, a new product similar to rice cakes.
Cookies are also doing well, especially those by Health Valley, an Irwindale, Calif., company that makes a variety of natural foods. It has 19 varieties of cookies described as fat free, including flavors like raisin oatmeal and apple cinnamon. (Although they are labeled as fat free, that is accurate only for each serving, not for an entire package. One serving, or three cookies, contains less than 1 gram of fat.)
Retailers said the quest to avoid foods that may cause allergic reactions is one of the largest factors affecting sales. "More and more people who haven't felt good in a long time are finding that their doctors are telling them to give up wheat or milk," said Cate Conniff, the food-information manager for the six Bread and Circus natural-foods stores in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
Shoppers can find pizza made with soy instead of mozzarella, ice cream made with rice instead of cream and bread and cereals made with grains other than wheat.
Two of the most rapidly growing alternatives to wheat are spelt and triticum polonicum, popularly known as Kamut. Both are ancient grains in the wheat family with a slightly different chemical structure that makes them easier to digest for wheat-sensitive people. Arrowhead Mills introduced Kamut cereal six months ago and expects annual sales this year to be more than 360,000 boxes, a lot for a new organic cereal.
Rudi's, a bakery in Boulder, came out with a spelt bread last October, and it is now the company's leading national line. The company, which has increased production from 1,000 loaves of spelt bread a month to 10,000 loaves, recently started making bagels and hot-dog and hamburger buns with spelt.
There has also been a profusion of wheat-free pastas and grain mixes, with choices now available in rice and spelt, as well as other ancient grains like quinoa and amaranth. To some extent, they appeal to those who simply seek variety.
Although the allergy connection has fueled the surge in nondairy alternative products, there is also a broader health goal: the reduction of fat and cholesterol. In most cases, the ingredient that substitutes for dairy products is soy. "Soy-milk sales were up 40 percent last year," said Richard Youngman, the president of Stow Mills, a distributor in Chesterfield, N.H., that sells to more than 2,000 stores in the East. Also booming are soy products like burgers, hot dogs, chili, sloppy Joes and cold cuts.
But some of the big-selling nondairy alternatives are made with rice, like Rice Dream frozen desserts and beverages.
These products also appeal to a growing number of people interested in vegetarian dishes, especially those who want to send their children to school with lunches that do not contain meat but also do not saddle them with the label of peculiar food.
"Kids are ostracized if they pull out something that is obviously tofu," said Ms. Conniff, of Bread and Circus.
In new natural-foods stores, the allocation of space makes it clear which areas are growing: there is much more space for frozen foods, where shoppers can now find healthy versions of typical American foods. "Prepared dinners do very well," said Spencer Brown, who manages Integral Yoga, a natural-foods store in Manhattan that once carried almost no convenience foods. Selling especially well, many retailers said, are organic potpies and lasagna made by Amy's; Indian dinners made by Taj; pizzas without cheese, like Original Rice Crust Pizza and Pizsoy, and Veggie Pockets, enchiladalike sandwiches.
Also popular are convenient foods sold on shelves, like cereals, organic canned tomatoes and juice blends, especially those with rain-forest ingredients -- juices from fruits that are grown in Central and South American rain forests, like guanabana, guava and star fruit.
Retailers are also expanding bulk-bin space for customers more concerned about price. "Economics has got something to do with it," said Mary Harvat, the director of purchasing for Texas Health Distributors, which sells primarily to the Whole Foods Markets chain. Bulk sales provide savings by eliminating packaging and advertising.
But what about that blue-green algae? Some products in natural-foods stores are still considered fringe items, even if they are selling better than a few years ago. One such category, green food, includes algae that supposedly provide energy and strengthen immune systems.
"Five years ago, I only carried one green food," said Richard Antonelli, the sales manager for Cornucopia Inc., a wholesaler in Dayville, Conn. Now he sells tens of thousands of dollars worth of green foods; his newest offering is Klamath Blue Green Algae, harvested by Klamath Blue Green in Mount Shasta, Calif., from a lake in southern Oregon.
But algae is still a very specialized food. Environmentalists need not worry yet that avid algae-eaters will upset the ecological balance.
 
AVANT-GARDE GROCERIES
 THESE are some of the foods gaining popularity in natural-foods stores.
AMARANTH: An ancient high-protein grain with a woodsy flavor that was popular with the Aztecs and is used in a number of cereals and breads.
GREEN FOOD: A category that includes supplements made from various grasses and algae. The manufacturers say they are high in beta-carotene and improve mental and physical functioning.
KAMUT: This is the name given by Bob Quinn to an ancient wheatlike grain. His family's company, Montana Flour and Grains in Big Sandy, Mont., is the main grower and promoter of Kamut. Mr. Quinn picked the name because he believed it was the ancient Egyptian word for wheat -- but later found out that it was not. Kamut has more protein than regular wheat.
QUINOA: An ancient Incan grain with complete protein, quinoa has a slightly nutty flavor.
RAIN-FOREST INGREDIENTS: Fruits that are grown in Central and South American rain forests, like guanabana, guava and star fruit, are especially popular now in juice blends.
SPELT: An ancient grain in the wheat family, it can be tolerated by many people who are sensitive to the more common strain of wheat.

HEADLINE: Chamber Society Seeks Lost Listeners

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
There is one point on which everyone connected with the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center agrees: the 23-year-old organization, once one of the New York music world's biggest success stories, is in the market for a miracle. In the three years since the retirement of the society's charismatic founding director, Charles Wadsworth, ticket sales have dropped by at least 30 percent.
The drop has been ascribed variously to changes in the society's roster made by Fred Sherry, Mr. Wadsworth's successor, and to Mr. Sherry's aggressive programming of contemporary music. Although the performances earned generally enthusiastic reviews, the audience did not return, and after Mr. Sherry's first season, the society cut back on the number of concerts it gave. Last year, Mr. Sherry announced that he would stay on as a cellist with the society but that he would not continue as director when his three-year term ended. 
 At the society's spacious new offices in the Samuel B. and David Rose Building at Lincoln Center, the hope is that Mr. Sherry's newly appointed successor, the clarinetist David Shifrin, will lure back former subscribers and attract new listeners. But the consensus in musical circles is that he is facing a formidable challenge, and that in addition to hostilities that may remain from Mr. Sherry's tenure, the society must now face the consequences of its own success.
 
Innovations and Competition
 "They represent an important new kind of organizational and artistic structure within the chamber-music world," said Dean Stein, the executive director of Chamber Music America, a service organization for small ensembles. "They showed that there was an alternative to the traditional kind of chamber group, which is a permanent touring ensemble with fixed instrumentation. And they became a model that many organizations around the country have replicated."
But the replication also occurred on the Chamber Music Society's doorstep. Merkin Concert Hall, which opened at the end of 1979, quickly became a home for new chamber groups. Chamber music flourished at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Frick Collection, and the 92d Street Y started its own series, directed by Jaime Laredo, who was once a violinist in the Chamber Music Society.
Lincoln Center itself has been competing with its resident society by presenting touring chamber-music groups in its Great Performers series, and Carnegie Hall has added chamber music to its programming. And this year the French Institute/ Alliance Francaise started a chamber-music series at its four-year-old Florence Gould Hall.
The society's own success may have spawned a level of competition that has outpaced the appetite of the chamber-music market, particularly in a recession. But the problem of maintaining an audience has not been universal.
"In terms of subscription renewal and ticket sales, the chamber-music audience is the most loyal audience we have, and we don't seem to have seen the effects of either the recession or the crowded field," said Raymond T. Grant, the director of the Tisch Center for the Arts at the 92d Street Y.
Mr. Shifrin's term does not officially begin until July 1, but he has already started grappling with the audience problem he has inherited. In programming the 1992-93 season, his first response to the dwindling subscription figures has been to soften the society's repertory. With a budget of about $2 million at his disposal, he has outlined a season heavily weighted with repertory staples and light on new music.
"What I would like to do with the Chamber Music Society is present a survey of the great literature, representative of all periods and all instrumental combinations," Mr. Shifrin said. "There are certain works -- the Mozart string quintets, the Brahms quintets and sextets, the Mendelssohn Piano Trios and the Beethoven Septet, for example -- that should be looked at over the course of five years, and then repeated."
Music of the 20th century has not been exiled entirely. But except for a few premieres, the season's 20th-century offerings are drawn from the list of modern works that have found their way into the standard repertory.
"I'm doing somewhat less contemporary music than Fred did," Mr. Shifrin said. "I would like to leave a certain area of new music to groups like Speculum Musicae, Music Today, the New York New Music Ensemble and the others that specialize in it. That's not to say that we won't commission new works or play new music. But I don't feel the Chamber Music Society needs to be a proving ground."
New music and premieres have always been an important component of the society's programming, and Mr. Sherry did not present a great deal more of it than Mr. Wadsworth had. The difference was in presentation and, to a degree, in style. Mr. Sherry was more attracted than Mr. Wadsworth to atonal and Serial music, and where Mr. Wadsworth tended to include new works in mostly standard programs, Mr. Sherry often grouped contemporary works. Mr. Shifrin's approach to new music seems more conservative than that of both his predecessors.
Mr. Shifrin, who is 42 years old, joined the society in 1989. He grew up in New York City and has been principal clarinetist with several orchestras, including the Cleveland Orchestra and the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. Since 1980 he has been director of Chamber Music Northwest, a summer festival in Portland, Ore., which he says he patterned after the Chamber Music Society. Mr. Shifrin won his new job when the Chamber Music Society board scanned the first 10 seasons of his Portland programming and decided that they were safely in the mainstream.
Whether accessible programming alone will help him overcome the problems of recent seasons is a question on which few in the music business are willing to comment. Both managers and musicians refuse to speak critically of the society on the record, for fear of losing high-profile engagements with the group. But some point out that there may still be resentment about Mr. Sherry's decision to replace some of the society's original members with younger musicians. On this topic, Mr. Wadsworth leaped to his successor's defense.
"There was a serious misperception about what happened," Mr. Wadsworth said. "Some of the changes Fred made were changes I had considered myself. I told some of the players that I was unhappy. But I felt a strong personal obligation to some of the musicians who had been there the first 20 years, and I chose to let them round out the time. That was probably my mistake, which Fred paid for."
Charles Kargacos, the society's executive director, said he hoped that subscribers who left to protest the roster changes would return now that Mr. Shifrin is taking over.
"Certainly Fred was a recipient of a great deal of ill will, fairly or unfairly," Mr. Kargacos said, "but David comes without any of the taint of that time."
Mr. Kargacos added that in the few weeks the society's glitzy new brochures have been available, subscriptions have been selling more briskly than at this time a year ago, and he is projecting a 10 percent increase in sales. Ticket income has risen as well, although that is partly because prices have been raised. This year, a 12-concert series cost $180; next season, it will cost $215. A four-concert series is going from $80 to $95.
But even the increase of 10 percent Mr. Karcagos projects will not return the society to the sold-out status it enjoyed during Mr. Wadsworth's tenure. And some critics have wondered whether the society's problems may be a sign that it has outlived its original purpose.
When Mr. Wadsworth started the society in 1969, the chamber-music literature -- with the exception of the string quartet repertory -- was a poorly traveled byway in American concert life. By convening a flexible ensemble, augmented by starry guest musicians, Mr. Wadsworth helped push the music into the mainstream, an effort often credited with precipitating the chamber-music boom of the early 1980's.
That boom has taken on a life of its own, however, and with so many ensembles, both permanent and temporary, exploring the mixed-timbre repertory, the Chamber Music Society sometimes seems to need a new sense of mission.
Mr. Shifrin, for one, said he does not see it that way. "I think all the imitation and replication bears out this organization's usefulness," he said. "We're in the position of being in the biggest arts center in the country, and being the organization chartered by that center to play the chamber-music repertory. We have the distinction of being the primary resident of Alice Tully Hall, which I have always considered one of the best places to play chamber music. And we have the resources to go after the finest performers and put on the best performances of the best music. I feel like a kid in a candy shop."

A New Bakery in Town
If the turquoise trim on the brick storefront at 672 Ninth Avenue (46th Street) that houses Amy's Bread is not arresting enough, the sumptuous display of breads in the window should do the trick. This new wholesale-and-retail bakery specializes in unusual, attractively shaped breads, many seasoned with olive oil, herbs, raisins, bits of olive, copious sprinklings of nuts and rich whole grains.
The owner, Amy Scherber, who is 32 years old and largely self taught, baked bread at Mondrian Restaurant until recently. Most of the breads, a well-crafted assortment of around two dozen, are sourdough, and many are made with a starter that Ms. Scherber said has been kept going by various bakers for around 100 years. 
 Her offerings include a swirled semolina bread stippled with black sesame seeds ($3.25) and another semolina bread studded with golden raisins and perfumed with fennel ($3.25). Among the other stars are chewy triangles thick with nubbly toasted walnuts ($1.65); a flattened round baked with olive oil, raisins and rosemary ($1.25); various kinds of focaccia ($1 to $4) and an oval of earthy whole wheat bolstered with toasted pecans, wheat berries, fruits and golden raisins ($4.50).
 
The World of Queens<HE<
In terms of culinary diversity, Queens probably tops all the other boroughs. And on Saturday and Sunday from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M., as part of the Queens Festival in Flushing Meadows Park, visitors will be able to sample the foods of 20 countries. The stands selling food will be clustered around the Fountain of the Planets. Admission is free.
 
Tropical Produce
 J. R. Brooks & Son, a produce company in Homestead, Fla., has published a handy guide to the tropical fruits and vegetables it grows. The foldout pamphlet describes 20 products, and explains their storage and use. It has color photographs and a nutritional chart.
Copies are available free from J. R. Brooks & Son, P.O. Drawer 9, Homestead, Fla. 33090.
 
Local Talent on L.I.
 Local Talent, a caterer in Cutchogue, L.I., has opened a retail shop on Route 25 (Main Road) in nearby Aquebogue. The roster of prepared dishes changes daily, but invariably includes tasty grain, bean and lentil salads ($6 a pound), chunky chicken salads, often seasoned with curry ($10 a pound) and excellent quiches in combinations like leek and bacon ($3.25 each).
The shop prepares rotisserie ducks and chickens, and gives customers one bird free with a purchase of eight. Local Talent's sumptuous brownies are also available at the shop, as are coffees, cheeses, assorted packaged foods and some cooking utensils.
 
Culinary Careers
 Careers Through Culinary Arts, a program that provides culinary training to students in New York City's public high schools, is only about two years old. But this month it granted scholarships totaling $77,000 to help 11 graduating seniors continue their education in the food field at schools like Johnson & Wales University, the French Culinary Institute and New York City Technical College. More than a dozen summer internships at restaurants and supermarkets were also awarded.
Richard Grausman, a cooking teacher and cookbook author, who started the program, works with home economics teachers in the New York City school system to prepare them to teach more advanced professional skills to their students. He has also obtained donations of equipment and ingredients for the schools from many companies and is organizing similar programs in other cities.
 
Coffee Gear
 Bodum, a Danish manufacturer of coffee-making equipment, has opened its first retail shop in America, at 673 Madison Avenue (61st Street). Besides glass coffeemakers that operate on a plunger system and sell for $19.95 and up, the shop carries cups, coffee carafes and, starting at $59.95, the handsome Osiris kettle designed to boil water very efficiently. The shop also sells Starbuck coffees from Seattle for $6.90 to $13.95 a pound.
 
A Chef Is Remembered

On Sunday at 5 P.M., the Ballroom, at 253 West 28th Street, is holding a party to unveil its second mural by Marion Pinto. The first one, depicting SoHo notables of the 70's, is in the front room of the restaurant. The new work honors the Ballroom's former chef, Felipe Rojas-Lombardi, who died last year. The party, with tapas and wine, will benefit the Felipe Rojas-Lombardi Scholarship Fund, which will give grants to people of Hispanic origin for culinary study, starting in 1994. Tickets, $55 each, can be reserved by calling (212) 675-4984.
 
FOOD NEWS FROM JAPAN
 AMONG the specialized culinary newsletters is Gochiso-sama!, a quarterly published in English in Japan, and filled with short but serious articles about Japanese food.
A recent issue discussed the history of ramen noodles, with recipes, and recommended ramen restaurants in Japan. The newsletter also provides information about regional Japanese ingredients, food tips, cookbook reviews and comments from readers.
Annual subscriptions are $20 (or 2,500 yen) and are available by writing to Gochiso-sama!, Yagoto Fujimigaoka 13-2, Tenpaku-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya 466, Japan. Payment by traveler's check is requested.

HEADLINE: Recycling Makes More Sense for New York Than Incineration

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"New York, Amid Doubts, Broadens Recycling Plan" (news article, May 27) fails to mention the high cost and risks of incineration and misleads the reader about the Mayor's plan to construct as many as seven giant incinerators.
For fiscal years 1993-96, the plan envisions at least $520 million for expanding three barely operational Queens and Brooklyn incinerators and constructing the Staten Island ashport and ashfill, to hold the toxic residue of the incinerators. Compare the $24 million budgeted citywide in fiscal year 1992 for waste prevention, reduction, composting and recycling. 
 The $520 million does not include the public health cost of incineration, such as increases in special education for children suffering from birth defects, brain damage and cancer, or lost wages and productivity because of increased suffering from asthma and respiratory diseases. The city's own environmental impact statement expresses concern about mercury contamination, which could taint fish and mothers' milk.
Who are your unnamed "most committed supporters" who question if we can make recycling work? The city's data show an astounding rate of cooperation, considering the failure of city leaders to embrace the issue, the paltry funds allocated for education and the poorly implemented program. Who are these unidentified "recycling proponents" who worry if recycling "makes economic sense in this densely packed financially hobbled and ethnically diverse world of towering apartments houses"?
A study by Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman says maximal recycling will save the city as much as $3.9 billion over 20 years. Jobs and businesses will be created by committing ourselves to composting and recycling, instead of incineration. Contrary to your assertion, such communities as the Hasidic and Hispanic communities of Williamsburg, and economically diverse Riverdale and South Bronx, are working together.
Incineration is a nonsolution to the solid-waste problem, benefiting companies that own nonrecyclable resources, incinerator companies, their consultants and investment bankers. With incineration, the proposed ashfill on Staten Island will be exhausted in eight years.

HEADLINE: Part of Rwanda's Problem Begins in U.S.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"In Rwanda, Births Increase and Problems Do, Too" (front page, May 31) relies on the flawed logic of population-control ideology and fails to examine the real problems facing Rwandans and others in the developing world. The high birth rate in Rwanda is not the cause but rather a symptom of poor living conditions.
Although you quote a World Bank report stating that "educated women have smaller families, and their children tend to be healthier and better educated," you present a decreased birth rate as a solution in itself to Rwanda's problems. Decades of coercive family planning programs, which offer women birth control and sterilization, but do not provide comprehensive health care or address their wider needs, have shown this strategy is doomed to failure.
We should address the real issues. It is estimated that 200,000 women worldwide die of illegal or unsafe abortions each year, yet our Government refuses aid to facilities in the developing world that offer abortions or abortion counseling. Birth control methods considered unsafe in this country, such as Depo-Provera injections, given at clinics in Rwanda, are widely used on third world women (and low-income women at home) without their knowing the risks.
The unequal distribution of wealth between industrialized and developing nations, and within developing nations themselves, perpetuates the poverty, illiteracy and powerlessness that lead women to have more children than they are able to feed.
The United States, with 5 percent of the world's people, accounts for one-third of the world's use of nonrenewable resources, making our per capita consumption of energy several hundred times that of the average Rwandan. Is it not hypocritical and racist to complain about the effects of "overpopulation" on the environment and do nothing to curb our overconsumption?

HEADLINE: That's Entertainment?

BYLINE: By Leonard Garment; Leonard Garment was White House counsel under President Richard Nixon.

DATELINE: ZUG, Switzerland

 BODY:
The telephone call found me in a small, neat hotel room in a small, neat Swiss town. Had I seen Vice President Dan Quayle's latest speech on values? Fax me a copy, I said, and walked to the lake, where swans and ducks paddled peacefully and bourgeois families strolled, to smoke a cigar and drink a beer.
Switzerland is as smooth and creamy as its chocolate. There is little unemployment, and the land lives mostly in homogeneous middle class harmony. Clocks, trains and civic virtues run on time. The people are friendly, hard-working and God-fearing. But these attractions soon pale, for the Swiss lack the intellectual and cultural debates and the class, racial and religious diversities that make a country absorbing. An American wit described Switzerland as "Scarsdale with mountains." 
 Back at the hotel was the Quayle speech, with its assertion that there are "two cultures" in America, "the cultural elite and the rest of us," and its argument that "we Americans" should speak out against the other side in the great culture wars. Not long afterward, I discovered that the main shortcoming in the speech was not its disapproval of Hollywood's morals: The problem was that the disapproval did not go deep enough.
While flying home, I saw Oliver Stone's film "J.F.K." Virtually everyone, according to Mr. Stone, was in on the plot to murder John F. Kennedy and usurp the Government. The C.I.A. was in on it. Lyndon B. Johnson was in on it. Not content with killing a President, the same guys murdered Robert F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
When "J.F.K." came out, plenty of people in the professional political community looked askance at it. But in Mr. Stone's artistic world hardly anyone laughed or criticized. Few seemed to think his reputation should suffer a penalty for the film's paranoid, pernicious lunacy. It was no surprise Hollywood should have seen "J.F.K." as reasoned political discourse. We viewers are familiar with a staple theme: the President, C.I.A., military, police, businessmen, legislatures and electoral politics are all useless and corrupt.
The entertainment community's political activities are organized around the view that politics do not work properly and that performers must save the Republic through their power to command media attention.
My point is that we should worry not just about the TV and movie view of illegitimate children but about the entertainment community's view of American society and political life.
Many people believe that our political system can't do the things that need to be done. We read about how dirty politics is. Every act of official discretion is said to be a mask for favoritism, every assertion of confidentiality is presumed to be a cover-up, every connection an official may hold to people and organizations outside government is seen as a corrupt conflict of interest.
Thus has Ross Perot become a credible candidate. Here is a man whose positions are still largely undiscoverable, who proposes to smash the budget deficit by asking upper middle class people to give up hunks of Social Security benefits, who boasts of his ability to disregard the conventional electoral process by buying the Presidency (for the people, he assures us), who would replace a democratic legislature with pseudo-plebiscitarian town meetings, who wants to fight drugs through the constitutionally appalling tactic of cordoning off and searching neighborhoods, whose reversal on taxation makes George Bush's "no new taxes" gaffe look like a model of coherence, who threatens his opponents with compromising photographs, who has taken an unwholesome interest in the dress and appearance of his employees.
Mr. Perot is taken seriously only because so many trust so little in our politics. They do so in no small part because their news and entertainment are full of this message. The media have legitimized the idea that the way to break out of the political morass is through the use of -- what else? -- the media. It is no accident that Mr. Perot leans heavily on mass communication and mass rallies to bypass the messy democratic details of conventions and campaigning.
Instead of a man on horseback, we are watching the arrival of the man riding the TV call-in show. The scene should be far more disturbing than the sight of new mother Murphy Brown or the sound of Dan Quayle taking her to task.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Acts On Behalf Of Holders

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
In a far-reaching effort to make the nation's companies more accountable to shareholders, the Securities and Exchange Commission today proposed major changes in corporate rules, including a requirement that companies for the first time justify executive pay levels.
The executive compensation proposal consists essentially of requiring companies to convert what are now often large masses of text into a series of tables, graphs and notes providing greater detail. 
 In addition, companies would be required for the first time to present the specific factors on which the executives' pay is based and to describe how this package is related to company performance.
A new summary table is to show all forms of compensation, including stock options, paid the chief executive and the four top-paid officers over the preceding three years.
There would also be a graph showing shareholders' return on investment over a five-year period in comparison with a group of peer companies and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock market index.
The new series of measures, under development by the S.E.C. for three years, would also give large stockholders access to corporate proxy statements to express opinions about the performance of management and directors.
 
2 Proposals Left Out
 At the same time, the commission did not include two significant changes it had espoused. It decided that companies should not be required to hand over lists of their stockholders to insurgents or other shareholders and it decided that when shareholders send written material to other shareholders they must file copies with the S.E.C., although under a far-simpler procedure than under current law.
Still, today's proposals represent a significant expansion of shareholder rights and they brought praise from at least one group representing investors.
"These proposals respond to the shareholders' call for more useful information about executive compensation and to allow more free and open communication among shareholders," said Ralph V. Whitworth, president of the United Shareholders Association, a group founded by T. Boone Pickens, the oilman and corporate investor. "This marks the beginning of the end of the S.E.C.'s role as corporate America's thought-control police."
Before formally adopting these proposals, the commission will consider comments submitted during the next 60 days.
 
Proposals are Modified
 The proposals for enhanced communications modify similar, even more ambitious ones, put forward in June 1991. Those proposals were withdrawn because of strenuous opposition by various corporate groups, including the Business Roundtable, made up of top executives. The companies said they feared that the absence of any filing requirement would lead to collusion by cliques of large stockholders, a complaint addressed today by the rule calling for a copy of written material to be mailed to the S.E.C. within 10 days.
Although this procedure applies only in cases in which the shareholder seeks no proxy authority, such as votes to elect him or her to the board, it is seen as a vast improvement from prevailing rules.
Currently, if a shareholder communicates with 10 or more other holders about a coming meeting or other corporate matter, the shareholder must not only file a detailed disclosure about himself but he must also distribute it to all those who receive the communication. If it is transmitted by mass media, for instance, a newspaper advertisement, the proxy statement must be mailed to all other stockholders, perhaps millions of them.
Today's proposal would eliminate current filing requirements for purely oral communications not seeking proxy authority. Thus, shareholders who discuss a company's performance over the telephone will no longer have to worry that their conversation could be deemed a proxy solicitation.
Under the modified plan, companies would not be required to supply shareholder lists to dissidents or other shareholders. But companies would be required to mail solicitations on their behalf -- and to aim them, if desired, at specific groups, like large institutional holders.
In opening this morning's three-hour hearing on the two sets of initiatives, both of which were adopted by votes of 4 to 0, Richard C. Breeden, the S.E.C. chairman, said some people had come to regard the shareholders' role in corporate governance as "perfunctory," citing in particular the issue of executive pay.
"When a company whose stock has plunged in value 'resets' the management's stock options to lower the strike price, many shareholders ask, 'Who is the board representing?' " Mr. Breeden said. "That looks like the old game of 'heads I win, tails you lose' because the management profits if it is successful, but it also profits if it fails."
But senior officials at the Treasury Department have suggested in recent weeks that the commission might be going too far, particularly in looking at more complete disclosure and at more accurate accounting for grants to executives in the form of highly lucrative stock options.
In a speech on Monday before a group of bankers here, Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson complained of "aspiring meddlers in executive compensation" who "want to get their mitts on employee stock options."
Congress has taken considerable interest in compensation of late, seeking under a House bill extending unemployment benefits to curtail executive pay by denying corporate tax deductions for pay exceeding $1 million.
Today's proposal on proxies also called for the elimination of prior S.E.C. review of solicitation materials, a requirement for "unbundling" related stockholder proposals so each could be voted on separately and allowing someone seeking election to a board to run with a slate of management people so his supporters are not disenfranchised.
The measure that would introduce statements of management performance in proxy material resulted from a proposal by Edward V. Regan, Comptroller of New York State. This would allow statements by any person or group that has held half of 1 percent of a company's stock for at least three years.

Los Angeles Inundated by Sublet Space

BYLINE: By Morris Newman

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
AN unaccustomed abundance of space available for subleasing in the downtown office market here has led to vigorous activity, particularly among tenants seeking bargains in rent. Yet nobody seems to be making money except office brokers.
Of the eight million square feet of office space available for lease in downtown Los Angeles, 1.7 million square feet is sublease space, according to the Cushman Realty Corporation, a local real estate brokerage. In 1988, only about 680,000 square feet of sublease space was available in the same market. 
 The flood of sublease space is creating a hardship for landlords, who find themselves competing within their own buildings with tenants eager to let giant blocks of space they no longer need. And because sublease space is typically offered at a discount of 10 to 50 percent off market-rate rents, the availability of the cheaper space is depressing rents in an already troubled market.
"You can really name your price," said James N. Travers, president of the Travers Realty Corporation of Los Angeles. "People are in a position where they must accept." He added that subleases were going for $12 to $18 a square foot, compared with $17 to $28 for space leased directly from landlords.
The current flood of sublease space is a combined product of an overbuilt office market and a poor business climate. Many important tenants, particularly law and accounting firms, have failed to achieve the rapid growth they had expected in the 1980's and are now returning much of their space to the market. Law firms alone are offering 30 floors of space in the downtown area, according to Mr. Travers.
Recent deals in downtown Los Angeles include two floors that Northern Trust of Chicago sublet from I.B.M. at the Wells Fargo Center, where the computer giant has offered six floors for sublease. In the same building, Kemper Securities of Los Angeles has leased 1.25 floors from the law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue.
Besides a price advantage, subletting often offers tenants the advantage of "move in" space, which is already built and furnished. In some cases, tenants can also have the use of furniture, telephones and even computers, as well.
Moving into furnished space relieves tenants of paying construction costs, which are typically factored into rent. Move-in space also spares tenants the obligation of providing personal guarantees to landlords that tenants will make the rent payments. "In a weak credit market, such arrangements appeal to many small tenants," said Margaret Duskin, vice president of TRI Commercial Real Estate Services of San Francisco.
Subleasing has been a source of seemingly endless dispute between landlords and tenants, particularly regarding who has the right to profit from the sublease. When markets are strong and rents are rising, landlords often attempt to prevent tenants from offering their space to subtenants at a markup.
In March the California Supreme Court reversed, by a 7-to-0 vote, a ruling in Carma Development Inc. v. Marathon Development (California) Inc., that a landlord can terminate the lease of a tenant who attempts to sublease, when the right to do so is clearly stated in the lease contract.
Although the decision won wide attention among lawyers and legal scholars, the real estate community viewed the case as largely irrelevant, since the case dated back to the early 1980's, when rents in California were skyrocketing. That era seems a world away from the current doldrums, in which tenants are less concerned with realizing profits than with limiting losses.
In many cases, tenants with subtenants in place are still losing "millions of dollars," according to Steve Marcussen, a vice president of Cushman Realty. Tenants who originally rented for $30 a square foot, he said, "are happy to get $16 a square feet and lose only $14."
Since sublease space tends to be taken more quickly than landlord space, landlords might reasonably expect the supply to be absorbed soon, giving them a chance to regain control of the office market. Yet an uncertain economy continues to play havoc with an already out-of-balance market.
The merger of BankAmerica and the Security Pacific National Bank by itself is expected to leave an additional 1.4 million square feet on the market in the next two years, while Carter Hawley Hale, the parent company of several department-store chains, is expected to vacate 110,000 square feet at 444 South Flower Street in the near future.
Despite the spate of leasing deals and the low rents, some potential tenants for sublet space hold back because they see a catch in some of the deals. The disadvantage is that at the end of a short-term sublet, another move, with all its attendant disruptions and costs, may have to be made. The way around that problem is to seek a lease for the space from the landlord that would phase in at the end of the sublet term.

HEADLINE: Perot Under Fire: Sifting Facts and Motives

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
Only a short while ago Ross Perot had the sort of public image that would make any politician salivate: self-made billionaire, just-folks tycoon, scourge of the Ayatollah, straight-talking guy. But lately a more ominous portrait has emerged: J. Edgar Perot, a man obsessed by conspiracies and beset by enemies in his mind, willing to use tactics of espionage and intimidation to destroy those who stand in his way.
Mr. Perot, in an aggressive public relations campaign over the last few days, has denounced that characterization as false -- "fairyland," "animal crackers" and "Mickey Mouse tossed salad" were a few of his more colorful dismissals. And he says this effort to redefine, and malign, his character has been orchestrated by President Bush and his re-election committee. 
 It appears, so far, that both things are at least somewhat true. Mr. Perot does have a history of using investigators and threats against opponents. And officials of Mr. Bush's White House and re-election committee have not been shy about publicly discussing that history while, more privately, an "opposition research" team has been running the sort of aggressive investigation into Mr. Perot's past that Mr. Perot has conducted against others.
"It is correct that we have opposition research, not just on Perot but on Clinton, too" said the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Rich Bond. He acknowleged that the opposition research does produce information about Mr. Perot, and that this information is sometimes given to inquiring reporters. "There are a number of reporters who call us looking for facts, and if we have the facts, we provide them."
But he defended the research as legitimate politics, saying "Mr. Perot wants to put a legitimate inquiry into the guise of so-called dirty tricks, and nothing could be farther from the truth," he said.
 
Episodes Support Picture
 There appears to be no proof that the Bush operation has fabricated accusations that Mr. Perot has used investigators and threats from lawyers. It need not. There have been a number of episodes in Mr. Perot's life that support the picture of him that the Bush campaign is now happy to see displayed.
The most recent example of Mr. Perot's behind-the-scenes use of lawyers, investigators and reporters against those who have displeased him can be found in his now-revealed dealings with The Washington Post and its premiere investigative reporter, Bob Woodward. It is an episode that illuminates the close line Mr. Perot has walked in his efforts to embarrass Mr. Bush and the risks inherent in those ways.
Mr. Perot and reporters at the Washington Post now acknowledge that in 1988 Mr. Perot provided information in extended interviews and in two three-inch black vinyl binders to the newspaper while he knew it was preparing to write a series of articles about Mr. Bush.
The articles were prepared under the supervision of Mr. Woodward, who was not available for comment today.
 
Information on a Deal
 The information came largely from a Washington law firm that was paid $10,000 by Mr. Perot and his longtime aide, Tom Luce, to gather details about a highly profitable land deal engineered by the Pennzoil Company and its head, J. Hugh Liedke, a close friend and former business partner of Mr. Bush.
The lawyers, from the firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPheron & Hand, had investigated a deal involving a 500,000-acre parcel in Northern New Mexico known as Vermejo Ranch. Mr. Perot said he was offered the ranch for $24 million in the early 1970's. It was instead acquired by Pennzoil.
The investigation never showed that Mr. Bush had done anything improper, and Mr. Perot insisted today that his motives were not to harm Mr. Bush. But Walter Pincus, one of the Washington Post reporters who received the information from Mr. Perot in 1988, said, "I don't think he was doing it to help him."
Mr. Perot said that in 1986, Pennzoil came to him and offered to sell 400,000 acres of the ranch for $50 million and that he learned that Pennzoil had received a $48 million tax credit for donating the other 100,000 acres to the Forest Service.
 
Contacts With Reporters
 Mr. Pincus recalled today that Mr. Perot had been providing information to Mr. Woodward in January 1988 about the Iran-contra scandal when he happened to volunteer that he also had information on the land transaction. Mr. Perot arranged for a Washington breakfast with Mr. Luce and the two Post reporters.
Mr. Perot said today that some information was provided after it was requested by the Post. Mr. Perot's spokesman, James Squires, said that Mr. Perot provided the information to The Post "to find out whether a fraud had been committed on taxpayers."
Last Sunday, Mr. Woodward wrote a front page article in the Post outlining Mr. Perot's investigation into the land deal. Mr. Squires, the Perot spokesman, suggested today that the article violated an agreement Mr. Perot had with the Post that his identity be kept confidential.
Mr. Pincus said that he recalled The Post had originally received the information about the Pennzoil deal in a confidential manner but that he did not know what had occurred in recent weeks between Mr. Woodward and Mr. Perot that might have altered that agreement.
"Bob's got his own sort of view," Mr. Pincus said, adding that he felt his remarks had been made off the record.
Mr. Perot's anger with Mr. Bush, then the Vice President, reportedly stemmed from a feeling that he and Administration officials in general, were paying insufficient attention to Mr. Perot's effort on behalf American servicemen he believed were still held in Southast Asia.
More than a decade ago, Mr. Perot provided seed money to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund for construction of a memorial in Washington, but he openly criticized the design picked by the fund's selection committee. Several officials involved in the memorial said that to get his way, Mr. Perot began a campaign to discredit them.
As part of the effort Mr. Perot hired Roy M. Cohn, the New York lawyer who, in his most famous role, had been counsel to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy during the heyday of the Senator's power.
 
Battle Over Vietnam Memorial
 "We trusted him at the beginning, but then he wanted to get rid of the wall," said John Wheeler, who was the chairman of the veteran's fund. "He wanted me as chairman to abandon the wall. He pushed me and pushed me to give up the wall. He said, 'I'll wipe you out.' It was like being sliced with a knife. The next thing I knew I was getting threatening phone calls."
Officials involved in the memorial said in interviews that in the early 1980's Mr. Perot repeatedly asserted that the memorial fund had been tainted by financial improprieties. Both Mr. Perot and Mr. Cohn demanded access to the fund's records to conduct their own audit but were rebuffed.
Rather than give the records to Mr. Cohn, the fund assembled its own independent audit committee to investigate Mr. Perot's allegations. But that did not satisfy Mr. Perot either, officials said, so the fund turned to the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, to conduct an inquiry.
Finding no evidence of impropriety, the agency concluded that the fund's operations "were proper and that the numerous allegations raised regarding the fund were not valid."
In business dealings, Mr. Perot has sometimes been accused of similarly rough tactics. In 1980 he led an extremely aggressive campaign to overturn a decision by a Texas agency to take away a contract for processing Medicaid claims from his company, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, and award it to a bidder from New York.
Mr. Perot's efforts to reverse the decision included private meetings with the Governor, the Attorney General and the members of the board of human resources, which awarded the contract.
His efforts also included gathering a dossier of negative information about the New York bidder, the Bradford National Corporation, and some of its directors, said the chairman of the human resources board.
Hilmar Moore, the mayor of Richmond, Tex., who was at the time the board chairman, said Mr. Perot had tracked him down to Salt Lake City, where he was vacationing. He said Mr. Perot told him he had some information about Bradford and wanted to come up and show it to him.
 
$2 Billion Contract
 "He just called and asked if he could come on up," recalled Mr. Moore. He said Mr. Perot flew from Texas to Utah on a private plane with one aide and presented him with a folder, which he recalled contained copies of legal complaints against Bradford and some of its directors.
"There was nothing personal in it," Mr. Moore said. "It was all designed to show that Bradford couldn't handle the business." The contract was worth about $2 billion a year to Mr. Perot's company.
Mr. Perot also convinced Mr. Moore that senior state accountants had been incorrect in concluding that giving the contract to Bradford would save the state money. Mr. Moore said he had welcomed the information and decided to work to rescind the award to Bradford.
In another Texas case, Mr. Perot has been accused of using both his wealth and threats to expose extramarital affairs to overwhelm an opponent who had battled for two years to collect $250 million in damages from Mr. Perot and his son, Ross Perot Jr.
Near the end of a two-year court fight that ended in April 1990, the opponent, Richard Salwen who was once a close legal adviser to Mr. Perot, said in court documents that the Perot camp was trying to "economically harass and punish" him.
Mr. Salwen, who was hired as the chief legal officer for the Dell Computer Corporation in 1989, worked for Mr. Perot first as a lawyer at the Electronic Data Systems and then for the Perot Group after Mr. Perot resigned as chairman and chief executive of E.D.S. at the end of 1986.
In his last few years at E.D.S., and until 1988 at the Perot Group, Mr. Salwen said he had worked mainly as an agent for the Perots on projects to acquire 16,000 acres north of Fort Worth and Dallas, and then on several projects related to the development an airfield owned by the City of Fort Worth.
Mr. Salwen's lawsuit against the Perots asserted that his work enhanced the value of the Perots' land by $250 million. Yet he contended that the Perots had never granted him the ownership stake in the property that they had promised when they lured him to leave his job at E.D.S.
In court documents, the Perots said Mr. Salwen was never promised an ownership position. In related affidavits, two other participants in the land investments with the Perots and Mr. Salwen, Mervin L. Stauffer and J. Michael Poss, who had close ties to the Perots, said the Perots were not obligated in 1988 to grant them specific ownership positions. Mr. Salwen acknowledged in court documents that he had no written commitment from the Perots.
In February 1990, J. Patrick Horner, president of Perot Systems, the computer-services company controlled by Mr. Perot, informed the chief financial officer at Dell Computer, Donald D. Collis, in two telephone conversations that the Perots had information about Mr. Salwen's involvement in an extra-marital affair. Mr. Collis was Mr. Salwen's supervisor at Dell.
Mr. Salwen's lawyer, C. L. (Mike) Schmidt said that when he learned of Mr. Horner's contacts, "I hit the ceiling." He protested the contacts by Mr. Horner in court documents, asserting that they had caused Mr. Salwen "emotional distress and loss of his professional reputation." Within a matter of weeks, Mr. Schmidt said in an interview, the case was settled for an undisclosed amount of money.
In 1990, Mr. Perot took the unusual step of obtaining a court order permitting the inspections of a house he rented and hiring off-duty Dallas police officers to conduct three inspections of the house each day.
According to a 1990 lawsuit, Mr. Perot took the action because the tenant, H. Wayne Hayes Jr., had failed to pay his rent in March 1990 and because Mr. Perot feared he might damage the house next to Mr. Perot's North Dallas estate. Mr. Hayes paid $7,500 a month in rent on the home, which is valued at nearly $2 million.
 
Patrol Cars and Dogs
 In remarks today on the NBC News program "Today," Mr. Perot said he had been obliged to take action because of drug use and fistfights on the property.
A lawyer for Mr. Hayes, Tim Jones, said there was no reason to believe Mr. Hayes would damage the property.
A report by a private investigating team, which was made public by Mr. Hayes's wife, said officers for Mr. Perot drove marked patrol cars and led a drug-sniffing dog through the house. Mr. Jones said that went beyond the court order approved by both sides.
Mr. Hayes, 35, is now in prison in Hawaii after pleading guilty last year to two charges of mail fraud in a Federal securities case.

Land deal involving Bush friend
 
Background
 Mr. Perot said he was surprised to discover that the Pannzoil Company, when headed by a close firend of then Vice President Bush, received a $48 million Federal tax credit for donating to the Government one-fifth of a larger parcel of land that he was offered a few years earlier for $24 million.
 
Accusation
 Mr. Perot hired Washington lawyers to investigate the transaction and secretly provided information to The Washington Post in an effort to embarass Mr. Bush.
 
Perot's Response
 Mr. Perot said he gathered the information only to decide whether to buy the land, and that he provided information to The Post mostly because the paper asked for it, although a Post reporter said that Mr. Perot volunteered it. A spokesman for Mr. Perot said Mr. Perot investigated the deal to determine whether a fraud had been perpetrated on taxpayers.
 
Richard L. Armitage investigation
 
Background
 Mr. Perot was active in efforts to locate American servicemen who were missing in Vietnam and believed that the Defense Department was not not making adequate efforts to search for them.
 
Accusation
 Mr. Perot asserted that Richard Armitage, an Assistant Secretary of Defense, had a friendship with a Vietnamese-American woman that compromised efforts to find missing American servicemen in Asia. Mr. Perot spread unfounded information about Mr. Armitage, including data gathered by an undercover police officer in Virginia.
 
Perot's Response
 Mr. Perot said he did not solicit the information about Mr. Armitage but received an unsolicited file from the officer. In follow-up interviews, Mr. Perot admitted he made the initial call to the police officer who had the information. Mr. Perot said he passed on the information to "appropriate law enforcement authorities" by handling it to the F.B.I. But he also acknowledged keeping a copy in his safe.
 
Vietnam War Memorial
 
Background
 Mr. Perot provided nearly $200,000 in seed money for design and construction of a Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. But he was openly critical of the design selected for the memorial by a panel.
 
Accusation
To undermine the project, Mr. Perot sought to dig up improprieties about officials of the fund. He demanded financial records from the fund, and hired Roy M. Cohn, who was former chief counsel to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, to help him.
 
Perot's Response
 Mr. Perot has denied that he was seeking to discredit officials of the fund. He said he had concerns about the fund's business practices and was acting on behalf of many veterans who did not like the memorial's design.
 
Dispute with business partner
 
Background
 Richard Salwen, once a close legal adviser to Mr. Perot, filed a $250 million lawsuit against him, contending that Mr. Perot and his son had reneged on giving him an ownership stake in property. He left the Perot family businesses over the dispute in 1988.
 
Accusation
 Mr. Perot, through an intermediary, spread rumors linking Mr. Salwen to an extra-marital affair. Mr. Salwen also accused Mr. Perot of intimidation, saying he threatened him and his lawyer: "I will bury you guys with hourly-rate lawyers."
 
Perot's Response
 Perot spokesman James Squires said Mr. Perot "never sought to intimidate Mr. Salwen with the use of personal information." -- RICHARD L. BERKE

HEADLINE: THE ISRAELI VOTE;
RABIN PLANS TO ACT ON MIDEAST TALKS AND SETTLEMENTS

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, June 24

 BODY:
Yitzhak Rabin said today that his priorities as Israel's next Prime Minister would be peace negotiations to bring about Palestinian self-rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and an end to construction of "political settlements" there.
Mr. Rabin, the victorious Labor Party leader in the national election Tuesday, added that he hoped in the process to improve relations with the United States, which have been seriously strained over the settlements issue. 
 "Every penny that goes to them is a blow to the things that are most important to Israel," he told a television interviewer tonight, referring to settlements not explicitly needed for Israeli security. "As far as the national budget is concerned, the building will stop."
 
Peace and Security
 Mr. Rabin spoke only in general terms and for the most part reiterated basic themes from his campaign as he savored the first day after a stunning Labor victory over the long-governing Likud Party. [Palestinians in the occupied West Bank cautiously welcomed the Labor victory. Page A14.]
Nevertheless, he sought to emphasize that many of his principal concerns would be different from Likud's, with the exception that he is no less committed to Israel's security.
"I believe that peace that doesn't contribute to security has no meaning and isn't worth the name 'peace,' " he said at a separate news conference.
 
'National Consensus'
 Mr. Rabin's triumph does not mean he has a Government yet, for he still needs to find coalition partners to give him a working majority in the 120-member Parliament. In fact, he suggested concern that the incomplete alliance he now leads may lean too far to the left, and he raised the possibility of religious and right-wing parties helping him to form a "broad national consensus."
In an apparent gesture toward the right, the Labor leader urged his left-wing allies in a coalition called Meretz not to press demands for a Palestinian state or for a complete freeze on Jewish settlements, whether defined as "political" or otherwise.
Though Mr. Rabin has not been specific about which settlements are political, they are generally considered to be those not in or around Jerusalem.
And he said that even if Palestinians gained self-rule -- a status that he has said he hopes to realize within nine months of taking office -- it did not mean that all 140 settlements built in the West Bank and Gaza over the last 25 years would disappear.
"We're not going to uproot settlements as we did in Sinai," he said, evoking what for many Israelis was a traumatic leveling of Jewish communities in the Sinai Desert a decade ago as part of a peace treaty with Egypt.
As praise of the Labor victory and expressions of hope for peace flowed in from the United States, Europe and Arab countries, Mr. Rabin and his strategists began to deal with the complex political arithmetic involved in putting together a stable coalition. They talked about having a Government in place in three to five weeks, and some of them set as a target July 13, when the new Parliament is scheduled to convene.
While there are several uncertainties, one point is obvious. Labor's rout of Likud could scarcely have been more thorough -- 45 parliamentary seats to 32, in the unofficial final tally. Likud, which held power for 15 years, now finds itself a dispirited and disoriented opposition party, one that its officials assume will endure debilitating internal arguments and possible schisms before its fortunes improve.
Its leader of the last decade, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, was widely expected to step aside before too long. Mr. Shamir hinted at that possibility in a television interview early this morning.
"We have to revamp the party," said Benjamin Netanyahu, one of several young party officials who would like to succeed Mr. Shamir. "It's very clear that the biggest message voters sent to us was: You've been there too long, and you forgot that you're accountable. And they're right."
 
Religious Party Role
 Still, as convincing as the Labor victory was, it left Mr. Rabin short of a working parliamentary majority.
One natural partner is Meretz, which won 12 seats. Added to Mr. Rabin's total, it gives him a total of 57. In theory, he could also throw in 5 seats won by two Israeli Arab parties, but he has said repeatedly that he will not accept them in the Government.
So to reach the 61 seats that it needs, Labor has no choice but to turn to some of the religious parties and perhaps also to a far-right party called Tsomet, which had been allied with Likud until now.
It is not impossible that Mr. Rabin could even ask Likud to join him in a "national unity government," along the lines of a broad coalition that prevailed from 1984 to 1990. But several officials in both major parties said that seemed highly unlikely, given the widespread opposition to such an arrangement within Labor and the unacceptable junior status that Likud would get if it went along with the idea.
In his television interview tonight, Mr. Rabin said that several parties of rigorously Orthodox Jews were possible partners. He also hinted at possible negotiations with Tsomet, which increased its parliamentary strength from two seats to seven, in good part because its leader, Rafael Eitan, is perceived by many voters as honest and straightforward.
At no point was Mr. Rabin specific about which parties he would approach. He insisted that he had forbidden any substantive discussions until after the vote totals are declared final, probably on Friday.
Those negotiations could prove delicate because his potential allies could not be more varied on several key questions.
Yet somehow that seemed like a mere detail today in the first blush of Mr. Rabin's victory, which left him holding all the important cards and able to do what he wants.
 
Likud's Internal Problems
 "The religious will come to us because they cannot survive in the opposition," Haim Ramon, a top Labor strategist said, exhibiting the party's new self-assurance.
With no complete statistical breakdown yet available, it was difficult to say precisely why Israelis voted as they did. But there was more than enough anecdotal evidence, along with a few numbers.
New immigrants from the former Soviet Union, displeased with their high levels of unemployment, punished Likud and flocked to Labor by margins of 47 percent to 18 percent, according to exit polls.
A graphic example of general dissatisfaction with Likud's stewardship was the vote total in Bat Yam, a working-class suburb of Tel Aviv. Bat Yam became a symbol of Israeli fears of terrorism after a 15-year-old girl was stabbed to death last month by a Palestinian from Gaza. Her killing set off several hours of anti-Arab rioting.
Normally, Bat Yam is Likud country. And normally, an attack of that sort could be expected to produce a backlash that works to Likud's advantage. This time, Bat Yam voters seemed to say that they did not trust the Government to protect them, and they gave Labor a plurality.

HEADLINE: Irish Ridicule New U.S. Envoy Over Gaffes

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUBLIN, June 24

 BODY:
In his first week as American Ambassador to Ireland, William FitzGerald, an 82-year-old businessman and friend of President Bush, has been hit by what a diplomat called "the Irish Welcome Wagon."
Major newspapers have mocked Mr. FitzGerald in front-page articles because of errors he made about fundamental issues facing Ireland in testimony on June 3 in hearings in Washington on his appointment. 
 Appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said the Irish had already voted in a referendum to approve the European Community's treaty on union of economic, foreign and security policies. Corrected on this point by Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, who pointed out that the referendum would not be held until June 18, Mr. FitzGerald apologized and said he was thinking of projected results, not the actual vote. The treaty was approved by 68 percent of the voters last week.
Questioned about his views on the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, Mr. FitzGerald said he was glad that the United States Congress was providing money "to encourage dialogue and cooperation between the Unionists and the Loyalists." Both terms, as nearly every Irish person knows, are used to describe the same group: the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland.
Most people here assume that Mr. FitzGerald also intended to refer to the opposing group, the Roman Catholic "nationalists" of Northern Ireland, who say they are discriminated against in jobs and housing. Some of them are seeking union with Ireland.
In a brief debate in Parliament on Tuesday, Pat Lee, a member of the opposition Fine Gael party, said "the mind-boggling decision of President Bush defies logic."
"I feel this nation has been slighted," said Dr. Lee, a 47-year-old Dublin doctor. He said Mr. Bush should explain to Irish-American voters "why he holds our country in such low esteem."
The Irish Times has run three articles on Mr. FitzGerald in the last week, including a front-page article today with the headline "New Ambassador is an insult; Irish-Americans complain."
The Irish Government of Prime Minister Albert Reynolds has not commented on Mr. FitzGerald's gaffes, which have been reported on national television and are being discussed with some fervor on radio call-in shows. Mr. FitzGerald, who is to present his credentials on Friday to President Mary Robinson, has also declined to comment on the criticism. Mr. FitzGerald replaces Richard A. Moore, 79, who will work on Mr. Bush's campaign.
Appointments of American Ambassadors to Ireland have often stirred controversy. Margaret M. Heckler came here reluctantly in January 1986 after she was dislodged from her post as Secretary of Health and Human Services, a reassignment that led Irish commentators to complain that their country was viewed a booby prize. Ultimately Ms. Heckler won respect for her intense study of Ireland's politics.
A Western diplomat argued that because of the friendship, Mr. FitzGerald would "be able to get Bush on the phone any time he wants anything for Ireland," an access that a younger, career diplomat might be denied.
The spokesman for the American Embassy, John Treacy, reacted scornfully. "No blow is too low. No shot is too cheap," he said, adding, "This is just a case of the Lilliputians firing their arrows at the emmisary of Gulliver."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Hopes to Lend Russians a Quick $1 Billion

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
In a move to speed aid to Moscow, the International Monetary Fund plans to lend the Russians $1 billion to help pay for crucial imports in a simplified reform agreement that the agency hopes to complete in the next two weeks.
The I.M.F.'s plan, as described by its officials, represented a scaling back of original plans for a multibillion-dollar package requiring more sweeping reforms by the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
 The fund's officials said they were acting because Moscow needed cash immediately, and because they wanted to give Russia and the other former republics of the Soviet Union more time to work out a plan to determine which of them would continue to use the ruble as a step toward stabilizing their currencies.
I.M.F. officials and negotiators for Russia said the fund had eased demands on Moscow like one for a lifting of oil-price controls over the next few months -- a faster pace than many Russian officials thought the people could tolerate. Russian officials, and some American ones, have said that with Moscow's economy in deep crisis, the I.M.F. should not demand an accord so strict that it might conceivably spur people to rise up in protest.
 
Balancing Act
 "We're trying to balance all the pressures we're facing while maintaining our standards for a solid program," an official of the fund said.
The new plan has taken shape as the United States has been pressing the I.M.F. to act quickly to aid Russia.
According to officials close to the negotiations, the I.M.F. and Russia are aiming to complete the scaled-down agreement before the economic summit meeting of major industrial nations -- the Group of Seven -- in Munich July 6-8.
Fund officials said they expected Russia to try to follow up the scaled-back agreement by requesting a larger aid package that would require more comprehensive reforms. When the Group of Seven unveiled its $24 billion aid package for Russia in April, it anticipated that the I.M.F. would lend Moscow $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year.
These officials cited a key stumbling block, one that made it difficult for Moscow and the fund to negotiate a more comprehensive agreement over the next few weeks: the fact that Russia and the other republics were still trying to sort out which republics would continue to use the ruble.
 
Who Uses the Ruble?
 Until the republics figure that out, it will be difficult for Russia to gain full control over its money supply because central banks in other republics might continue to print billions of rubles -- rubles that could find their way into Russia in the course of commerce. Thus, the second agreement, coming once it was determined which republics would use the ruble, could set more definite targets for limiting inflation and growth in the money supply.
Only then, officials close to the negotiations said, could Russia seek to peg the ruble at a set rate. This would also open the door to Russia's tapping a planned $6 billion multinational fund to stabilize the ruble.
"I don't think anyone loses in this," said David Lipton, a Washington-based economist who is a consultant to Russia on the negotiations. "The truth of the matter is the Russians have taken a lot of important steps. It is an important moment for the West to be weighing in with some aid, and with this mechanism, the West is weighing in."
In most I.M.F. agreements, the fund disburses money in installments every few months, with each piece conditioned on a country's satisfying certain targets, like reducing its budget deficit to a specified level.
The fund has occasionally used scaled-down agreements before, as they place less stringent conditions on a country than in the broader agreements.
The American Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, David C. Mulford, said in a speech Monday in Zurich, "The Russian situation is unique in certain respects and may require creative solutions."
He added, "An agreement is needed in a matter of weeks, not months."
Negotiations between Russia and the I.M.F. are scheduled to resume late this week in Moscow.
Officials from the fund and from the Bush Administration officials said that under the expected package, Russia knows that it would not receive more than the expedited $1 billion if it backed off from its commitment to economic change.
The officials say that Mr. Yeltsin has been courageous in pushing ahead with bold reforms to create a market economy, although they are concerned that inflation and money-supply growth are not under control.
In his speech, Mr. Mulford said that to satisfy the I.M.F., Russia had to reduce its budget deficit to a level that could be financed without having to print money, a process most economists regard as inherently inflationary. He also said Russia had to control the printing of money and establish a currency with a stable value to help link its economy to the world's hard-currency economies.
He also said Moscow had to create legal structures and a system of private rights based on private ownership for Russian and foreign investors.
He added that the I.M.F. and Russia are in "broad agreement" on these points. "The differences of course, concern the details," he said.
Fund officials said that Yegor T. Gaidar, Russia's acting Prime Minister, made significant progress toward this scaled-down pact last week when he met with the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus. Mr. Gaidar was here during Mr. Yeltsin's meetings with President Bush.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Excerpts From Interview With President Bush on First Term and Future

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview with President Bush in the Oval Office on Tuesday. The questioners were R. W. Apple Jr., Joel Brinkley, Steven Greenhouse and Andrew Rosenthal of The New York Times. Some questions have been edited or paraphrased because of space limitations.
Q: We would like to talk to you about your record for the first term. As you look back over the last three and a half years, can you tell us what you consider your most significant domestic initiatives that you have originated, promoted and seen through to fruition?  
 PRESIDENT BUSH: I think clearly the education initiative, where we set with the governors six educational goals, and where we're now trying to implement them. Some need Federal, some of it needs Federal legislation; much of it doesn't. There are many America 2000 communities, schools across the country, communities across the country, and so I think clearly that's a major one.
I think I'd put down, in terms of accomplishments, I'd put down our child care and the A.D.A. bill as early accomplishments.
I think what we've done on the Federal bench. I said ahead of time what I was going to do; we have good, quality judges. I think I'd take that as a significant accomplishment.
And I think I'd also put down, in terms of legislative accomplishment, the revision of the Clean Air Act.
What we really want to do relates more in the broad subjects, like anticrime, education. And we started, we've mapped out, put down a road map, but we're not there yet.
Q: Are there other parts of your record in a larger sense than these domestic issues that you think best recommend you for another term?
A: Obviously I think we've made great accomplishments. Great, earth-shaking.
Q: Which specifically?
A: Well, standing here with Yeltsin the other day, getting rid of all SS-18's, getting rid, agreeing to get rid, of all these MIRV'ed ICBM's is a significant accomplishment.
The changes in the world, I think, we get blamed if things went wrong. We should get credit if they've gone right. And they've gone right. Reunification of Germany. Democracy in this hemisphere. Pushing for, but not having accomplished, free-trade agreements. . . . We can't say that's done, obviously, but I think we're on the right track for free trade, as opposed to protection.
I think handling the changes inside what used to be the Soviet Union and the C.I.S. has been good, and I am very pleased that ancient enemies are talking to each other in the Middle East.
And, of course, Desert Storm was a significant and major accomplishment, because it said to aggressor nations: You can't just go take over a friendly country next door.
 
Goals for a Second Term
 Q: You've been in public life a long time. But there still seems to be this sense among people, when we interview them and in polls and when you talk to people even in your own party, that people don't quite understand what you stand for or what you'd like to do. Where would you like to take this country?
A: I'd like to see it . . in the first place, I'd like to see it set in an environment of world peace.
Secondly, I think at home, changing, fundamentally revolutionizing education is critical.
And I'd like to see a domestic environment where we have a return to safety in the streets, and we have it where mothers don't worry about their children walking home from school. And that means winning the battle against drugs, certainly, and doing better in the crime field so we have domestic tranquillity. And that means, of course, a lot of things that go with it. It means help for the cities, it means battling against crime by passing better legislation.
And so it's got to be the whole domestic tranquillity in a better-educated America.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q: Economic growth has been slow in the first three and a half years of your Administration. What would you say has caused this?
A: A long recession with not enough investment and not enough----. And it's longer than it needs to have been because we could have stimulated the economy to get out of it. And so it's a long recession.
I don't know, I can't remember all the studies I undertook when I studied economics about business cycles, but I think the answer to the recession would have been, and still is, stimulating growth.
I think one of the reasons for the discouraged economic outlook relates to the deficit and to the, well, to the anemic growth itself.
Q: What do you think should be done now to stimulate growth?
A: I think we need to do what I've been trying to get the Congress to do for some time: to selectively stimulate the economy.
I happen to think the economy is better than most of the people in America think. We saw polls somewhere last week 60 percent of the people think the economy is getting worse. The economy is getting better. In some areas, it's not getting better, but I think we should stimulate it through the methods that we've talked about. You know, the litany of growth initiatives. And I feel committed to them, and I wish that we could have done it, and still wish that we can do it.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Help for the Cities
 Q: Mr. President, you said that one thing you wanted to do in a second term is to help the cities. Even some black Republicans don't feel that this Administration has paid much attention to the plight of black people in the center cities. What do you think the Federal Government can do and what do you think it can't do to break this cycle of poverty and crime and general decay in the cities?
A: Three weeks ago I was sitting with some people in Los Angeles. All of whom -- Democrat, Republican, private sector, public sector, liberal Mayor, conservative Governor -- all wanted enterprise zones.
Q: So that's one thing they can do?
A: It's one thing they can do, yes. I would expect those black Republicans would have given enthusiastic support for that. We've been trying to get that done for a long time. With a renewed sense of urgency, we brought that back with Pete Wilson, Ueberroth and Mayor Bradley . . . we got the bipartisan leadership together; they made the pitch: Please pass this.
We can do this. Set it out alone, and let's get it done. And it is frustrating that it's not been done, not simply in the wake of the riots from Los Angeles but over the years that we've been trying to get it done. So there's one area we'd start with.
Another one is this new program "Weed and Seed," which I think has broad support. The name implies you weed out the criminals, you seed the areas. And there are some 40 different programs I think are connected with our weed-and-seed initiative that would help, from labor to health to certain education programs.
Longer run, I'm convinced that educational reform is essential for the cities, and I would like to see the crime bill passed. So there's four.
And home ownership, I mean that's something we've been advocating. There's a little progress been made on that. But I think those are the directions that we ought to go to help the cities.
Q: And the directions we shouldn't go?
A: Well, we ought to find out what hasn't worked and not do it. We ought to reform the welfare system so we do everything we can to get families to stay together. When the mayors came to see me, John, they said that the decline in the family was the single most important cause for what went wrong, what's wrong in the cities. And we talk about family values and keeping families together, and there's a little ridicule factor out there, and we are right on target in talking about it and trying to find ways like welfare reform to strengthen the family. . . .
 
Civil Rights and Family Values
 Q: Do you feel that more moral leadership, more exhortation, more calls on the country to cease discrimination, to view a black American the same as a white American, the same as a brown American, are needed from the White House?
A: Well, I think it's needed from everybody, and I've tried very much to do that, speaking out against discrimination, against discrimination of any kind. . . . But I can't argue that it shouldn't be done more, no. I think we should. Find every opportunity to do it.
I take pride in the civil rights bill. I think it's forward-looking. I think it is against quotas, and I think it is against discrimination in the work place. I'm very proud of it as I am of the A.D.A. bill, both of them forward pieces of civil rights legislation.
And to those who want to redefine it and say that I caved in on quotas, they're wrong. They want to say I was dragged kicking to the finish line, they're wrong. We had a good piece of legislation. We kept working with Congress and we finally got it right.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q: The family values that you brought up -- Vice President Quayle's been talking a lot about -- I wonder if you could address those issues. Is it wrong for the entertainment industry to make single motherhood or even unwed motherhood appealing, glamorous, exciting in any way? Is it wrong for people of the same sex or unmarried people to be parents? And why?
A: Yes, it's -- in my set of values, people of the same sex to be parents?
Q: That's right, or unmarried people.
A: No, not unmarried people at all.
But I can't accept as normal life style people of the same sex being parents. I'm very sorry. I don't accept that as normal.
And I believe in the traditional family values. And the best shot that a kid has is to have a mother and father that love that child, that will educate that child, that will care for that child. . . .
But to glamorize life styles that are, in my view, not the normal life style, I don't approve of that. I don't want to censor it, but I don't approve of it.
We've gotten away from our fundamental strengths, which are traditional family values. And I think all the Vice President is trying to do is say we ought to return to that as much as possible. That doesn't condemn every single -- every person that's divorced. But I think when you see the decline of the family, as the mayors were telling me, we'd better find ways to strengthen them.
When you see some of the filth on television, you ought to speak out about it. I mean, I'll spare you the program, but Barbara and I saw one the other night at Camp David. I couldn't believe it. The words. And to think my 15-year-old granddaughter might be listening to that in Miami, Fla.
And people know that it's gone too far. People know that this is bad for the family, putting too much pressure on it. So I applaud speaking out for and trying to find constructive ways to strengthen the family.
 
Problems of Inner Cities
 Q: One of the other points that the Vice President has made is that we've had a change in our moral behavior over the last 20 or so years. And that the poor people in this country, particularly in the inner cities, were more affected by that than you or anybody in this room was. Do you agree with that? Why do you suppose that's the case?
A: Well, I think if you look at the demographics you would see that there are a lot, many more single-parent homes in that kind of an environment. Some of it's economic, I'm sure. Some of it's lack of educational opportunity, quality of education. Some of it is slipping in, then, to practices like the drug culture. Some of it is condoned because of economics, getting involved in selling drugs.
So there's a whole lot of reasons, there's a host of reasons that -- where the pressures are enormous on those families. A lot of it economic.
Q: Do you have to address the economic problem before you----?
A: Yes, we do. Try to get jobs in the inner cities, jobs with dignity. Try to break the welfare dependency, break the cycle of welfare. Everyone knows it's bad. I haven't heard anyone defend it, and they shouldn't.
 
Balancing the Budget
 Q: Mr. President, you spoke very eloquently on behalf of the balanced-budget amendment proposal. If you're re-elected, would you intend to eliminate the deficit during your second term, and how would you go about doing that?
A: We've got a program before the Congress right now, and it leans heavily on controlling the growth of mandatory spending programs. That's the way we would do it. There's a 32-page, 32 pages of alternatives and options up there right now before the Senate. And it is detailed. And I regret to see an editorial in The New York Times today saying that one candidate, Bill Clinton, has put some detail out there and we have not, because that is not factual.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q: The competitiveness of many American industries has declined vis-a-vis the Japanese over the past decade or two. Many Americans, including Mr. Perot and Governor Clinton, are saying that the Government should take a more active role in helping the industries of tomorrow. What do you think is the proper role for the Government?
A: I don't think we ought to have industrial planning. I don't believe in targeting.
I think what we need to do is do what we suggested on research and development and education. Therein lies the answer, and I do not want to see the Government pick winners and losers. Shouldn't do that. Maybe we have a fundamental difference we can talk about in the fall when we get into the campaign mode.
 
U.S. Role in Yugoslavia
Q: Mr. President, you spoke a few minutes ago about your pride in what had been achieved in Desert Storm. . . . I wonder if you could differentiate for me between the situation that we sought to remedy there and the situation in Yugoslavia?
You talked about a friendly country being overrun by an aggressor. I think some people, at least, would describe the Serbian Government as an aggressor attempting to overrun Bosnia and Herzegovina. I think that the loss of life certainly has been greater in Bosnia and Herzegovina than it was in Kuwait. What makes us reluctant to consider military steps by the United Nations or by the United States and the coalition it put together to try to protect these people?
A: I think in the instance of Iraq moving into Kuwait you had one country taking over another country. The Yugoslavian situation is complicated by the fact that you have one country that seems to be disintegrating, or going forward . . . depending on who you are arguing the case----
Q: But we have recognized----
A: ----into many other republics. So you've just started this process. And you have citizens from one entity or another living in another person's country. And so you've got similar----. The situation is more analogous, it seems to me, to what's happening in the western part of the former Soviet Union than it is analogous to what's happening in----.
Q: Moldova.
A: Yes, or Moldova or where else. I mean, look at the map. And so I think that's the thing that has made it different.
Now, the human suffering is enormous, and I am very much concerned about the loss of life there. We are considering what next the United States might do about it.
But I think that is what differentiates the two in the eyes of the whole world. In the eyes of the United Nations, I might add, in the eyes of the E.C.
Q In the months that led up to Desert Storm you said repeatedly that we were not going to exclude any form of response. Are you keeping your options open, vis-a-vis the Yugoslavian situation?
A: Yes.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Relations With Congress
 Q: In any discussion of what this Administration has been able to accomplish or not accomplish comes the complaint that Congress has blocked many of the initiatives you put forward. Well, you're not the first President to face an opposition Congress. Other Republicans have had greater or less luck than you facing the Democratic Congress. Do you think it is legitimate to judge a President, at least in part, based on how well he is able to work with Congress?
A: Whether I think it's legitimate or not isn't the question. I think that will be one criterion to judge the President. I would look back and say that when you have a divided, when you have a divided Government, a President does much better if he controlled one house or the other of the Congress.
There are some vivid exceptions to that rule. Jimmy Carter had control of both houses, and God knows, we don't want to go back to the misery index where it was when he left office. So I can't argue that getting control alone solves all the problems.
What hasn't been tried in the last 35 years is a Republican President and Republican control of both houses of the Congress. When Reagan came into office and I was the Vice President, he got a lot done in the first term because he controlled one house of the Congress. And it makes it an awful lot better if you control, say, one house, say nothing of two.
So I think, yes, you'd have to have people say that's one measure.
But I wasn't elected to do it the way the liberal Democrats that control Congress want, and so I've had to stand up to them. And that's not the measure of how I want to be President.
So I will say to the people this fall, 'Let's try something that hasn't been tried in the last 35 years. Let's try the Republican President whose values, I believe, are in keeping with the values of the American people.'
I think they want stronger crime legislation. I think they'd like a new approach to education. I think they want to see enterprise zones tried, if, indeed, they'd even focused on that question. I think they'd like to see the economy stimulated. I think they'd like to see us try to do a better job on the spending side.
And I'm going to say, now, here's a way to get that done: Give me control of both houses. Give the people a Republican President and control of both houses of Congress. You've tried it with the Democrats, both houses; that was abysmal failure. You've tried it partially with a Republican President, and when that happened, things moved pretty well. But now, try it the way it hasn't been tried.
Q: Is there any reason to believe that if you do not win both houses, or even one house, that you'll have any better luck getting your initiatives through?
A: Yes, because I think I've got problems, but they're nothing compared to what Congress has. And so I think the turnover is going to be important. I think the election will be enormously helpful in that regard, because these values we're talking about and the legislative initiatives I'm talking about will have support from the American people. We will take that case, clearly, to them.
So I think . . . when you first get in, if you're first elected, no matter what the situation, you can get more done. We got the clean-air bill done pretty quick when we first got here, the child-care legislation. We had to fight like the devil to do it against an old-thinking Congress, but we got it done.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q: What do you think when you look back on your career when you see a Governor of a small state, and a man who's never held public office, running you even or better? Aside from the hostility of Congress, what do you think has got into the American public? Is it just the problems with Congress?
A: No, no.
 
The Mood of America
 Q: Is it just the economy?
A: No. It's more.
It's the decline in the American family. It is the fact that there's a negative perception out there, driven largely by the economy. Right track, wrong track. Think you'll be better off tomorrow or not?
The economy has driven it largely. If not, why would things look so much better in polls -- that fortunately I didn't refer to that much -- a year ago? The answer is the economy.
But it's more than that. It is also this feeling against crime. It's the feeling of the decay and decline in the American family. And we're going through, kind of, what I think is a transitional phase. As the economy recovers, I think you're going to see this optimism that has an innate quality of America come back. And I think we're dealing at it from a very low ebb here. The economy is moving, and people think it's getting worse. Now how do you explain that? . . .
And we're going to get it in focus in the campaign, the positive things.
But more fundamental than that, the economy is going to move. And we're still going to have these big problems to face, but we're not going to be facing them against such a negative backdrop. . . .
In the final analysis, people are going to say, who do you want sitting at that desk? Who has the temperament? Who has the experience? Who do we trust? And that's why I'm going to win this election; you watch.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Undeclared Candidate;
Perot Traces Spying Rumors To Bush 'Dirty Tricks' Staff

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANNAPOLIS, Md., June 24

 BODY:
Denying reports that he had employed private investigators to uncover information that could be potentially embarrassing to President Bush, Ross Perot today called the accusations part of an orchestrated effort by the "dirty tricks crowd" in Mr. Bush's re-election campaign.
"You all know what's going on, so let's don't pretend that we don't," Mr. Perot told a news conference here after a dockside rally with his supporters. "There has been a 90-day effort to redefine my personality by a group called opposition research of the Republican Party. They're generally known as the dirty tricks crowd." 
 Mr. Perot, the undeclared independent candidate, who is at or near the top of public opinion polls in the three-way Presidential race, used his appearances at the news conference and on television today to try to quash efforts by Republican Party officials to depict him as a dangerous person who, as President, would abuse the powerful Federal apparatus and trample civil liberties. In seeking to refute such assertions, Mr. Perot went on the offensive and engaged in the type of mudslinging that he and his aides have said they would not use.
Mr. Perot was also interviewed live on the NBC "Today" program and on "Larry King Live," the Cable News Network talk program.
 
Pledge on Economic Plan
 Besides denying the Republican accusations, Mr. Perot, touched a number of other issues in his hourlong news conference. He promised that he would have a detailed economic plan that would be "discussed" with the American people before the election. He denounced sexual harassment in the military and said the alleged molestation of women at a convention of Naval aviators last year was "inexcusable."
He told reporters that before he could support a free trade agreement with Mexico, he would have to be sure it would not eliminate American jobs. And without saying it outright, he hinted that he was uncomfortable with the idea of racial preference programs.
Aides to Mr. Perot said the appearances today were intended to "set the record straight" and halt Republican efforts to define the Texas billionaire.
"This press conference was about going to the press and saying, you've heard the following stories, you're writing the following stories, now here are the facts and you write the way you want to," said Mort Meyerson, a senior adviser to Mr. Perot.
Mr. Perot laid the blame squarely at Mr. Bush's feet for the spate of critical reports about him. "He is in charge of the whole process," he said on the "Today" program. "That party does not run out there out of control."
But Mr. Perot predicted that the harsh attacks would backfire on the Republicans "because the American people are just furious with this little theater program they run" in Washington. "The American people want action," he said. They want something to happen in this country. Washington is a master of deception, cover-up and deceit."
Recent news reports have contended that Mr. Perot provided information on what he considered a questionable land deal involving a close friend of the President, investigated Mr. Bush's children and hired private detectives to shadow his own children. At his news conference, Mr. Perot either denied the allegations outright or provided what he said were justifications for his behavior. But when pressed for details in other cases, he avoided direct answers.
Some officials in the Bush campaign today denied that the reports about Mr. Perot's investigtions had been spread by them, the White House or other Republican officials. But Rich Bond, the Republican chairman, freely admits that Republican campaign workers have passed along damaging information about Mr. Perot, though he denies that this constituted "dirty tricks."
Administration officials seem intent on keeping the heat on, and continue to hammer away at the theme of Mr. Perot's purported instability. "Mr. Perot's paranoia knows no bounds," Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said at his daily briefing.
The news conference today was reminiscent of those held by Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas in the wake of allegations that he had had an affair with a cabaret singer. Perot aides appeared concerned that the Texan's drive could be blunted by accusations about his character. Mr. Meyerson noted that in some surveys, the number of people who do not approve of Mr. Perot has doubled.
Mr. Perot denied that he had sought out information on Mr. Bush's children. He said he had merely received reports from a source he declined to identify that one of Mr. Bush's sons was consorting with a gun-runner for anti-Communist guerrillas in Nicaragua. He said he had passed along the information to Mr. Bush, then Vice President, as "one father to another."
Perot aides gave reporters photocopies of a handwritten note from Mr. Bush, written in December 1986, thanking Mr. Perot for providing him with the information. "You see, I was very touched by your call about my kids," Mr. Bush wrote, adding that his children "are all straight arrows, uninvolved in intrigue."
But Mr. Perot avoided answering a question of why, if he suspected shady dealings in a 1982 land deal involving the Penzoil company, he had given material relating to the deal to The Washington Post, rather than to the Internal Revenue Service. In the transaction, Penzoil, headed by Hugh Liedtke, a former business partner of Mr. Bush, was granted a $48 million tax deduction for the gift of 100,000 acres to the Federal Government.
 
Questions About Deal
 Instead, Mr. Perot engaged in a long, rambling discussion of the value of the land, and asked: "How and why did they get such favorable treatment? Why did they get such a huge evaluation on the land?" He said that he had "casually" mentioned the transaction to Bob Woodward, an assistant managing editor at The Post, and that when Mr. Woodward later asked for documents, he gave him documents obtained by a Washington law firm retained by Mr. Perot. "That's not walking around with a Sherlock Holmes hat and a magnifying glass," he said.
An assistant to Mr. Woodward said the editor was away for the next two weeks and could not be reached to corroborate Mr. Perot's account.
Throughout the news conference, Mr. Perot displayed his customary pugnacious style. At one point he dismissed the controversy that has swirled around him in recent days as "Mickey Mouse, tossed salad." In response to a question about whether he had hired a detective to shadow his children and check up on their friends, Mr. Perot said whatever he did was out of a desire to protect his children, adding, "It is a huge gap between making sure they're safe, and investigating my children and/or their friends, or whatever else some fruitcake alleges."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voices -- Chicago;
3 Views on the President's Domestic Record

 BODY:
Political experts, local officials and ordinary voters in several cities were asked to appraise George Bush's performance as President.
 
Andrew Sohn
36 years old; lawyer in a small Chicago firm
I think one of Bush's problems is you really can't point to a single domestic program that you can call an achievement. In a way, his neglect has been the most significant thing. As a few months pass and you get some sense of who this guy is, you see he has a distinctly right-wing, almost extreme conservative mindset. I was taken aback by how cool and harsh his opinions were. 
 I think he is basically a decent guy. I got into a lot of fights with some of my younger friends after the L.A. riots. They were trying to lay the blame at George Bush's feet, implying he had contempt for the poor. I don't think that's true. But he certainly doesn't have the ability to convey any compassion.
I don't think he's got the inner gift that either a Kennedy or a Reagan had. I didn't like Ronald Reagan, but he had a gift for conceptualizing issues and communicating them. Bush just doesn't have that.
 
Paul Green
49 years old; political scientist and director of the Institute for Public Policy at Governors State University
If the guy gets blamed for the economic recession, then we have to give him credit for defeating communism. [He has kept his promises] as well as any candidate. Campaigns are basically competing wish lists. Whether you like him or dislike him, he basically hasn't changed. He's what he said he would be. He has done as well as expected. He has basically done a satisfactory job.
No one should be surprised by the last four years. I think basically, it has been a continuation of the Reagan era. Basically, it's a suburbanized view of America; those people who are predominately white, middle-income, college-educated. Those are people who should benefit from the policies of the Reagan-Bush era, and basically they have.
If this election year was a referendum on foreign policy, George Bush would be a shoo-in. Unfortunately, other issues of this country have completely overshadowed that. The bottom line is, Where are you going to get the money and who are you going to spend it on?. You could spend a stealth bomber on any major city and you know what, you'll have marginal, if any, change.
 
Barbara McCollum
33 years old; a carpenter
With the Gulf war, he spent a lot of time and diverted a lot of money away from domestic issues that needed to be dealt with. I think he wanted to rally a lot of Americans or reinvent that feeling that America was No. 1. That was good.
But I think we need to work on things in this country. Like getting rid of drugs, cutting down the crime rate, creating jobs. I think going to war just diverted our energy away from those issues. We generated this nice, good feeling, but we wasted a lot of resources on the war.
The only two promises I can remember was that he would be the environmental President and that he would be the education President. I think the way he took such a hands-off approach to Exxon's polluting of Alaska showed he really wasn't the environmental President. And I don't think he has committed any extra resources to education, so he hasn't come through on that one either.
He is the kind of leader who says the right things but does nothing. He talks about the family and how important the family is, but there's no decent day care in this country. We don't have national health insurance. We haven't done anything to provide low-cost housing so young couples can get a place. That's supposed to be the American dream.
I think we need to be able to compete economically and it's more than just bashing people who buy Japanese cars. I don't think he is capable of coming off the sound bites and dealing with these issues."

HEADLINE: Most of Rail Network Shuts Down In Response to Strike at One Line

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
Most of the nation's freight railroads shut down yesterday in response to a limited strike against just one of them, and they immediately began urging Congress to step into the labor dispute by passing legislation imposing contract terms on recalcitrant unions throughout the industry.
Amtrak, the passenger railroad, was hobbled by the shutdown because most of its trains outside the Northeast run on lines owned by the idled freight railroads. But many of the nation's biggest commuter lines, including those in the New York area, were not greatly affected. 
 Still, tens of thousands of travelers were inconvenienced, and there remained a possibility that more passenger trains would be canceled after the next strike deadline, which one union set at 12:01 A.M. on Friday.
 
Accusation of Bad Faith
 The unions, which had granted most of the railroads a reprieve by offering to continue working and negotiating beyond the previous deadline of 12:01 A.M. on Wednesday, yesterday accused the freight railroads of bargaining in bad faith. Union officials said the railroads were effectively locking out workers nationwide in order to create an artificial emergency.
At a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which was considering whether Congress should legislate an end to the shutdown, the chief negotiator for the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, Jed Dodd, said, "What the carriers are doing is creating a national emergency out of a local strike so that this committee and the Congress imposes onerous agreements on our members."
That union went to Federal District Court in Washington yesterday seeking an order preventing the freight lines from locking its members out of work. A hearing was scheduled for today.
It was not clear how quickly Congress might act, if at all.
Lawmakers might simply order the railroads and their employees to resume operations under contract terms proposed by a Federal mediation panel before the talks broke down. But some members of Congress were said to favor a simple extension of the negotiating period, moving the strike deadline until later in the summer, perhaps after the political conventions.
In April 1991, Congress halted a rail strike 17 hours after it began and imposed contracts similar to those that had been recommended by a Federal mediating panel. The current dispute is a continuation of last year's.
The nationwide shutdown began early yesterday the International Association of Machinists set up pickets shortly after midnight against the CSX Corporation, one of many railroads with which the machinists had been negotiating.
 
The Railroads' Argument
 The railroads argued that the nation's freight lines formed a "seamless" system that could not properly function if a big piece like the 33,601 miles of track owned by CSX, the nation's third-largest railroad, was removed from service.
"Freight is lost, freight is delayed, freight is backed up," the Association of American Railroads said in a statement. "Rather than grind to a halt over a 24-hour period, attempting to make connections and failing to serve the shipping public, the railroads thought it in the interest of their customers and the public to promptly notify them as to the effect the I.A.M. strike would have almost immediately."
As the day wore on, there were mounting strains on the transportation system and the manufacturing base.
"The Council of Economic Advisers' best estimate is that the economy will lose about a billion dollars every day the strike continues," said Michael Boskin, head of the White House economic office.
Although several railroads continued to try to provide normal service, at least over shorter distances, in the face of problems switching cars to other lines, the majority were in the process of shutting down.
The machinists union said it picketed relatively few locations of CSX, a railroad that was made the union's target because its routes are largely duplicated by those of other carriers.
"There is no reason that one passenger or one ounce of freight cannot be carried on the nations' railroads, except for the irresponsible behavior of the freight carriers," John F. Peterpaul, the machinists' vice president, said in a written statement.
But the railroads said they always bargain as a group to avoid a single member from being isolated and forced to capitulate, at which point other railroads would be struck one at a time.
"Employers in a multi-employer bargaining group must shut down in defense of their struck member of the group, not solely to protect the struck member but also to protect the bargaining group itself from the ultimate result of exorbitant and costly settlements," the railroad association said.
 
Warnings From Manufacturers
 Thomas Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, said on ABC's "Good Morning America" program that if the shutdown continued beyond 24 hours, about of quarter of the plants making cars or their components would begin to be effected. "With a week, the industry could effectively be shut down," Mr. Hanna said.
But a spokesman for the General Motors Corporation, which gets a quarter of its parts by rail, said customers would not feel any immediate effects since dealers have several weeks of cars on hand waiting to be sold.
Food-industry executives and analysts said that they did not expect the rail shutdown to have a significant impact on the manufacture and delivery of food products in the near future.
In recent years the industry has increasingly turned to trucks to carry food. For example, Kraft General Foods Inc. expects only a few shipments to be disrupted.
Officials of the Ferro Corporation, a maker of coatings, plastics and specialty chemicals based in Cleveland, said a rail shutdown would have to last nearly a month to affect the company's supply and distribution patterns.
Transportation Secretary Andrew H. Card Jr., urging Congress to legislate an end to the shutdown, said in Congressional testimony that he had been told of a Texas plastics maker that would end normal production after one or two days, and of a New Jersey chemical company whose clients would have to shut down in two days because the chemical company could no longer supply them with vital chlorine.
Although there was some disruption to passenger travel, it did not seem to be as severe as had been feared in the last few days of bargaining.
Tom Clancy, the writer of popular thrillers, was briefly stuck in Salt Lake City with a party of family and friends who were traveling by Amtrak on a private car to Las Vegas. They rented a van and continued on their way yesterday morning.
But in Orlando, Fla., a vacationing Briton named Iain Bebbington said he did not know how he would get to New York for his flight home on Saturday. Amtrak trains in Florida rely on CSX track and dispatchers and were not running. Mr. Bebbington's rail pass, mostly used up, did not have enough remaining value for him to get a refund from Amtrak to pay the air fare to New York, but he did have the option of a 22-hour trip on a Greyhound bus.
In the Boston area, Amtrak maintained commuter service to about 70,000 people who ride trains into the city from the North and South Shores, although many thousands chose to drive to work instead because of the uncertainty.

Chart: "Empty Tracks: Behind the Rail Dispute"
 The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, representing 7,800 workers at 40 freight railroads went on strike against one line, the CSX Corporation. Other freight lines then shut down, saying the strike against CSX left them no choice. The Brotherhood of Maintenance ofWay Employees, representing 2,000 workers at Amtrak and Conrail, said they would not strike until at least 12:01 A.M. Friday while talks continue. These are the two main rail unions in the negotiations.
 The railroads have offered the same basic wages and work rules that Congress imposed last year.
 
The main issues besides wages involve:
 * Contracting out of work and reducing crew sizes. The railroads argue that they need the cuts to operate more efficiently. Unions have already lost hundreds of jobs to the cuts.
 * Health benefits. The railroads want to pay a smaller share.
 * Collective bargaining. The unions are concerned that the railroads are avoiding real bargaining by halting operations and then asking Congress to intervene and impose a settlement. The railroads are concerned that any agreement with the two main unions that differ from those imposed on the other unions last year could make the other unions dissatisfied.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Economic Plan;
Darman Crunches, Then Criticizes, Clinton and Perot Numbers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
Richard G. Darman, President Bush's budget director, began hacking away today at two new targets: the deficit-cutting proposals made by Ross Perot and Gov. Bill Clinton.
Joining in an accelerating round of attacks by Administration officials, Mr. Darman ridiculed the proposals of Mr. Bush's two likely opponents in the Presidential campaign, saying they lacked specifics and would do little to reduce the $400 billion annual deficit. 
 In a rare bit of partisanship during a briefing for reporters today, Mr. Darman said the economic proposals of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Perot did not address what he described as the main issue driving up the deficit: rapidly rising health-care costs.
 
Where the Two Seek Savings
 To reduce the deficit, Mr. Perot has said he would cut $180 billion in waste and fraud and has called on Germany and Japan to contribute $100 billion more a year toward their own defense.
In an economic plan he presented on Sunday, Governor Clinton proposed increasing taxes by $150 billion over the next four years, affecting mostly the richest 2 percent of the population and foreign corporations with operations in the United States. He also called for $140 billion in savings by trimming the Federal bureaucracy and slashing the military budget.
Mr. Darman said the two plans would achieve far smaller savings than the Democratic and independent candidates envisioned, asserting that neither man gave details on how he would carry out the cuts.
"Neither approach is serious; neither will do," he said.
 
Poor Arithmetic, He Says
 Mr. Darman questioned Mr. Perot's suggestion that Japan and Germany shoulder far more of their own military costs to reduce the Pentagon's burden of stationing troops overseas. He asked whether the United States would be better off if those nations re-armed.
He ridiculed Mr. Perot's proposal to save $20 billion by having rich people forego Social Security and Medicare benefits. Mr. Darman said that to achieve that level of savings, every Social Security recipient in a household with an income of more than $50,000 would have to give up benefits.
He said that if billionaires like Mr. Perot were to give up their benefits, it would save just $110,000 a year.
In speeches and television appearances, Mr. Perot has said that he is still studying many budget issues. But he asserted that by using his business experience and sophisticated management techniques, he was sure he could lop billions of dollars of waste from the budget.
Late this evening, James Squires, the Perot campaign press secretary, said Mr. Perot would not comment immediately but planned a more comprehensive economic proposal soon.
 
Sharper Attack on Clinton
 Mr. Darman said Mr. Clinton's plan was more intellectually serious than Mr. Perot's sketchy proposals, but he reserved most of his fire for the Arkansas Governor.
He criticized Mr. Clinton's plan for failing to spell out how it would save $5.7 billion by making Pentagon procurement more efficient and how it would save $4 billion by reforming the management of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government agency that is managing the bailout of the savings and loan industry.
The Clinton plan "has been contrived strictly for media consumption," Mr. Darman said. "Strictly analyzed, it is transparently a phony." He said the plan would cut the deficit by only $10 billion a year.
Mr. Darman also said the plan was vague in explaining how it would hold down Medicare and Medicaid costs.
"The principal reason the plan fails is it ignored the heart of the Federal budget, the rapidly growing mandatory part of the budget," he said.
Robert J. Shapiro, a top economic adviser to Mr. Clinton, responded angrily to Mr. Darman's comments. "It's hard to take Mr. Darman's plan seriously after he presided over the three largest deficits in American history," Mr. Shapiro said.
He said that Governor Clinton's plan included substantial investment in education and in capital development like rail lines, "and pays for every penny of it with spending cuts."
"If the Reagan and Bush administrations had followed this rule, we'd have no budget deficit," he added.
Mr. Shapiro, who is vice president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a research group based in Washington, said controlling Medicare and Medicaid costs must be part of a wholesale reform of the health-care sector, and he said Mr. Clinton would soon issue a comprehensive health plan.
 
Everyone Loves Education
 Mr. Darman had some kind words, however, for Governor Clinton's call to improve education and job training, develop civilian technologies and spend more on public projects like restoring roads and bridges. But he said Mr. Clinton had borrowed many of those ideas from the Bush Administration.
Mr. Clinton's plan calls for spending $200 billion more over four years on education and capital development.
Mr. Darman was preceded by two other senior economic officials in the Bush Administration in his criticism of Governor Clinton's budget proposals.
Appearing on Fox Television's Morning News on Tuesday, Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, also tore into the Clinton plan. "Basically he's got a $150 billion tax increase to finance $220 billion for new spending with a bunch of putative savings which, when you look at them, kind of evaporate," he said.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady went on the attack on Monday. In a statement, he said, "If you want to decrease jobs, increase taxes -- particularly on small-business men and women -- discourage savings and investment, fuel the engine of big government and drive away foreign investment, this is the perfect plan."

HEADLINE: THE ISRAELI VOTE;
Baker Asks Resumption of Talks Shortly After Rabin Takes Office

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d called today for a quick resumption of Middle East peace talks once the new Labor-led Israeli Government takes office, as many American officials and Jewish organizations quietly expressed relief at the demise of the hard-line Likud Government.
Although most Jewish organizations issued only standard public congratulations to Yitzhak Rabin for his victory in Tuesday's election, in private many of them expressed both relief and joy. The Likud Government's hard-line policies, including its refusal to halt settlement building in the occupied territories, had often forced American Jewish organizations into the nerve-racking choice they hate most: having to choose between supporting the policies of the President and the policies of the Israeli Government. 
 "Neither American politicians nor American Jews feel comfortable in a state of constant conflict with the Israelis, and that has been the case to some degree since the 1982 Lebanon war, and was really accelerated under the last Likud Government," said Steven L. Spiegel, a historian of the American-Israel relationship at the University of California at Los Angeles.
 
'Self-Fulfilling Prophecy'
 "Now there is more than a sigh of relief out there," Mr. Spiegel said. "American officials and American Jews are now so convinced that life will be easier under Rabin, that it is going to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. He will really have to work to mess it up. Likud had its stalwarts in the American Jewish community, but the overwhelming majority wanted Rabin to win this election. It is more than relief that people are expressing -- it is a sense that our Israeli friends are back."
No doubt, said Mr. Spiegel, even under a more moderate Rabin Government there are certain to be tensions between Israel and the United States over specific policy issues, but they start out with much more in common than was the case with the Likud and the Bush Administration. Even after the honeymoon is over, the chances for a reasonably "normal" United States-Israel relationship are now much greater, he said.
Michael Lerner, editor of the liberal Jewish journal Tikkun Magazine, said: "Many American Jews are rejoicing today. I think the Bush Administration should be proud of itself. It helped to create the political conditions for this outcome, by giving Israel some clear-cut options: either halt settlements and enter into serious negotiations with the Arabs, or lose the economic and political support of the United States."
 
Bush Invitation Expected
 Not all officials of Jewish organizations were ready to go quite that far in their praise for the Administration, but there was certainly a consensus that the change of leadership in Israel should pave the way for a fresh start between the Bush team and the Israeli Government, and between the Bush Administration and American Jews. President Bush is widely expected to invite Mr. Rabin to visit him in Washington or at his summer home of Kennebunkport, Me., this summer.
Thomas A. Dine, executive director of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, the most prominent pro-Israel lobby, said Israel was the only country in the Middle East capable of making such a profound political change in its government through the democratic process.
"The next step," Mr. Dine said, "is to put the U.S-Israel relationship back on track and solve the problem of the loan guarantees to end the crisis of absorbing the Russian and Ethiopian immigrants."
Mr. Baker told reporters today that he hoped the next round of bilateral negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors could take place "just as soon as it is conveniently possible in the aftermath of the formation of a new Israeli Government."
 
4 Rounds of Talks
 Israel, the Palestinians and the Arab countries have held four rounds of peace talks in Washington since their direct negotiations began last October,with the American-brokered Madrid peace conference. The most recent session ended in early April, with the various parties having nothing but procedural agreements to show for their efforts.
Mr. Baker, however, declined to be drawn into any predictions about the still pending Israeli request for $10 billion in loan guarantees to help absorb Russian immigrants. Israel postponed the request in March, after refusing to meet the Bush Administration's condition that it freeze all new settlement building in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Clinton Asks Executives to Accept His Economic Plan

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton asked manufacturers and business people today to buy his new plan for restoring the country's economic health, including his proposals for increases in corporate taxes and cuts in executive pay.
"It is clearly time to reassess and change our policies and face reality," the Arkansas Governor and presumed Democratic Presidential nominee told business executives attending a meeting here of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
 The association members, many of them Republicans and many of them major figures in the nation's business community, took Mr. Clinton's suggestions about higher taxes and lower pay in straight-faced silence.
 
Applause for Some Proposals
 But the business leaders vigorously applauded some of his other proposals for restoring health to the economy, including his calls for welfare reform, tax credits for the working poor and heavy investment in the nation's schools and deteriorating highway and communication systems.
Further, they applauded Mr. Clinton when he called on them to demand economic plans from President Bush, who will be the Republican nominee, and Ross Perot, the Texas business tycoon who is expected to announce an independent Presidential candidacy soon.
"Tell George Bush and Ross Perot that you want to know what they would do," Mr. Clinton all but shouted as he neared the end of his speech. Then he flashed a grin.
Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the group, said in introducing Mr. Clinton that there were many things in Mr. Clinton's new plan that both pleased and disturbed manufacturers. But the most important thing about the plan, he said, was that it constituted a "specific" on which to begin a national debate about how to restore the nation's economic health.
"We applaud you," he told Mr. Clinton.
The Governor released his sweeping plan last weekend with the hope that it would help him better define his candidacy and lift him out of last place in the polls. The plan calls for tax and spending changes that would cut the deficit in half by 1996 but at the same time provide money for a major renovation of the nation's education, transportation and communication systems.
On Monday, Mr. Clinton received several rounds of loud applause when he presented his plan to the United States Conference of Mayors in Houston. Since then, he has made headlines pushing the plan in press interviews and on television talk shows.
There has been almost as much criticism of his proposals, particularly from Republicans, as there has been applause. But he has been almost universally praised for coming forth with a specific plan while Mr. Bush and Mr. Perot have remained silent.
In his speech today, Mr. Clinton said that the Republican approach to economics over the past decade was "dead wrong" because it was based on the premise that if taxes on the wealthy and well-to-do were reduced, the money left in their hands would eventually "trickle down" to the poor and less-well-to-do.
 
'Rebuilding America'
 "The result is that Americans are now working harder for less," the Governor said. "We are falling behind every year. We've got to focus on rebuilding America. This would be the best money we've ever spent."
Rather than cut taxes for the wealthy and big corporations, he added, tax breaks should be given to poor and middle-class families. They would then spend the resulting savings and the economy would pick up, he said.
"We will get the money back," he assured the manufacturing executives.
Mr. Clinton asserted that his economic plan would "put America back to work" and make it once more the most respected power on earth, not just militarily but also economically.
He added: "If you don't want somebody who will stay up late and get up early to try to figure out what to do with health insurance costs, the bureaucracy, administrative costs and making us competitive with the people of Europe and Asia, then don't vote for me."

HEADLINE: Congress or Bush Could Act, but Neither Is Eager

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
As railroads across the country slowed to a halt today, the Bush Administration and Congressional Democrats each demanded that the other take some urgent action to resolve a bitter, longstanding dispute between railroad unions and management.
Congress halted the last rail strike, in April 1991, after 17 hours, but this time lawmakers did not rush to jump into contract negotiations that mediators had been unable to resolve after more than two years. 
 "It is my sense that Congress is very uncomfortable in the role of picking winners and losers in labor disputes," said Representative Al Swift, Democrat of Washington, as he opened a marathon hearing on the railroad strike by the House Commerce Subcommittee on Transportation and Hazardous Materials.
 
'Congress Must Act'
 The subcommittee's first witness, Transportation Secretary Andrew H. Card Jr., cast Congress squarely in that role and argued that the nation's economic well-being was at stake.
"Today the stoppage has already exacted a serious toll," Mr. Card said. "Consequences flow from the first day of a disruption. Tomorrow the price paid will be much higher. Therefore, Congress must act today."
Democrats draw much of their support from labor unions; Republicans are usually allied with management. Rather than taking action and possibly alienating powerful constituencies in an election year, both sides spent the day airing disagreements on possible solutions as well as the causes and severity of the shutdown.
During one of the few moments in the hearing devoted to practical solutions to the shutdown, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, listed several options that Congress might consider if it decided to enter the dispute. They ranged from demanding a new cooling off period to imposing specific contracts on the unions and the railroads. In between were various forms of mediation and legislation that could impose aspects of a settlement while leaving others to future negotiation or mediation.
After the hearing, senior members of both parties in the House and Senate met to discuss several competing proposals for legislative action. While several lawmakers emphasized that no consensus had been reached, they said any agreement could lead to a vote as soon as Thursday.
The possible actions that the Administration could take include public or private "jawboning" by the President urging a settlement, and a request by the Attorney General to the Interstate Commerce Commission seeking an order that the railroads not being struck resume operation.
 
'The Trains Have Stopped'
 With every response to a question, Mr. Card said the Administration had diligently implemented provisions of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, which provide for various forms of mediation but to no avail.
"All I can tell you is that the trains have stopped," became a kind of refrain from Mr. Card.
Throughout the day the top officials of both the unions and the railroads sat in the cavernous hearing room on Capitol Hill, each awaiting a turn to address the subcommittee.
At 12:01 A.M. today the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers called a strike against CSX Transportation, a major freight carrier. Then, in the early hours of the morning 38 other railroads initiated a lockout against the machinists, effectively shutting down the nation's freight rail system.
Two other unions agreed to extend negotiations for 48 hours with Conrail, a freight carrier, and Amtrak, the Federally subsidized passenger carrier.
As a result of Congress's action last year and other Federal mediation efforts, the unions and the railroads have agreed on contracts covering 200,000 rail workers, more than 90 percent of the total. Union leaders representing the 20,000 workers involved in the current dispute insist that further Federal intervention would deny them the chance to let the collective bargaining process play itself out.
The potential political costs to Congressional Democrats was described bluntly by Jed Dodd, chief negotiator for the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees in contract talks with Conrail and Amtrak.
"Congress has a choice of either being a union buster or of respecting the democratic rights of American railway workers," Mr. Dodd said in an interview this afternoon.
Congress has taken various actions to intervene in rail labor disputes 17 times since 1963, but key Democrats said today that the situation was different this time because of the freight railroads' collective response to the machinists' strike against one company.

HEADLINE: Durables Orders Post First Big Drop of Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
New orders for durable manufactured goods fell 2.4 percent in May, the first significant decline this year, the Commerce Department reported today.
Analysts had been expecting orders to rise and expressed disappointment at the results, although many economists found the report only mildly disturbing. They noted that this series was subject to large swings and that orders fell just six-tenths of 1 percent when military orders are excluded. 
 Still, a big drop in military hardware was accompanied by declines for 9 of 10 major industry groups. And backlogs of unfilled orders skidded for the ninth straight month, to the lowest level in three years. Shipments, which had climbed during the first three months of 1992, fell 1 percent.
The data fanned speculation that the Federal Reserve would decide, perhaps at a policy meeting next week, to push down short-term interest rates yet again in an effort to support the economic recovery. President Bush called for such action on Tuesday.
"It is still consistent with a growth story, but with equal emphasis on the sluggishness of that growth," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist for the First Boston Corporation, of the report on durables.
One relative bright spot was a 1.4 percent increase in orders for civilian capital goods, which account for one-quarter of the $119.5 billion durable orders total. This followed a 7.1 percent decline in April for this bellwether category.
Nevertheless, the bond market appeared buoyed by the figures, which tended to support the notion that the recovery, rather than gaining momentum, might be weakening. Or as Thomas W. Synnott 3d, chief economist for the United States Trust Company, put it, business conditions are at least "ambiguous enough" for the Federal Reserve to act.
 
Gains in April and March
 The 2.4 percent, or $3 billion, decline in May orders for long-lived goods as diverse as dishwashers and military tanks followed gains of 1.9 percent in April and 2.1 percent in March. The biggest factor was a 27.7 percent drop in military equipment, which more than wiped out a 20.7 percent April advance.
Apart from the stone, clay and glass products category, all major groups posted declines, the largest being 6.2 percent for transportation equipment, both military and civilian. Instruments and related products and electronic machinery also had substantial declines.
Unfilled orders, a widely followed forecaster of business conditions, fell $2.7 billion, or six-tenths of 1 percent, last month.
Weakness in this area -- the latest rise in backlogs was in August -- "means that factories will meet increased demand with overtime and not new jobs," said Lawrence A. Hunter of the United States Chamber of Commerce. Further declines, he added, could cause "new temporary layoffs."
Today's report also showed that shipments of durable goods fell 1 percent, or $1.2 billion, after being unchanged in April and averaging gains of 1.9 percent for January through March. The biggest decline was a 1.4 percent drop for transportation equipment.
New orders last month were 3.6 percent above the level of May 1991, while unfilled orders over this period fell 4.5 percent.
Today's report included revisions for each series that benchmarked data to the 1989 and 1990 annual survey of manufactures and included late-arriving figures, corrections and changes in the methodology for adjusting data for variations in the number of trading days in reporting periods.
Analysts said the revisions had little effect on the pattern of durables orders over the last year.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Rudderless In the Recession

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THE numbers say the recession is over. But with the latest polls showing that 78 percent of registered voters disapprove of President Bush's economic performance, it is plain that Americans aren't listening. Why, then, is candidate Bush confining his economic maneuvers to jawboning the Federal Reserve for easier credit?
The short answer is that even if Washington had the will to stimulate the economy quickly, it lacks the way. "The next six months," notes Neal Soss of First Boston, "are baked in the cake." 
 The long answer is more interesting. Many analysts believe that even a timely dose of stimulus -- say, a tax cut early in 1992 -- would not have made much difference. They argue that the economic rules have changed, that the humongous budget deficits and other structural weaknesses inherited from the 1980's -- everything from the savings and loan debacle to the real estate bust -- have blunted the impact of traditional policy weapons.
Worse, perhaps, from Mr. Bush's perspective, four years of economic wallow have undermined the public's confidence that all bad things must come to an end. And this collective gloom could prove self-fulfilling, as both consumers and businesses hunker down for survival in the frosty economic climate of the 90's.
Yes, there really is a recovery out there somewhere. Production has been edging up since the spring of 1991, and almost every forecaster is predicting 3 percent annual growth through 1993.
Three percent would be fine, if not dandy, were the economy already running near capacity. But 3 percent is only half the pace enjoyed in the early months of previous postwar recoveries. And with recession-battered businesses fighting to stay lean, the benefits are barely trickling down: Robert Reischauer of the Congressional Budget Office reports that "we are only doing a little better than treading water" in the job-creation department.
The obvious conclusion -- a hindsight special -- is that the President blew it. Mr. Bush's advisers never imagined that the shallow recession would last so long, or cause such grief to white-collar suburbanites. If they had, the White House might have made a deal early on with Congress to cut taxes, and perhaps to give cash-starved states a shot of the green. At very least, Mr. Bush would have screamed for the Fed to cut interest rates faster and further.
All this assumes that Congressional Democrats could have been persuaded to save President Bush's bacon, and that the fiscal hawks to the President's right would have gone along with a bigger deficit. It also assumes that the economy would have responded according to Hoyle.
Would consumers have rushed to spend the tax windfall? Would businesses have rushed after them, expanding capacity and rebuilding depleted inventories?
Perhaps. But it is also possible that a temporary break with budget discipline would have been widely interpreted as a permanent break. And this would probably have generated expectations of higher inflation, raising long-term interest rates and fears of a monetary crunch down the road. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, whose friendship with the President reportedly gives him enormous influence over policy, has argued that tax and spending measures would have had less than zero effect, frightening business so much that total private spending would have fallen.
A safer route to re-election bliss might have been through more aggressive expansion of the money supply. And indeed, the President is now making no secret of his irritation with the Fed's caution. But here, too, there were potholes galore.
The Fed certainly had the power to pour loanable funds into the economy. But it could not guarantee that big lenders, the banks, insurers and commercial credit companies that have been bloodied by losses in real estate, would have made the cash available to less-than-blue-chip borrowers. Nor could the Fed have prevented a possible increase in long-term interest rates driven by inflation-wary financial markets, which would have partly offset the stimulus.
To frustrated supply-siders who have been shouldered aside by the President's old guard, the moral is simple: traditional remedies don't apply to nontraditional problems. "Uncle Sam is seen as General Motors to the fifth power," observes Lawrence Kudlow, the chief economist at Bear Stearns who served as an adviser to President Reagan. Thus the way to rebuild confidence in the economy (and Mr. Bush), the supply-siders say, is through dramatic initiatives -- Government layoffs, a spending freeze and wholesale privatization.
But Mr. Reischauer wonders why anyone would want to buy another set of policies from the good folks who stuck George Bush with the $400 billion budget deficit. "The circumstances that everybody warned would tie our hands are here," he concludes. And the only way out of the bind is to deal directly with the fiscal legacy of the Reagan years.

HEADLINE: House Panel Backs Enterprise Zones

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
The House Ways and Means Committee voted for a form of enterprise zones intended to spur the economy of 50 impoverished areas today, as it began work on a hodgepodge tax bill with elements of urban aid, tax relief for real estate and extensions of a variety of temporary preferences.
The committee quit work for the evening before reaching the sections intended to raise enough revenue to pay for the $14.4 billion in various cuts proposed by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the committee chairman. It is expected to complete action on Thursday. 
The enterprise-zone proposal was backed by the Democrats on the committee and opposed by the Republicans, who called the measure deficient because it did not free all capital gains earned in the poverty areas from taxation. The plan would exempt those gains from taxes only if they were reinvested in the enterprise zone.
 
Likely to Pass This Summer
 Enterprise zones, in some form, now seem likely to be enacted this summer. A goal of the Bush Administration and especially Housing Secretary Jack Kemp for several years, the idea has languished because of Congressional suspicion that they would do little real good for the poor urban or rural areas where they were situated.
But with the May rioting in Los Angeles, the capital suddenly felt the need to do something for the cities and revived interest in enterprise-zone proposals. The zones have been a key element of negotiations among Congressional leaders over urban legislation. Those talks have languished, as Democrats are seeking more job training money to go with the advantages for investors in the enterprise-zone proposals.
To keep things moving and provide a way of extending the expiring tax benefits, too, Mr. Rostenkowski decided to go ahead with a proposal of his own so the whole House could vote on something this month.
The Illinois Democrat's plan could well be modified, either before House action next week or in the Senate, where committee consideration is planned for the week of July 19.
Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, characterized Mr. Rostenkowski's plan today as "a bit of a sham," complaining about its capital-gains tax provision.
Mr. Rostenkowski's plan would allow 50 enterprise zones of up to 20 square miles to be established by 1996, half in urban and half in rural areas. They would have to have populations of at least 4,000, high poverty and unemployment rates, and a state and local government plan for economic development.
The chief benefit available to employers in a zone would be a credit against income taxes of 15 percent of the first $20,000 in annual wages (a maximum of $3,000) for employees who live in the zone. Businesses in the zone would also be allowed to treat as ordinary expenses up to $20,000 a year in what would otherwise be depreciation on business property. The limit under present law is $10,000. And investors would be allowed to take ordinary loss deductions on enterprise-zones businesses.
 
Republican Alternative Killed
 The committee debated the plans behind closed doors and announced later that a Republican alternative, offered by Representative Bill Archer of Texas, was defeated, 23 to 13, on a straight party-line vote.
Mr. Archer's plan did not specify how many zones could be created, but he said the total could be about 300. His plan would have allowed zones to be designated until the Administration estimated the cost at $2.5 billion over five years.
Since the five-year cost of the Rostenkowski proposal was estimated by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation at $2.5 billion, Mr. Archer appeared to be counting on sympathetic cost estimating by the White House Office of Management and Budget.
 
2 Ways of Measuring Poverty
 His proposal allowed designations of enterprise zones by somewhat different poverty formulas than those used by Mr. Rostenkowski. Zones could have as few as 1,000 residents in rural areas.
The main engine of the Republican plan was that no capital gains taxes would be due on tangible or intangible investments in an enterprise zone. It would also allow tax credits of up to $1,800 a year to some employees of zone businesses. And it would permit expensing of up to $50,000 of business investment.
Only one provision was common to both the Rostenkowski and Archer proposals. Both would allow ordinary loss deductions for investment in the zones.
After the enteprise zone votes, the committee moved on to the job-training front, raising from 60 to 90 percent the Federal share of the costs of some state job-training programs.
Two other measures intended to help distressed urban areas involved making permanent tax breaks that have been extended at 6- or 12-month intervals for many years. They were credits for investment in low-income housing and for employment of disadvantaged youths.
Provisions allowing governmental units to issue mortgage revenue bonds and bonds for small manufacturing operations were also voted by the committee.
Among the important measures in his plan that were intended to help pay for the $14 billion cost were a $5,000 limit on the deductibility of moving expenses, which was expected to raise $3.5 billion over six years.
Two permanent extensions of current temporary tax-law provisions, which would require higher estimated tax payments by individuals and corporations, were expected to raise $6.2 billion. A change in the way securities dealers must account for certificates they hold would raise $2.5 billion.
Another $1.4 billion would be raised by a provision making permanent certain temporary estate-tax rates scheuled to expire in 1994.
Those provisions and a change in taxation rules making it easier for real estate investors to claim losses, a measure very popular in Congress, were expected to be dealt with on Thursday.
Before the committee went home tonight, it also voted temporary extensions of several other tax breaks now scheduled to expire on July 1.
It voted 18-month extensions of the credits for research and experimentation, and employer-provided educational assistance.
It voted to continue for 18 months the exemption from the alternate minimum tax for charitable gifts of appreciated property, and the exemption of up to $70 worth of employer premiums for group legal services programs.
The committee voted only a six-month extension of the provision allowing the self-employed to deduct 25 percent of the cost of health-insurance premiums. It expects to address this issue again later in the summer when it considers broader health-care measures.

HEADLINE: Mexico Stocks Down Sharply

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 24

 BODY:
Mexican stocks took their second-biggest fall of the year today, which analysts attributed to a rise in domestic interest rates.
The Bolsa Price Index ended down 65.78 points, or 4 percent, at 1,562.71. 
 Traders said the rise in rates for the bellwether 28-day Mexican Treasury bill to 16.50 percent, the year's high at auction, caused investors to sell.
Continued doubts about the free-trade accord by Mexico, Canada and the United States also hurt the market. There were also fears about how the Telmex union will vote to deal with its 2.9 percent stake in the telephone company.
Volume was a light 69 million shares. Some 89 issues traded, of which 72 fell, 5 rose and 12 were unchanged.
The previous record drop of the year was on June 17, when the Bolsa fell 5.89 percent, or 99.71 points.
The L series of Telefonos de Mexico fell 4.31 percent, while its A shares dropped 3.94 percent.

HEADLINE: Facing Life After Alexander's;
Retail Workers Look to the Future With Hope and Fear

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VALLEY STREAM, L.I., June 23

 BODY:
The employees of Alexander's department store gathered for their farewell supper around the long narrow tables at Tony Roma's, a mile down the road from the discount store where many of them had worked since it opened in 1967. Over spareribs and potatoes, they exchanged hugs and phone numbers, and a certain grim view of the future.
There was Maureen Murphy, 41 years old and single, who had started working in the store before Christmas 25 years ago and never left. Now, she feared more than anything losing her home in Rosedale, Queens, just seven years shy of paying off the mortgage. 
 There was Ronald Alexander, 29, who laughed with the long-haired beauty from the camera department and wondered whether they would still be together in six months. He'd worked in Alexander's during high school, traveled to Germany with the Army, and came back to a job in the stockroom.
Alexander's has not announced when its 11 stores will close, but the death of the 65-year-old department-store chain is hurling 5,600 employees into an unwelcome job market in a field hit hard by an unforgiving recession.
 
Impact on the Retail Industry
 While talk of unemployment often focuses on the loss of factory jobs, the recession has had an even greater impact on the wholesale and retail industry. Since 1988, according to the State Labor Department, New York City and the surrounding counties have lost more than 171,000 jobs in the wholesale and retail industry, falling to 890,000 from 1,061,600.
"It's the No. 1 source of decline during the past several years," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, New York regional commissioner at the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "We've never seen a recession take this kind of a toll in the service industry."
Retailing tends to employ a large number of workers at either end of the age spectrum. The older workers at Alexander's, many of them part timers, are too young to retire but fear no one will hire them. They are terrified of losing severance pay, pensions and other benefits they had counted on to ease them into retirement.
The young, for whom unemployment is now at its highest level in 25 years, also wonder if they will be able to find jobs, even if they try new fields, though some are excited about the challenge.
"The employees of Alexander's are going to be competing in a labor market that is very difficult for new entries," said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Urban Research Center. Statewide, unemployment last month was 7.9 percent. "There could be no worse time to add to the labor supply than right now," Mr. Moss said.
If they are entering a job market that is all but lifeless, the employees at Valley Stream are leaving a store that each day descends further from the tidy divisions they once tended into retail hell.
Scrawled signs announce that the third and fourth floors are closed to customers. The second floor is a grab bag of appliances scattered around the escalator. The first floor is mayhem: women's skirts and artificial flowers in the men's department, patio umbrellas in lingerie, boxes torn open and the parts of lamps and fans strewn about, stuffed animals with the eyes pulled out.
"I still can't believe that it's gone," Ms. Murphy said. "I walk through the store devastated. Customers just come in to say goodbye, not even to buy things."
When Ms. Murphy began at Alexander's, she was a high school student of 16 picking up extra cash around Christmas. Her supervisor, pleased with her work, recommended that she stay on. She never left.
She progressed swiftly at Alexander's to become manager of the women's dress department before she was 20. "It's like a family-oriented type of store," she said, and glanced at her co-workers, laughing and putting their arms around one another's shoulders at the dinner tables. "You see how it is."
A trim woman in a button-down shirt and pants, short hair brushed back in a no-nonsense cut, Ms. Murphy has so far gone on two job interviews: tense encounters relieved only by the sympathy of the recruiters. "They know the situation with Alexander's, that it wasn't your fault," she said.
Ms. Murphy and other employees began to suspect the store would go bankrupt after Christmas, when the receiving department screeched to a standstill. But they thought bankruptcy would be a gentler matter, involving the closing of a few stores or a reorganization of the company's debt. None expected the entire chain to fall. In a sense, Mr. Moss of N.Y.U. said, Alexander's was the retail equivalent of the post office, offering flexibility, opportunities to advance within the company and above all, job security.
Ms. Murphy now worries about paying her bills and making her mortgage, but she hopes to avoid taking a job in desperation. For her, strength came in what she remembers as, simply, "the call," from her older brother in Pennsylvania.
"He said everything right: 'I'm here. Whatever you need, don't worry,' " Ms. Murphy remembered. " 'Sometimes things work out for the best.' "
She is thinking of leaving the retail trade, which no longer offers the security it once did, and considers retraining for a career in medicine, an avocation until now. At the Rosedale Volunteer Ambulance Corps, she is known as Lieutenant Murphy.
"That's something I enjoy doing," she said, "and with retailing being so iffy, you want to make sure the job you take is secure enough that you don't have to worry where your next check is coming from." She does not know how long her resolve will last.
"I'm trying to have a positive attitude," Ms. Murphy said. "As long as I have my health and can get by, I leave it all in God's hands."
 
Nearing the End Of a First Job
 As a high school student from nearby Rosedale, Queens, Ronald Alexander's first job was working in the receiving room at the Valley Stream store. He stayed there two years. In his 20's, he joined the Air Force, dabbled in college and traveled. And then he returned home to Alexander's, where the same man who had hired him as a teen-ager offered him another job.
Mr. Alexander had hoped to build a career at Valley Stream, where his hourly wage rose to $6.50, from $5.25, in just the year since his return. His boss affectionately refers to him as "my son," and Mr. Alexander, who is 30, once hoped to become store director just like him.
"It's my family," Mr. Alexander said. "My first job, and I'm closing the store."
Mr. Alexander has interviewed with other retailers, like Caldor and A & S, that have come to recruit at Alexander's. He has no way of gauging his prospects.
"Out here, you got 300 people going for the same job and they're all qualified," Mr. Alexander lamented. "It's luck, really."
His sweetheart from the camera department, who did not want to be identified, seemed undisturbed by the closing. She is studying to be a pharmacist and expects to look for an internship at a pharmacy after summer school.
Mr. Alexander considers returning to school, but is ruling it out for the moment for lack of money. His real hope, he said, is to get a loan so he can open a convenience store or a liquor store between the Green Acres Shopping Mall and his home in Laurelton, Queens.
If that doesn't come through, Mr. Alexander is prepared to accept something else. His minimum requirement for a job: "I have to like it, at least a little bit."
 
A One-Two Punch Leads to Fear
 Gladys Cayea, a 15-year employee, is not given to self-pity. To beat the cancer that claimed half her stomach and left her with a lung tumor, she had to be tough. Now, she is scared.
More than the $100 she earned for 20 hours a week as a cashier, Mrs. Cayea counted on Alexander's for the medical benefits that saved her and her husband, Jack, from financial ruin during her illnesses.
In February, the retailer told employees it would no longer provide medical insurance. To continue the comprehensive coverage she had, Mrs. Cayea would have to pay $3,536 a year, nearly her entire net salary.
Now, she does not expect to find another job.
"Who's going to hire somebody that's going to be 64 years old?" she asked. "If I can manage the way I am, I'll collect unemployment and severance pay. We'll just have to make things work out."
She tries not to dwell on the tenuous road to October 1994, when she will turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare. Deep reflection brings anxiety, heart palpitations. "If I start thinking about what's going to happen, I get myself all worked up and nervous," she said. "I just take it as it comes along."
Jack Cayea served 33 months in the Army, fixing vehicles in Europe during World War II. He and Gladys married after his return and had two children. He worked as a produce manager at Bohack's until 1973, when the first of two heart bypass operations forced him to stop working at the age of 50.
There were good years. In 1964, the family moved here from Woodhaven, Queens. Two weeks each summer, they rented a cottage in Vermont.
At that time, Mr. Cayea said, he expected his retirement years to be free of these worries. "Sometimes things don't work out the way you want them to, but you have to take life the way it comes," he said.
 
Young, Unworried And Looking Ahead
 Zenia Sneed, 20, did not worry the day Alexander's announced its closing. She saw in it her escape to a new future. "I was going to leave one day, but that day wasn't coming fast enough for me," she said.
"But now it's sad," Lynette Smith broke in. Ms. Smith, 21, periodically tempered her younger friend's brazen declarations. "It'd survived the Depression, it'd been around forever."
"Yeah, on the news it said, 'Alexander's will be missed.' They made it real sad," Ms. Sneed said. "But to tell you the truth, I think people were ashamed to shop here. I'd see, whenever they'd have bags from A & S or Macy's, they'd put the Alexander's bag inside that, so it wouldn't show on the outside."
Ms. Sneed is finishing high school and hopes to collect unemployment benefits for the summer, then attend Brooklyn Technical College. She wants to be a police officer, preferably for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, because, she says, that is the safest branch of police work.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
At PPG the Worst Seems to Be Over

BYLINE: By Jonathan P. Hicks

 BODY:
BY last year, it seemed that the recession had finally caught up with PPG Industries, which makes Pittsburgh Paints and Lucite as well as glass, specialty chemicals and coatings for the auto and construction industries. After gliding through the tough terrain of business conditions in 1990 with record earnings, PPG saw its profits sag. By the fourth quarter of last year, the company's earnings plunged 42 percent from their level a year earlier and earnings for the entire year dropped to their lowest level since 1983.
But PPG's fortunes seem to have shifted, several industry analysts say, contending that the company already absorbed the biggest blow from the recession, in the last three months of 1991. In part, the improvement is the result of greater efficiency and the closing of high-cost operations, notably in glass making. But the greatest benefit has come from the slow, but steady improvement in the economy, which has increased the demand for automobiles, houses and office buildings that use the company's glass for windows. 
 "They have passed the bottom in most of their businesses," said Donald A. Pattison, an analyst with C. J. Lawrence. "On a year-to-year basis, all of their quarters from here on out will be up."
Indeed, the company, based in Pittsburgh, has already seen an increase in demand for glass and paint for new cars in North America so far this year. For the first quarter of this year, the company reported net income of $78.8 million, or 74 cents a share, compared with earnings of $96.7 million in the corresponding period last year. Adjusted for nonoperating items, the company had a 32 percent increase in first-quarter earnings, better than many analysts expected.
Many analysts contend that they are amazed that the company was not affected more severely by a recession that battered the automobile companies, while housing starts fell to their lowest level in nearly 20 years. "As a cyclical company, there is no escape from a recession," said Harvey Stober, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. "But if you look at what PPG makes and who buys it, it's incredible that their earnings were affected as little as they were."
Although PPG reported earnings of $276 million, or $1.90 a share, for last year, Mr. Stober pointed out that the company's earnings, excluding extraordinary charges, were $485 million, or $2.61 a share. "Compare that with some of the auto companies that were bleeding red ink," he said. "PPG is probably one of the best-run cyclical businesses in America today. If you look at their track record, they have provided, on average, total return to shareholders well in excess of 20 percent per year for the last 10 years."
The company's stock, which closed at $64.875, up 25 cents, yesterday, has recovered from its 52-week low of $50 at the end of the year.
Nearly 40 percent of PPG's sales are from the company's coatings and resins businesses, which make paints for vehicles, industrial finishes and consumer paints. Another 38 percent comes from glass for the construction industry and for cars. And 20 percent of the sales are from commodity and specialty chemicals.
Another important factor in the company's prospects has been the stabilizing of prices for flat glass, the product that eventually becomes windows in buildings and cars and trucks. The low prices have been the result of worldwide overcapacity in the last few years, which seems now to be easing. And after declining sharply over the last few years, prices have begun to stabilize.
Mr. Pattison forecasts that PPG's earnings will likely climb to $3.30 a share for this year, up from $1.90 for 1991. Meanwhile, Mr. Stober expects the company's earnings to climb to $3.70 a share.
While PPG is seeing improvement in many businesses, it is nonetheless wrestling with several problems. For one thing, its chemical business is expected to have slightly lower earnings this year because of higher natural gas prices. PPG is a leading producer of chemicals used in water treatment and paper production and vinyl plastics, and natural gas is used as a fuel in making chemicals. Also, pricing in the commodity chemical business remains highly competitive and prices have stayed low. PPG is a leading maker of chlorine and caustic soda, two building block chemical products: chlorine, which goes into everything from plastic to water purification systems, and caustic soda, which is used in a variety of manufacturing processes and household products.
And the economy in Europe, where PPG derives a quarter of its sales, has been lackluster. "In Europe, demand is still weak," said Douglas B. Atkinson, the company's director of investor relations. "It's not a disaster in Europe, but it's flat at best. We see things as probably bottoming out in Europe right now. That's going to be a 1993 recovery story."

HEADLINE: Violent Crime Drops 2 Percent; Total Crime Rises in New Jersey

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 24

 BODY:
For the first time since New Jersey began compiling statewide statistics on crime 25 years ago, the state recorded a decrease last year in each of four categories of violent crime -- homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.
The state's 15 largest cities continued to lead the list in the number of all crimes, but when the report compared where crime was rising fastest, suburban and rural areas led urban neighborhoods, according to a report released today. 
 The figures, released on the eve of the Legislature's planned vote on the state budget, immediately became enmeshed in the political fighting between the Democratic administration and the Republican legislative majority.
In a statement accompanying the report, Attorney General Robert J. Del Tufo said that the Republican budget proposal, especially $39.6 million in cuts to his department, "places in grave danger and jeopardy the physical and economic well-being of the citizens of New Jersey."
The Attorney General and Gov. Jim Florio also used the release of the report to renew the administration's attack on a Republican plan to repeal the state's ban on assault weapons.
 
421,663 Reported Offenses
 The Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, said Mr. Del Tufo's comments were politically motivated.
"I think he's wrong," Mr. DiFrancesco said. "I think he's saying that because the Governor's people think they have to scare people."
Overall, there were 421,663 reported criminal offenses in New Jersey in 1991, an increase over 1990 reports of less than one-half of 1 percent, according to the Uniform Crime Report, a tally of crime data from local, state and Federal police agencies.
That increase compared with an overall increase of 2 percent for the Northeast -- which includes the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont -- and a 3 percent increase nationwide.
While violent crimes increased by 5 percent nationwide, they decreased by 2 percent in New Jersey and by 1 percent in the Northeast as a whole. Nonviolent crime increased by one-half of 1 percent in New Jersey and decreased in the Northeast region at a similar pace. Nonviolent crime in the entire country increased by 2 percent.
"Our tough drug laws, gun laws and community policing initiative have clearly been a contributing factor in reducing the number of murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults," Mr. Del Tufo said.
Camden was the state's most crime-ridden city, followed by Newark, Jersey City, Trenton and Paterson. But overall, every category of crime decreased in urban areas from 1990.
With robberies and homicides showing the biggest increases, crime in suburban and rural areas increased in every category except for aggravated assault and motor vehicle theft.
Despite the overall 2 percent drop in violent crime, the state had the second-highest number of reported violent crimes since it began its Uniform Crime Report in 1967. There were 49,119 violent crimes reported last year, compared with the record 50,067 in 1990, the report said.
Motor vehicle thefts, assaults against police officers, and drug arrests decreased. Burglaries, larcenies, bias incidents and domestic violence all increased.
Officials expressed particular concern about an 18 percent increase in reported bias crimes -- from 824 in 1990 to 976 in 1991 -- and a 10 percent jump in the number of domestic violence offenses, 55,698, including 61 slayings.

Sales of U.S. Vehicles Rose 1.5% in Mid-June

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 24

 BODY:
The domestic auto industry extended its modest recovery from the recession with a slight gain in mid-June sales, industry figures showed today, but the strength came largely on demand for trucks and rental cars.
Sales rose 1.5 percent compared with the corresponding period a year earlier, but the gain masked a 4.8 percent drop in overall car sales, with sharper declines at General Motors and Chrysler. Ford Motor's sales, however, were notably strong. 
 Truck sales, which have been leading the rebound from the two-year downturn, were up 12.5 percent industrywide.
For the year to date, truck sales are up 15 percent and car sales up eight-tenths of 1 percent.
Makers reported selling 37,585 cars and trucks a day in the June 11-20 period, compared with 37,053 in the corresponding period last year. Both periods had nine selling days.
 
'I Think We're O.K. This Time'
 United States Commerce Department projections show a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for cars of 6.4 million. That was the same rate as a year earlier, the industry's worst since 1983.
"My biggest concern is we're starting that same upward spike that we had in June and July last year," said Joseph Phillippi, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York. "I'm hoping we're not looking at that same situation again where the bottom falls out. But I think we're O.K. this time."
Ford, the No. 2 auto maker, continued to pace the 10 companies that build vehicles in the United States, with car sales 9.9 percent higher and truck sales 12.4 percent higher in mid-June.
Ford said its car sales were helped by strong demand from rental-car fleets stocking up for a summer travel boom created by recent air-fare price wars. Rental companies are keeping cars beyond the standard six-month service period and taking early delivery of cars due in July.
 
6.9% Drop in Car Sales at G.M.
 The No. 1 auto company, G.M., reported a 6.9 percent decline in car sales, the second consecutive 10-day period in which sales trailed year-earlier levels after a strong late May. G.M. truck sales were up six-tenths of 1 percent.
G.M. has its stars, including the redesigned Pontiac Grand Am, which is especially popular because of a 3.9 percent interest rate for loans of up to 48 months and a new G.M. financing plan that lowers monthly payments and adds a balloon payment at the end of the contract.
Jim Druce, Pontiac sales manager at Red Holman Pontiac-GMC Truck-Toyota in Westland, Mich., said the Grand Am accounted for half of his sales in recent weeks.
 
Chrysler Buoyed by Truck Sales
 Chrysler car sales fell an estimated 17.4 percent, but sales of its bread-and-butter mini-vans and Jeeps led to 12.4 percent higher truck sales for the period. The No. 3 auto maker has extended its "National Mini-Van Sale" promotion through Aug. 31.
"People with more money are shopping," said John Casesa, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Company in New York. "And banks are showing an increasing willingness to make car loans."
Among so-called transplants -- Japanese makers with American factories -- Honda and Mazda reported car sales down 25.3 percent and 34.4 percent respectively. Nissan car sales were up 5.1 percent but truck sales were down 5.8 percent. Toyota car sales were up 2.1 percent.
Japan's nameplates built in this country have shown signs of weakness recently, reflecting price increases and the apparent effects of a "Buy American" movement that began spreading earlier this year.
Detroit's Big Three year-to-date vehicle sales are up 6.4 percent, compared with 3.2 percent for Japanese transplants.

Drop in Money Fund Yields Slowed Down in Last Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The declines in the yields of the money market funds monitored by The IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report eased considerably in the latest week.
But Walter S. Frank, the chief economist at Donoghue's, said he did not expect yields to adjust much more. "I don't see anything in the near term to put any pressure on the Fed to ease further," he said. 
 While the economic data show the recovery is not collapsing, they also show there is little life in the recovery. Mr. Frank said he thought the next clue might come in two weeks when the Government releases the employment report.
The seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt fund fell 9 basis points, to 2.44 percent, in the last week, while the simple yield was off the same amount, to 2.41 percent. In the same period, the lagging 30-day compounded average yield and simple yield were off by about 15 basis points, to 2.67 percent and 2.64 percent, respectively. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
The assets of tax-exempt funds were down by $800 million, to a total of $95.1 billion, significantly less than the $1.3 billion decline in the previous week.
Analysts at Donoghue's said the average number of days left to maturity of tax-exempt securities held in fund portfolios rose by two, to 55, showing managers were moving way out on the curve to pull in the higher yields.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-free yield is 3.38 percent; for those in the 31 percent tax bracket, it is 3.53 percent.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market funds, distributed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management of Milwaukee had the best return, with a yield of 3.27 percent.
 
Taxable Funds
 The assets of the taxable money funds declined by $1.3 billion, to $486.3 billion. Donoghue's said the institutional funds fell more than $1.6 billion, to $163.8 billion, while the assets of the retail funds rose $300 million, to $322.5 billion.
The average seven-day compounded and simple yields were both down 2 basis points, to 3.48 percent and 3.42 percent, respectively. Over 30 days, the compounded average is 3.51 percent, and the simple average is 3.45 percent, each down a basis point from the previous week. Analysts said the average days to maturity of securities in portfolios remained at 61.
The Dreyfus Basic Money Market Fund, which had the best return among the taxable funds the previous week, was joined last week by the Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series; both yielded 4.30 percent.
The average yield of bank money market accounts, the prime competitors of money funds, was unchanged at 3.36 percent.

HEADLINE: Loss Grows At French Store

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: PARIS, June 24

 BODY:
The chairman of Galeries Lafayette S.A., the French retailer, said the company's department store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan would lose substantially more in 1992 than the $3.6 million it lost in 1991.
Georges Meyer told analysts here today that the New York store probably would not be profitable even if the American economy picked up. 
 "Our goal isn't to make a profit, just to break even," Mr. Meyer said. The store is too small for Galeries Lafayette to operate profitably using management methods applied at the company's 17 stores in France, he added.
Mr. Meyer declined to specify the potential loss in 1992 but said he hoped it would be less than three times the 1991 loss. He added that the company hoped the store would break even in several years.
The store replaced the Bonwit Teller store in the Trump Tower at 57th Street and Fifth Avenue and was opened on Sept. 28, 1991, after a redecoration that cost $13.7 million. It sells women's clothing, accessories and perfumes distributed over 40,000 square feet on five floors. Sales at the New York store in 1991 totaled $8.4 million.
Galeries Lafayette had 392 department stores, supermarkets and home repair centers worldwide at the end of 1991. Mr. Meyer said companywide sales in the first five months of 1992 had inched up from the similar period last year and were unchanged from the period in 1990.
The chairman said the company would try to reduce operating costs by pooling distribution resources and merging the administrative staffs of its Galeries Lafayette fashion stores with its Nouvelles Galeries general department and home-furnishing stores. The savings this year from the reorganization could be as high as five-tenths of 1 percent of total sales, he added.

HEADLINE: Dow Ekes Out Gain of 5.08; Focus Is on Tobacco Stocks

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Heavy trading in tobacco stocks after a long-awaited Supreme Court decision on the liability of cigarette makers was Wall Street's most compelling feature yesterday in an otherwise listless session.
Stocks ended with meager gains as investors also received more evidence of a sputtering economic recovery. The Government reported that durable goods orders for May fell by an unexpected 2.4 percent, which followed revised increases of 1.9 percent in April and 2.1 percent in March. The May decline was the steepest since a 5.3 percent drop in durables in December. 
 While the news was greeted by some as hope for further interest-rate cuts to keep the economy from relapsing in recession, others were disheartened by the implications for second-quarter corporate earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 5.08 points at 3,290.70, compared with a session high of 3,302.74.
Advancing issues led declining issues, 868 to 845. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 194.4 million shares, compared with 190.9 million on Tuesday.
The durable goods data surprised Wall Street economists who had expected an increase of three-tenths of a percent. "The economy continues to behave in a laborious fashion," said Hersh Cohen at Shearson Asset Management.
Durable goods are items like cars and home appliances that are intended to last at least three years. They are a good gauge of the economy's health because they are expensive and take longer to produce. Orders measure both demand and future employment prospects among manufacturing companies.
The market took the 7-to-2 Supreme Court ruling that smokers may sue tobacco companies for damages under state injury laws in stride. The court rejected the industry's argument that the cigarette health-warning law, adopted in 1965 and amended in 1969, shields cigarette companies from such lawsuits.
But Philip Morris noted that the complicated ruling held that cigarette companies could not be sued by smokers who contended that they had not been adequately warned of the risks of smoking after 1969.
"The tobacco stocks looked as if they were going to turn the market into a disaster," said Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal & Company. "But the Street philosophized and decided it was actually a victory."

HEADLINE: A Sagging Italy Looks to Sale of State Enterprises

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, June 24

 BODY:
The economic system that sustained Italy's postwar development from ruin to leading industrial power has come unglued, causing a crisis of confidence that is undermining business and unmasking the real cost of the so-called Italian miracle.
From the deeply depressed Milan stock exchange, where trading has slowed to a crawl, to the dark corridors of state-owned industrial companies in Rome, where politically appointed managers talk morosely of privatization, the gloom is uniform. 
 "We are in the midst of a very deep fog," said Carlo Scognamilio, the rector of the Luiss business school in Rome, "and only radical action to change the nature of the economy will get us out."
In the face of this impasse, a buzzword has caught on: privatization. Shipbuilding, steel, banking, mining, energy, aerospace, utilities and railways are among the sectors in which the state is either the sole owner or a dominant force. The trouble is, many of these enterprises are aimed more at serving political interests -- like preserving jobs -- than in making money.
Even so, if not exactly a panacea, a big selloff of state property is now seen by business executives, economists and some politicians as the only way to hitch Italy, the world's fifth-largest economy, to the mainstream of Europe and arrest what a former industry minister, Renato Altissimo, called "our slide toward Cairo."
The country's deterioration is a drastic turnabout from five years ago. Then, leading companies like Olivetti and Fiat, spurred by a general economic upturn in Europe, were raking in profits and economists were boasting that Italy's economy had overtaken Britain's in size.
But in retrospect, the boom may have been a bubble that masked Italy's fundamental problems.
These problems have come home to roost in twin crises afflicting the federal finances and the Milan stock exchange, Italy's principal stock market. They are certain to pose a severe test to Giuliano Amato, deputy leader of the country's Socialist Party and a former treasury minister, who was officially asked last week to try to form a new government.
 
$1.2 Trillion Debt
 Two figures sum up the extent of the nation's plight. The first is a large one: 1,469,831,000,000,000 lire, or $1.2 trillion. That is the size of the national debt after years of reckless government spending on every form of patronage, from jobs for teachers with no pupils to disability payments for entire villages of able-bodied Southerners.
Indeed, it has risen to 103 percent of Italy's total output of all goods and services. Those include the Fiat cars, Olivetti computers, Ferragamo shoes, Parma hams and Benetton clothes that forged the image of Italy's success. In 1983, the debt equaled just 69 percent of output.
By comparison the net public debt of the United States, at a mere 37 percent of gross national product, is moderate.
The second dismal figure for Italy is the price of stock in Fiat S.p.A., the company that symbolizes private enterprise and is a bellwether for the economy. The shares now trade for 5,425 lire, or about $4.60 -- less than one-third the price at which the Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi sold his 10 percent Fiat stake in 1986.
"Qaddafi proved a fabulous financier of startling prescience," said Isidoro Albertini, a Milan broker.
 
Holding on to Affluence
 "Italy cannot go on this way," conceded Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman of Fiat. "The state is out of money, the stock exchange stagnant. We will have to accept sacrifices and discipline. But the problem is that Italy is a country of people whose affluence is recent, and they do not want to give up anything."
But the stock market has already given up a lot. Its index stands at a little over half the 1987 level. Moreover, it has become clear that the dearth of capital on the market and the enormous government indebtedness are linked problems blocking Italy's development.
Because the Treasury has to offer very high interest rates on its bonds to attract the billions of dollars needed to finance the deficit, private companies find themselves unable to compete effectively for savings.
"Instead of creating new enterprise, our risk capital is being swallowed shoring up the state." said Luigi Cappugi, an economist.
By selling chunks of state industries, the state may be able to raise as much as $50 billion over the next four years, thus making some inroad on the huge debt.
This in turn should make it easier to reduce the annual budget deficit, now running about 10 percent of gross national product, because the shortfall is largely caused by interest payments on the debt.
Then, once the Government's financing needs have been eased, more capital should eventually flow to the stock market, helping to end the long slump in Milan.
 
Obstacle to Union
 "There is no other course but privatization," argued Gianni de Michelis, a former Minister of State Industry who is now Acting Foreign Minister. "Without it we will never reach the targets of Maastricht."
The embattled Maastricht Treaty, which calls for a single European currency by 1999, states that only countries with budget deficits of less than 3 percent of G.N.P. are admissible to monetary union. It also obliges the 12 member states of the European Community to lower their national debts to under 60 percent of total output. Of the major European economies, Italy is by far the most distant from these goals.
Certainly, there is no lack of industry to privatize. Money was in short supply when Italy's postwar reconstruction began, and great swaths of the economy have remained, increasingly anachronistically, in state hands.
For example, more than 90 percent of the nation's banks are state owned. Even some pasta companies are state run. In all, economists reckon that close to 50 percent of the economy is government operated.
Among the bigger state-owned groups and prime targets of the privatization plan recently approved by Parliament is ENI, the state-owned energy company. With 1991 sales of $42.4 billion and net income of $900 million, it looks attractive enough. The Acting Budget Minister, Paolo Pomicino, said recently that shares would be offered in the fourth quarter of this year.
 
Money-Losing Units
 But a closer look at ENI reveals the huge problems that are certain to afflict Italy's privatization drive and perhaps abort it completely.
In effect, ENI is a sprawling group in which a very profitable oil and gas operation masks chemical, mining, engineering and textile divisions that are losing money. ENI even has a daily newspaper, Il Giorno, which also piles up losses.
The chief justification for the unprofitable units is that they provide tens of thousands of jobs for a group that has long been well known as a fief of the Socialist Party. While this may have been acceptable under the prevailing economic system that allowed parties to use state industries partly as vote-gathering machines, it is difficult to see how it can be justified in the market place.
For example, ENI's chemical operations lost $1.2 billion last year. In part, this reflected a worldwide chemical industry slump. But there were other factors at play.
"We have enormous overcapacity in the chemical sector and we would like to close various plants," said Gabriele Cagliari, ENI's president, "But we cannot for social reasons." He added that "social is just a nicer word for political."
Other senior ENI officials pointed to the group's fertilizer plants. Because the oil-exporting countries that produce the methane from which the fertilizer is made also produce fertilizer at about half the Italian price, the factories are not competitive.
"But there are about 10,000 jobs at stake in Sicily, Calabria and Puglia, so we cannot close the fertilizer plants," said one official, who insisted on anonymity.
Mr. Cagliari, a political appointee, seemed generally ambivalent about privatization. He said he would favor initially turning ENI into a joint stock company and then selling small stakes in some parts of ENI, like the oil unit, AGIP, and the gas unit, SNAM.
"Decisions in Italy are very laborious and much had to be done before any of ENI could be sold," he said. "But in any event I can tell you we have a kind of religion on maintaining 51 percent and the state's share in ENI would not drop below that."
In all, at ENI and at the state industrial holding company IRI -- a fief of the long-governing Christian Democratic Party -- there are more than half a million jobs, a fabulous reserve of political capital for parties that have made patronage the basis of their strength.
 
Vehicle for Graft
 State industry is also a vehicle for graft that can be very lucrative to politicians. For example, a 48-mile pipeline between two ENI chemical plants in northern Italy was recently found to have ballooned in cost because of kickbacks and overpayments for expropriated land.
"In effect," said Mr. Scognamilio, the rector of Luiss, "politicians are being asked to cut off their own hands." Asked if the country's notoriously slow-moving political class could take such drastic action, Mr. Altissimo, the former Industry Minister, said, "I don't see how parties will agree. I never knew a turkey that asked for Christmas to be brought forward."
What is clear is that an immense, and very uncharacteristic, act of political will is needed to drag Italy from its slump. With the country still searching for a government 10 weeks after an election, that looks hugely unlikely. But the alternative is grim.
"If you sell state assets you strike at the heart of the Italian political system," contends Fabrizio Garimberti, an economist. "But politicians will be dragged kicking and screaming into privatization because it is the only way to solve the crisis of our public finances. And therefore it is the only way for Italy to remain in Europe."

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Rail Shutdown Lifts Prices Of Heating Oil and Copper

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A shutdown of the American freight-rail system sent copper futures prices up sharply yesterday and contributed to a steep rise in the prices of heating oil futures.
Copper for June delivery jumped 2.10 cents, to $1.0685 a pound on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The buying reflected fears that the halt in rail shipments would aggravate an already tight supply levels. 
 "Most people have been carrying marginal inventories," said Stephen Platt, metals analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds.
 
Could Turn Bearish
 The nation's freight trains stopped rolling yesterday after a union struck one rail company and the rest of the industry shut down. The unions accused the companies of a lockout.
Although initially bullish for copper, the rail shipping halt could become a bearish factor if it lasts long enough to put a damper on the economic recovery because copper is a basic metal in many industries. That point may be about two weeks away, said James Steel, an analyst withRefco in New York.
Copper prices were rising before the rail strike. Copper for June delivery had climbed about 4 cents a pound since late May on signs of relatively tight world supplies and the threat of a copper strike in Poland.
Poland exports about 200,000 tons of refined copper to the West annually, Mr. Steel said.
Mr. Steel said the rail strike also contributed to a surge in heating oil futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange, though the rally was rooted mainly in an industry report late on Tuesday that American stocks of petroleum distillates, products like heating oil, were nearly 6 percent below the five-year average. The American Petroleum Institute also reported an unexpectedly steep drop last week in crude oil stocks.
Mr. Steel said the rail stoppage had helped lift heating oil because more goods likely will be shipped by trucks, which are heavier users of diesel fuel, a close relative to heating oil.
The rail strike also could increase air-shuttle traffic in the New York-Washington corridor, he said. That would prompt increased demand for jet fuel, which is also closely related to heating oil.
Home heating oil for July settled at 63.66 cents a gallon, up 1.55 cents. Heating oil for next-month delivery had not settled that high since Nov. 20, when the final price was 63.73 cents a gallon.
Unleaded gasoline for delivery in July settled at 65.15 cents a gallon, up 0.02 cent. Crude oil for delivery in August settled at $22.89 a barrel, up 30 cents. Natural gas prices were higher, with contracts for delivery in August settling at $1.521 for 1,000 cubic feet, up 3.8 cents.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls on Indications Of Weak Recovery in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar lost ground again yesterday on world currency markets, depressed by fresh economic data that called into question the strength of the economic recovery in the United States.
Gold prices were mostly lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $342.80 an ounce, off $1.70 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold had fallen $1.45 an ounce, to a late bid price of $342.65. 
 The dollar tumbled on a report showing that new orders for durable goods had fallen an unexpectedly sharp 2.4 percent in May -- the steepest drop since December -- underscoring the uneven nature of the economic recovery. Most economists had anticipated an advance of three-tenths to nine-tenths percent.
"The dollar really needed to see some good economic reports," said Mike Faust, an analyst with MMS International. "And when we didn't see it, it set the stage for some pretty solid dollar losses." Mr. Faust said trading had been heavy after the release of the report.
 
Effect of Call for Lower Rates
 The dollar was further pressed by President Bush's call for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to give the economy a boost. Lower interest rates tend to make dollar-denominated securities less valuable, reducing investors' demand for dollars.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.03 yen, up 0.07 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 126.60 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 126.45 yen, down from 127.28 yen on Tuesday.
In London the pound rose to $1.8780, from $1.8620 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.8795 to buy 1, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.8625.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5500 German marks, down from 1.5660; 1.4005 Swiss francs, down from 1.4175; 5.2185 French francs, down from 5.2710; 1,173.00 Italian lire, down from 1,184.00, and 1.1957 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1968.

HEADLINE: Stride Rite's Net Up 16%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 24

 BODY:
The Stride Rite Corporation, which makes Keds brand and other shoes, said today that second-quarter earnings rose 16 percent.
It warned, however, that analysts' estimates for the full fiscal year were "a little too high," which sent the company's stock plunging $4.625 a share, closing today at $20.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Stride Rite said second-quarter net income rose to $21.8 million, or 42 cents a share, from $18.8 million, or 37 cents a share, a year ago. It said sales for the quarter ended May 29 increased to $171 million from $153.9 million.
John J. Phelan, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said percentage gains for the full fiscal year 1992 will be below those recorded in the second quarter because the recession has made customers cautious about buying.
Analysts' estimates for full-year net income of $1.45 to $1.55 a share, on sales of $615 million to $620 million, are "a little too high," Mr. Phelan said.
In the fiscal year ended Nov. 30, the company earned $66 million, or $1.28 a share, on sales of $574.4 million.

Patchwork Outfield Works Out for Yanks

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., June 24

 BODY:
Figure this one out, if you can. The Yankees did not have Danny Tartabull or Roberto Kelly available tonight and they had a pitcher who could not throw strikes in his last start. No chance for victory, right? Wrong.
Any doubt about their outfield was eliminated when Dion James and Jim Leyritz, the replacements for the two starters, helped the Yankees score four runs in the first inning. And any doubt about Jeff Johnson's pitches was erased inning after inning as he cruised past the Royals for seven strong innings. 
 The result of the unexpected performances by these three Yankees was an unpredictable, but highly acceptable 6-3 victory over Kansas City at Royals Stadium.
The triumph gave the Yankees a chance to finish their lengthy road trip with an even record because they stand at 6-7 with one game remaining, Thursday afternoon.
"It would certainly be nice to do that," said Manager Buck Showalter. "We would have liked to do better, but it would be nice to win tomorrow."
 
First Victory Since April
 Johnson's pitching gave the Yankees a chance to dream about him actually being a viable part of their rotation. The left-hander has yet to show he truly belongs because he has been so erratic and still seems to be one bad start away from the minors. But he earned his first victory since April 19 by scattering eight hits and walking only two.
After Johnson was hammered for eight hits and six earned runs in two and two-thirds innings in his outing against Baltimore, he might have been hanging in the majors by a thread. But pitching coach Mark Connor met with him two days ago, told him to be aggressive and start proving himself and Johnson obeyed.
"He's had 30 starts in the big leagues and it is time for him to pitch well, to be consistent," Connor said. "He's got to go out there and pitch six or seven innings, whether he has his good stuff or not."
 
No Easy Task
 Staked to the quick 4-0 lead in the first, Johnson did not fool around with batters, used his curveball often and tossed 93 economical pitches while lasting into the eighth. Though Johnson claimed the conversation with Connor boosted him, he refused to view tonight as integral to remaining in the majors. He has done that previously and it overwhelmed him.
"Wins don't come too easy for a guy like me," said Johnson, who has a 5.72 e.r.a. after allowing two earned runs in seven innings. "If you put added pressure on yourself and worry about going to Columbus, you'll really be in trouble. I'm not doing it anymore."
Reciting what Connor had told him, Johnson said, "I've got a year in the big leagues and it's time for me to start doing something."
The Yanks did something against Rick Reed after the national anthem by raking him for four runs and four hits. Andy Stankiewicz started the frame by singling to right field for the first of his four hits and James followed by doubling him in with the first run.
Don Mattingly clubbed a single to right, Mel Hall popped out and Kevin Maas walked to load the bases. Leyritz, who was starting his second career game in right field, made the lineup look terrific with a sacrifice fly to give the Yanks a 2-0 lead.
Reed induced Matt Nokes to hit a grounder near second base, but it glanced off Keith Miller's glove for a costly error and allowed Mattingly to score. Charlie Hayes added a run-scoring single that gave the Yankees a comfortable 4-0 lead. Both Leyritz and James were super subs with three hits each while the team pounded 15 against four pitchers.
"It was nice to get ahead early and get the momentum going in our way," said Stankiewicz, after the first four-hit game of his career. "That's my job and it was nice to do it. That's what the big guys behind me want me to do."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 ROBERTO KELLY will miss two to four days with a bruised left shoulder blade he incurred from being hit by a pitch Tuesday. . . . Since DANNY TARTABULL is with his wife and newborn son in New Jersey, DION JAMES will handle center with JIM LEYRITZ and RANDY VELARDE getting playing time in right. . . . KELLIE TARTABULL, Danny's wife, gave birth to a 7-pound, 20-inch boy late Tuesday and named him ZACHARY. The baby was born three weeks premature and is in intensive care at a Teaneck, N.J. hospital because his lungs are not yet fully developed. Tartabull will likely rejoin the club Friday.

Studying Soccer Violence by the Civilized British

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:

Among the Thugs
By Bill Buford
317 pages. W. W. Norton. $22.95. 
 We think of England as being civilized. (It is we Americans who are violent.) And so apparently did Bill Buford, the American expatriate editor of the literary magazine Granta, who has lived in England since 1977. At leasthe thought the English civilized until one Saturday evening in 1982, when he took a train from Wales to London and saw the appalling evidence of what English soccer fans had done that day. (Or football supporters, as he calls them, using British terminology throughout his report.)
"My journey . . . offered up a vision of the English Saturday, the shopping day, that was different from the one I had known: that in the towns and cities you might find hundreds of police, military in their comprehensiveness, out to contain young, male sports fans who, after attending an athletic contest, were determined to break or destroy the things that were in their way. It was hard to believe."
It was so hard to believe that he felt compelled to take a closer look. He went to a soccer match on his own, experienced what he calls "a movable crush" and saw nothing of the game because there were too many people in the way. He wanted to befriend some likely looking thug, was at first regarded as "a deviant homosexual who deserved to be injured badly," but soon met "someone who was truly spectacular to look at, qualifying for that special category of human being -- one of its most repellent specimens."
He got to know the subculture, won the trust of the people he met for being "a good geezer," and traveled with his new companions around England and Europe during a decade when the behavior of soccer fans was making world headlines. Out of his adventures comes a book, "Among the Thugs," that is both funny and scary and is filled with violence that at least in one incident surpasses Shakespeare's "Titus Andronicus." If the book didn't have an ultimately serious purpose, one would be tempted to say it was all too much.
Mr. Buford pushes the possibilities of participatory journalism to a disturbing degree. He reports getting so drunk with his hooligan pals that he sometimes had trouble remembering what happened. He witnessed violence that he might have been able to impede, though probably at the cost of becoming its victim. He became part of rioting crowds that inflicted property damage and bodily injury. And at times, being part of it all, he even enjoyed himself.
But his joining in seems justified to the reader because he was always working out a theory on what he was witnessing, an important part of which has to do with the stages of a crowd's behavior. To understand the terrifying phenomenon of English soccer hooliganism, you could not simply take a snapshot and run away from it.
He thought at first that the violence was a protest. "So many young people were out of work or had never been able to find any. The violence, it followed, was a rebellion of some kind -- social rebellion, class rebellion, something." But as he got deeper into it, he discovered a multitude of subtle nuances. He began to focus on the surprising psychology of the crowd experience. He discovered that a violent crowd is a being unto itself, that there are elements of it inside every one of us and that getting caught up in the frenzy can be ecstatic.
As for why young males in England were rioting every Saturday: "They do it for the same reason that another generation drank too much or smoked dope or took hallucinogenic drugs or behaved badly or rebelliously. Violence is their antisocial kick, their mind-altering experience, an adrenaline-induced euphoria that might be all the more powerful because it is generated by the body itself, with, I was convinced, many of the same addictive qualities that characterize synthetically produced drugs."
This of course is only part of an answer. And Mr. Buford presses on, concluding that the rioters need their fix of violence because English society is somehow realigning itself, and the old working class has disappeared in the new service economy. This seems pale and abstract beside his colorful observations on crowd behavior. It hardly accounts for shocking outbursts of racism and nationalism that suggest a genetic drive to wage war against the outlander, as if the English soccer thugs were unfulfilled soldiers grown restless from waiting too long for King Henry V to return and lead them in another battle of Agincourt.
But the author distracts us from any dissatisfaction we may have with his sociology by relating how he finally paid for his involvement with the thugs. Despite being fed up with his friends, he went to Sardinia for the 1990 World Cup semifinals, was caught in the middle of another riot and suffered a brutal beating at the hands of the Italian police, much as Hunter S. Thompson was punished for his journalistic curiosity at the end of his book "Hell's Angels," when he was beaten by one of the motorcycle gangs he was investigating. We can admire Mr. Buford for his daring, but he also permits us to feel superior in our detachment.
Meanwhile, the reader can't help dwelling on an interlude a third of the way into the book in which a police superintendent questions the author about American football matches: " 'Am I mistaken, Mr. Buford,' the superintendent continued, 'or is it the case that there are also very few policemen in the grounds of these American football matches?'
"Very few, I assured him.
"'And yet,' Superintendent McAllister continued, 'there is no trouble?'
" 'None.' "
"Among the Thugs" does severe damage to the conventional wisdom that England and Europe are bastions of civilization, while the United States is the country whose character has been forever scarred by violence.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Two Old Rivals Now Running Together

SERIES: 30 Days to Barcelona -- Eighth article of a series on the Summer Olympics.

 BODY:
Professional antagonists for so long, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird are finally together, both on the same team and in pursuit of the same goal: a gold medal in men's basketball at the Olympics this summer.
They've waited years for this, haven't they? When they first met, it was 1979, in the Final Four championship game, Johnson playing for national champion Michigan State, Bird for runner-up Indiana State. And later, in the National Basketball Association, they waged memorable battles throughout the 1980's, Johnson taking the Los Angeles Lakers to five league titles and Bird helping the Boston Celtics soar to three. 
 Theirs was a mutual, if sometimes grudging, admiration. But not until this week in La Jolla, Calif., have they played side by side on the same court. They are preparing for an Olympic qualifying tournament that starts Saturday in Portland, Ore.
"This could be the last hurrah for both of us," said Johnson, who effectively announced his retirement last November because he had contracted the virus that causes AIDS. "You never know. So this one isn't just for Laker fans, or just for Celtic fans, it's for basketball fans everywhere."
Bird, 35 years old, concedes he is nearing the end, especially after being limited to 45 games this season because of problems with his lower back after surgery last summer. Like Johnson, however, he has refused to say anything official about retirement.
He does, however, talk about getting a chance to play on the same team with Johnson, once his rival but now his friend and teammate.
"This is nice," he said today, "because Magic's been out all year and there's no question that our careers are close to being over. It's a great honor, yes, but like I've said, we're here for one reason and that's to win a gold.
"Just playing on the team is not going to do it. We came here to accomplish something, and hopefully we can do it together."
 
Albania Seeks a Way
 "Gervish Per Te Fituar," translated as "Scratch for Win," is the logo on Albanian lottery tickets intended to generate funds for the country's Olympic team. Unless $100,000 is raised within a few weeks for the squad, some Albanian athletes will be scratched from competing in Barcelona.
Jorgoni Arben, Albania's deputy Minister of Youth Sports and Culture, said most of the $150,000 raised for the team in lottery sales has not been released by the Government because of economic difficulties. The Albanians, though, are still hoping to field 15 athletes in 5 events in the country's first Olympic Games since 1972.
"The most important thing is just to take part for the first time as a democratic state," said Arben, whose country ousted its Communist leadership in free elections last March. "The goals of sports will spread in the country and the Olympic movement will increase."
Albania has raised $500,000 over all since it began selling lottery tickets six months ago. Tickets are 50 cents apiece, with a minimum purchase of two, and prizes range from a free ticket to $5,000.
Lottery sales have slowed recently because of difficulty obtaining tickets and a sluggish economy. To remedy the problems, tickets will soon be available in stores rather than banks and new types of lottery games will be implemented.
 
Changing Faces
 Three major stars of the old Soviet Union failed to make the track and field team that will represent the Commonwealth of Independent States at the Barcelona Olympics.
In trials this week in Moscow, Yuri Sedykh, the leading hammer thrower in history, and his greatest rival, Sergei Litvinov, did not finish among the top three. Sedykh, the 37-year-old Olympic champion in 1976 and 1980 and the world champion last year, was fourth behind Igor Astapkovich, Andrei Abduvalyev and Igor Nikulin. Litvinov, 34 years old, the 1988 Olympic champion and world champion of 1983 and 1987, did not advance to the final eight.
Between them, Sedykh and Litvinov have the 19 longest throws in history, led by Sedykh's world record of 284 feet 7 inches. That is nearly 18 feet farther than the best ever by an American, Jud Logan's 268-8. With a throw of 262-10 on his final effort today, Logan was among the top finishers at the United States trials today. The other qualifiers were Lance Deal (262-3) and Ken Flax (254-5).
Another leading athlete from the former Soviet Union who did not make the team was Galina Chistiakova, the world-record holder in the long jump. She finished 10th in the Commonwealth trials.

HEADLINE: Keep the U.N. -- and America's Word

 BODY:
Mayor David Dinkins has mounted a catch-up campaign to keep four United Nations agencies from leaving New York City for cheaper pastures in Germany or suburban New Rochelle. That's a start. But this is not just a municipal matter. It also involves winning world respect for America's word.
The Mayor needs help from Congress and the Bush Administration. They're to blame for America's abysmal failure to pay, in full and on time, the dues owed the world organization. 
 It won't do simply to snipe at Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as if he were a crafty Rhine maiden trying to lure unwary U.N. workers to sleepy Bonn. When Germany's capital moves to Berlin, there will be ample space in a not unpleasant city. Mr. Kohl is offering free rent and moving expenses to the U.N. Development Program, the Population Fund and the Development Fund for Women.
He has a solid advantage: Germany has paid its U.N. dues, and even promises to increase its added voluntary contribution. Uncle Deadbeat, by contrast, owes $555 million in general dues and $112 million for peacekeeping. Much of the shortfall results from a fiscal gimmick. Though dues are payable on Jan. 1, the check does not go into the mail until October, when the U.S. begins a new fiscal year. American procrastination invites other members to follow suit, thereby deepening the U.N.'s chronic cash shortage.
More noise about this delinquency is in order, especially from New York's two Senators and the City's 14 Representatives. This is not a partisan issue. Polls show strong public support for the U.N.
City Hall has already come up with a competitive offer to dissuade the United Nations Children's Fund from moving to New Rochelle. Deputy Mayor Barry Sullivan proposes a rent reduction of $28 million over 20 years if Unicef remains on U.N. Plaza. And to underwrite future expansion, the city is prepared to issue tax-exempt bonds.
But the German challenge requires more urgent attention, both in New York and in Washington. If Chancellor Kohl prevails, the rest of the United Nations will soon be coaxed elsewhere, diminishing New York's standing and America's special status as a nation of nations.

HEADLINE: New Promise for Peace in Israel

 BODY:
Even Israelis seem surprised by the outcome of their most momentous vote in a generation. Few predicted such a decisive turn to Yitzhak Rabin's Labor Party, ending its 15 years in the wilderness. But enough Israelis voted cautiously for peace to enable him to form a government that's hostage neither to the extreme right or left.
This is an outcome Americans can welcome with relief and considerable hope. For President Bush, who has suffered harsh criticism from some American Jews, the results vindicate a long, tenacious peace initiative. 
 The peace talks he prompted have galvanized such broad support in Israel that even Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir held back his criticism. And now, after long pre-election paralysis, the Rabin victory offers hope to all sides. "It looks like the peace process has been rescued from the Likud's attempts at sabotaging it," Hanan Ashrawi, a leading Palestinian, said yesterday.
Mr. Rabin promises first priority to granting autonomy and self-rule to Palestinians. Moreover, he pledges to curb settlements in the disputed West Bank and Gaza Strip, thus opening the way for U.S. approval of $10 billion in loan guarantees to help Israel absorb Russian immigrants. By quietly refusing to yield on this condition, Washington managed to improve Mr. Rabin's chances without giving Mr. Shamir a provocative target.
The elections spell out the result. The Likud coalition won only 32 seats of the Parliament's 120 seats, its worst showing since 1969. Labor's share increased from 37 to 45. Placing third with 12 seats was the unabashedly dovish Meretz bloc, giving the peace faction new leverage.
Mr. Shamir's defeat owed much to mismanagement of the overtaxed, overregulated economy. Soaring unemployment led to a dramatic drop in Russian emigration; the frustrated newcomers turned strongly against Likud. This debacle was inextricably linked to the Government's frantic effort to build new settlements.
The blunt Mr. Rabin exploited this linkage, while reminding voters that he was also commander in the triumphant Six-Day War 25 years ago. Even fresher is his recent service as Defense Minister, when he confronted the Palestinian uprising with "might, power and beatings."
Yet toughness is scarcely the same as inflexibility. Israelis demonstrably yearn for peace and security in a transformed Middle East. Labor and its new leader speak of national interest and security guarantees, rather than ideological and biblical claims to a Greater Israel. The change to the pragmatic Mr. Rabin offers new possibilities for a land-for-peace compromise vainly sought by successive American Presidents.
This opportunity could evaporate, however, if Palestinians and their Arab allies once again misread the Israeli mood. Reciprocal trust can only be nurtured by matching moderation. In this, further resourceful diplomacy by Secretary of State James Baker can make a difference. It has already paid generous dividends.

HEADLINE: Salesman Or Strategist?

BYLINE: By Robert B. Costello; Robert B. Costello was Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition in the Reagan and early Bush Administrations.

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

 BODY:
No one is in a better position to take a stand on the Government's role in helping U.S. industry compete than Ross Perot. An insider who understands the intricate workings of Government, he used his knowledge to build an industry -- Electronic Data Systems -- and great personal wealth.
The question is: Is Mr. Perot the kind of leader who is willing to make commitments against which he asks to be measured, or is he the slick systems sales pro who will tell us anything to get the job and is never pinned down on specifics? 
 When he was a businessman hungry for public-sector work, Mr. Perot studied the Government's needs. If the tables were turned and he was in charge, we would expect him to define a role for government in using its vast resources to nurture industries critical for U.S. leadership in the 21st century.
Mr. Perot is no strict protectionist. His strategy at E.D.S. demonstrated that he understands the dangers of a go-it-alone industrial policy. He developed the American and foreign resources his company needed to be competitive -- and to build an American data processing industry in partnership with the Government. Thus, he should have more insight than any politician into how government might create opportunities for growth, investment and employment.
We know that the Government can play this role. Important technologies -- computers, semiconductors and jet aircraft -- originated in the Defense Department, the result of wise investments to meet civilian and military needs. The Pentagon supported critical research and development and then proceeded to buy enough of the product to put in place the infrastructure to make the U.S. the international leader in these industries. This was accomplished without restricting trade or limiting the global exchange of technical information.
These breakthroughs were unexpected dividends, since such a public-private partnership was not the original goal. But perhaps it is a model for the future.
The world's largest buyer of goods and services is our Government. With the proper industrial policy, this power can be harnessed to revive our technological and manufacturing leadership.
For too many years, politicians have pushed big pork barrel science projects, like the supercollider, with little regard for building a broader technical base with the potential for benefiting everyone. Germany and Japan have promoted useful projects, supporting industries and technologies from precision instruments to semiconductors.
The hydrogen-cycle internal-combustion engine would have been a good test of the potential role of the Government as a catalyst and leader in industrial development. If we had been able to point to progress on this nonpolluting technology at the Earth Summit, we might have been seen as a leader, not a reluctant follower.
The U.S. had the potential to be far ahead in developing this lightweight engine, which runs on hydrogen and air, producing only water and nitrogen oxides as byproducts. Research and development still need to be done and a market has to be created.
If the military pioneered the use of the technology to build higher-efficiency, nonpolluting vehicles with low emissions, the result could be of far greater importance to U.S. industrial capability than the supercollider.
Only the Government has the resources and well-defined needs to make this happen. After the Pentagon created the market, all Government agencies could be required to use vehicles with hydrogen-cycle engines. Thus, the Government could help build a critical industrial infrastructure.
But Washington had better hurry. The Germans and the Japanese are working on prototypes, though they do not yet have a big enough captive market to insure success.
In technology, trade and politics, bold, insightful leadership is the difference. Ross Perot is either the leader with industrial insight or the consummate salesman whose promises aren't pinned down to measurable specifics. The U.S. needs leadership in the dynamic world of industrial competition -- commitments, not promises. So far we've heard only promises.

HEADLINE: Water Gun Raises Problems of Responsibility

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Controlling the Wrong Guns" (Topics of The Times, June 10), you neglect to mention individual responsibility in the issue of Super Soakers, the water guns whose use has led to real gunplay. Science and technology take developments to their next logical step, whether in nuclear power or Super Soakers. The responsibility of using them falls to the citizenry.
Most city dwellers, including myself, suffer from some urban stress. But if hit by a stream of water, however much it would vex us, we would not resort to violence. But our city is also home to people truly living on the edge. Some of them are armed and dangerous, and would not hesitate to retaliate with real guns, as we have seen in Boston and New York. 
 Teen-agers and younger children are excited at the opportunity to use these high-powered water cannons to act out the fantasies fed to them through television and the movies. Studies have shown that many children, especially boys, do not assess risk well. Some might think it is irresponsible to give youngsters a toy that virtually asks for trouble.
It is easy to say, as the company that makes Super Soakers did: Simply enforce laws to remove real guns from the street. I find it hard to believe that the company that markets the water guns cares much about the urban child. Still, I don't believe in censorship. However, Super Soakers, of themselves, are not dangerous in the sense that shoddily made goods or toxic products are dangerous and therefore removable from the marketplace. The danger comes in how they are used and where.
We may ask the company to stop making them; it probably won't. We may ask stores to stop selling them; they probably won't. We may ask New York City to ban them, but that might turn out to be unconstitutional. If the problem worsens, concerned citizens must work on bringing the kind of economic pressure and embarrassing publicity down on those involved in making this so-called toy available. To suggest that we wait for real gun control to solve the problem of violent retaliation is tantamount to saying, let's do nothing.
Those who live in this city and have children know that they are constantly teaching their children to live defensively, and now there is one more thing to add to the list. Parents and other adults who decide to buy this ballistic water pistol have a responsibility to teach youngsters to assess the risk in playing with this toy.
For the sake of children and bystanders, let's hope people decide the stakes are too high and won't buy the thing.

 BODY:
As Vice President George Bush accepted the Republican Presidential nomination on Aug. 18, 1988, he told thousands of cheering convention delegates that his goal as President would be to pick up where Ronald Reagan left off.
"The most important work of my life is to complete the mission we started in 1980," he declared. 
 It seemed a fitting declaration for a man who told the convention that he had spent his life carrying out assignments. As a World War II pilot, the first American envoy to Communist China, the Republican Party chairman and the Director of Central Intelligence, he had always set off with a clear mission, Mr. Bush said.
 
An Unfamiliar World
 But soon after his inauguration, the world Mr. Bush had known so well began to dissolve around him. While he exercised his strong hand in foreign policy and left domestic issues largely alone, the Communist menace vanished, the economy soured and Americans confronted a deepening social crisis that crystallized in the rage and violence in Los Angeles.
As his term comes to an end in these circumstances, a crisis of leadership threatens Mr. Bush's re-election. The President himself seemed clearly aware of that as he made his argument for another term in an interview in the Oval Office on Tuesday. [Excerpts, page A24.]
"In the final analysis, people are going to say, 'Who do you want sitting at that desk?' " Mr. Bush said after 30 minutes of discussing his record. "Who has the temperament? Who has the experience? Who do we trust?"
Rising from his wing chair, pushing his gold-trimmed pen back into his shirt pocket and putting on his glasses to show his guests out, his final words were confident: "That's why I'm going to win this election. You watch."
But as voters begin to pass judgment on the very terms Mr. Bush outlined -- his record and his ability to lead -- they are doing so in a world very different from the one in which he was elected in 1988. In 1992, America no longer seems to want a President who can carry out assignments on well-charted ground. The nation and the times demand one who can set new goals and devise the next mission for a people entering wild territory.
Having pursued his career with a bomber pilot's single-minded focus, Mr. Bush now finds himself frozen on the top step, unable to explain clearly what he has tried to accomplish in the last three and a half years or where he would like to take the country.
Asked that very question, the President listed a series of general goals: "In the first place, I'd like to see it set in an environment of world peace. Secondly, I think at home, changing, fundamentally revolutionizing education is critical. And I'd like to see a domestic environment where we have a return to safety in the streets, and we have it where mothers don't worry about their children walking home from school."
But a raft of recent public opinon surveys show that Americans don't really understand what Mr. Bush means by that, how he has tried to lead the country since 1989 or how he intends to achieve his goals if he wins a second term.
The most recent New York Times/CBS News poll, taken on June 17-20, shows Mr. Bush's overall approval rating at an all-time low of 34 percent. A large majority said the Bush Administration was drifting without clear policies. And in the end, a majority of Americans said he had not said enough about where he stands for them to judge what he might do if he won re-election.
Only 9 percent said he had kept all or most of his campaign promises. Indeed, Mr. Bush -- the "read my lips" candidate of 1988 -- has never quite recovered from the damage he did to his standing in his own party by agreeing to raise taxes in 1990.
 
Bush Takes Pride In Foreign Policy
 Mr. Bush easily listed what he considered his accomplishments: an education program that sets general goals for local schools to reach by century's end, and existing legislative ideas he endorsed and helped shape on child care, air pollution and the rights of the disabled. He also cited his appointment of conservative judges to the Federal bench.
In foreign affairs, he spoke of "great, earthshaking" accomplishments, including the recent agreement cutting Russian and American nuclear weapons, the Arab-Israeli peace talks, and his role in the unification of Germany and in the transformation of the former Soviet Union. "And, of course, Desert Storm was a significant and major accomplishment," he said.
Indeed, when people surveyed in the new poll were asked to name Mr. Bush's single most important accomplishment as President, 29 percent said the Persian Gulf war. Another 18 percent said foreign policy in general. But only 1 percent mentioned the economy and leadership abilities, and 39 percent could think of nothing at all.
Of those who listed the victory over Iraq as his major accomplishment, hardly anyone could think of any other notable achievement.
Behind these numbers are other statistics that paint a starkly negative picture of Mr. Bush's first term: record deficits, an anemic economy, low consumer confidence and even lower confidence in government.
Certainly, the President inherited some of his economic problems from a previous Administration, though it was one he helped manage. And Congress shares both credit and fault for much that has occurred.
But as voters assess Mr. Bush's Presidency, the most consistent observation is that while he is a good crisis manager, he has been reactive at a time when the nation needs a creative, forward-looking leader. And his record shows few, if any, domestic initiatives that Mr. Bush or his aides have devised and carried through.
"The premise that Bush set out on his inauguration is in serious trouble," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, referring to Mr. Bush's vow to continue what Mr. Reagan had started. "What he was saying no longer is relevant or what people desire. They know that the long-term policies we were following have failed, and even putting a human face on them isn't being accomplished."
The White House justly responds that Mr. Bush has shown leadership in the area he clearly cares about most -- foreign affairs, where at times he has demonstrated the power and adroitness that have escaped him on the domestic front.
Much of what Mr. Bush has done, however, has been in response to the startling events that have occurred around him. He has been far less successful at articulating America's mission in a post-cold war world. Critics say that failure has been dramatized by what they see as Mr. Bush's lack of leadership in responding to the civil war in Yugoslavia.
But even his successes in foreign policy seem to mean less to voters now.
"The attitude of the American people is: 'Glad you ended the cold war, defeated the Soviet empire and extended freedom. Which of you guys can do more for me next?' " said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip. "That's a legitimate question, and it's the challenge that Bush faces as a leader."
 
Echoes of Reagan Strike Fewer Chords
 A few years into the Reagan era, new nouns with unmistakable meanings began popping into the national vocabulary: Reaganism. Reaganomics. The Reagan Revolution. Reagan Country. Reagan Democrats.
The Bush Administration was supposed to be a smooth continuation of the Reagan years. But applied to Mr. Bush, such nouns are non sequiturs to some, terms of derision to others.
While a Reaganism was a folksy articulation of the President's ideology, a "Bushism" is an example of the President's Rubik's Cube speaking style. "Reagan Country" referred to whole regions or voter blocs loyal to Mr. Reagan, but "Bush Country" is hard to find. In fact, several new New York Times/ CBS News polls show that about half of the roughly 13 million Democrats who voted for Mr. Bush in 1988 say they will vote for someone else this year, while more than one-tenth say they don't know how they will vote.
In election years, Mr. Bush has been quick to seize on symbolism, as he did in 1988 with his visits to flag factories. And in this campaign, led by Vice President Dan Quayle, the White House has seized on "family values."
Taking up that theme in the interview on Tuesday, Mr. Bush denounced what he called "the filth on television," and said: "I can't accept as normal life style people of the same sex being parents, I'm very sorry. I don't accept that as normal. And I believe in the traditional family values. And the best shot that a kid has is to have a mother and father that love that child, that will educate that child, that will care for that child."
In normal times, Mr. Bush scorns the kind of symbolism Mr. Reagan frequently waved like a battle standard. Mr. Bush has often said that he hates to be "put on the couch" to give voters a glimpse at his psyche. And he dismisses any need for rhetorical flourishes or other symbolic gestures of leadership.
"He is rhetorically and oratorically a handicapped man," said Thomas E. Cronin, a Presidential scholar at Colorado College. "Americans have the models of F.D.R., Kennedy and Reagan, who exhorted them to some ideal or some version of the American dream or asked for sacrifice. George Bush has not been able to stir the country."
 
Supporters Facing A Crisis of Doubt
 Even those who support Mr. Bush agree that he is facing a crisis of doubt. about his leadership.
"The American people have lost their sense of political efficacy, and that is what the Perot candidacy represents right now," said Representative Vin Weber, Republican of Minnesota. "Bush's problem is that he doesn't look to people like the kind of guy who can challenge a gridlock system and bust it loose."
Politicians and academics across the political spectrum believe that at its core, Mr. Bush's problem is one of credibility.
"People don't think Bush is a crook," said Barbara Bardes, professor of political science at Loyola University of Chicago. "They're just not sure what he's doing, and in that case they think he's doing nothing."
In recent weeks, Mr. Bush and his aides have been scrambling to find actions that will make him seem more Presidential. But after leaving domestic issues largely alone for most of his term, all this activity may not be helping. "Anything they do now has hanging over it the question, 'Why didn't you do it earlier?' " Mr. Gingrich said.
Mr. Bush is highly secretive and prefers to make most decisions himself or in consultation with small groups of close friends. The White House resists discussion of how decisions are reached, or what advice the President weighs in making them. The President "goes ballistic," as he puts it, when a decision is reported before he is ready to announce it.
"There is something very bizarre and dangerous about this President, and that is the extent to which he is into surprises," said James David Barber, author of "The Presidential Character" (Prentice-Hall, 1972), a study of White House leadership.
Mr. Bush likes to trade on his personal relationships with foreign leaders, and to rely on his own experience and knowledge. That approach has failed him at times: critics say it did in relations with China. Mr. Bush, convinced that he could serve as his own adviser on that country after serving there as an envoy in the 1970's, pressed ahead after the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square with a conciliatory policy that has produced no tangible results.
But in other instances, this style may have helped. During the gulf crisis, he made decisions with seven top aides, in the Oval Office and in strict secrecy. In the end, Mr. Bush's diplomacy ran smoothly, and his war machine was startlingly efficient, at least in accomplishing its limited goals.
That, his supporters say, adds up to a good crisis manager. "He'd be a good person to be stuck in a snowstorm with," said Lynn Martin, the Secretary of Labor. "You could trust him, and you'd have an awful good chance of getting out of there."
But does that style lend itself to leadership on a grander scale?
"I don't feel that Bush has inner demons, like Nixon or Johnson," said Fred Greenstein, a student of the Presidency who teaches at Princeton. But he said, "What we see is someone who has always been good, dutiful, responded to situations, but just is not very good as a helmsman."
Mr. Bush's term has been an exercise in trying to keep up with expanding horizons on almost every front.
When he moved into the White House, he devoted his energies to foreign policy -- believing, associates say, that the economy was basically sound and needed little attention from him. The cold war seemed to be winding down slowly, and Mr. Bush set himself to tinkering with the relationship with the Soviet Union.
 
White House Surprised By Soviet Collapse
 The sudden disintegration of the Soviet empire surprised Mr. Bush as much as it surprised everyone else. But his aides say the President's caution and personal relationship with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev helped keep the peace during the transition. His critics say it led Mr. Bush to hang onto Mr. Gorbachev far too long.
These days, Mr. Bush talks almost wistfully about having a Republican Congress to help him enact his legislative agenda. "When Reagan came into office and I was the Vice President, he got a lot done in the first term because he controlled one House of the Congress," he said in the interview. "And it makes it an awful lot better if you control, say, one house, saying nothing of two.
"Give me control of both Houses. Give the people a Republican President and control of both Houses of Congress."
Mr. Bush blames Congress for his failure to enact more than a few domestic initiatives. But some say he has not done a good job working with the Democratic Congress.
Mr. Gingrich, sharply critical of Mr. Bush's decision to break his "no new taxes" campaign pledge in 1990, said the President spent too much time trying to play the conciliator with an unwilling Democratic majority in Congress, and then did not fight hard enough when his efforts failed.
"He has resolutely avoided accepting responsibility for what I think is an unavoidable civil war culturally about where this country is going," said Mr. Gingrich, who believes the 1992 election ought to be a moral, philosophical and cultural battle. "All of his social instincts and his personal grace lead him to conciliate. In a civil war, you have to pick sides and win."
 
Who Really Lives In 'Bush Country'?
 If it is difficult to tell which side Mr. Bush is on at times, it is equally hard to tell who is on his side. Interviews over recent weeks produced only one large, unified easily defined voting bloc squarely in his camp: the several million voters who vote for the candidate most squarely opposed to abortion.
Dr. Richard Land, head of the Christian Life Commission for the Southern Baptist Convention, concedes that most of these are one-issue voters who don't care could not care less about the President's record on any other issue.
Like most political analysts and interest-group leaders, Dr. Land had difficulty identifying other large voting blocs that unquestionably belong to the President. "Boy, you know I can't think of any," he said with a long sigh. "I just can't."
Mr. Bush long ago lost the enthusiastic backing of bedrock conservative Republicans.
Michael Sanara, a former Reagan Administration official who now teaches political science at Northern Arizona University, seemed to sum up the focus of Republican disillusionment. "I'm on the list for all the Republican Presidential fund-raisers," Now, he says. "I just write on the solicitation 'No new taxes,' and send it back."

U.S. Trade Agency Turns Down Car Makers' Complaint on Japan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
The Federal Government's trade agency ruled today that Detroit's auto makers had not suffered significant harm from imported Japanese mini-vans, a verdict that prevents the Commerce Department from proceeding with plans to impose tariffs on the imports.
The decision by the independent agency, the International Trade Commission, to reject a highly political case is a landmark in American trade policy. It reflects the presence of a new majority, more skeptical of industry claims, on the little-known body, which has the power to block American industries from receiving Commerce Department protection from imports.
 
A Former Member's Analysis
 Three new commissioners -- two Republicans and a Democrat -- have joined the six-member body in recent months, and the two Republicans appear to be taking a much narrower interpretation of the nation's trade law than their predecessors. Their terms will last as long as nine years. 
 "You'll find a pattern of results a little more consistent with the actual data on what the imports are doing to the industry, and not that the industry is doing badly," said Ronald A. Cass, the commission's Democratic vice chairman in 1989 and 1990 and now the dean of Boston University's law school.
But Mr. Cass, like other trade experts, cautioned that the commission might not have been captured by staunch advocates of free trade but rather by lawyers who make a very narrow reading of the law.
A test of whether the commission has actually moved all the way into the free-trade camp will come on Thursday, when it must rule on whether the American softwood-lumber industry has been hurt by Canadian imports. The American industry has lost many jobs, and the Commerce Department has tentatively set a 6.5 percent duty on the imports.
The commission, which is headed by a Democrat, decided by a vote of 4 to 2 today that mini-van shipments by the Mazda Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation had not inflicted "material injury" on American car makers and did not threaten to do so.
Federal law requires the commissioners to consider in each case the domestic industry's output, market share, sales, profits, productivity, capacity, employment and seven other indications of economic health.
The decision was a setback for the General Motors Corporation, the Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, which filed the case last year. Before the decision, some auto company executives had even been discussing the possibility of a trade case against imports of Japanese luxury cars, such as the Acura Legend.
Detroit executives and top officials of the United Automobile Workers publicly gloated in recent weeks about the Commerce Department's tentative decision to impose a duty of 12.7 percent on Mazda mini-vans and 6.75 percent on Toyota mini-vans.
The Commerce Department found in December that these mini-vans were being sold below "fair market" prices and determined in May the margin of underpricing, which set the planned tariff.
Thomas H. Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, an auto industry trade group, said the fact "that the I.T.C. was unable to see a connection between proof of unlawful trade practices and harm to the U.S. industry is incomprehensible."
 
The Big Three React
 General Motors also called the decision "incomprehensible." Ford characterized the ruling as "a sad development for the American worker." The decision signaled to "Japan that it's O.K. to defy the international rules of trade, and what's more, that it doesn't hurt America," Ford said in a statement.
Chrysler, whose mini-van dominates the United States market, called the decision "a great disappointment," and a blow "to the long-term interests of American consumers and to the ability of our nation's manufacturing segment to compete worldwide."
Mazda, one of the targets of the domestic industry's complaint, said in a statement that it was "gratified." It added, "We have maintained since the beginning of this proceeding over one year ago that our position would ultimately be vindicated."
 
The Appeals Process
 Detroit's auto makers had no immediate comment on whether they would appeal the commission decision to the Court of International Trade, a Federal tribunal in New York. That court's decision could be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and after that, the Supreme Court. But few cases have been appealed because of the cost and the New York court's record of frequently sustaining the commission.
No duty is collected from Japanese auto makers during any appeals, and deposits collected for the last six months against eventual duties will be refunded to the importers.
Despite the commission's decision today, Detroit may eventually receive import protection from Congress. The House Ways and Means Committee approved a routine tariff-renewal bill today with an amendment that would raise the duty on imported mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles (like the Isuzu Trooper) to 25 percent from 2.5 percent by reclassifying them as trucks instead of cars.
The measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, opposes special protection for the auto industry. President Bush also opposes the tariff increase, and Congress has not overridden any of his vetoes.
Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said he would "take a look" at whether to introduce legislation changing the commission's standards for measuring when a domestic industry has been hurt by imports. The law setting the standards was amended in 1988 to help domestic industries, and today's case was the most politically controversial test yet of the revision.
Today's decision appears to signal that the commission's long-term direction is changing. After fairly consistently finding harm to domestic industries in the 1980's, the commission has now ruled against American companies in 6 of its 11 cases this year. The previous five rulings against American companies concerned three obscure chemical compounds, underground electrical cables and some steel rails.
The rulings are all the more striking because domestic industries win any tie votes on the commission and because the Commerce Department investigates trade cases only after the commission has issued an initial opinion that the American industry is suffering. The commission voted 3 to 0 last summer, with one commissioner recusing himself, to allow the Japanese mini-van case to proceed.
One new Republican on the commission, Peter S. Watson, has a term that will not expire until Dec. 16, 2000, suggesting that the commission's new shape may prove enduring. All three Republicans on the commission and one Democrat voted against the Detroit auto makers while the two remaining Democrats voted in their favor. No more than three members of the same party can serve on the panel at the same time; the chairmanship alternates between parties every two years.
Mr. Watson replaced Seeley G. Lodwick, an Iowa Republican who tended to be more receptive to domestic industries' complaints. At the same time, David B. Rohr, a Maryland Democrat whose nine-year term expires at the end of 1994, has also become increasingly willing to vote against domestic interests.
Mr. Rohr and Mr. Watson both voted with the majority and against the Detroit auto makers today. "I find that the information submitted to the commission does not establish that the volume of imports has had more than a minimal effect on the sales of domestic mini-vans," Mr. Rohr said in a statement, adding that he also did not believe that the imports had affected prices.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 27, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about a decision by the International Trade Commission that tariffs should not be imposed on imported Japanese mini-vans referred incorrectly to a court that hears appeals of decisions by the Court of International Trade. It is the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, not the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

HEADLINE: CONGRESS FORCES END TO SHUTDOWN OF TRAIN SERVICE

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, June 26

 BODY:
Congress approved binding arbitration late Thursday night to settle the labor dispute that shut down the nation's freight lines and threatened commuter rail service, mainly in the Northeast. The legislation was rushed early today to the President, who signed it immediately.
The House of Representatives first passed the legislation by a 240-to-140 vote and then the Senate by a 87-to-6 vote just before midnight. President Bush's signature insured that there would be no further disruption of freight lines as well as Amtrak, the Federally subsidized passenger carrier.
 
'Going Back to Work

 The White House said in a statement, "The President is pleased that Congress, with bipartisan cooperation, has met its responsibility to end the rail crisis." 
 Officials of the freight railroads said they expected to have 75 percent of their trains running again within 24 hours after the legislation was enacted and full service stored within 48 hours.
"The nation's railroads are going back to work as soon as possible," Edwin L. Harper, president of the Association of American Railroads, said in a statement. The measure enacted by Congress Thursday night immediately sends rail workers back to their jobs during a 20-day cooling-off period followed by binding arbitration if no settlement is reached.
But there was lingering discontent with the outcome among many lawmakers who voted for the bill grudgingly rather than risk further damage to the nation's economy from the shutdown.
Like many other Democrats, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who voted for the bill, blamed the railroads for the shutdown because 38 freight lines responded with lockouts when a single union called a strike Wednesday against a single railroad.
"A small band of railroad owners has walked away from the national interest and forced Congress to come to their rescue. So now Congress must act, in order to try and protect the jobs and economic health of America from that cynical and self-interested attitude," Senator Kennedy said during the Senate's brief debate on the measure, which ended with the voting just before midnight.
 
Major League Baseball
 In what its authors described as a novel approach to rail labor disputes, the legislation borrowed an arbitration method commonly used in major league baseball: after a fixed period of negotiation both labor and management submit a "last best offer" to a neutral arbitrator who then picks one. This was the 18th time that Congress has intervened in a rail labor dispute since 1963, applying a variety of approaches over the years.
Secretary of Transportation Andrew H. Card, who like other Bush Administration officials had pressed for quick Congressional action, said Thursday night, "THe solutions represented in this legislation might well become a model that could be used in the future."
Pressure to take some kind of action mounted in Congress all day Thursday despite vigorous lobbying the unions to keep Congress from intervening. In addition to reports of the shutdown's effect on trade and manufacturing, the lawmakers faced the prospect that it might spread to commuter services along the heavily traveled Northeast corridor from Boston to Washington by 12:01 A.M. today.
 
Outrage by Labor
 On Wednesday, unions negotiating with Amtrak and separately with Conrail, a freight railroad whose tracks carry many commuter trains, agreed not to strike those railroads at least until today. But the machinists union began picketing one large freight railroad, CSX, and the railroad industry retaliated by shutting down freight service nationwide.
On Thursday, labor leaders strongly denounced the proposed legislation, saying it would rob union members of their right to strike. In a joint statement, seven railroad unions and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said they opposed "any action by Congress to intervene in these railroad labor-management disputes."
The unions said that if Congress felt it must act to stop the strike, the least objectionable option would be to extend the negotiations.
"We would vigorously oppose any other intervention, including the imposition of binding arbitration in any form," the statement said.
 
2 Days to Restore Service
 After the proposal passed the House but before the Senate voted on it, the Association of American Railroads grudgingly endorsed it. "We are concerned about launching into a new process untested in the railroad industry," said Edwin L. Harper, the trade association's president. "But we are even more concerned about the need to bring an end to this strike."
Upon final enactment, the association said, service could be 75 percent restored in a day and fully restored in two days.
In Congress the most vocal opposition to the legislation came from Democrats, many of whom rely on political support from unions. They contended that the railroads had contrived a national emergency through the lockout on the freight lines, thus forcing Congress to intervene and short-circuit the union's right to carry out a strike. Representative Gerry Sikorski, a Democrat of Minnesota, said on the House floor, "What we are doing is rewarding the railroads and punishing the unions."
In fact, 124 Democrats in the House voted against the measure while only 112 favored it. The split among Republicans was 136 in favor and 15 against.
 
Idled Freight Railroads
 Most of the nation's freight railroads shut down at 12:01 A.M. Wednesday in response to a limited strike against one of them, CSX. Amtrak has been hobbled by the shutdown because most of the trains outside the Northeast run on lines owned by the idled freight railroads.
The legislation taken up Thursday was crafted in meetings of lawmakers, Congressional aides and Administration officials. The meetings began Wednesday evening and continued virtually without interruption until this afternoon.
Presenting the legislation in the House Subcommittee on Transportation and Hazardous Materials this afternoon, Representative Al Swift, a Democrat of Washington, said, "I have no doubt that all the involved parties will wish we had done something else."
 
Letting Arbitrator Decide
 The crucial compromise in the bill involves applying the mediation technique borrowed from multi-million-dollar salary disputes between major-league baseball.
If the railroads and the unions fail to resolve their differences during the 20-day negotiating period, they would each be required to submit a "last best" contract to a panel of three arbitrators who would then pick between the offers. This process would extend no more than 15 days beyond the end of the negotiating period.
The unions would pick one arbitrator, the railroads would pick another, and those two people would choose the third who would do the actual work of supervising negotiations and then conduct the binding arbitration if necessary.
The arbitrator's decision would then be submitted to the President, and unless he disapproved within three days, it would have the force of law. If the President rejected it, the unions would be free to strike and the railroads could engage in lockouts.
 
History of Intervention
 "I can't imagine a situation in which the President would disapprove the decision of the abitrator," said Mr. Card, the Transportation Secretary.
As a result of Government intervention, a nationwide railroad strike has not been allowed to proceed freely since the shopmen's strike of 1922. On 10 occasions this century, individual companies or the nationwide system of rail carriers have been officially seized by the military through Presidential order to prevent strikes.
"The baseball solution steers a course right between the demands of labor and management and sets up a process that encourages them to negotiate with each other rather than waiting for Congress to legislate a contract," said Representative Dennis E. Eckart, a Democrat of Ohio who is chief sponsor of the legislation and is credited with suggesting the arbitration scheme.
In more than nine hours of hearings Wednesday, unions leaders spoke against any Congressional tampering with their right to strike, and railroad officials asked the lawmakers to immediately impose a settlement on the unions without further negotiations.
When the labor action started Wednesday, two unions announced a 48-hour moratorium on any action against Amtrak, the Federally subsidized passenger rail carrier. That deadline was set to expire less than six hours after the House committee act ed, and union leaders had refused to commit themselves on a course of action if the deadline came while legislation was still working its way through Congress.
"I am skeptical of any arbitration process imposed by Congress," said Mac Fleming, president of the Brother hood of Maintenance of Way Employees, one of the unions involved in the dispute with Amtrak.
 
The President's Role
 Throughout the day on Thursday, President Bush and Administration officials made public statements pressing Congress to take immediate action. "I urge the House and Senate to act to end this strike today, the national interest re quires no less," the President said this morning.

HEADLINE: Emergency or Ploy?;
Railroads Can Turn Sense of Crisis To Advantage Under 1926 Labor Law

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
As Congress confronted a costly railroad labor dispute, the antagonists bitterly disputed whether the shutdown of most of the nation's freight railroads was a crisis created by hardline unions or a disruption devised by railroads taking advantage of a decades-old labor law intended to encourage negotiation.
The debate goes to the heart of labor relations in the railroad industry, for on this issue hinges the rights of rail unions to strike, even in a limited fashion, against an industry that has been increasingly aggressive in cutting its labor costs. 
 In three separate sets of contract talks -- one involving machinists and the entire freight rail industry, another with maintenance workers and the freight line Conrail, and the third involving several unions and the passenger line Amtrak -- the unions tried to take the offensive without causing so much disruption that Congress would step in on the industry's side.
But to the unions' dismay, the rail industry on Wednesday turned a regional machinist strike against one big freight line into a nationwide shutdown.
 
Neither Side Pleased
 That brought Congress reluctantly into the fray, and the solution that Congress put together pleased neither the unions nor the railroads. That solution ordered that the shutdown end and established binding arbitration to resolve the two sides' differences.
"We are definitely, absolutely, unequivocally opposed to any process that has binding arbitration," said Mac Fleming, president of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, which is wrangling over new contracts with Amtrak and the Consolidated Rail Corporation.
"If the Congress orders us back to work without our basic fundamental right to strike, then Congress is not doing us any favor," he said.
The railroads had adamantly urged Congress to put an end to the strike, but not to alter in any way the earlier nonbinding recommendations of mediating boards, which the unions rejected a month ago. The railroads had hoped that the nationwide freight shutdown would lead to Congress's imposing those terms on the unions.
Rail labor laws make strikes a last resort, but strikes are not flatly prohibited as long as there have first been long negotiations, and binding arbitration is not usually involved in the elaborate process by which rail contracts are negotiated.
 
Tortuous Negotiations
 In the current disputes, the railroads appear to be making careful use of the negotiating process, which is far different from the norm in other industries. Their goal has been to settle without a strike, despite the seemingly insurmountable differences with the unions over wages, work rules and back pay.
Under the Railway Labor Act of 1926, labor unions can strike only after completing an elaborate negotiating process that can last for years. First the workers must talk directly to their employers. Next, if no progress can be made, talks must resume under the auspices of the National Mediation Board, a Federal agency created to handle labor disputes of railroads and airlines, which cannot dictate binding terms but can keep the sides talking indefinitely.
Even after a mediation board concedes failure, the President can name another panel, known as a Presidential Emergency Board, which reviews the negotiations and drafts a proposed settlement.
The emergency board's proposals are not binding, but after rejecting them, the unions cannot strike and the companies cannot impose new contract terms without first waiting through "cooling-off" periods. These provide a month in which the adversaries can, if they want, engage in last-ditch talks and avoid a strike.
 
Deadlines Coincide
 Only if a strike is so crippling that it constitutes an emergency does Congress step in.
Each of the three separate labor disputes now coming to a head went through this long process separately, starting on different dates and meeting on different schedules. But in each case, the mediation board and the emergency board acted on the three disputes all at once, so that the final cooling-off period in the disputes ended simultaneously early Wednesday.
Perhaps this development, which added to the sense of emergency, was nothing more than a coincidence. But for some time, the railroads have recognized that with careful timing they could turn the negotiating system to their advantage.
Just over a year ago, in a letter to other railroad chiefs discussing the merits of the Railway Labor Act, Robert Schmiege, the chief executive of the Chicago and NorthWestern line, pointed out that individual railroads were not able to withstand a prolonged strike and needed to coordinate their strategies under the law.
"Railroads need a legal framework which makes it difficult for unions to create economic tests of strength," he wrote. "Railroads need a framework that permits us to tactically manage the sequencing of the bargaining and mediation phases."
 
Creating a Crisis
 Mr. Schmiege, urging his colleagues to maintain a unified stance, wrote, "Without the threat that a labor crisis will affect the national economy, our companies are at a terrible disadvantage."
At the end of the latest cooling-off period this week, when the International Association of Machinists struck a single railroad, CSX Corporation, railroads all over the country retaliated by shutting down their operations. That created just the kind of labor crisis Mr. Schmiege had described and prompted Congress to act even though the machinists did not strike nationwide and the other unions chose not to strike Amtrak or Conrail.
At first, the Association of American Railroads argued that the freight lines had no practical choice but to shut down all operations. They claimed that the nation's freight system was "completely integrated" and that interruptions to service anywhere in the country would inevitably ripple through the whole system.
But when the unions pointed out that most of CSX's routes were also served by the Norfolk & Southern line, the railroads offered another rationale for shutting down from coast to coast.
If CSX alone were struck, it might quickly be forced to capitulate to the unions, who would then simply turn their striking power upon another railroad, the railroads said.
Wynn Henderson, the editor of Straight Lines, a labor union newspaper published in Minneapolis, said that the railroads have repeatedly learned in recent years the value of using supposed emergencies to make Congress the ultimate arbiter of rail labor disputes.
As Mr. Henderson sees it, these precedents have left the railroads knowing "that if they just stonewalled, that they could count on the Administration and Congress to eventually intervene to stop any strike, and to impose as law recommendations that would give them more than they could achieve through any process of negotiation."

HEADLINE: INDUSTRIES GAINING BROAD FLEXIBILITY ON AIR POLLUTION

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
The Bush Administration today issued a rule that will give manufacturers broad authority to increase substantially the amount of hazardous pollutants they can pour into the atmosphere beginning in the mid-1990's.
The Environmental Protection Agency reluctantly issued the new rule, which had been championed by the President's Council on Competitiveness, a Cabinet group headed by Vice President Dan Quayle. The rule will be central to a system of pollution permits that will be established over the next 10 years under the Clean Air Act of 1990. 
 Chemical and drug manufacturers, concerned about the costs of meeting standards in the Clean Air Act, had sought the rule, saying they needed a flexible standard so they could make changes in equipment or production practices that might cause them to exceed air pollution limits.
 
Discretion to Emit More
 Under the new rule, a company can increase the amount of pollution it emits into the atmosphere by up to 245 tons a year without public notice or hearings if it says it is forced to do so by a change in production methods. The company can do this by applying for an increase, and while the application is pending, it may go ahead with its plans.
"Sometimes you have requirements issued by a state or the Federal government to change a product or a process," Dan Lacy, vice president for corporate communications at Ashland Oil said in explaining why the rule would be helpful. "You have certain restrictions on the amount of time you have to do it in. If you are facing that kind of deadline and you're waiting to get a permit to proceed, then that puts the business in a bind."
A giant refinery typically emits millions of pounds of pollutants into the air each year, but small manufacturing plants generally discharge only a fraction of that amount.
The Environmental Protection Agency has 45 days to reject or approve the application, while states have up to 90 days.
 
Waxman Is Furious
 President Bush often cites the passage of the Clean Air Act as one of the singular achievements of his Presidency, a claim he repeated again on Wednesday in an interview. Enacted on Nov. 15, 1990, the law was designed to control virtually every important source of air pollution and substantially reduce health and environmental damage caused by acid rain, smog, urban ozone pollution, toxic chemicals and destruction of the earth's atmospheric ozone shield.
But one of the principal authors of the act, Representative Henry A. Waxman, a Democrat of California, said that the rule issued today eviscerated the law.
"This is a massive loophole, written for political purposes, that carves the heart out of the Clean Air Act," Mr. Waxman said. He called the rule illegal and predicted that it would be challenged in court.
The new rule was also being cited by state air pollution-control officials, some Democrats in Congress and national environmental leaders as more evidence for their argument that the President has blunted the law's effect. He has done this, they said, by missing legal deadlines for issuing some important rules and by altering others to make them friendlier to business.
The Council on Competitiveness, which has played a central role in the White House's management of the law, is already the defendant in separate lawsuits by New York State and Mr. Waxman.
The final rule on permits will not begin to take effect until at least 1995, the E.P.A. said today. States have until November 1993 to complete their pemit programs and to submit them to the environmental agency for review. The agency has until November 1994 to approve state programs. Companies have until 1995 to begin applying for permits, which are to be issued from 1995 through the end of the decade.
The Council on Competitiveness has attracted support from industrial executives and increasing criticism from environmental groups and Democrats because of its growing influence in reviewing, halting, and at times helping to write new regulations, particularly those concerned with environmental safeguards.
 
Vote Called 'Harassment'
 Today, the House Appropriations Committee acted on a proposal by Representative David E. Skagg, Democrat of Colorado, and voted 30 to 18 to eliminate money for the council's eight-member staff.
David C. Beckwith, the Vice President's spokesman, said today that the committee's vote was "harassment," and that the council would not waver in its objectives. "The same Congressional critics who allege the council was operating illegally have abandoned that tactic in favor of political harassment," said Mr. Beckwith. "The council will continue to uphold and enforce all laws at the least possible cost to jobs, consumers and the economy."
The new rule sets up the framework for states to issue operating permits to roughly 35,000 factories, chemical and pharmaceutical plants, refineries, power plants and other important sources of air pollution. Forty states already have some form of permit program, according to the environmental agency. But under the Clean Air Act, the agency is required to set new minimum, uniform standards and to enforce them.
The disagreement on the rule has produced one of the angriest political struggles in the Administration, between William K. Reilly, the E.P.A. Administrator and Vice President Quayle.
Their disagreement focused on whether factories should be able to increase by small amounts the levels of pollution they are allowed to produce.
Mr. Reilly argued that the increases should be small -- no more than five tons annually per company -- and that the public should have the right to review applications by companies.
Mr. Quayle and the Council on Competitiveness said the increases do not have to be small and companies should be allowed to make them without public review. Mr. Quayle's position was strongly supported by the Chemical Manufacturers Association, drug makers, refiners and other large industries. Industrial executives said they should have the flexibility to make changes in their plants that would increase pollution without having to go through a long and exhausting public review.
 
When Bush Intervened
 Last month, Mr. Bush intervened and decided the issue in favor of Mr. Quayle. At the time, the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency represented Mr. Bush's decision as one with minor pollution consequences. Administration officials said companies would not be allowed to increase their air pollution emissions by more than 40 tons each, or 80,000 pounds, a year. They also said it was likely that the final rule would include a provision allowing states to have a short review period to approve or disapprove the increased pollution.
The final rule issued today goes much further. The rule allows any company to increase its air pollution by up to 245 tons, or 490,000 pounds a year, a significant amount for any manufacturing plant, state air pollution-control authorities said today. The rule also allows plants to make the increases as soon as they apply to states. The E.P.A. has 45 days to reject the application, and states have 90 days to approve or disapprove. The public will not be notified or have an opportunity to intervene unless states write such provisions on their own.
 
Big Regional Effects
 In industrial regions, like the Mississippi River corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge or the Kanawha Valley west of Charleston, W. Va., such increases could total millions of extra pounds of pollutants in the air every year if a number of chemical plants and manufacturers take advantage of the waiver at once.
Directors of state air pollution-control agencies today condemned the new rule, saying it was a giant loophole designed to allow companies to pollute without penalties. The state authorities also said the rule would make it exceedingly difficult to enforce portions of the Clean Air Act designed to control urban smog, and they predicted that many states would ignore the Administration's regulation and enact tougher standards.
"We don't intend to put this regulation into effect; I don't think many states will," said Thomas C. Jorling, the Commissioner at the New York Department of Environmental Conservation.
But there are some states, like West Virginia, that are prohibited by state law from exceeding Federal environmental standards. "It's an awful rule," G. Dale Farley, the director of the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission, said of the new rule. "The whole point of requiring plants to get operating permits is to have some handle on overall air pollution emissions. It allows states to have a management scheme. With this provision, the only thing states can do to keep on top of the situation is just to have a rubber stamp that says, 'We object.' When the applications come in, we stamp them and that will prevent the extra emissions."
Mr. Waxman, in asserting that the new rule is illegal, said the Clean Air Act had directed the Administration to require public notification and review for any modifications in a company's permit. He said in an interview today that the provision for public notification had been included in the law to make it much more difficult for companies to exceed air pollution levels on their operating permits.
But William G. Rosenberg, the E.P.A.'s assistant administrator for Air and Radiation, said today that the new rule would provide the nation with cleaner air by making it easier to enforce the law.


GRAPHIC: April 1991. Administrator William K. Reilly of the Environmental Protection Agency first proposes a rule setting forth procedures governing pollution permits under the Clean Air Act. The proposal requires public notification and public hearings before any company can exceed the level of polution on its operating permit. That proposal goes to the White House for review.
Chronology: "Policing Pollution: 15 Months, 1 Rule"
 May 1991. The Council on Competitveness reviews the proposal and adds provision to allow manufacturers and chemical companies to increase pollution levels without public notification. Under the revised proposal, states have a week to object to applications from companies seeking to modify their operating permits. If a state objects within 7 days, the company can not increase pollution. If a state does not object, the increase can be made.
 Summer 1991. E.P.A. General Counsel Donald Elliott issues a memorandum that says it is illegal to elimate public review. The Clean Air Act signed by Mr. Bush specifically directed the E.P.A. to write a rule that allowed the public to intervene in porposals by companies to increase their polution, he says. Other legal experts in the Government concur, including Charles Bowsher, the Comptroller General, and Richard B. Stewart, the Assistant Attorney General for Lands and Natural Resources.
 October 1991. Mr. Reilly sends up another proposal that once again calls for the public to have the right to be notified and intervene if a company asks to increase its pollution levels. Under the newly revised proposal, if such increases were under five tons, states are directed to expedite the application. Mr. Reilly issues the proposal to meet a November 1991 deadline for making the fule final. Vice President Quayle and the Council on Competitiveness reject this latest proposal.
 May 1992. The President decides the issue in favor of Mr. Quayle and directs Mr. Reilly to write a rule that eliminates public review. Mr. Reilly refuses to issue the rule until the Department of Justice declares such a rule legal. Mr. Bush orders Attorney General William P. Barr to prepare a memorandum to that effect.

Bush's Roles on World Stage: Triumphs, but Troubles, Too

SERIES: The Bush Record -- Second article of a series.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Conventional wisdom holds that there are two George Bushes: the skilled architect of foreign policy and the neglectful caretaker of domestic affairs. Even some people on the Bush team have come to cultivate this image, since it allows them to explain away the President's shortcomings at home by saying he was too busy saving the world abroad.
But in fact George Bush has also shown at least two personalities in his conduct of the nation's foreign policy. He has often really been the consummate seasoned statesman, but at other times he has seemed distracted and ineffective in a world undergoing dizzying change. 
 There was the George Bush who, working the telephones and personal contacts with other heads of state, skillfully managed the Western alliance's response to the cataclysmic revolutions in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, helping to insure that one of this century's great upheavals went off relatively peacefully.
 
'We Should Get Credit'
 There was the George Bush who was the galvanizing force in building an international coalition to roll back the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and strip Baghdad of its weapons of mass destruction.
And there was the George Bush who encouraged his Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, to bring together the first full-scale peace talks between Israel and all its Arab neighbors. More recently, it was the George Bush who with Mr. Baker negotiated sweeping nuclear arms cuts with the Russians that were highly advantageous to Washington.
"I think we'd get blamed if things went wrong," Mr. Bush said in an interview, assessing his record; therefore, "we should get credit if they've gone right, and they've gone right. I think handling the changes inside what used to be the Soviet Union has been good, and I am very pleased that ancient enemies are talking to each other in the Middle East. And, of course, Desert Storm was a significant and major accomplishment, because it said to aggressor nations: you can't just go take over a friendly country next door."
But there has been another George Bush as well -- the one who built up Saddam Hussein of Iraq before the Persian Gulf war in the mistaken hope that money and favors would modify his behavior. The George Bush whose disastrous trip to Japan early this year only underscored the degree to which his Administration had ignored a fraying relationship with Tokyo. There was the George Bush who virtually had to be shamed into giving aid to Russia by former President Richard M. Nixon. The George Bush who after the end of the cold war seemed to lose his moorings and began seesawing between engagement and disengagement in such messy post-cold-war problems as Haiti and Yugoslavia.
And finally there was the George Bush who, as Vice President and President, holds at least some responsibility for the ballooning Federal deficit, which has deprived his Administration of precisely the dollar resources it now needs to help consolidate the democratic revolutions the United States helped spawn from Managua to Prague.
"When future historians look back on the Bush foreign policy they will find a lot to like about it," said Michael R. Beschloss, who has written several histories of American foreign policy. "But they will also find it largely reactive. The new world order was a creation not of George Bush but of Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. They were the event-makers. Bush reacted constructively and creatively to their initiatives and concessions."
 
Policy of 'Status Quo Plus'
 Mr. Bush was most comfortable when he was acting within the boundaries of his traditional cold-war framework. His performance was much less consistent and commanding when the Soviet Union came apart, the cold war ended and he was "called upon to fashion a new template for American foreign policy," Mr. Beschloss said.
If the Bush team came into office with a philosophy, the Administration's first foreign policy review described it best. It was dubbed "status quo plus" -- preserve the cold-war balance of power where necessary while promoting incremental change in relations with Moscow where openings presented themselves.
While it did not openly disdain human rights, the Bush team's refusal to use trade sanctions to modify China's human rights behavior and its lack of concern for democracy in Kuwait after the gulf war underscored that the issue was never its first principle. But the real problem was that soon after Mr. Bush's watch began, the status quo simply collapsed. When it did, the Bush team's instinctive prudence and alliance-management skills seemed to serve the nation well, at least at first. Indeed, when asked what he is most proud of, Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, said it was the liberation of Eastern Europe, the unification of Germany and the dissolution of the Soviet empire "without a shot being fired" across the old East-West divide.
 
'We Were Instrumental'
 "Now, I am not saying we necessarily did this all by ourselves," he said, "but we were instrumental in the way it happened. I think if you asked people 10 years ago if the Soviet Union was going to collapse, would it be this way, I think most people would say no. It is probably going to take place in the context of a grand confrontation."
But prudence is an instinct not a vision. It has its limits, and those limits became clear later in the Bush Administration when the President was called upon not to be just reactive. The times required a proactive, creative leader.
If his public statements are any measure, Mr. Bush was not prepared for this new, unexpected role. Indeed, for a President so preoccupied with foreign policy, it seems odd that he has not given even one memorable foreign policy speech. For Mr. Bush, the theories, the speeches, "the vision thing," as he put it, always came later -- if at all.
Even the hallmark phrase the White House began using midway through the term to sum up Mr. Bush's approach to the changing world came into being by happenstance, not through any real planning.
In late August 1990, Mr. Scowcroft was sitting around the Nonantum resort in Kennebunkport, Me., talking with White House press aides about how to explain the need to confront the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. "Tell them we can't just let Iraq get away with this -- there is a new world order developing," an aide recalled Mr. Scowcroft remarking
"New world order" -- the White House press team liked the sound of that. It was catchy. It was fresh. It had potential. Later, two members of the White House press team were in their office at another hotel, the Shawmut, when Pam Olson, a White House correspondent for CNN, came in.
"We told her it's 'a new world order,' " one of the officials recalled. "She liked it, and 30 minutes later it was on CNN. So the 'new world order' was born at the Shawmut Hotel. It was really just an accident. The philosophy came later."
Unification of Germany
Bush Aids Process Behind the Scenes
 By most accounts, Mr. Bush reacted slowly but effectively to the problems that awaited him when he took office. This was Phase I of his foreign policy.
Behind the scenes he helped refashion the world from one in which the United States confronted the Soviets from Germany to Nicaragua to one in which Moscow and Washington could solve problems together in both those countries and in others, too. His aides and allies say Mr. Bush's work to bring about the peaceful unification of Germany is one of the least known but most important acts of his Presidency.
"Behind the scenes Bush stage-managed the outcome," said Peter Rodman, a former member of the Bush National Security Council. "He stiffened Chancellor Kohl's spine on the question of staying in NATO, when there were great pressures on him to leave. He stroked Mitterand to get the French to re-endorse the NATO alliance and also agreed to adapt NATO, to make it less threatening and address Gorbachev's fears. You really could have had an explosion and an unraveling, and you had just the opposite."
 
Helped by Soviet Decisions
 Mr. Bush's attention to all the parties was undeniably helpful. But Germany would not have reunified smoothly if the Germans had not been willing to buy the Soviets out of Berlin, and had Mr. Gorbachev not been ready to take the billions of dollars that Bonn gave him to resettle his troops and shore up his economy. And at the same time, it was while Mr. Bush was focused on Germany that his Administration went on autopilot in the Middle East and slipped into its policy of continuing to build up Iraq against Iran, even when the Iraqi leader's threatening behavior clearly argued for a new approach.
Mr. Bush's instinctive pragmatism also played well in Latin America, where the President dropped the Reagan Administration's confrontational approach and chose instead to compromise. Again, he was helped by the Soviet retreat and withdrawal of aid from its clients.
"After a decade of civil war, the Bush approach offered space for all of the actors to negotiate terms that permited peaceful political change," said Robert A. Pastor, an adviser on Latin America to President Jimmy Carter.
 
Little Focus on Latin America
 But the same political pragmatism that enabled Mr. Bush to disengage from Ronald Reagan's politically contentious contra policy in Nicaragua also prompted his Administration to focus on the issue only as long as it took to defuse an explosive political problem.
Since its first year and a half, the Administration has devoted little attention to Latin America. Just when aid and attention are needed to consolidate some of the infant democracies America helped create, the Bush policy for the hemisphere seems to have lost energy and focus.
Mr. Bush certainly acted decisively in December 1989 when he ordered the invasion of Panama and seizure of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. But the tear gas Mr. Bush inhaled when he returned to Panama early this month was just one more demonstration that the consolidation of democracy is much more difficult than its forceful installation.
 
The Gulf Crisis
Paving the Way For Peace Talks
 The largest challenge President Bush has faced was the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Even his foes now credit him with deft handling of the crisis after the invasion; he built a coalition unlike any before in modern history. This was Phase II of his foreign policy.
Out of the war, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker are also given much credit for engineering an opening for Arab-Israeli peace talks.
The Middle East was one area of the world where the Bush team actually worked to overturn a status quo -- in this case the stubborn deadlock over the West Bank.
So far, though, this effort has not produced any concrete results -- largely because it has been based entirely on external pressures and not on any fundamental change of view by Israel, the Palestinians or the Arab states. But the stunning victory of the Labor Party in Israel this week suggests that Israel may now undergo precisely that sort of internal change. If that leads to a breakthrough in the peace talks, that will be attributable, at least in part, to the environment created by the Administration's Madrid peace conference.
 
An Election Setback
Politics Intrude On Foreign Policy
 Phase III of the Bush foreign policy began on November 5, 1991 -- the day the Republicans lost the Senate race in Pennsylvania to a Democratic upstart, Harris Wofford.
The White House drew a hard lesson from that shock; Mr. Bush's success in foreign policy had been turned into a political liability because of the perception that it had come at the expense of domestic policy. On that election day last November, Mr. Bush postponed his long-planned visit to Japan. Then three weeks later, realizing this had been a mistake, he rescheduled the visit, but turned it into an automobile sales mission that was as embarrassing as it was unproductive.
In some ways, Mr. Bush has been lurching back and forth ever since -- and not just because of political concerns. The concurrent problem was that, as the Soviet Union disintegrated, so too did the broad framework for the Bush foreign policy.
 
Soviet Compass Is Lost
 The Soviet Union had been the main problem, around which Mr. Bush's reactive foreign policy was organized and, later, the main partner for many of its diplomatic endeavors. Once it disappeared, the defining core of the policy was lost, and the Administration began having trouble sorting out what exactly was the national interest, where should the United States intervene and with whom this country should work. As one Administration official put it: "There was nothing big to react to anymore."
To make matters worse, foreign policy issues increasingly grew to be intrastate quandaries -- ethnic and national disputes, or environmental problems -- instead of interstate questions. Rather than dealing with the implications of Iraq's invading Kuwait, the kind of problem the President clearly understood, he found himself called upon to confront Serbia's threat to Bosnia or turmoil in Haiti -- situations about which he seemed to know little and care even less.
Even critics of the President acknowledge that he should not have been expected to provide magic answers for these new and beguiling problems. But the Administration seemed to find all these new quandaries disorienting. This seems to account for the oscillations in the Administration's dealings with the crises in Haiti and Yugoslavia; first he ignored them, then there was a sudden burst of activity, and then inactivity again.
Traditional foreign policy problems could be dealt with by mobilizing troops or negotiating arms control agreements. But the conflicts in Yugoslavia and Haiti, the destruction of rain forests or the democratization of the former Soviet Union all required not just creative solutions but money -- money for United Nations peacekeeping operations, money to help Russia make the transition from a Communist to a market economy, money that is no longer available.
This is so in part because Mr. Bush grew to be a victim of the Reagan Administration he had helped to lead. The deficit ballooned during the Reagan years. And Reagan Administration officials even boasted in memoirs that this was deliberate. They said they hoped that under the burden of a record deficit, there would be intense pressure to starve liberal social programs.
 
Hampered by the Deficit
 But years later, that came back to haunt the Bush Administration and tie its hands in the one area where it wanted and needed money. As the historian Ronald Steel put it: "The huge deficit made it impossible for the Administration to fund an activist foreign policy. When all of these opportunities to develop free markets and democracies were out there in Eastern Europe and Russia, we could not afford to nurture them."
The end result, argued Stanley Hoffmann, a Harvard University European affairs expert, is that American foreign policy today seems reduced to two conflicting statements: We are the only superpower left, and we are broke so we can't do anything.
"During the first few years," Mr. Hoffmann said, "I think the Bush people thought they saw the future almost the way it looked in 1945 -- we would be clearly the No. 1 superpower, but the Soviet Union would follow our lead. The two great powers and a few lesser ones would do things together. That is not going to happen. Now we have to shut up or put up, and since we don't want to put up, we may have to shut up."

HEADLINE: House Approves Foreign Aid At Lowest Level Since 1977

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
The House voted today to spend $13.8 billion on foreign aid, the lowest total since 1977 and an amount the Bush Administration called "inadequate."
Final passage came on a surprisingly wide margin as the bill was supported by 297 members and opposed by 124. Republicans backed it narrowly, 92 to 72. Democrats voted for it by a wide margin, 205 to 51. The House's one independent voted no. 
 The bill withstood complaints that it was more important to spend money on problems at home than abroad for two major reasons. First, under the 1990 budget agreement, cuts in foreign spending cannot be transferred to increase domestic spending.
Second, the bill had been trimmed in the Appropriations Committee before it reached the floor, enabling lawmakers to vote for it and still say they had voted for cuts. The $13.8 billion total was $1.3 billion below the Administration request and $628 million under last year's appropriation.
The bill included $417 million in aid for the former Soviet republics, a provision that was hardly remarked on in debate. This bilateral aid is only a small part of the assistance the Administration hopes to provide. Legislation to put more money into the International Monetary Fund to help the former republics is now being kept from the Senate floor by a filibuster over a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget.
Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the subcommittee that handled the appropriation, spoke proudly of one provision in the bill that the Administration attacked, which would gradually end military grants to NATO countries. He called it an end to "the free lunch."
The bill also included a $20 million item for the United Nations Population Fund. The Administration threatened a veto over that issue because it said the fund "supports a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China." House Republicans, who considered offering an amendment to delete $1.15 billion for the World Bank, backed down after Administration protests and proposed cuts in the whole bill that totaled only $60 million.
But Representative John Miller, Republcian of Washington, said the $30.9 million reduction for the World Bank was a "very small step" to warn the Bank to "stop the environmentally destructive loans that have caused hundreds of thousands of people to be kicked out of their homes."
A final amendment adopted today cut $24 million from development assistance. Its author, Representative Dan Burton of Indiana, said it was intended to punish India for human rights violations, repressive laws and mistreatment of prisoners in Kashmir and the Punjab. But the amendment did not specify which nation should be cut, so it could affect any country receiving that kind of assistance.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN -- Voices: Boston;
Mixed Reviews on Bush's Foreign Decisions

 BODY:
Political experts, local officials and ordinary voters in several cities were asked to appraise President Bush's record on foreign policy.
 
Mark Brogioli
27 years old; insurance adjuster at Safety Insurance in downtown Boston
He's paid no attention to domestic affairs, or very little -- he's spent too much time concentrating on international affairs. I think he should be a little more interested in what's going on at home. He's lucky that things have sort of fallen into place as far as what's going on in the former Soviet Union -- I think that would have happened regardless of who was President. He seems to be letting Russia make the moves and then responding to them. 
 I don't feel George Bush really cares about the individuals in Yugoslavia. China's most-favored-nation trading status -- he claims that it's being done for democracy and whatnot, but I don't really agree with that. A lot of people I talk to support Bush, give George Bush complete credit for the Berlin wall falling, for the Soviet Union collapsing, and I really don't think he had that much to do with any of that.
 
Seyom Brown

In general, I think that there's been a squandering of opportunity for constructive leadership in the dramatically changed international system. What you have, unfortunately, is petty electoral considerations and small-mindedness masquerading under his favorite term, "prudence."
With the end of the cold war it was really a great opportunity for leadership that was handed down to Bush by Reagan on a silver platter. the economic crisis in the Soviet Union that accompanied perestroika really called out for the United States to take the lead in fashioning a Marshall Plan-type of response to the massive reconstruction needs in the post-Soviet areas and also in the Soviet Union itself.
Well, Bush wasted most of the first year of his Administration with what the Administration said was a review of Soviet policy, and from my perspective he played to the conservative gallery with postures of diplomatic toughness toward Gorbachev -- and I think this played right into the hands of Gorbachev's own conservative critics in the Soviet Union.

I think he's been an excellent leader in foreign policy. I think the most impressive accomplishment is the relation with the increasingly democratized Soviet Union. I think they will move increasingly toward a more capitalistic and democratic approach to government, which in the long run, I expect and hope, will make them more our allies. One of the key things he's done is to be careful not to prematurely commit loyalty to any subgroup in the Soviet Union.
I think it would be very tempting, for an inexperienced President in foreign policy, to give too much attention to who happened to be the particular person in power in a situation where things are changing very quickly. I think the President has done a very good job of maintaining United States' interests.
[The question of balance between domestic and foreign policy] in some ways is a false distinction because in some cases, like in the field of environmental policy, the international and domestic issues merge. He has been quite constructive in taking a balanced position on the need for both environmental protection and economic growth. I think that in the long run Bush is right that China is increasingly recognized as a superpower. and I think it's better for us to develop relations at the same time that we try to coax them and encourage them into a more humane approach toward their citizenry.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Platform;
In a Final Draft, Democrats Reject a Part of Their Past

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
In a final draft of its platform for this year's elections, the Democratic Party not only attacks the Reagan-Bush Administrations, but also spurns much of the "big government theory" that Democrats have embraced for decades.
The Democratic National Committee today issued the final draft, which reflects the political philosophy of Gov. Bill Clinton, who has clinched the party's Presidential nomination. 
 The draft is implicitly critical of the party's old thinking and old solutions.
 "We reject both the do-nothing government of the last 12 years as well as the big government theory that says we can hamstring business and tax and spend our way to prosperity," the draft says. "Instead, we offer a third way."
The "third way" is a nickname for Mr. Clinton's political philosophy, which, he says, tries to steer a course between laissez-faire capitalism and welfare-state economics.
Much of the platform echoes themes developed by the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of moderate Democrats headed until last year by Mr. Clinton.
 
New View of Federal Role
 The draft platform rejects the assumption that the government can provide a solution to every social problem.
The 1992 platform reflects an effort by some Democrats to move away from old-style liberalism, rooted in the political orthodoxy of the New Deal and labor unions, and toward a more centrist position.
But Mark E. Steitz, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said it was inaccurate to describe the 1992 platform as being simply "to the right" of platforms adopted by the party since 1972. Democrats prefer to say that they have transcended the old left-right divisions.
In addition, Mr. Steitz said, some issues that have provoked fights among Democrats in the past have faded away with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Those issues include the United States policy on Central America and on nuclear weapons.
The Democrats' draft contains many themes that could be accepted by President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle. It calls for a cut in the capital gains tax for people who make long-term investments in new technology. It says, "We honor business as a noble endeavor." And it demands a restoration of "basic American values," including a greater emphasis on "work, family and individual responsibility."
 
Opposing Bush's Policies
 But on other issues, the platform offers stark alternatives to the policies of Presidents Bush and Reagan.
The Democratic draft calls for a Federal law to protect a woman's right to have an abortion, regardless of her ability to pay. It says employers should be required to grant unpaid leave to workers caring for newborns or sick relatives. In 1990, Mr. Bush vetoed such a plan.
The Democrats also promise to "provide civil rights protection for gay men and lesbians and an end to Defense Department discrimination." Without being specific, the platform suggests that wealthy people should pay higher taxes, and it endorses tax relief for "middle-class Americans" and for families with children.
The Democratic platform also says, "We will oppose Republican efforts to gut the Clean Air Act in the guise of competitiveness." It says that corporate executives, "who pay themselves 100 times what they pay the average worker, shouldn't get big raises unrelated to performance."
The platform committee will take final action Saturday on the draft. It will go to the floor of the Democratic National Convention in New York on July 14.
The Democratic platform committee is headed by Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California. Clinton delegates account for a majority of the committee. The drafting was coordinated by Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico and John D. Holum, a Washington lawyer who was active in the Presidential campaigns of George S. McGovern and Gary Hart.
The Democrats' 1992 platform says, "We oppose the Bush Administration's efforts to bankrupt the public school system -- the bedrock of democracy -- through private school vouchers." It deplores "savage inequalities among public schools across the land."
The Democrats, like many Republicans, endorse the goal of "access to quality, affordable health care" for all Americans. But with Democrats divided on the details of a national health-care plan, their platform does not specify how to achieve that goal. It calls for "tough controls on health costs."
In the draft of its platform, the Democratic Party says, "We offer a new social contract based neither on callous do-nothing Republican neglect, nor on an outdated faith in programs as the solution to every problem."
 
Buttressing the Family
 The Democrats' strategy for "strengthening the family" would be palatable to many Republicans: "Governments don't raise children; people do. People who bring children into this world have a responsibility to care for them and give them values, motivation and discipline. Children should not have children."
The draft also says, "The private sector is the engine of our economy and the main source of national wealth." But it denounces "those at the top of the totem pole, the inside traders, quick-buck artists and savings and loan kingpins who looked out for themselves and not for the country" in the 1980's.
Rather than calling for large new Federal programs, the Democratic platform looks to private voluntary associations to help solve social problems. It says the success of American democracy depends on the strength of families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, and civic and charitable organizations -- groups where "the values and character of our citizens are formed."
The platform affirms "our longstanding special relationship with Israel" and promises that Democrats will continue the Bush Administration's efforts to foster Arab-Israeli peace talks. But it accuses the Administration of encouraging Arabs to believe that the United States will deliver "unilateral concessions" from Israel.

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Cuts Growth Forecast for the Year

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 25

 BODY:
Drastically cutting its growth forecast for the year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says that the world economy remains mired in uncertainty, but predicts that a recovery will take hold in 1993.
In its semiannual report, the 24-nation organization slashed its estimate for economic expansion in 1992 to an anemic 1.8 percent from the 2.2 percent it had predicted in December. The group attributed the enduring economic weakness to high German interest rates, the bursting of Japan's speculative bubble, Britain's persistent recession and wariness among businesses and consumers. 
 But the group, which is based in Paris, suggested that while the United States recovery had been hesitant so far, it should gather pace in the second half of the year, contributing to overall growth of 3 percent in the O.E.C.D. countries next year.
"The positive indicators of the economic situation in the United States are now more numerous, and confidence in a recovery is spreading," the O.E.C.D. report said.
The report predicted that American economic growth would be 3.75 percent in the second half of 1992 and 2.1 percent for the entire year. In 1993, the organization said, United States economic expansion should reach 3.6 percent; it foresaw inflation increasing marginally to 3.2 percent, from 3.1 percent this year.
Inflation for all O.E.C.D. countries should total 3.5 percent this year and 3.2 percent in 1993, down from 4.1 percent in 1991, the report said.
Despite its measured optimism for 1993, the O.E.C.D. report was full of gloomy warnings that are certain to figure high on the agenda of leaders of the world's seven leading industrial countries when they gather on July 5 in Munich to review the state of the world economy.
The organization said the current impasse in world trade talks was contributing to a climate of anxiety.
The report also suggested that Germany's fiscal deficit was likely to keep interest rates high in that country and throughout Europe, dampening demand and slowing growth.
The organization warned that economic reform was taking a devastating toll in Eastern Europe, with output likely to slump 18 percent this year in the former Soviet Union and 15 percent in the region as a whole.

HEADLINE: Dow Declines by 6.69 to Finish at 3,284.01

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks ended a listless session with small losses yesterday, as new jitters about earnings kept many investors out of the market.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 6.69 points, to 3,284.01, as volume on the New York Stock Exchange slipped to 183 million shares, from 194.4 million on Wednesday. Advancing issues led declining ones, 861 to 815. 
 The software industry became the latest sector to be hurt by concerns about earnings: Lotus Development said it would not meet second-quarter earnings estimates and that its 1992 profit would be 25 cents a share below estimates. Its stock lost 5 5/8, to 18 3/8. The loss dragged down Borland, off 1 1/4, to 39 1/4, and Microsoft, off 2 1/4, to 70.
Many companies will release second-quarter results in a few weeks, and investors are likely to stay inactive until then, traders said.
 
Weak Economic Data
 In addition, investors are still apprehensive about the recovery after the May durable goods report on Wednesday showed an unexpected 2.4 percent drop in orders -- the steepest since a 5.3 percent drop last December.
The market also remained sensitive to other bad news. Many investors sold shares of British Petroleum after news that its chairman, Robert Horton, had resigned. B.P. lost 6, to 48 3/8. Traders cited concerns that the company's relatively high dividend of $3.99 a share would be cut or eliminated.
Stocks managed to ignore a strong performance in bonds. In late trading, the 30-year Treasury bond was up 19/32 , to yield 7.77 percent, compared with 7.82 percent on Wednesday. Sentiment was helped by a well-bid auction of one-year bills and an unexpected jump in weekly claims for unemployment benefits.
 
Losses in Tobacco
 Shares of some tobacco companies retreated a day after the Supreme Court opened the way for damage suits over cigarettes. Philip Morris slipped 1/2, to 73 1/4; Loews eased, 1 5/8, to 109 3/8; UST fell 1/2, to 27 3/4, and American Brands lost 1/4, to 45 1/8.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 0.71 point, to 403.12; the American Stock Exchange composite lost 0.05, to 374.15; the New York Stock Exchange composite fell 0.28, to 221.53, and the Nasdaq composite closed down 3.19, to 548.20.

HEADLINE: Trade Panel Approves Canada-Lumber Duty

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
In the latest sign that their 1988 free-trade agreement did not settle all trade disputes between the United States and Canada, a Federal trade agency ruled today that imported Canadian lumber had hurt American producers, a decision that will allow the United States to impose a 6.51 percent import duty next month.
Within minutes of the 4-to-2 vote, William A. Dymond, the commercial counselor at the Canadian Embassy, told reporters that Canada would try to overturn the International Trade Commission's ruling by appealing to a binational arbitration panel. 
 The dispute comes as American, Canadian and Mexican negotiators are in the final stages of drafting a North American free-trade agreement, and disputes involving the earlier pact have made it an increasingly controversial model for the next one.
The nature of the decision also reflects a change in the commission's composition, with the addition in recent months of three commissioners who tend to look narrowly at the effect of the imports in question rather than broadly at the political and economic implications of a case.
On Wednesday, the panel ruled in a 4-to-2 vote that the American auto industry had not suffered harm from Japanese mini-van imports.
 
Canadian Success in the U.S.
 Trade experts said that Canadian lumber had a third of the American market while Japanese mini-vans had only an eighth. So the Canadians had more of an opportunity to hurt the American lumber industry by holding down prices.
Over all, the American lumber industry is healthier than the auto industry. But, concentrating narrowly on how trade law is written, the commissioners gave this less weight.
"This is clearly a message to our trading partners and domestic industries that this is a new I.T.C. -- you don't have the predictability that we used to have," said Paula Stern, a former Democratic chairman of the commission.
What happens next in the Canadian lumber case is unclear because of murky language in the 1988 trade pact. The agreement excluded such lumber because that area was addressed in a 1986 memorandum of understanding under which the United States agreed not to impose an import tariff on lumber if instead Canada imposed an export tariff on the same lumber.
Canada canceled the memorandum and its tariff in October, prompting the Commerce Department to file the trade case. Canada contends that since the memorandum no longer exists, lumber is not excluded from the free-trade agreement.
The American lumber industry contends that lumber is exempt, so that any appeal by Canada would have to go to the Federal Government's Court of International Trade in New York instead of a panel of arbitrators from both countries. But Bush Administration officials recently appear increasingly reluctant to side with American industry.
A senior Administration official said this evening that the United States would allow a binational panel to review today's decision. A separate panel will review the Commerce Department's decision in May that set the 6.51 percent duty after concluding that Canadian provinces were subsidizing their exports.
Regardless of appeals, which could last half a year or longer, the Customs Service will begin collecting the 6.51 percent duty next month. Canada exported $2.7 billion worth of softwood lumber, mostly pine boards, studs and beams, to the United States last year, suggesting that duties will total nearly $200 million a year.
C. T. (Kip) Howlett, the chairman of the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports, a lumber industry group in the United States, said today's decision would save 16,000 American jobs while raising the cost of building an average new home by up to $250.
The Commerce Department initially assessed a duty of 14.48 percent on March 6 but reduced it to 6.51 percent after a review in May. The reduction prompted complaints from American logging companies that the Bush Administration had succumbed to lobbying by Canada and was sacrificing the industry for the sake of bilateral relations.
 
Complaints Are Fueled
 Those complaints were fanned this week when James H. Lake, the chairman of a Washington public relations company and now one of the four deputy managers of President Bush's re-election campaign, said he had twice called a senior White House official on the Canadians' behalf.
Mr. Lake's firm -- Robinson, Lake, Lerer & Montgomery -- is one of a dozen Washington public relations, legal and lobbying firms retained by Canada in the case. Mr. Lake said today that after joining the campaign and after the preliminary Commerce Department ruling on March 6, he called Clayton K. Yeutter, who is President Bush's domestic policy adviser. Mr. Lake arranged for Mr. Yeutter to talk to an American lawyer pleading the Canadians' case.
Mr. Lake said the telephone call involved no impropriety because he had not been involved in lumber issues in his new job.
Mr. Yeutter said that while he had spoken to the lawyer, he had never got in touch with the Commerce Department about the lumber case and so had had no effect on the decision. The Journal of Commerce first reported the call on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Havel Calls for Preservation Of United Czechoslovakia

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, June 25

 BODY:
President Vaclav Havel appealed today to Czechs and Slovaks to remain one nation, but he acknowledged that prospects for the 74-year-old union had dimmed.
"Perhaps we must truly divide if we are to unite again," Mr. Havel said, a touch of sadness in his mellifluous baritone voice. 
 His remarks came at the opening session of what may be Czechoslovakia's last federal Parliament. It was a bittersweet occasion, one in which small gestures said a lot about the distance this nation has traveled from its rambunctious "velvet revolution" less than three years ago.
When Mr. Havel, the dissident and playwright who became President, finished his speech, Czech deputies stood to applaud. Most of the Slovak deputies also shuffled to their feet, but did not seem to know what to do with their hands. Some jammed them into their pockets; others held them awkwardly at their sides.
In November 1989, it was Mr. Havel's spontaneous enthusiasm that personified Eastern Europe's most joyous anti-Communist uprising, the 10-day velvet revolution in which hundreds of thousands of people shouted a totalitarian Government out of power.
The Government that emerged from the 1990 elections was among Eastern Europe's most eccentric, filled with writers, intellectuals and actors. Frank Zappa, the American rock star who inspired some of the dissidents, was officially named a cultural envoy.
 
Striking a Moral Tone
 Over the next two years, Mr. Havel repeatedly sought to strike a moral tone as President. For instance, he opposed the parliamentary law that banned senior Communists or secret police collaborators from holding high office in the new Czechoslovakia.
Mr. Havel, who is not affiliated with any party, lost that fight to the increasingly powerful right-wing factions in Parliament. Even as Mr. Havel's international standing was rising, his power to move events in his own country was ebbing steadily.
The divisions that were emerging in Czechoslovakia over these years mirrored those generally in Eastern Europe: Nationalists in Slovakia, many of whom were former Communists, favored softening the rigors of economic "shock therapy." They were allied against the aggressively pro-market capitalists who were increasingly prominent in the Czech lands.
In the June 5-6 elections, Vladimir Meciar's Movement for Democratic Slovakia won the largest number of seats in Slovakia and Vaclav Klaus's Civic Democratic Party prevailed in the Czech regions.
Mr. Meciar and Mr. Klaus, with their diametrically opposed views on economics and the very structure of the Czechoslovak state, recently agreed to slash the size of the federal Government. They also decided on a process under which the two regional Parliaments will agree by Sept. 30 whether, or how, to break up the state.
 
Slovaks to Block Re-Election
 In his speech today, Mr. Havel made it clear that he would not preside over the dissolution of this nation, saying he preferred to create rather than destroy.
Czechoslovakia's Parliament is scheduled to vote next week for a new President; Slovak parties have already pledged to block Mr. Havel's election. If that happens, he could remain until Oct. 5 as interim president.
Mr. Havel defiantly brushed aside rumors in Prague that he might resign, pledging to remain a political figure.
"I don't feel the least reason for resigning, for leaving the stage simply because someone whistles at me to capitulate or because there is on the horizon the possibility of another defeat," he said. "I will not leave the ship only because it is rocking."

HEADLINE: Couple Indicted in Kidnapping of Exxon Executive

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 25

 BODY:
The New Jersey couple accused of kidnapping Sidney J. Reso were indicted by a Federal grand jury here today, as Federal prosecutors asserted that others were involved.
The assertion was included in the indictment that added two charges to the four counts of kidnapping, extortion and conspiracy that were filed against each of the suspects, Arthur D. and Irene J. Seale, both 45 years old, after their arrests last Friday in a car rental office in Hackettstown, N.J. 
 Without elaborating, the indictment said that "others," who were not identified, joined the Seales in the conspiracy against Mr. Reso, the 57-year-old president of Exxon's international division.
The indictment's kidnapping conspiracy count defined the Seales and others as "members of a conspiracy" that abducted Mr. Reso, wrote and arranged the delivery of several ransom notes to both Exxon and its international division and made calls to a special cellular telephone number established by the F.B.I. for communications with Mr. Reso's kidnappers. The Seales specifically were accused of making calls the night of June 18 that gave instructions for dropping off the ransom money.
 
Ransom Notes Mailed
 The United States Attorney for New Jersey, Michael Chertoff, released the indictment late this afternoon without comment on the investigation or the search for Mr. Reso.
Neither Mr. Chertoff nor the indictment said how many other people may have been involved.
One of the new charges involved using the mails to transmit ransom letters. The indictment said "members of the conspiracy" mailed a ransom letter from New York City to Exxon's corporate headquarters in Irving, Tex., on May 12. That was 13 days after Mr. Reso vanished moments after he left his home in Morris Township, N.J., for the 10-minute drive to his office in Florham Park.
Another ransom letter was mailed from Florham Park to Mr. Reso's office on June 1, the indictment said.
 
A Call From Pooler, Georgia
 The second new accusation involved interstate travel in aid of extortion. The count said the Seales and a third person, who was not identified, travelled from New Jersey to Florida and then to Georgia as part of the plot against Exxon. On June 8, the indictment said, "a member of the conspiracy" made an extortion call from Pooler, Ga., a small town a few miles northwest of Savannah.
Federal and state authorities, meantime, continued a round-the-clock search for Mr. Reso, primarily in the three New Jersey counties that have figured in the case since the April 29 abduction: Morris, Warren and Hunterdon.
Mr. Reso lived and worked in Morris County. The Seales, both unemployed in recent months, lived with Mr. Seale's retired parents in Changewater, a rural hamlet of Lebanon Township in Hunterdon County, which is adjacent to Morris. The couple were arrested in Warren County, across the Musconetcong River from Hunterdon, after F.B.I. agents spent about four hours the night of June 18 following a string of ransom calls and notes through four towns in Morris and adjacent Somerset Counties.
The ransom demanded for Mr. Reso's release, $18.5 million, was never left anywhere by F.B.I. agents that night. The reason, the authorities said, was that a series of calls with ransom instructions ended abruptly after the driver of the car that was being followed by F.B.I. agents saw a roadblock that had been set up because of a fire near Far Hills, N.J., and drove away. Authorities have declined to discuss the arrangements or promises for Mr. Reso's release had the ransom money been left by F.B.I. agents.
 
Assuming He Is Alive
 William Tonkin, a spokesman for the F.B.I., said today that authorities hoped that one or more other people involved in the kidnapping may be holding Mr. Reso.
"We will remain optimistic as to his well-being," Mr. Tonkin said. "Absent information to the contrary, we're going to work on the premise he's still alive. We have no reason to think he's not alive."
Mr. and Mrs. Seale have been held without bail in separate jails since shortly after their arrests. On the advice of their court-appointed lawyers, the Seales have refused to be interviewed by authorities since June 19, officials said. They declined to say what, if anything, the couple said about the case immediately after their arrests.
Mr. Seale worked until 1987 as a security officer for Exxon. A decade earlier, he retired on an officer's disability pension from the Police Department in Hillside, N.J., where he had grown up.
 
A Security Consultant
 Before he and his wife returned to New Jersey in late 1989, they spent several financially troubled years in Hilton Head Island, S.C., and Vail, Colo. About a year ago, Mr. Seale applied for a job with Intertel, a security consultant.
Robert Peloquin, head of Intertel, said today that Mr. Seale was retained twice between last summer and this March at $40 an hour to do part-time record checks for two clients. Mr. Peloquin also said Intertel let Mr. Seale use a desk and a phone in its New York office about twice a week between last summer and March to seek both a permanent job for himself and business for Intertel. Mr. Seale was unsuccessful in both undertakings, Mr. Peloquin said. Intertel broke off contact with him when the company closed its New York office in March and opened a headquarters in Rockville, Md., he said.

HEADLINE: Democrats Offer New Health-Care Plan

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Seizing the initiative on a politically charged issue, House Democratic leaders today unveiled a health care proposal intended to contain costs and insure more than half of the 30 million Americans not covered by health insurance.
But the fate of the measure is uncertain at best. Even if approved by Congress, it would probably face a veto by President Bush. 
 Nonetheless, after a seven-month effort to reach a consensus within their ranks, Democrats say the health program will clearly mark the goals of the party as it tries to retain its Congressional majority this fall.
 
Aim Is to Reduce Inflation
 House Democrats also noted that the plan dovetailed with proposals offered by Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the likely Democratic Presidential nominee, as the party prepares for its national convention next month.
Calling health care the most important domestic issue after unemployment, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, said: "Even if this bill were signed into law this year, we would still be short of universal comprehensive coverage. But this bill, as opposed to Republican proposals, takes the one step that will enable us to reach that goal: cost containment."
The major objective of the legislation is to reduce inflation for health care to 6 percent from the current rate of 10 percent by limiting the costs of all health procedures and products. The Government would set maximum national payment rates for hospitals, doctors and services based on market conditions, or about 35 percent higher than Medicare rates.
But there would be exceptions to the price controls. States could establish their own payment rates for hospitals and doctors rather than submit to a national standard. And health maintenance organizations would be allowed to negotiate their rates with hospitals and doctors.
The measure would also increase Government regulation of health insurance, establishing standards that would guarantee wider access to people with past health problems and to workers changing jobs who otherwise could be uncovered for months.
In addition, the plan would allow the self-employed to deduct 100 percent of their health insurance expenses after Jan. 1, 1994. Democrats say their plan would require no new taxes.
 
'Lays the Groundwork'
 "It lays the groundwork for insuring all Americans," said Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who is the primary author of the bill. "At current inflation rates, health insurance costs are doubling every four years. Workers face benefit cutbacks, while millions are afraid to switch jobs or move for fear of losing insurance coverage. Our bill solves this key problem."
The Stark plan originally attracted no more than lukewarm support from liberal Democrats, who prefer either national health insurance or an arrangement by which private companies would be required to provide coverage or pay into a Government insurance fund. But earlier this month, the California Democrat added provisions giving parents the opportunity to obtain Government benefits similar to those provided by Medicare for their uninsured children.
The bill would also cover all poor pregnant women by 1999, although it would still leave about 10 million underprivileged Americans uninsured.
What makes the plan attractive to liberals will surely attract strong opposition from insurance companies, hospitals and doctors. "We don't believe Americans can afford to trust Government to budget, redistribute and manage $800 billion dollars in personal decisions about health expenditures," said Mike Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, a lobbying group for private hospitals. "This is like a political shell game where some are more interested in attracting a veto then enacting reforms this year."
Mr. Bromberg said he and other health providers prefered a more modest plan offered by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, to limit annual increases in premiums and curb the right of insurers to cancel policies because of a person's health.
House Republicans offered a third, less generous plan three weeks ago that would limit malpractice claims and overhaul health insurance plans provided by small businesses.
A senior Gephardt aide conceded that it would take a fight to get the Stark health plan through the Ways and Means Committee, where it will be considered next week. "We're not there yet," he said, "but the pieces are falling together."
 
Criticism by Republican
 Representative Bill Gradison of Ohio, the ranking Republican member of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, criticized the Stark plan, saying, "These national price controls would lead to rationing and over time would damage the quality of health care in this country."
Asked what could pass this year, he replied, "Nothing, because the Democrats don't want President Bush to have a bill signing ceremony on health care."
The Democrats estimated that if nothing was done, the average annual premium of $4,800 now paid by a family of four would double in 1992 dollars by the year 2000.

HEADLINE: National AIDS Panel Says Administration Has Not Done Enough

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
The National Commission on AIDS said today that the Bush Administration had failed the nation by showing poor leadership in combating the AIDS epidemic.
The commission released a statement after what its members said was an extraordinarily disappointing meeting on Wednesday on AIDS and government leadership with Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
 The commission, a bipartisan panel appointed jointly by Congress and the White House and charged with creating a national consensus on what should be done about AIDS, said in its statement, "President Bush and the Department of Health and Human Services have failed to meet fully their responsibilities in leading the national response to the monumental human suffering and economic loss from the H.I.V./AIDS epidemic."
 
Secretary 'Ambushed'
 A department official said that Dr. Sullivan "was ambushed" by the commission's negative comments after the meeting. Administration officials present at the meeting could not be reached for comment, but the department issued a statement today from Dr. Sullivan:
"The charge by the commission is a total misrepresentation of the facts and the commitment of the Bush Administration. In all of American public health history, no single disease has ever occupied so much attention and commanded so many resources in so short a time.
"H.I.V. infection and AIDS continues to be one of the highest public health priorities of this Administration," he said.
Dr. June E. Osborn, chairman of the commission, said in an interview today that she felt Dr. Sullivan had been "very unresponsive" at the meeting. "He told us that he had a lot of work to do, and that everyone is working very hard," she said. "In other words, business as usual. This epidemic is an immense, historical tragedy and business as usual is not enough."
 
'No Sense of Urgency'
 The purpose of the meeting between the Secretary and the commission members was to review what the department has done to carry out the commission's recommendations last September. At that time, the commission outlined 30 steps that the Government could take to help get the epidemic under control.
The statement said President Bush had given only one speech on AIDS, in March 1990, placed no emphasis on legislative proposals on AIDS and has "signaled no sense of urgency to either the American people, or to his own domestic policy experts."
Further, the statement said, "The United States, with the largest number of H.I.V. infections in the world, is one of the few industrialized nations with no national plan to deal with the epidemic, and no mechanism to create one."
The Government has also not increased funds for programs to prevent AIDS, and has allowed funds for existing prevention programs to drop from $497 million in 1991, to $480 million in 1992, the statement said.
Separately, the AIDS Action Council, a Washington lobbying group for AIDS organizations, said the Administration had failed to issue regulations that would allow people with AIDS to apply for help with housing payments.
The bill appropriating $50 million for that purpose was passed last fall, and the council pressed the agency to make the money available. But by April, when no rule was forthcoming, the council got an agreement from an Assistant Secretary at H.U.D., Anna S. Kondratas, that the rule would be published by June 1. An official at H.U.D. said today that the agency had not meet the deadline but that it would put out the rules soon.
Daniel T. Bross, director of the AIDS Action Council, said that the Government's response was "not good enough for the thousands of people living on the streets and dying on the streets with AIDS."
"This is another indication of the disinterest of the Administration," he said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
UAL's Prospects For a Recovery

BYLINE: By Agis Salpukas

 BODY:
THE UAL Corporation's United Airlines is a colossus that spans the globe. It is the only carrier in the United States that has a major route system to both the Pacific and Europe.
Yet in spite of its powerful route system, it has been unable to remain unscathed in the current round of fare cuts, rising fuel prices and uncertain future bookings. And the economies of the United States, Japan and other big industrial countries remain in the doldrums. 
 During the first quarter, UAL lost $92.3 million. It is expected to post another loss in the second quarter, which is normally a good one for the industry.
Other major carriers also posted declines in the first quarter, with Delta's loss totaling $151.6 million and USAir's $63 million. Only the AMR Corporation, the owner of American Airlines, posted a small profit -- $20 million.
On Wednesday, UAL was dealt another blow. Standard & Poor's lowered its ratings on $2.9 billion of the company's debt to BBB-, from BB+.
The rating still keeps the company as one that investors should consider, but it means that there is more risk in buying UAL's securities since economic conditions could make it more difficult for the company to pay its debt-service costs.
The company was taken off S.& P.'s Creditwatch, where it had been placed along with six other large carriers on April 21.
Philip Baggaley, an airline analyst at S.& P., said there was an anomaly in looking at UAL. Compared with companies in other industries, he said, UAL has a balance sheet that looks poor. Taking the company's debt and factoring in leases for airplanes, UAL's debt-to-equity ratio stands at 88 percent. Mr. Baggeley said the average ratio of debt-to-equity for triple-B-rated companies was 47 percent.
Also, in the short term, the company faced some difficulties because it has to compete with low-cost Southwest Airlines in two of its key markets, Chicago and California. Continental Airlines, which is operating under bankruptcy protection from its creditors, also competes with United on many routes, particularly in Denver, where both carriers have hubs.
Yet looking at UAL from such a perspective overlooks United Airlines' hidden strengths, which make the airline one of the prime carriers, along with American and Delta, that should be able to capitalize on future trends in the airline industry.
"It has tremendous strengths," Mr. Baggaley said.
UAL has assets of enormous value that it could sell in a pinch -- some $5.2 billion worth -- Mr. Baggaley said, adding that he was using a very conservative measure.
Included are its Pacific routes, which UAL acquired in 1986 from Pan American World Airways for $384 million and which are valued at $3 billion; its Apollo computer reservation system, which is becoming a truly international system and is worth about $500 million, and the airline's gates and hubs at major airports like O'Hare International in Chicago, which are valued at $2 billion.
Thus, Mr. Baggaley does not foresee a cash squeeze for UAL. The strong assets could be used to raise money if the industry remained depressed for a longer period.
UAL management and analysts had hoped that this year would bring a strong recovery for the airline industry, and especially the company, after a disastrous 1991, when the Persian Gulf war doubled fuel prices and traffic slumped because of war-related anxiety.
The industry seemed on the way to recovery earlier this year, but then it became embroiled in a huge attempt to revamp the air-fare structure, a move initiated by Robert L. Crandall, chairman of American Airlines.
One short-term result of the air-fare changes has been a huge sale of low-priced tickets. As a result, planes will be filled this summer with happy passengers flying at bargain prices, while airline executives will be trying to figure out how to pay higher fuel bills with falling revenue.
Even though traffic has picked up on international routes, the signs for a strong recovery are still uncertain.
"Things look more ominous than we thought they would be," said Rose Ann Tortora, an airline analyst at the First Boston Corporation.
"It's not inappropriate to be concerned," she said, referring to the ability of United to pay its debt while spending huge amounts to stay in the race to be a global carrier.
While United has already built up its Pacific routes, it is still expanding in Europe. The carrier was at first reluctant to cut capital spending, since it sometimes did not have enough airplanes to cover all its routes effectively. UAL was also seeking to keep pace with American, which has surpassed it as the nation's largest carrier.
Last January, UAL stepped back from its ambitious expansion drive and said it would cut capital spending by $2 billion over three years to strengthen its balance sheet.
AMR had taken a similar step earlier, saying it would cut its capital spending by $8 billion.
Ms. Tortora said sentiment was growing among investors and analysts that it was time for UAL to pull back from the huge plane orders and expansion plans.
"Let's make some profits with the planes we have," she said.
