 BODY:

Paychecks Rise Only 2.7%, The Lowest Rate in Years
The economic growth that has propelled stocks to record levels has not done the same for the paychecks of American workers, whose earnings rose 2.7 percent in the last 12 months, the smallest amount in the 13 years that records have been kept, the Labor Department said. Inflation was 2.5 percent, and the economy grew 3.5 percent. The amount business spent on health benefits fell by one-tenth of 1 percent; as recently as 1988, the spending was rising 14 percent a year. [Page A1.]
 
Canadian Markets Rally
Investors cheered the vote rejecting sovereignty for Quebec, even though the margin was paper-thin. The Canadian dollar rose sharply, stocks advanced in Toronto, and the Canadian central bank lowered a lending rate. [A8.]
 
Stocks Give Up Big Gain
Stock prices dipped late in the day as traders took profits. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was up 42 points on upbeat economic reports and lower interest rates, ended down 1.09 points, at 4,755.48. Broader averages also fell a bit. [D8.]
 
Nabisco Rejects Icahn Proposal

New Home Sales Increase
New-home sales recovered in September, lifted by low mortgage rates, the Commerce Department said. The 3.3 percent rise followed an 11.1 percent plunge in August. Consumer confidence weakened slightly. [D2.]
 
Softkey Shares Weaken Again
Softkey International shares fell for the second consecutive day. Investors feared its two takeover offers would dilute its earnings per share. Softkey shares are nearly 40 percent below their 52-week high. Market Place. [D8.]
 
High-Level Meeting on Debt Ceiling
President Clinton plans to meet today with Republican Congressional leaders to discuss an extension of the debt limit, but both sides disagreed about the meeting's agenda. [A19.]
 
Cloud Over Dow Chemical
Dow Chemical finds itself heading down the treacherous path traveled by several implant makers. The company had kept its distance from the suits directed at Dow Corning, half of which it owns.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Up 3.3% Aided by Lower Loan Rates

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Lower mortgage rates helped generate a recovery in sales of new homes in September, the Commerce Department said yesterday, providing more evidence of steady, moderate growth.
Sales rose 3.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 727,000 units, after a revised 11.1 percent plunge in August to 704,000. 
 September was the fourth consecutive month in which sales of new homes exceeded 700,000 a year -- a level of sales activity not seen in nearly two years, since the four months from September through December 1993.
In another indicator of resurgent economic activity, Chicago purchasing managers said their Chicagoland Business Barometer posted a solid rise in October with big gains in production and orders.
The measure rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.4 in October from 49 in September -- the first monthly gain after four consecutive months of decline -- with any measure above 50 pointing to an expanding manufacturing economy.
But a separate report showed consumers slightly more pessimistic about the economy. The Conference Board, a New York-based business research group, said its consumer confidence index was 97 in October, down from 97.3 in September.
Still, the index was higher from a year ago, when it was 89.1. The index, based on a sample from 5,000 households, works over a 1985 base of 100.
Although the view of the current situation by consumers dimmed, easing to 105.3 in October from 110 in September, they grew more optimistic about the future. The index measuring their sense of future economic conditions rose to 91.5 in October from 88.8 in September.
"This month's readings continue to suggest healthy economic growth ahead." said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.
The housing sales report followed a report last week that showed an increase in sales of existing homes as well. The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in September -- the fifth consecutive monthly increase -- to an annual rate of 4.15 million units.
"Tumbling mortgage rates do wonders for the housing market and they certainly have done so during the third quarter," said David Lereah, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.
But sales in the Northeast fell 12 percent in September to a rate of 44,000 a year. That was the lowest rate for the region since sales were running at 38,000 a year in August 1982, the Commerce Department said.
Sales of new homes in the Midwest rose 12.7 percent, to a rate of 151,000 a year, and were up 6.9 percent in the West to 231,000. Sales in the South were down by seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 302,000.

HEADLINE: Some Tobacco Growers Diversify, a Study Finds

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
A new study of tobacco farmers in the United States shows a significant generation gap in the farmers' concern for their economic future and the need to diversify their crops.
The research, believed to be the first comprehensive assessment of American tobacco farmers' attitudes, found that farmers have a strong and continuing economic dependence on tobacco as a crop, and showed that many farmers powerfully identify their interests with those of tobacco companies. 
 But the study also found that younger and more educated farmers were more eager to supplement tobacco income with other ventures and were more concerned about the long-term uncertainties of tobacco agriculture.
Furthermore, 80 percent of tobacco farmers of all ages said that the purchase of foreign tobacco by American manufacturers was a grave threat to their future.
The research, called the United States Tobacco Farmers' Opinion Study, was financed by a $98,000 grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The foundation and the organizations that conducted the survey said they had no connection to tobacco companies or anti-tobacco groups.
Telephone interviews with 992 tobacco farmers in six states were conducted in March by researchers from the Bowman Gray School of Medicine of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., and the Center for Sustainable Systems in Berea, Ky. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
About 37 percent of the growers said they depended on tobacco revenues for more than half of their net family income, and 69 percent said they received at least a quarter of their family income from tobacco.
Two-thirds of the farmers under the age of 45 said they had discovered profitable ventures to supplement tobacco growing.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: THE OVERVIEW;
Balkan Leaders Face an Hour for Painful Choices

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
The Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, once remarked that choosing between President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia was like chosing between "leukemia and a brain tumor."
For all three Presidents, however, the hour of painful choices has now come. After four years of war, the loss of quarter of a million lives, the dispersal of three million refugees and the destruction of their once-shared Yugoslav state, they have been summoned to a bleak American air base near Dayton to confront each other and their responsibilities in talks that start on Wednesday. 
 There will be no joy in their hearts at this prospect. They are used to playing the endless halls of mirrors that constitute Balkan politics, and they are unaccustomed to looking each other in the eye and certainly deeply reluctant to do so.
Even Mr. Tudjman and Mr. Izetbegovic, nominal allies in Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation, dislike each other with a peculiar intensity. "If only Izetbegovic would sit down and have a drink like a civilized human being, we could do business with him," the Croatian President is fond of telling American visitors. The Bosnian President, a devout Muslim, shuns alcohol.
To Mr. Milosevic, an independent Bosnia was a ludicrous invention -- as much a state, he once suggested, as Caligula's horse was a consul. As for Mr. Tudjman, who has a pronounced taste for creamy, medal-bedecked military uniforms, the dour Serbian President often dismisses him as a buffoon.
"This is a complete snake pit," said a senior American official who will be present at the talks. "But we're ready to play the big snake."
Only after countless aborted agreements and resolutions, culminating with the recent Serbian massacre of several thousand Muslims from the United Nations-designated "safe area" of Srebrenica, has the West backed up its pronouncements with credible threats of force.
Richard C. Holbrooke, the chief American mediator, understands this need for strong measures. He has progressed to this point by thrusting American power squarely in the face of his interlocutors. Till now, this kind of diplomacy has worked.
The Assistant Secretary of State has warned Mr. Izetbegovic that NATO will not be his air force, threatened Mr. Tudjman with economic sanctions if he makes a wrong move, and left Mr. Milosevic with no doubt that the international acceptance he craves will not come without major Serbian concessions.
The method has gradually revealed the weaknesses of the three: Mr. Izetbegovic's difficulty with decision-making and tendency to agree with the last person he has talked to; Mr. Tudjman's pomposity and inflated notion of his refurbished army's prowess; Mr. Milosevic's fear of continued international isolation.
But if American officials now know how to deal with the three men, they are scarcely any closer to bridging the enormous differences that separate them.
All the issues that caused the wars of Yugoslavia's disintegration -- the status of Sarajevo, the territorial claims of Serbian minorities in Bosnia and Croatia, the governance of Bosnia -- remain unresolved. Some atrocities -- the killing of Muslims in northwestern Bosnia this month and Muslims in Srebrenica in August -- are still raw in the minds and hearts of the Bosnian delegation.
Conspicuously absent from the meetings will be the two main Bosnian Serb leaders. Radovan Karadzic, the political leader, and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the army chief have been indicted for war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague and both risk arrest if they leave their territory. In the Dayton talks, Mr. Milosevic and other Bosnian Serb officials are representing that side.
But still, Mr. Izetbegovic will be negotiating with men who, at the very best, turned a blind eye to the incarceration of tens of thousands of Muslim civilians in bestial concentration camps by Serbian forces throughout Bosnia in 1992 and the imprisonment of thousands more in similar camps by Croatian troops around Mostar in 1993.
Moreover, he is aware that the objective that led Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Tudjman to condone, or perhaps approve, such methods -- a carve-up of Bosnia along ethnic lines that would leave the Muslims with very little -- may well persist just beneath the surface of the more measured official policies the two Presidents now espouse publicly.
Decision-making in Ohio will not be easy for Mr. Izetbegovic. More at home in philosophical discussions than political realities, the mild-mannered Bosnian leader has zigzagged this way and that.
At times it has appeared that two spells in prison -- in 1946 and again in 1983 -- stemming from his identification with Muslim movements contested by Yugoslavia's Communist authorities -- imbued Mr. Izetbegovic with a patience and otherworldliness ill-suited to politics.
He did little to prepare for war, although it was clear to almost everyone that the Bosnian independence he sought in 1992 would provoke a violent reaction from the Serbian minority of Bosnia, strongly backed by the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army. On April 4, 1992, two days before the fighting broke out, he declared: "Citizens of Sarajevo, sleep peacefully, there will be no war."
He says now that he has no regrets. "In history there are no experiments," he said in a recent interview. "We don't know what would have happened if we had stayed. But after the destruction of Vukovar, would you have stayed with Yugoslavia and Milosevic? We had to choose, and the aggressors committed crimes we never predicted. I never could have predicted such enormous crimes."
The slaughter of Muslims by Serbs in 1992 initially disoriented Mr. Izetbegovic. Under immense military pressure, he repeatedly entertained thoughts of a Muslim mini-state in some part of Bosnia, an idea attractive to some radical members of the Muslim nationalist Party of Democratic Action that he founded. But in the end, he always discarded it.
Now, at the age of 70, this lawyer has grown in stature, bolstered by the emergence of a credible Bosnian Army which, backed by the Croats, has won significant victories this year. His standing has also been reinforced by the fact that, despite obvious pressure from an influential minority of Islamic radicals in Bosnia and from military supporters including Iran, Mr. Izetbegovic has never abandoned the basic civility and tolerance that has allowed Muslims, Croats and Serbs to go on living together in Sarajevo through four years of war. This stance has amounted to the best rebuff of repeated Serbian charges that he is a "fundamentalist" and Croatian claims that Mr. Izetbegovic and his people need education in civilized European mores.
The Serbian charges have used as ammunition a document called "The Islamic Declaration" published by Mr. Izetbegovic in 1973.
While it contains inflammatory passages -- suggesting, for example, the coexistence of Islam and "non-Islamic social and political institutions" may be impossible -- it amounts essentially to a meditation on how to reconcile Islam with the modern world.
Whatever his past convictions, Mr. Izetbegovic's current goals now seem clear. He wants a settlement that offers a real chance that Bosnia will remain whole, either through the central, democratic institutions established under a peace plan, or -- if that fails, Bosnian leaders say -- by securing the land, the money and military training that would open the way for some future military push.
Thus he wants the line that the United States proposes to draw through Bosnia -- dividing the country roughly in half between the Serbs and the federation -- to be a faint one, a temporary division rather than a permanent frontier.
Mr. Izetbegovic wants Sarajevo, the soul of Bosnia, undivided. He seeks a land link between Sarajevo and Gorazde, the remaining eastern Muslim enclave. He will request a huge economic aid package. And he insists on the departure, through popular vote or arraignment, of Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic.
"With democracy and freedom, it will become irrelevant which side controls a town," Mr. Izetbegovic said. "If reasonable people come to power, all problems can be solved."
Western diplomats look to Mr. Milosevic as the best hope for peace because he is desperate to get international economic sanctions on Serbia lifted and, at 54, looks forward to a less rocky future as president for another decade or two.
He is therefore ready to make compromises. He has made clear that he cares little about Sarajevo, even less about the fate of Mr. Karadzic, whom he loathes, and General Mladic, whom he now sees as a liability. But his room for maneuver may be limited.
He heads a delegation that includes Bosnian Serbs who care passionately about securing Serbian rule over part of Sarajevo. Indeed a Sarajevo divided along ethnic lines has been a fundamental war aim of the Bosnian Serbs.
Moreover, he has refrained from ousting either man up to now, apparently because he is not entirely sure of his power base in the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army.
The army is keeping watch on eastern Slavonia, a sliver of rich land that abuts Serbia and is the one remaining Serbian-occupied area of Croatia.
It is particularly unstable because Mr. Tudjman remains a volatile character, enamored of his army, who has repeatedly been underestimated by American officials.
Flanked by a Defense Minister, Gojko Susak, whom officials close to Mr. Holbrooke call "the tough cookie of the Balkans," Mr. Tudjman has shown that he can successfully use force, including sometimes barbaric methods, while skirting international ostracism or stricture.
He is not a natural ally for the United States, but he has emerged as one because he was needed to balance initial Serbian military superiority and provide an arms pipeline to the Bosnians. From comments in the 1990 Croatian election campaign that he was pleased not to be married to "a Serb or a Jew" to more recent reflections on the need for Croats to show Bosnian Muslims what European civilization is about, Mr. Tudjman has shown a streak of thinly veiled bigotry.
Despite these traits, Mr. Tudjman has retained American support as he recovered all but 3 percent of Croatia from the secessionist Serbs. He also helped himself to more than 20 percent of Bosnia.
In so doing, he has virtually cleansed Croatia of its 13 percent Serbian minority. "Croatia is now rid of its historical cross," he declared after the victorious August attack on the Krajina region that sent about 170,000 Serbs into flight.
"We knew all along that Tudjman wanted a small, humble, contrite, quiet and second-class Serb minority," said one State Department official. "But we needed him, so we closed our eyes."
The policy culminated with the Clinton Administration's effective green light to the Krajina campaign, a triumph that cemented Mr. Tudjman's vision of himself.
Mr. Tudjman's conversion to nationalism came at a relatively late age. As a young man, he joined Tito's Communist Partisan movement and fought the Croatian Ustashe, Nazi puppets whose slaughter of Serbs during World War II provided one of the highly charged historical themes that have fed the current conflict.
After the war, he rose quickly to become, before the age of 40, Tito's youngest general. But a move from the army to historical study then led to a radical conversion from Communism to Croatian Nationalism.
His writings now suggest that Ustashe crimes were exaggerated and the number of Serbian and Jewish dead inflated. He became a leading figure in the "Croatian Spring" of 1971, a flowering of national and liberal resistance to Tito's autocratic rule. The movement was quashed by Tito and Mr. Tudjman imprisoned.
He emerged, as Communism collapsed in Europe, to lead Croatia's march to independence as the head of the Croatian Democratic Union Party. The march suffered setbacks, but it now looks victorious, and Mr. Tudjman, at this stage, is the big winner from the latest Balkan war.
Mr. Holbrooke is now determined to curtail Mr. Tudjman's triumphalism. He wants to head off any attack on eastern Slavonia, and he wants to make real multiculturalism in Bosnia the price for Mr. Tudjman's ticket to acceptance in the West and eventually the European Union.
"His ticket to the West is compliance on these issues," said one American official. "No use of force in eastern Slavonia. Work with the Muslims in Bosnia."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Strong Demand Propels Copper, And Corn Hits a 7-Month High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Copper prices rallied yesterday on the Commodity Exchange of New York on signs of surprisingly strong industrial demand.
On other commodity markets, corn prices rose to a seven-month high. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 0.24 point, to 242.22. 
 Copper for December delivery climbed 1.10 cents yesterday, to $1.2475 a pound.
Availability of copper, an essential component for construction projects and many manufactured products, remains relatively tight despite increased warehouse stocks, analysts said.
"The market appears to be saying, 'We don't think there is going to be enough copper around for the fourth quarter,' " said Richard Hirsch, a vice president of Deutsche Sharps Pixley Metals Inc. in New York.
Traders in New York took their cues mainly from the London Metal Exchange, where copper for delivery in three months rose $21 a metric ton despite an increase in visible stocks. A metric ton is 2,205 pounds.
Copper in exchange-registered warehouses rose by 2,500 metric tons last week to 193,450, the London exchange said.
"In spite of all the worldwide recession fears, we're seeing strong manufacturing and industrial demand," Mr. Hirsch said.
Visible American stocks of copper remain low. Commodity warehouse stocks were unchanged at 6,107 tons, the exchange said in a daily report after the close of trading yesterday.
"You certainly have a tight situation in the U.S.," David Rinehimer, an analyst with Smith Barney, said.
Corn and soybean prices rose on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly as a result of farmers' reluctance to sell newly harvested crops at current prices.
The advance also reflected traders' expectations that the Agriculture Department would further reduce its 1995 corn and soybean production estimates in a Nov. 9 crop report, said Dan Cekander, a grain analyst with Fimat Futures USA Inc. in Chicago. "I think people are starting to get a little nervous going into the crop report," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Developments in U.S. Neighbors Cause Dollar to Rise, Then Dip

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed against most leading currencies yesterday. It initially rose to a five-week high against the yen as traders assessed the United States impact of the vote in Quebec that narrowly rejected secession from Canada, but the dollar then slipped back after the Mexican peso weakened.
"Canada helped the dollar, and Mexico held it back," said Jay Westheimer, senior currency trader with Banco di Sicilia in New York. 
 Concern that a Quebec vote for independence would roil Canadian financial markets made market participants wary of holding too many United States or Canadian dollars during the last few days. After the slim vote against separation, Canadian and United States markets surged yesterday morning, driving both currencies higher.
"Investors are feeling a little more comfortable about investing in North America, hence the dollar is benefiting," Charles Spence, director of currency sales at Standard Chartered Bank in New York, said during morning trading.
That comfort, however, did not last long. The Mexican peso fell because of continued concern that Mexico's economy will be slow to emerge from recession. The peso's decline hurt the dollar because of the close ties between Mexico and the United States. Mexico is the United States' third-largest trading partner, after Canada and Japan.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar edged up to 101.96 Japanese yen from 101.95 yen on Monday. The dollar slipped to 1.4070 German marks from 1.4089 marks and to 1.1353 Swiss francs from 1.1369 Swiss francs. The British pound rose to $1.5810 from $1.5779.
In other trading, the Canadian dollar settled at 74.33 United States cents, up from 73.34 cents on Monday. The United States dollar rose to 7.0750 Mexican pesos, up from 6.925 pesos on Monday.
The gain in the Canadian dollar yesterday was tempered by the narrow margin by which secession was rejected, market participants said.
By a vote of 50.6 percent to 49.4 percent, Quebec voters turned down the provincial government's request for a mandate to negotiate separation from Canada .
"No one can believe this issue is resolved," said Graham Broyd, manager of currency sales at National Westminster Bank in New York. "It will be with us for a while to come and may result in another vote during the next couple of years. The risk premium Canada has to pay for Quebec is still there."

HEADLINE: Steps Taken On Welfare In Michigan

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

 BODY:
In another month or two, most women on welfare in Michigan will probably have to be working within six weeks of having a child or they will lose their benefits.
New welfare recipients there who do not obtain jobs, paid or unpaid, are likely to become ineligible for benefits in two months. Michigan fathers would lose their driver's and professional licenses for not supporting their children. And welfare recipients would be docked 10 percent of their payments to reimburse their landlords for damage to housing. 
 In an apparent effort to outpace other states and show the nation how to make welfare recipients go to work, the Republican Governor of Michigan, John Engler, proposed these and other changes yesterday in a state welfare program that already leads the nation in steering recipients into jobs, with about 30 percent of its 190,000 welfare recipients working -- three times the national average.
With Congress on the last lap of writing legislation to hand most of the control over welfare to the states, most likely in December, Mr. Engler submitted his proposals yesterday to a supportive State Legislature. He wants his own program, an expansion of one he established three years ago, to take effect immediately afterward. He would then begin spending the lump-sum payments, or block grants, that Congress is expected to allocate to all states for largely unrestricted use on welfare, replacing a system now controlled by Washington.
If, as widely expected, the overhaul of the welfare system is approved by the full Congress and is signed into law by President Clinton, states are likely to begin a stampede to re-invent welfare in ways most suitable to them. Michigan made a point yesterday of being the first out of the gate.
"We want to be ready to go as soon as the legislation is passed in Washington," said Gerald H. Miller, director of the Michigan Department of Social Services. The Governor's spokesman, John Truscott, said: "We want to be the first state. We want to be the model for the rest of the nation."
In Michigan, welfare would be redefined. Mr. Miller's department would become the Family Independence Agency, which would oversee a Family Independence Program. The principal Federal welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, would become Family Independence Assistance.
The state's welfare system would be greatly simplified, too, Mr. Miller said. The standard form applicants fill out would be cut to 5 pages from 25. Many reporting requirements would be eliminated, and layers of the welfare bureaucracy would shrink, with most of the work assumed by the caseworker, who would be called a family independence specialist.
But Michigan's rush to be first stuns people who argue that the changes the Governor has already made have yet to be proven, especially in a recession, when jobs, now abundant in Michigan, disappear. State welfare spending could soar as the state tries to fulfill its promise to support people who seek to find work and fail.
"From our standpoint, the speed with which they are moving is just appalling," said Sharon Parks, senior research associate at the Michigan League for Human Services, a research and advocacy organization.
Mr. Truscott acknowledged the problems arising from a recession. But he said that starting with the first block grant, the state would set aside a contingency fund, although how much of the grants would go to that was undecided. He also said he would expect Congress to help out with emergency aid.
"Congress can always revisit this," he said, "if it gets to the point where staters cannot handle it." But Congress has made no such provision for a bailout.
At a news conference today and in an outline of a bill he plans to submit to the State Senate and House, Mr. Engler said he would deny welfare to mothers under 18 and provide coverage for them only when living under adult supervision, trying in that way discourage young women from using a baby and a welfare check as a means of leaving home.
The new program would be at once tougher on people who refuse to work and gentler on those who make an effort. Instead of food stamps, for example, many people who do find jobs but remain on welfare would be freed of the stigma of using food stamps and be given cash for food instead.

HEADLINE: An Intricate Senate Procedure Lends a Hand to Welfare Recipients

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
With one clean swipe just before midnight Friday, the Democratic minority in the Senate knocked out of the big budget bill many of the harshest policies involving welfare.
No longer would the bill force families off welfare after they had been on relief for five years. 
 No longer would it allow states to deny welfare benefits to unwed mothers younger than 18 or to children born into families already on welfare.
No longer would the bill provide a bonus to states if their rate of out-of-wedlock births fell.
The Democrats did not succeed because they mustered a majority vote for their position -- the 46 Democratic senators voted to delete the provisions in question, while the 53 Republicans voted to retain them -- but because of an arcane procedure known as the Byrd rule.
The Senate's use of the rule raises some question about whether comprehensive welfare legislation, approved by both houses and favored in some form by President Clinton, can become law this year.
Under this Senate rule, named for its author, Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, provisions in budget bill can be successfully challenged on a point of order if they produce no change in revenue or spending or if such changes are "merely incidental" to the fiscal items. It takes a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes if all senators are present, to waive the rule.
The rule does not apply directly to the House, whose budget bill clamps down more on the poor than does the Senate's. But it will apply to any matter approved by a conference committee before the Senate.
So the rule is likely to complicate the work of the conference committee that this week is beginning to try to work out the differences between budget bills approved last week by the Senate and the House.
These are among the elements of the House bill, but not the Senate bill, that may not meet the test of the Byrd rule:
*Abolition of the Commerce Department.
*Merger of the Agency for International Development, the United States Information Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency into the State Department.
*Repeal of Federal nursing home standards.
*Overturning new Government regulations on livestock grazing on Federal land.
*Tightening of the United States embargo on Cuba.
*Revision of the Endangered Species Act.
None of these go to the heart of the budget measure, which is supposed to balance the budget in seven years, cut the taxes of middle- and upper-income taxpayers and shift control of most social programs from the Federal Government to the states.
But many are important to conservative Republicans in the House, where freshmen have no experience with the strange ways of the Senate. The party leaders may have to twist a good many arms to get these conservatives to vote for the compromise measure that comes out of the conference without these provisions.
The rule also complicates the politics of welfare legislation, which is going through Congress along two separate tracks.
The Senate and House have passed separate welfare bills almost identical to the welfare provisions in the budget bills. The notion of overhauling welfare is popular politically, and President Clinton has said he would sign a bill with welfare measures like those in the Senate bill.
The Republicans who control Congress decided to include the welfare provisions in the budget bill so they could blame Mr. Clinton for vetoing the popular legislation if, as is almost certain to happen, he vetoes the budget bill.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said he was reluctant, as a political matter, to give the President the opportunity to sign the former and veto the latter.
Then there is the question of a Senate filibuster. Under the rules, budget bills cannot be filibustered. But a separate welfare bill could be. The welfare bill was approved in the Senate last month by an overwhelming 87-to-12 vote. But many Democrats who voted for it might jump ship if they thought they could sustain a filibuster.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, the leading opponent of the welfare measure in the Senate, said tonight that he thought most Democrats who voted for the measure last month would join a filibuster if President Clinton drops the word.
Senator Byrd, who was the Democratic leader from 1977 until 1989 and who sees himself as the guardian of the prerogatives of the Senate, first got his budget rule approved by the Senate in 1985. It cannot be changed without a three-fifths majority in the Senate.
The rule was meant to counter the fact that under law only 20 hours of debate are permitted on the huge budget measures known as reconciliation bills. Before the Byrd rule was imposed, dozens of extraneous elements often managed to sneak into such bills without debate or the knowledge of many senators.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices End Day Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were mixed yesterday.
The market, traders and analysts said yesterday, is being pulled in two directions: by market participants hoping that a budget deal will be reached in Washington and by those looking at economic reports for signs of inflationary growth. 
 The two opposing forces were reflected in trading yesterday. Despite reports showing a growing economy, there were enough buyers betting that a budget deal would prompt the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates again this year.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32, to 107 9/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.33 percent, from 6.35 percent on Monday. The prices of intermediate-term notes were mixed or little changed. Bill rates rose a few basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Several reports released yesterday showed strength in the economy. The Chicago Purchasing Management Association said yesterday that its index of business activity rose to 53.4 last month from 49 in September. A reading above 50 denotes expansion in the manufacturing sector. Analysts had expected an increase to 50.8. The prices paid component in the index also increased to 59.5, from 54.9 in September.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said new-home sales rose in September to an annual rate of 727,000 from the trade estimate of 725,000 and from the August downward revision to 704,000. And the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey fell slightly, to 97 in October from 97.3 the previous month.
Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst with Thomson Research, Boston, said the December bond futures contract fell after the release of the data, But prices were also under pressure from some end-of-the-month squaring-up of positions, highlighted by some short-covering, traders said.
"The reality is that the market is still bullish," Ms. Mesch said. "The bulls are technically well ahead in this market rally, but complacency about the rally being in the bag would be a mistake."
The December contract rose as high as 117 10/32 yesterday, with the low at 116 16/32, before closing at 117 1/32.
"The economy is at a point of being either very good or very terrible," said Carroll J. Delaney, director of research for Stires, O'Donnell & Company, "with the market sitting very comfortably in between."
"But for the market to dismiss the last G.D.P. figure of a 4.2 percent gain for the third quarter is really stretching it," he added. "Bottom line, the market is ignoring all the data, concentrating instead on the budget negotiations in Washington and fixed on the idea that when the issue is resolved we will get a corresponding action of an easing by the Federal Reserve."
Despite the battle in Washington, the Treasury was still planning to announce plans this afternoon to sell bills and notes to raise money it needs to pay Government expenses in the fourth quarter.

Manhattan tally: Charles Jourdan returns and a currency trader stays, as do Tiffany's offices.

BYLINE: By Mervyn Rothstein 

 BODY:
CHARLES JOURDAN is returning to Manhattan retailing.
The company, which closed its Madison Avenue and Trump Tower stores more than two years ago, has signed a lease for 1,700 square feet of selling space at 655 Madison, at 60th Street. The upscale shoe store is to open Nov. 20. 
 The space is being sublet from Bogner, the ski wear company, which is moving its shop to a five-story 1880 brick row house at 821 Madison, between 68th and 69th Streets.
Faith H. Consolo of the Garrick-Aug retail brokerage, which handled the Jourdan deal for Bogner, said the sublet was for two years -- the time left on the Bogner lease -- for an annual rent of "less than $150 a square foot."
"Comparable space for that corner today would be $275 a square foot and up," Ms. Consolo said.
Max Imgruth, Charles Jourdan's president and chief executive, said the two earlier stores, at Madison and 66th and in Trump Tower at Fifth and 57th, had been closed because the new Jourdan owners, who took over three years ago, felt that business was eroding on Madison and "decided to redirect the company and rethink strategies."
In addition, Mr. Imgruth said, "both deals were made in the 80's, and the Trump Tower rent, including common area charges, was $1.92 million a year."
"Even though we did $6 million in shoe sales, we made no profit," he said.
The time was now right to reopen, he said, and the sublease provided "an opportunity."
"The rent," he said, "is intelligent. Sometimes you take something even if it is for a relatively short period of time."
 
Currency Trader Stays Put
 Tullett & Tokyo Forex Inc., a London-based currency trading company, has signed a 15-year, $35 million lease to keep its North American headquarters, with 550 employees, at 80 Pine Street in lower Manhattan.
The company agreed in June to remain in New York City in exchange for a $2.2 million, 16-year tax incentive from New York City. But it had waited to sign the lease until the State Legislature approved a package of tax benefits designed by the Giuliani administration to encourage residential conversion and commercial renovation downtown, said Bruce Surry, a senior managing director of the Edward S. Gordon real estate company, who handled the deal for Tullett & Tokyo. The legislation was signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki on Sunday.
The company's decision to stay in Manhattan was a victory for the city, which has lost several currency-trading concerns to Jersey City in recent years. Noonan, Astley & Pearce has moved to 10 Exchange Place across the Hudson; two other companies, Bierbaum Martin and Fulton Prebon Yamane, are now at 101 Hudson Street there.
At 80 Pine, a 38-story building at Maiden Lane, Tullett & Tokyo will expand from about 46,000 square feet to 62,680 square feet, Mr. Sully said. He added that the landlord, the Rudin family, had been "particularly aggressive in helping to keep this tenant."
William C. Rudin, president of Rudin Management, said "the Mayor's downtown plan was a key component of Tullett & Tokyo's decision to stay."
Rudin Management has been particularly aggressive in trying to revitalize downtown. It is renovating 55 Broad Street, a 31-story office building at the corner of Beaver Street with 400,000 square feet of empty space, and making it a center for information and telecommunications companies.
Mr. Rudin said that 55 Broad would open at the end of the month. "There are three floors committed," he said, "and we're working on three or four more floors of deals."
 
Tiffany Offices Also Stay
 Also staying in Manhattan and expanding are the operations offices of Tiffany & Company, at 600 Madison Avenue, a 26-story building at 58th Street, two blocks from the flagship store at 57th and Fifth.
Tiffany has about 63,000 square feet on four floors at 600 Madison, on various leases that were to expire in from three and a half to five years. It will have about 84,000 square feet and one more floor under one new lease that has been "restructured and extended on economically favorable" terms for the next 15 years, said Mitchell Steir, executive vice president of the Julien J. Studley agency. Mr. Steir, who brokered the deal for Tiffany, declined to disclose the terms of the lease. Arthur J. Draznin of Harper-Lawrence Inc. was leasing agent for the building.
"The business group could have relocated outside New York but felt it was best to be at 600 Madison," Mr. Steir said.
 
2 Companies, 1 Office
 The trend to consolidation continues. Two companies with common ownership that occupy space in two midtown office buildings are moving to one.
Vitt Media International, a media planning and buying company with 36,000 square feet at 1114 Avenue of the Americas, at 42d Street, and Sawyer Ferguson Walker Inc., a seller of national advertising for many major newspapers, which has 17,000 square feet in the Chrysler Building, are moving to about 35,000 square feet on the 10th floor of 90 Park Avenue, a 41-story building at 39th Street.
Charles Lowenstein and Scott Pudalov of the Edward S. Gordon company handled the deal for the companies. The lease is for 10 years, with an aggregate rent of $15 million.

HEADLINE: Arab-Israeli Conference Agrees on Mideast Development Bank

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Oct. 31

 BODY:
A three-day conference of business and Government leaders intended to broaden economic bonds between Israel and the Arab world ended today with the announcement that an American-backed proposal for a Middle East Development Bank would move forward.
The conference passed a resolution calling for establishment of the bank, to be capitalized at $5 billion with paid-in working fund of $1.25 billion. Officials said they will negotiate in the coming months to determine who the shareholders will be and how much each will contribute. 
 The bank has been championed by the United States, Israel, Jordan and Egypt but opposed by the European Union, which says that the bank will eclipse European development programs, and by Persian Gulf countries that are supposed to provide a substantial part of its financing.
The gathering was declared a success that "exceeded all expectations," by Joan Spero, Under Secretary of State for Economic and Agricultural Affairs.
Foundations were laid for deals between Arabs and Israelis that may bear fruit in the future. But the three days of meetings also were marked by inter-Arab rivalries, European-American competition for influence and the legacy of 50 years of Arab-Israeli conflict.
During the conference, Israel announced it had signed an agreement to enter into negotiations with Enron Corporation, an American energy company, to buy liquified natural gas produced by the company in Qatar.
In addition to the regional development bank, which will have its headquarters in Cairo, the meeting also approved plans to establish regional tourism and business boards, a permanent secretariat for the economic conference in Rabat, Morocco, and a committee in Amman to organize future conferences.
"I still am an optimist, and I believe we are heading for the best of times," said Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan, the chairman of the gathering, officially called the Middle East/ North Africa Economic Summit. The first regional economic meeting that included large Israeli participation was held a year ago in Casablanca with King Hassan II of Morocco as chairman. Organizers said the next conference will be in Cairo and the following one in Qatar.
On the whole, the meeting of more than 1,000 businessmen and delegations of officials was more subdued than the Morocco gathering. Syria and Lebanon refused to attend the meeting, and Iran, Iraq and Libya were not invited.
Time after time, discussions were interrupted by Palestinians who complained that Israel is falling behind schedule in granting them autonomy or by Arabs calling upon other Arabs to slow down their "rush" to peace until Israel makes peace with Lebanon and Syria.
On the development bank proposal, European Union officials argued that it is an American attempt to diminish Europe's role in the Middle East.
Saudi Arabia's Commerce Minister, Ussama Al Faqih, said in a speech on Sunday that his country would not contribute to capitalize the bank, and Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have taken the same position.
Until these disputes are resolved, a number of experts here said, the bank remains merely "an announcement to establish" with nothing more than a location in Cairo.
The agreement to negotiate for the sale of $20 billion in natural gas falls short of being a direct business transaction between an Arab country and Israel, but it would be the first such deal by a Persian Gulf Arab oil-producing nation to supply energy to Israel.

HEADLINE: Canadian Dollar Buoyed by Quebec Vote

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: MONTREAL, Oct. 31

 BODY:
Relief at the rejection of separatism by a paper-thin majority of Quebecers rippled through Canada's economy today, driving up the depressed Canadian dollar and the Toronto stock market and offering investors a respite after weeks of uncertainty about the country's future.
"It's not just positive, it's exuberant," Warren Jestin, the chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia, said of the market's reaction to Quebec voters' decision to remain a part of Canada. 
 Even a thin 52,000-vote margin of victory, Mr. Jestin and other Canadian economists said, has dissipated the fog of confusion over Quebec's future that had obscured Canada's economic strengths.
They include an enviably low inflation rate, profitable exports of raw materials such as oil and forestry products and signs that the federal and most provincial governments are serious about trimming back Canada's staggering debt burden.
John McCallum, the chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, compared the financial markets before the referendum to a metal spring wound up so tightly that Quebecers' approval of secession could have sent them flying off in uncharted directions. Even the slim rejection of the referendum sufficed to wind down the tension.
"It's kind of a reprieve and a wake-up call" for Canadians to find a place for Quebecers in their country, Mr. McCallum said of the referendum result. But, he added, "We're now on a sustainable path."
The most conspicuous indicator was the rising Canadian dollar, in which trading had virtually stopped last Friday as trepidation grew about the outcome of the referendum.
The Canadian dollar closed today at 74.35 cents, up .77 cents from Monday's close. Foreign currency speculators began buying once the referendum results swung last night in favor of those who wanted to stay a part of Canada.
The benchmark Toronto Stock Exchange's composite index of 300 stocks rose 130 points soon after trading opened, dropped in modest profit taking and resumed its climb to close at 4,459 points, up just over 79 points from Monday's close. The stock markets in Montreal and Vancouver also registered gains.
The Bank of Canada fueled the optimism by lowering its bank lending rate sharply today, to 6.18 percent, compared to 7.65 percent last week. Canadian bonds rose earlier in anticipation of the cut, which could stimulate consumer spending by Canadians, who owe proportionately more money than Americans.
The rally extended to Quebec, where the Montreal brokerage firm Levesque Beaubien reported substantial buy orders for Quebec provincial bonds. Many investors were previously scared off by the prospect of political instability in the province. But as Sherry Cooper, the chief economist for Nesbitt Burns, observed, "It is still too early to definitely suggest that investors will commit sizable long-term capital to the Quebec economy."
Not all economists shared the euphoria. While the immediate crisis was over, a few noted, the impasse over Quebec was still unresolved and could distract Prime Minister Jean Chretien's Government from the spending cuts needed to place the economy on a sounder footing. Economic growth flattened out in the first half of the year, they said.
Jeff Rubin, the chief economist of Wood Gundy Inc. in Toronto, said the referendum result was much narrower than the markets had expected and had not really reduced the political risk of investing in Canada.
"It shows that Quebec has the political capacity to say 'yes' " to separation from Canada, Mr. Rubin said of the narrowness of the vote.
David Rosenberg, a senior economist with Nesbitt Burns in Toronto, reported a "temperate enthusiasm from a market point of view." He too said the 1.2 percent margin of victory was much too close to warrant unbridled optimism.
But, Mr. Rosenberg added, "With the vote out of the way, there is room for investors to focus on underlying positives" in the Canadian economy.
Though Canada carries one of the highest ratios of debt to gross national product in the Western industrial world, it also has one of the lowest rates of inflation -- currently just over 2 percent a year.
It is also running a record trade surplus with the United States, its foremost trading partner, of 15.2 billion Canadian dollars a year. And the Canadian Government looks like it will meet or exceed its target of cutting 32.7 billion Canadian dollars from the annual budget deficit this year.
The threat of Quebec separatism has obscured much of this for foreign investors and other observers, economists said.
Ted Carmichael, the chief economist for J.P. Morgan in Toronto, compared Canada-watching to a three-ring circus, with investors variously preoccupied by the fundamentals of the Canadian economy, the Government's progress toward deficit and debt reduction and political developments like the Quebec referendum.
"Like in any circus, the spotlight tends to shift from ring to ring," Mr. Carmichael said, with Quebec commanding recent attention.

HEADLINE: An Intricate Senate Procedure Lends a Hand to Welfare Recipients

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
With one clean swipe just before midnight Friday, the Democratic minority in the Senate knocked out of the big budget bill many of the harshest policies involving welfare.
No longer would the bill force families off welfare after they had been on relief for five years. 
 No longer would it allow states to deny welfare benefits to unwed mothers younger than 18 or to children born into families already on welfare.
No longer would the bill provide a bonus to states if their rate of out-of-wedlock births fell.
The Democrats did not succeed because they mustered a majority vote for their position -- the 46 Democratic senators voted to delete the provisions in question, while the 53 Republicans voted to retain them -- but because of an arcane procedure known as the Byrd rule.
The Senate's use of the rule raises some question about whether comprehensive welfare legislation, approved by both houses and favored in some form by President Clinton, can become law this year.
Under this Senate rule, named for its author, Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, provisions in budget bill can be successfully challenged on a point of order if they produce no change in revenue or spending or if such changes are "merely incidental" to the fiscal items. It takes a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes if all senators are present, to waive the rule.
The rule does not apply directly to the House, whose budget bill clamps down more on the poor than does the Senate's. But it will apply to any matter approved by a conference committee before the Senate.
So the rule is likely to complicate the work of the conference committee that this week is beginning to try to work out the differences between budget bills approved last week by the Senate and the House.
These are among the elements of the House bill, but not the Senate bill, that may not meet the test of the Byrd rule:
*Abolition of the Commerce Department.
*Merger of the Agency for International Development, the United States Information Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency into the State Department.
*Repeal of Federal nursing home standards.
*Overturning new Government regulations on livestock grazing on Federal land.
*Tightening of the United States embargo on Cuba.
*Revision of the Endangered Species Act.
None of these go to the heart of the budget measure, which is supposed to balance the budget in seven years, cut the taxes of middle- and upper-income taxpayers and shift control of most social programs from the Federal Government to the states.
But many are important to conservative Republicans in the House, where freshmen have no experience with the strange ways of the Senate. The party leaders may have to twist a good many arms to get these conservatives to vote for the compromise measure that comes out of the conference without these provisions.
The rule also complicates the politics of welfare legislation, which is going through Congress along two separate tracks.
The Senate and House have passed separate welfare bills almost identical to the welfare provisions in the budget bills. The notion of overhauling welfare is popular politically, and President Clinton has said he would sign a bill with welfare measures like those in the Senate bill.
The Republicans who control Congress decided to include the welfare provisions in the budget bill so they could blame Mr. Clinton for vetoing the popular legislation if, as is almost certain to happen, he vetoes the budget bill.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said he was reluctant, as a political matter, to give the President the opportunity to sign the former and veto the latter.
Then there is the question of a Senate filibuster. Under the rules, budget bills cannot be filibustered. But a separate welfare bill could be. The welfare bill was approved in the Senate last month by an overwhelming 87-to-12 vote. But many Democrats who voted for it might jump ship if they thought they could sustain a filibuster.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, the leading opponent of the welfare measure in the Senate, said tonight that he thought most Democrats who voted for the measure last month would join a filibuster if President Clinton drops the word.
Senator Byrd, who was the Democratic leader from 1977 until 1989 and who sees himself as the guardian of the prerogatives of the Senate, first got his budget rule approved by the Senate in 1985. It cannot be changed without a three-fifths majority in the Senate.
The rule was meant to counter the fact that under law only 20 hours of debate are permitted on the huge budget measures known as reconciliation bills. Before the Byrd rule was imposed, dozens of extraneous elements often managed to sneak into such bills without debate or the knowledge of many senators.

HEADLINE: At Co-ops, Entrenched Arrogance

SERIES: THE HOUSE RULES: Last of three articles.

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
When a group of Japanese urban planners visited New York recently as part of an exchange program, they were struck by any number of the city's singular quirks. Nothing, however, bemused them more than the discovery that every co-op building had its own peculiar array of rules, dictating all kinds of things, from who can live there to how fat their dogs can be.
Co-ops don't exist in Tokyo, and all condominiums there are subject to a uniform set of bylaws established by the city government. "What really boggled their minds was that a bunch of people get together here and set up their own rules," said Michael Kwartler, an urban planner with the New School. 
 Curiously, while New York has probably the most comprehensive law regulating the creation of co-op buildings, virtually nothing addresses the internal workings of a co-op once it is formed. That has meant that the strengths of co-ops are increasingly their points of friction. Owners may like that they have absolute control over their neighbors, but they don't seem to like that their neighbors have absolute control over them.
So while no one imagines that co-ops will wither and vanish, many agree that some issues need resolution if co-ops are to maintain their allure.
Increasingly, it is the co-ops' governing boards, which operate with great power and virtually no oversight, that are the focus of attention and discontent. The deficiencies of some boards have been newly defined by a corruption scandal involving managing agents and by shareholder irritation with some boards' furtive and overbearing ways.
In the wake of that scandal, people have begun calling for the licensing of managing agents. Whether that actually happens, boards feel they need to be more conscientious about whom they hire, and some are turning to consultants to advise them.
At the same time, said Clark Halstead, the head of Halstead Properties, more buildings are choosing to dismiss their agents and manage their affairs themselves, though then they must grapple with their own inexperience.
To some people, the scandal, and the way some boards have tried to compensate by exerting greater control, points directly to one of the system's most disquieting issues: the existence of a certain number of deeply entrenched, highly secretive boards that no longer represent their shareholders.
Many people advocate restricting tenures of board members. Assemblyman Alexander B. Pete Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat who lives in a rental building, has for a decade promoted a co-op bill of rights because complaints about co-ops from his constituents. "It's become a very imperial life style," he said.
His bill would require greater disclosure of information to shareholders and applicants, including the reasons behind all board decisions. But while the bill has regularly passed the Assembly, the Senate has refused to consider it, largely because of opposition by real estate interests.
Many people say that the system works well enough unencumbered. In any event, given the cost of regulation, coupled with the forces aligned against it, few people seriously think that many new rules fundamentally altering the system will ever be imposed.
"That's good news and bad news," said Walter Goldsmith, a real estate lawyer who once worked on co-op matters at the State Attorney General's office. "The good news is co-op owners will be able to do it themselves. The bad news is they will be able to do it themselves."
His point is that while owners may cherish the freedom, they are going to find the work ever more complex and onerous. Squabbling will persist.
Norman Schreiber is a 54-year-old freelance writer who lives in a Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, co-op, where he has served on the board for seven or eight terms. He is writing a murder mystery set in a co-op, and is voluble on the behavioral sociology of the institution.
"Theoretically, a co-op is an excellent experience on two levels," he said. "There's the sense of ownership that does make a difference in how you think and live and plan with each other. There's the notion of sharing. Economically, it makes sense, because the landlord -- you -- doesn't have a profit incentive.
"In real life, however, those issues sometimes get forgotten. People with very different ideas of how the world works come into conflict. There is the run-the-building-like-a-business approach. I often wonder, what business? Penn Central? Then there are those who want to run it like a social organization. It just doesn't work."
As a housing choice, the co-op seems unlikely to grow in prevalence, but neither is it likely to shrink. The reasons have to do with the sour promises for the local economy as well as the quirky nature of New Yorkers.
In the stagnant market of the 1990's, few buildings have converted to co-ops, and developers doubt that there will be more co-ops soon. All new buildings tailored for home ownership are condominiums, since they are easier to sell and sublet.
Yet no one foresees co-ops vanishing, or even being eclipsed by condominiums anytime in the 21st century. New Yorkers, it is often remarked, gain sustenance from irritation. Too much happiness seems to make them edgy. So the co-op system should weather any amount of defilement.
Indeed, if the always cyclical real estate market gathers momentum again, real estate people think more co-op conversions will occur. Mr. Kwartler, the urban planner, said that as the boundaries between where people live and work narrow, more people will desire the rigid control over neighbors that co-ops permit.
What is becoming another significant issue is the large number of co-op apartments not occupied by their owners. Many buildings have 70 to 80 percent of their stock in the hands of people who continue to rent them from the buildings' original sponsors. These hybrid buildings are especially difficult to manage, since renters often care less about the building, but also because owners frequently resent renters.
"Everyone anticipated sponsors would be there for a while," said Abbey Goldstein, a real estate lawyer. "But no one envisioned them being there forever. And there is tremendous abuse in regard to sponsors improperly keeping control of boards."
At least one case dealing with the right of investors to rent co-op apartments indefinitely is before the State Supreme Court.
It is true that some recent court decisions have gone against co-op boards, but none have significantly sapped their basic powers. In April, a court ruled that a woman could have a freezer in her co-op, in violation of house rules, after she established that she suffered from panic disorder and was unable to leave her apartment often enough to shop for food. In June, a court ruled that a co-op can't charge sublet fees unless that right is expressed in the lease and bylaws. Lawyers hurriedly began advising boards to spell out fines and restrictions in their bylaws.
Greater harmony may have to come in ad hoc ways. In many buildings, annual parties are held so people at least meet one another. In-house newsletters are distributed to strengthen communication.
Many promote arbitration and mediation to resolve co-op disputes. This would prevent cases like the recent one in which $130,000 in legal fees were exhausted to decide who should pay for window bars costing $924.
Lela Love, who directs a mediation clinic at the Cardozo Law School and has mediated many co-op cases, recalls the two warring couples in a Brooklyn co-op. For years, they fought over the banging noise that one couple's infant made at meals in his highchair. Not until the aggrieved couple tried to bring criminal charges of harassment against the other couple did they turn to mediation. A solution emerged: wrap the metal parts of the high chair in towels and put a carpet beneath the legs.
Just as they argue over whether to allow pianos, or dogs weighing more than 15 pounds, co-op owners find themselves divided over what they want.
A long-time co-op resident, after lamenting the constrained nature of the co-op system, was asked if she might prefer a condo. She gave a withering look and said: "Oh, no. Then anyone can move in."

HEADLINE: 'Yes' for New York Debt Reform

 BODY:
It took many years of profligate borrowing, shaky budgets and fiscal gimmickry for New York to sink to one of the lowest state credit ratings in the country. The state's poor standing is not simply an embarrassment. It costs taxpayers millions of dollars a year in extra debt service payments.
The best hope for improving the state's shoddy borrowing habits is an important, if little discussed, proposal to amend the State Constitution on the ballot Nov. 7. We strongly urge a "yes" vote on Ballot Proposal No. 3. 
 On paper, the New York State Constitution already imposes stringent controls on government borrowing. Bond issues must be approved by the voters, in theory, and the voters have been increasingly reluctant to do so. But since the days of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, state governments have circumvented voter resistance to bond issues by finding stealthy devices to issue debt without referendum approval. The principal means was the creation of state agencies that issued their own bonds, backed by the stated intention of the Legislature to make appropriations every year to retire them. Despite aggressive legal challenges, this form of backdoor indebtedness has been upheld by the state's highest court as legal because it was not considered the kind of debt barred by the State Constitution.
Today New York State has only $5 billion worth of bonds authorized by the voters -- and $23 billion worth issued by state agencies without voter approval.
Proposal No. 3 would amend the Constitution and outlaw such backdoor debt, except in a few instances. It would, however, enable the Legislature to authorize the issuing of bonds backed by specific revenues without approval by the voters, as long as their total does not exceed a cap pegged to a fixed amount of the total personal income reported by the state's residents. The measure will not necessarily cut down on New York's debts. But it will prohibit borrowing for day-to-day expenses, and make most future debt a direct obligation of the state.
Under the proposed amendment, the state would also be required to produce a long-range capital investment plan, subject to public hearings, so that citizens for the first time would be able to see its priorities clearly. The measure would also allow several bond issues to be proposed for approval at the same time, enabling voters to pick and choose which purposes they would like to support. Until now, only one big grab-bag bond issue was allowed for each election.
By far the biggest advantage is that the measure would make more clear the purposes of future debt and the revenues that will be available to pay it off. Once and for all it would forbid such practices as the selling of the state prison at Attica to the Urban Development Corporation, and then renting it back for a quick infusion of cash to meet expenses.
Ultimately, the most effective brake on borrowing will be pressure from the voters and the credit agencies. But everyone will benefit by making the process more open and based more on long-term planning than short-term expediencies.
Three other proposed constitutional amendments will be on the ballot:
* Proposal No. 1 would increase the maximum amount of money in damages that can be sought in lawsuits before the Civil Court of New York City or the District Court in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, from $25,000 to $50,000. We endorse this proposal as a reasonable adjustment to the impact of inflation on lawsuits that may be filed in the state's lower courts.
* We also recommend a "yes" vote for Proposal No. 2, which would make it clear that if a registered voter moves within the same county or within New York City, he or she does not need to re-register. The measure also incorporates several changes to make state law conform with Federal law.
* Proposal No. 4 would authorize the state to let the upstate town of Keene, near Lake Placid, acquire 12 acres from Adirondack State Park for a cemetery. In return the town would give 144 acres surrounding a nearby trout stream to the state. Environmentalists support the measure as a net gain for the park. We recommend a "yes" vote.

HEADLINE: For Fare Increase, M.T.A. Owes Us a Giveback

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority breached the $1 fare barrier on New York City buses and subways some years ago, I have found it more difficult to use this public service without the necessity of rationalizing whether or not each use was economically justified. O.K., call me a penny pincher, but I support a wife and two children. 
 With the fare increasing by 20 percent this time to a substantial $1.50, local transportation cost is going to become a household expense to weigh just like groceries.
Beginning Nov. 12, when the four of us decide to spend a weekend afternoon in Central Park or shopping for school shoes, as we recently did, the $12 round-trip transit fare will have to be factored in to our planned expenses. To us, $12 is not an insignificant amount of money.
Using the most conservative calculations, my family's minimum bus and subway fare expenses over a year will be $2,748. That is $229 a month. I could almost lease a car for that, and maybe I should, forgetting the nice idealism of helping to preserve the environment by relying on mass transit.
Assuming that a fare increase is justified and that all appropriate efficiency measures have been taken in management of the system, let us think of a way for the M.T.A. to give something back to the ridership and perhaps increase ridership as well.
Over the years the agency has tried half-fare programs. What I would like to see is a half-fare program at night and on weekends. This would place the burden on the commuter (I am one) and encourage use during off-peak hours. The mechanisms are already in place because it would be an extension of the seniors' half-fare program. How about it, M.T.A.?

HEADLINE: Who Put Ethics on Labor's New Agenda

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Labor Wakes Up" (editorial, Oct. 26) speaks to the hopes of many workers that a revitalized labor movement can grow again to improve economic and social conditions for all American workers. But one error is apparent to any knowledgeable observer of labor's debates over the past four or five months. 
 You credit supporters of the newly elected A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, John J. Sweeney, with the effort of the labor movement to "police itself vigilantly."
Although I supported Tom Donahue's re-election, I have no desire to reopen the campaign, and I am committed to doing what I can to help the new administration succeed. I firmly believe that Mr. Sweeney will attempt to pursue an ethical practices code and hope that you will be vigilant in reporting its successes.
However, the resolution to update an ethical practices code and to provide an enforcement mechanism was part of Mr. Donahue's campaign for re-election, not Mr. Sweeney's.
Mr. Donahue introduced this subject in his inaugural address on Aug. 1, pursued it over the objections of several Sweeney supporters, included it in his campaign literature (it never appeared in Mr. Sweeney's literature) and insured its adoption as the last piece of convention business over which he presided.
Tom Donahue has always deeply believed that labor needs to insure that no hint of corruption engaged in by a few individuals be allowed to taint the dedicated work of so many honest, hard-working trade union leaders.

HEADLINE: Kate Ericson, 39, Installation Artist

 BODY:
Kate Witte Ericson, an artist who collaborated with her husband, Mel Ziegler, on indoor and outdoor installation works noted for their beauty, complexity and social awareness, died on Sunday at her home in Milanville, Pa. She was 39 and also had a home in Manhattan.
The cause was brain cancer, her husband said. 
 Ms. Ericson was born in Manhattan in 1955. She earned a bachelor of fine arts degree from the Kansas City Art Institute in 1978 and a master's from the California Institute of the Arts in 1982. She and Mr. Ziegler met as undergraduates and began working together in 1978, developing a style that featured provocative accumulations of materials and ideas, many of them involved with architecture, American history and the economy.
One of their first solo shows, at the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art in 1986, consisted of a display of all the wood necessary to raise a house, with each piece carved with a phrase or adage about house or home. At the end of the exhibition, the wood was sold and used in the construction of a house.
Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler exhibited their work in many shows in the United States and abroad, including the 1989 Whitney Biennial. Their most recent New York exhibition was in 1993 at the Michael Klein Gallery in SoHo.
In addition to her husband, Ms. Ericson is survived by her parents, H. A. and Alma Ericson, of Norwalk, Conn., and a brother, Scott, of Arlington, Tex.

HEADLINE: Mike Figgis Reconsiders His Divorce From Hollywood

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 31

 BODY:
Mike Figgis has no illusions about the limited appeal of his new film, "Leaving Las Vegas." After all, it has no car chases and no explosions. It doesn't even have a serial killer, the trend of the moment in Hollywood.
"I really have no high expectations for the box office," said Mr. Figgis, a British director whose relationship with Hollywood can be characterized only as veering between ambivalence and despair. "I don't feel my life is on the line. Besides, it's already exceeded my expectations." 
 "Leaving Las Vegas" opened last week in New York and Los Angeles. Little or no fanfare preceded it, but it received some of the best reviews of the year. In the film, which expands around the nation this week, Ben, an alcoholic played by Nicolas Cage, goes to Las Vegas to end his life in a final binge. He meets and falls in love with a prostitute played by Elisabeth Shue; their bond seems mysterious, tender and desperate. "This small, searing film watches transfixingly as Ben plays out his final hand," Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times.
The movie is based on a semi-autobiographical novel by a screenwriter, John O'Brien, who killed himself two weeks after learning the book was to be made into a movie. O'Brien left no suicide note, but his father, Bill, said the book, also called "Leaving Las Vegas," served the same purpose. "The family came to the set one day, and I found it almost unbearably sad," Mr. Figgis said.
For the 45-year-old London-based director, whose past films include "Stormy Monday," "Internal Affairs" and "Mr. Jones," it is something of a personal vindication that the movie was made at all. It hardly surprised him that most of the major studios rejected it as too uncommercial; less expected were rejections from Miramax, Gramercy and Sony Classics, companies that are normally sympathetic to this kind of film. It is being released in the United States by MGM/UA.
"A year ago I was almost unemployable," Mr. Figgis said over breakfast at his hotel the other morning. "Frankly, I'm broke. But I feel optimistic. However bad the studio system is, the American film industry will always surprise you by taking a film like this and saying, 'We really like it.' It's true; you're only as good as your last picture."
By most accounts, including his own, Mr. Figgis's last Hollywood picture, "Mr. Jones," was not very good. In fact, he describes the experience as a nightmare.
The 1993 movie, which starred Richard Gere as a manic-depressive who falls in love with his psychiatrist (Lena Olin), was controlled by a revolving group of studio executives at Tri-Star, and producers whom Mr. Figgis despised.
"I've never in my life experienced anything that was so degrading, so humiliating, so completely lacking in respect," Mr. Figgis said. "Had it been anywhere but a film studio, people would have been on the floor bleeding."
The major source of disagreement on "Mr. Jones," according to the director, was the insistence of the producers and the studio that it be more upbeat. "They felt the film was too dark and wanted it more glamorous," Mr. Figgis said. "I thought it was a ludicrous idea. Manic-depression isn't something to dismiss lightly."
"You either learn from that kind of experience, or you turn very bitter," said Mr. Figgis, whose roots are in experimental theater and music, and who writes the scores for his movies. "And then this book turned up. I saw it as a symbol of something. The choice was to make a film or to try to make more money. Actually it was no choice."
Executives at Tri-Star disagreed strongly with the director's account, saying that "Mr. Jones" was always intended to be a love story and that Mr. Figgis failed to follow the script and instead asked the actors to improvise their lines. They said that the ending presented by Mr. Figgis was incoherent and that the studio took over the final editing.
The final outcome was a critical and financial failure that all parties would now like to forget.
It was while Mr. Figgis was involved in post-production work on "Mr. Jones" that Stuart Regan, a friend of his who runs an art gallery in Santa Monica, found the O'Brien novel in a secondhand bookstore, read it and brought it to Mr. Figgis's attention. "It was such a profoundly dark story," Mr. Figgis said. "And it was like a breath of fresh air to me, because it came along at not a very good time." (Mr. Regan is executive producer.)
Mr. Figgis took only a week to write the first draft, and immediately called Mr. Cage, whom he had met casually. "The book is brutal and very 90's, but there was a kind of old-fashioned charm and dignity to this man -- and Nicolas was the one actor I thought of."
Ms. Shue, who has played ingenue roles in such movies as "Adventures in Baby-Sitting" and "The Karate Kid," was cast partly because she seemed so wholesome. "I wanted the girl next door," said Mr. Figgis, who met Ms. Shue years ago when she read for a project and convinced him that she had talents untapped by studios.
With the help of his agent, Robert Newman at International Creative Management, Mr. Figgis raised the bulk of the film's cost, $3.5 million, from Lumiere Films, a French production, financing and distribution company. The actors and Mr. Figgis took virtually no money, and shooting was done on Super 16 film, normally used in documentaries, instead of 35 millimeter.
"It was lighter, it was cheaper, it was grittier, and it was a little more impressionistic," Mr. Figgis said. Sting, a friend of Mr. Figgis's since they worked together in 1988 on "Stormy Monday," volunteered to sing on the soundtrack.
The story has a deeply personal resonance for Mr. Figgis, who is married and has three children. "My parents were alcoholics," he said. "On weekends they would drink themselves into stupors, be out of control, irresponsible." (His father died of cancer; his mother is ailing.) The director spent his childhood in Nairobi, Kenya, in the fading days of British colonial rule.
"We lived in the lap of luxury with no money whatsoever," he said. For a while his mother worked as a secretary to Ernest Hemingway. He describes his father as "a charming, dashing Irishman" who held a succession of jobs, but mainly "he drank."
"We were always broke," Mr. Figgis recalled, "but we lived like kings."
As for the connection between the film and his parents, Mr. Figgis said, "A psychiatrist would say you associate yourself with the thing you would like to heal in yourself."
After the family relocated to northern England, Mr. Figgis began playing in rock-and-roll bands and later immersed himself in London's avant-garde theater world. His first major feature film, "Stormy Monday," set in Newcastle's steamy jazz world, and starring Tommy Lee Jones, Sting and Melanie Griffith, received strong reviews and caught the attention of Hollywood. His American directorial debut, "Internal Affairs," a police thriller with Richard Gere and Andy Garcia, made Mr. Figgis one of the more provocative and sought-after directors in town.
But the films that followed -- "Liebestraum," a thriller that brought Kim Novak out of retirement; "The Browning Version," starring Albert Finney and Greta Scacchi; and "Mr. Jones" -- were either critical or financial disappointments. With "Leaving Las Vegas," could Mr. Figgis's stormy relationship with Hollywood be on the upswing? He's not sure.
He would like to make a movie version of Strindberg's "Miss Julie," starring Juliette Binoche, late next year. In the meantime he's enjoying the reaction to his new film -- and waiting for offers.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
The Search for Peace in the Balkans: A Primer

 BODY:
After four years of war that followed the disintegration of Communist Yugoslavia - and added "ethnic cleansing" to the world's vocabulary of shame - the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia are meeting at an Air Force base in Ohio today to begin hammering out a peace settlement. If progress is made, the parties will move to Paris for continued negotiations. NATO has pledged to send 60,000 troops to enforce a peace.
 
THE PLAYERS
 
Slobodian Milosevic
President of Serbia
 The 54-year-old Communist turned nationalist has been blamed more than anyone else for the violence that has wracked the Balkans. In search of a Greater Serbia, his army or his proxies attacked Croatia and led a rebellion against the Muslim-dominated government of Bosnia. Squeezed by a United Nations economic embargo, his territorial holdings rolled back by force, he has recently brought the Bosnian Serbs to heel and sought a settlement. He is negotiating on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs.
 
Alija Izetbegovic
President of Bosnia
 The founder in 1990 of the Muslim nationalist party in Bosnia, Mr. Izetbegovic, 70, had served in prison for allegedly plotting to overthrow the Communists. A lawyer and a devout man, he has been accused by the Serbs of "fundamentalism," but he says he stands for tolerance. Elected president in 1990, he led his country to independence in 1992, arguing that the alternative was oppressive Serbian rule. But this helped set off a war for which the government was unprepared.
 
Franjo Tudjman
President of Croatia
 A one-time Communist official who was jailed by Tito for his ardent Croatian nationalism, Mr. Tudjman, 73, has made little secret of his desire to bring Croatians in Bosnia into the orbit of the motherland. But he relied on tacit American support for a military build-up to counterbalance Serbia and, under Western pressure, says he supports the integrity of Bosnia.
 
THE MAJOR ISSUES
 
TERRITORY
 Each side now controls an area roughly equal to what it would get ina settlement. But each has other areas it wants for security or historic reasons. The Serbs, for example, want a more secure corridor linking up their lands, while the Bosnians want a clear path to the surrounded enclave of Gorazde. Any trading of hard-won ground is certain to be wrenching.
 
ENDING HOSTILITIES
 Beyond the current cease-fire, the parties will have to agree on how far back to pull their armies, how to monitor troops and arms, whether military reductions will occur and how peacekeeping forces will be interposed. The Americans also seek to equialize forces by reducing Serb arms or increasing the government's.
 
CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
 How much power will the central government have? How will elections be organized and monitored? The details will determine whether Bosnia survives as a genuine country or a fiction, with its Serbian and Croatian areas effectively annexed by neighbors. The rights of displaced people to regain their homes will also be discussed.
 
EASTERN SLAVONIA
 Negotiators will try to set a timetable for the return of this Serb-held region to Croatia, and the protection of Serbs who remain as displaced Croats flood back in. The Croatian president has set a deadline to the end of November before conducting a military attack.
 
SARAJEVO
The future of Sarajevo, the symbolic heart of a multi-ethnic Bosnia, is in dispute. The government wants an open, shared city under its control; the Serbs want to keep the areas they control as part of their new republic.
 
WHAT'S BEEN DECIDED
 In previous meetings in Geneva and New York, the warring parties agreed on general priniciples. Bosnia is to remain a single country but it will be divided into two republics: one governed by the Bosnian-Croat federation, which will have about 51 percent of the territory and one by the Bosnian Serbs, which will have about 49 percent. Each can develop special ties to neighboring countries.
 The principles call for free, internationally monitored elections to select a collective national presidency, with two-thirds of its members from the Bosnian-Croat federation and one-third from the Serbvs, and a parliament divided along the same lines.
 
The Bosnian Serbs
 
Serbian leaders in Bosnia say their people fear life under Muslim domination, and had looked to Serbia for support for their rebellion, but are new reduced to seeking a semi-autonomous region. The political leader, Radovan Karadzic, and the military leader, Ratko Mladic, have both been indicted for war crimes and have lost Serbia's support for their war aims.
 
Croatia
 
Mainly Roman Catholic, with a population of nearly 5 million, Croatia has fought to regain its territory, with support from the West, which sees it as a counter-balance to Serbia. Now in an uneasy alliance with theBosnian government, its main immediate goal is to secure the return of eastern Slovania, seized by Serbs in 1991.
 
Bosnian and Herzegovina
 
When it broke from Yugoslavia in 1992, Bosnia's population of 4.6 million was about one-half Muslim - mainly Slavic people who adopted Islam under Ottoman rule - one-third Serb and one-fifth Croat. The government, dominated by Muslims, says it is committed to a pluralistic society, and it now hopes that international backing will preserve its borders.
 
Bosnian-Croat Federation
 
At American urging, Bosnian Croats and government forces stopped fighting each other in 1994 and forged an alliance to battle the Bosnian Serbs. The federation is to govern about half of Bosnia under the peace settlement, but the government is alarmed by indications that local Croats are deepending their ties to Croatia.
 
Serbia
 
A majority of Serbia's 10 million people are Orthodox Christian Serbs, but te country also includes restive Albanian and Hungarian minorities. At first the undisputed powerhouse of the region, Serbia and Montenegro retained the name of Yugoslavia, an entity not widely recognized by other countries. President Milosovic fanned the flames of nationalism, but the dream of a Greater Serbia has wilted.
 
Four Tortuous Years of Talk, Broken Promises and War
 
1991
 
JUNE -- Croatia and Slovenia declare independence. In Slovenia, the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army agrees to withdraw after 10 days of fighting. In Croatia, the Krajina region is seized by local Serbs.
 
SEPTEMBER -- United Nations imposes an arms embargo on the former Yugoslav republics. Serbs take over eastern Slavonia region of Croatia, destroying city ov Vukovar.
 
OCTOBER -- Serbs begin seige of Dubrovnik.
 
1992

APRIL -- European Community and United States recognize Bosnia. Serbian siege of Sarajevo begins. A vicious Serbian campaign to evict or kill Muslims in scores of towns and villages throughout Bosnia begins.
 
MAY -- U.N. imposes an economic embargo on Serbia and Montenegro after a shell kills more than a dozen people lined up for bread in Sarajevo.
 
MAY-OCTOBER -- Serbs engage in widespread and brutal "ethnic cleansing" of areas they conquer, ejecting Muslims. Tens of thousands of Muslim men are put in detention camps and widespread rape of Muslim women is reported.
 
OCTOBER -- U.N. imposes a 'no-flight zone' over Bosnia to deter Serb attacks (not enforced until April '93).
 
1993
 
JANUARY -- Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen announce a peace proposal to divide Bosnia into 10 provinces. Plan falls apart after rejection by Bosnian Serb assembly in May.
 
APRIL -- War erupts between Bosnian Muslims andCroats over territory. Croats in the Mostar region throw Muslims into camps similar to those run by the Serbs.
 
MAY -- Serbia, squeezed by economic sanctions, says it is cutting off aid to the Bosnian Serbs, though some supplies continue.
 
1994
 
FEBRUARY -- A Serbian shell at the Sarajevo marketplace kills 69 people and prompts NATO to set an ultimatum for the withdrawal of Serbian artillery around the city. Most guns remain in place but are monitored by the U.N.
 As Bosnian Serbs make large gains in eastern Bosnia, United Nations declares several "safe areas" and threatens NATO air strikes to maintain them.
 United States sponsors uneasy federation between Muslims and Croats.
 
APRIL -- First NATO air strikes, on Serbian forces around Gorazde, triggered by Bosnian Serb attack on this "safe area." Serbs take U.N. peacekeepers hostage, and pinprick air attacks stop.
 
1995
 
MAY -- Situation in Sarajevo deteriorates as Serbs resume using heavy guns. NATO air strikes near Pale are followed by the seizure of over 400 United Nations hostages by the Serbs. Air strikes are halted.
 
JULY -- Serbs overrun Srebenica and Zepa and expel Muslims, including these women and children, and massare thousands of Muslim men, causing world outrage. NATO threatens extensive air strikes if Gorazde is attacked.
 The War Crimes Tribunal at the Hague indicts Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military commander, bringing the number of indictments to nearly 50.

HEADLINE: U.S. Wages Up 2.7% in Year, A Record Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
The expanding economy that has propelled stock prices to record levels has not spilled over to the paychecks of American workers, whose earnings rose by 2.7 percent in the last 12 months, the smallest amount on record, the Labor Department reported today.
In the year that ended in September, wages and salaries rose by 2.8 percent and benefits rose by 2.2 percent, resulting in the calculation of a 2.7 percent overall rise in earnings. Inflation for the same period was 2.5 percent, while economic growth was 3.5 percent. 
 The figures also showed that business was succeeding in its effort to bring down the cost of health care. The amount spent on health benefits fell by one-tenth of 1 percent, the first decline since the Government began tracking these costs in 1981. As recently as 1988, health spending was going up 14 percent a year.
Since the mid-1980's, the incomes of middle-class households have stagnated. But today's figures underscore the view that even in a year with a solidly expanding economy, a roaring stock market and strong corporate profits, many American workers cannot find perceptible improvements in their earnings.
The frustration and insecurity that have resulted are expected to play a major role in shaping next year's Presidential race as politicians of both parties try to portray themselves as the best choice to provide economic growth that will benefit the middle class.
President Clinton has already found it hard to get political credit for the strong economy, and stagnant paychecks will make it harder for him to contend that he has helped the average worker. But the results also hold out little joy for the Republicans as they try to deal with public skepticism about many of the Federal spending cuts they plan to enact in such areas as education and Medicare.
"There is something wrong with rising profits, rising productivity and a soaring stock market but employee compensation heading nowhere," Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich said today.
Representative Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey, a senior member of the Banking Committee, said today that the figures were a result of broad changes in the structure of the American economy. "It's not the fault of either party or budget problems," she said. "It's the fundamental changes in the technological base and employment patterns."
But, she added, "If we don't get the budget deficit down and we don't reorder our savings and tax policies, we'll never be able to tackle this."
While economic growth has been steady, Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, contends that it has not been high enough to drive up wages. Faster growth will not occur without lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve and more Government support for exports, he said.
"If we are concerned about wages and workers' standard of living, we ought to focus more on doing all we can to raise growth," he said. Many analysts do expect the Federal Reserve will lower short-term interest rates one more time this year.
The hope that higher growth will lift compensation may be of scant comfort to workers worried about keeping their jobs. Even as economic growth remains steady, companies continue to announce plans to shed jobs, the latest being an announcement today that W. R. Grace & Company would cut 800 jobs by the end of next year.
The job insecurity bred by such cutbacks was cited this month by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, as a major factor in the slowdown in labor compensation. "That fear has doubtless played a significant role in the slowdown in the growth of labor compensation as workers have in effect sought to preserve their jobs by accepting lesser increases in wages," he said.
Today's figures, however, offered hope that incomes could be about to grow somewhat faster.
"We are getting health costs under control," said Joseph E. Stiglitz, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "That leaves more room for wages to increase."
While some analysts remain skeptical that reductions in benefit costs can be sustained, there is a growing sense that some significant portion will be shared with workers as well as with stockholders.
Specialists say that most of the savings so far have come not from a shrinking of benefits or a shifting of costs to workers but from companies using their leverage to bargain harder with hospitals, clinics and other providers of health care.
"Employers have become a lot smarter in using their leverage to negotiate and providers are doing all they can to keep their share of the market," said Charles Kerby, an official at William M. Mercer Inc., a consulting firm based in New York.
Today's report showed that total compensation costs rose just six-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter, matching the first quarter of this year for the smallest increase since the series began in 1982.
Wages and salaries were up seven-tenths of 1 percent for a 12-month total of 2.8 percent, while benefit costs were up four-tenths of 1 percent for a 2.2 percent yearly rise.
For workers in private industry, employment costs rose six-tenths of 1 percent, or 2.6 percent over 12 months. That, according to economists at Merrill Lynch, is probably the smallest rise in at least 40 years.
Wayne Shelly of the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, noting the decades of minimal gains in benefits, said the Merrill Lynch assessment sounded "reasonable."
The figures for health costs were not published separately from benefits as a whole, which also encompass vacation, holidays, sick leave, shift differentials, life insurance, retirement benefits, unemployment insurance and severance pay.
But Mr. Shelly said health costs eased one-tenth of 1 percent in the latest 12 months, the first time they had shown such a retreat.
As gauged by the Consumer Price Index, inflation in medical care has moderated significantly in recent years but still ran at 4.4 percent for the 12 months through September. The decline in employers' costs implies that some hard bargaining was done by corporate America.
For the 12 months through September, today's report showed, workers in service industries posted compensation gains of 2.9 percent compared with 2.1 percent for those in goods-producing industries. This was markedly different from the year ended September 1994 when the increases of both groups were separated by just one-tenth of a point, straddling 3.25 percent.
White-collar workers had bigger gains than blue-collar workers, 2.8 percent to 2.3 percent, while non-union workers, up 2.7 percent, did a bit better than union workers, up 2.4 percent, the report also found.
One of the biggest gains came for workers at colleges and universities, where pay and benefits rose 4.7 percent. Machine operators, assemblers and inspectors, on the other hand, gained just 1.8 percent.
By region, compensation increases for the 12 months were 2.7 percent in the Northeast, 2.8 percent in the South, 2.5 percent in the Midwest and 2.1 percent in the West. Workers in metropolitan areas gained 2.7 percent, with those in other areas up 2.4 percent.
In a separate report today, the department said collective-bargaining settlements reached by private industry in the third quarter called for smaller increases than the contracts they replaced, the 12th consecutive period this had occurred. The average increases were 3.2 percent in both the first year and over the term of the contract, compared with increases of 3.8 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively, in the contracts being replaced. Most of those older contracts were negotiated in 1992.
Last week, the department reported that median weekly earnings of wage-and-salary workers climbed 3.7 percent over the latest 12 months. After adjustment for inflation, the real gain was 1 percent.

A front-page headline on Wednesday about a Labor Department report showing the smallest increase in labor costs on record misstated the rise in wages and salaries for the last 12 months in some editions. As the article stated, they rose 2.8 percent, not 2.7 percent. Earnings, consisting of wages, salaries and benefits, rose 2.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Turning Rockers Into High Rollers

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
With his baseball cap turned backward and a silver earring bobbing as he strummed a few chords on an air guitar, 29-year-old Philip Weck was not your typical casino customer. But then again, this was not your typical Vegas hot spot: music by Pearl Jam pumped through the sound system and an electronic board above a bank of slot machines counted the diminishing number of acres of rain forest left on mother earth.
"It's more like a party than a casino," Mr. Weck observed, taking a break from a post-midnight romp at the roulette table in the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino here. "It's more familiar to people like me than the Strip." 
 You say you want a revolution? By most standards, the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, which opened with high-decibel pomp last spring, is less than radical. An affiliate of the Hard Rock Cafes, it bills itself as the spot in Las Vegas for people who do not like Las Vegas, but it is ultimately a place to eat, drink and gamble, with plenty of buxom cocktail waitresses.
When it opened, there was only a hope that a younger crowd would discover Vegas, and that if it did, the newcomers would spend freely. Now there are answers to both questions. The hotel says that it turns away as many as 300 people seeking reservations every weekend, and that the Hard Rock's revenues are running more than 50 percent ahead of projections.
With tens of thousands of young customers like Mr. Weck attracted by the slick rock-and-roll aura, this may prove a hint of things to come in Las Vegas, which has been experimenting for several years with ways of reinvigorating its time-tested, if slightly tired, formula of glitz, schlock and the lure of easy money.
The Hard Rock is also showing the way for what will undoubtedly be forays by other entertainment-oriented companies -- from Planet Hollywood, which is working with Caesars Palace, to the leading movie studios -- into the enormously profitable gambling business.
The top executives of the Sony Corporation, for instance, have been given tours of the Hard Rock by its chairman, Peter Morton, and even the Walt Disney Company, which has denied rumors that it is considering opening a casino, has said it may test the waters by putting slot machines on cruise ships it is building.
The initial success of the Hard Rock is a sign of the new marketing strategies being employed in the $40 billion gambling industry as it overcomes old moral and legal restraints and makes its way into America's mainstream.
For instance, many casino operators here have sought to shed the old image of mob-infiltrated dens of sin filled with an aging tour-bus crowd by appealing to clean-cut families. They have added amusement parks and hotels built around themes like pirates or ancient Egypt.
But the Hard Rock is looking beyond that clientele, which has a median age of 46. Mr. Morton said the median age of a Hard Rock customer was 35, and was better educated and more well-to-do than the industry average.
"I'm not sure you can even call this a yuppie crowd," said Barbara Hein, a 39-year-old dealer in the Hard Rock casino, as she surveyed its youthful mix of customers. "They're younger than that."
She added: "I don't know where they get it all, but they sure do have money to spend. I can't believe it."
Neither can Mr. Morton, co-founder of the Hard Rock empire and 60 percent owner of the hotel and casino.
"We knew they'd come, but people are betting a lot more than we thought," he said. "There are yuppies out there who'll really play blackjack. I mean, they play with real money. It's amazing."
The remaining 40 percent of the hotel and casino is owned by Harvey's Casino Resorts. The operation is private and does not release financial figures. Mr. Morton said, however, that it would produce revenues of about $100 million in the first year, compared with initial projections of $60 million.
One of the greatest surprises is the 2,000-square-foot retail store, which sells an array of Hard Rock paraphernalia, from T-shirts to caps for children -- all of which bear the Hard Rock insignia and are thus free advertising. Sales from the store are 75 percent ahead of budget, Mr. Morton said.
Young gamblers are also walking away with thousands of the casino's $25 playing chips, which carry an image of Jimi Hendrix. Each chip costs the Hard Rock a little more than 50 cents.
All that is why seven months after the opening of the 340-room hotel, Mr. Morton is thinking of doubling its size, with construction perhaps starting next year.
"What it proves so far is that there is real strong demand for that kind of product in the casino industry," said Mark Manson, a gambling analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "It is hard to get that younger group. But this works."
The flood of revenues is not being matched by profits, though. The hotel and casino, a short way from the Strip, the site of the biggest casinos (many with more than 2,000 rooms), overran its initial construction budget of $78 million and ended up costing $102 million.
And, at least so far, the Hard Rock has cost more to run than anticipated as the hotel and casino fine-tune their formulas. Salomon Brothers estimated that the Hard Rock contributed $400,000 to Harvey's net income in the third quarter, about a third of what the securities firm had expected.
"There were some costs that ran over a bit and we did some experimentation, so costs exceeded our expectations," said Charles W. Scharer, chief financial officer of Harvey's. "But the property is very strong."
The Hard Rock is a study in details. From the 82-foot Gibson guitar out front to the guitar-shaped slot machine handles, Red Hot Chili Pepper chips, saxophone chandelier and vintage Harley-Davidson motorcycle mounted above the tables, the place oozes hip ostentation. The nightclub, called the Joint, has featured acts from Bob Dylan to Melissa Etheridge and the Eagles.
The Do Not Disturb signs for the hotel rooms -- which begin at $75 for a double during the week and $135 on weekends -- read, "I hear Ya' Knockin' But Ya' Can't Come In." And the hotel room art, rather than the usual prints of anonymous seaside villages, consists of photos of rock greats like B.B. King and the Beatles. The rock music played at the pool, which has a sandy beach, is also broadcast underwater.
In short, it is a marketing laboratory, an attempt to remake an old product with new packaging.
"We've become what we wanted to be: the alternative to Caesars Palace," said Stephen L. Cavallaro, the Hard Rock's general manager. "Our cards asking people how they liked staying here say, 'Did you dig it or was it bogus?' More than 8 out of 10 rate us as awesome. Now that just blows me away."
Mr. Morton, of course, understands the marketing edge he has created.
"People sit around the pool, on the beach, and I love it when they say, 'I don't feel this is really Las Vegas,' " he said. "But economically I always look at it as Las Vegas."
One thing the formula misses are the high rollers, who create an aura that many other customers find attractive.
"This is real nice for a change, but these are real small players," said Margaret Thurston, a 50-something woman who works at a nearby hotel as a concierge and who was playing the Hard Rock's slot machines. "This place isn't in the same league as the other casinos with the high rollers."
A benefit of the younger crowd, however, is that they are more inclined to play the table games, which tend to be more profitable for the casino. That reverses a longtime trend at the nation's casinos, which have seen an increasing share of their earnings come from slot machines. They now reap a little more than half their revenues from the slots.
"One lesson we're learning is that the younger customers like more interactive activities," Mr. Cavallaro said. "Craps is more interactive than the slots. That's where they go."
For Mr. Morton, this is clearly just a first step away from the burgers-and-oldies formula of his cafes, as he seeks to find more ways to cash in on the brand name he has created. Casinos in other cities are a possibility, he said, as well as hotels and resorts with other partners. He also acknowledged that he had considered taking the Hard Rock empire public.
"I don't need to bring more lawyers and more accountants into my life," he insisted. "I have enough already. I don't need the money. But I've run my company in such a way that it could go public like . . . " And he snapped his fingers.
For now, he has demonstrated that someone who might not have favored gambling before can be attracted by the right atmosphere.
"Whoooaa!" said Tony Zaldivar, a 30-year-old auto restorer from Chicago, when asked why he had come to the Hard Rock.
"I always meet cool people here," said Mr. Zaldivar, who was sporting two earrings in his left ear, long black hair, a goatee and a sleeveless sweatshirt. "It's more my kind of people, my kind of music. You know?"
He added: "It's just a cool scene. Are you really a reporter, in Vegas?"

HEADLINE: Farewell to the Steam Table

BYLINE: By ALFRED GINGOLD and HELEN ROGAN 

 BODY:
AT Bertelsmann, employees can nibble fresh sushi in a sleek dining room overlooking the Great White Way. At Pfizer, they can pre-order their children's birthday cakes and pick them up on the way home. On request (not before), the server at Mount Sinai's Kosher Corner will prepare a serious pastrami sandwich garnished with the sort of sour pickle seldom experienced north of Delancey Street. Hungry lawyers at Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler can choose between Chilean sea bass with peppers, mango and pineapple or a soft-shell crab sandwich with curry mayonnaise.
New York's company cafeterias are not what they used to be. 
 Gone from most places are the tired sandwiches, the soggy fries, the mystery-meat stews gently decomposing on the steam table. Nowadays, while there is still no such thing as a free lunch (except at very few places) the lunchtime living can be easy indeed.
There are, of course, some exceptions. At glitzy Conde Nast, a small uninspiring cafeteria dishes out mayonnaise-laden salads and hot foods off the steam table. The lissome editorial assistants merely race in for a "bialy, no butter," endless iced coffee, Dannon Light and (daringly) an egg white omelet on dry toast.
Companies have spruced up their cafeterias because in the 90's it makes business sense. A good meal at a reasonable price (less than $5 in most places, including beverage) in pleasant surroundings is a hefty benefit, generating good will and increasing productivity. The estimated 300 to 400 employee dining rooms are economical if they draw 80 percent of the employees at least once a day.
Most of the new cafeterias are in the hands of food service specialists, often subsidiaries of giant multinational corporations, which run them for profit or for a fee. Subsidized cafeterias remain popular, especially at law firms.
"It's not uncommon for people to be working through the night," said Mike Bailey of Compass International, the parent company of Flik International, which feeds many lawyers. "You'd better make sure you feed 'em well for that $3 billion deal."
What the new cafeterias have in common is more striking than their differences. To begin with, please do not call them "cafeterias"; those in charge prefer "employee dining facilities." Most are intended to be peaceful: cool colors, flowers, blond wood, carpets and tables far enough apart for privacy.
At Scholastic Inc.'s main offices in a renovated SoHo loft, the whole 12th floor was designed as the cafeteria. Outside, there is a terrace with sculpture, a stage, arbors, Adirondack furniture and spectacular views; inside, a room full of light, greenery, Fiestaware, exposed pipes and ducts painted in soft pastels and a jukebox stocked with classics like "Goodbye Cruel World [I'm Off to Join the Circus.]"
Even when the physical plant is unpromising, a soothing effect can be created. The cafeteria at Metropolitan Life, run by Aramark, is on a basement floor, but the look is of an indoor courtyard, with hanging plants, indirect lighting and thick white pillars.
Numerous extras win employee allegiance: At Scholastic, managed by Good Food, a small company in New York, there is free biscotti with your cappuccino, a daffodil or chocolate covered strawberry on the first day of spring and an employees' birthday breakfast every month. Kaye, Scholer, which handles its own cafeteria, offers free lunch on snowy days, cooking classes and an "appreciation day" for each employee, with a free lunch or candlelight dinner.
Most cafeterias have few lines. Instead, separate stations bearing names like the Kettle or Itsa Pizza or Varieties offer everything from tacos to Thai. At serving stations, warmed up with quasi-rustic touches, Restaurant Associates cafeterias display fruit and baked goods in baskets on farmhouse tables; at Restaura's operations at Paine Webber and Nynex, dishes are showcased on wrought-iron bakers' racks, and at Saatchi & Saatchi, Flik uses white crocks instead of the dreaded stainless steel.
So how is the food? Well, all pretty good. At Nynex, the chicken is lemony and light, and the arugula gritless; at Rockefeller University, the European sandwiches are served on bread from Eli's and the Tom Cat Bakery as well as the ubiquitous Fink; at Mount Sinai's cafeteria, run by Marriott International, diners can sample four salad vinegars.
And all of them offer serious coffee. While espresso and cappuccino are still big among media and financial types, others have moved on to flavored (often weirdly flavored) coffee; at Nynex, for example, it was butter pecan.
All the emphasis is on fresh preparation. In each of the dozen cafeterias visited, a cheerful person in a chef's hat was sharpening knives a la Benihana, tossing the elements of a stir fry or saucing pasta. These so-called boredom breakers keep the customers coming back.
Because the trend of the moment is lighter eating, salad bars have been overhauled and now offer fish or grilled chicken, perfectly cooked asparagus, hearts of palm, roasted vegetables and grains of many lands. The refrigerators teem with diet sodas and designer water. "Sure, people are diet-conscious when it comes to drinks," said Roy Elvove, Flik's man at Saatchi.
The food services all offer selections with names like Healthy Choice, Spa Menu and Living Right. Signs bearing little red apples or heart-shaped toothpicks stuck in the healthy stuff guide diners to make good dietary choices.
Although people are eating turkeyburgers and pasta more than before, they are easily discouraged. That is why, said Michael Kowalczyk, the chef at Kaye, Scholer, "We offer a low-fat lunch, which is a cold plate, but we don't give calorie amounts; people aren't ready to face the truth and look at two ounces of steamed salmon."
In small ways, every cafeteria comes to reflect the corporate culture enveloping it. At Metropolitan Life, a smiling woman dishes out hefty yellow cupcakes with brown icing in honor of the Preference Plus Account Variable Annuity Fifth Birthday.
At Rockefeller University, seasonal decorations are frowned upon. "They don't want to trash the place up," said John Harding of Restaurant Associates, looking around at the high-ceilinged airy room with its breathtaking views of the East River. Saatchi offers bright little bags for those who eat at their desks, while Ogilvy & Mather's cafeteria, a Gardner Merchant operation, tries to use as many client-sponsored products as possible, like Hershey chocolate and Birds Eye vegetables. It even has an after-hours bar.
One of the most idiosyncratic cafeterias in New York has to be the one done by Restaurant Associates for the performers at the Metropolitan Opera, where during the season you can see up to 1,600 people, many in costume, wolfing down cheeseburgers. (Placido Domingo is often there, while Pavarotti has everything brought to his dressing room, including mint tea and the Wellbred carrot cake, to which he is so devoted that the standing order is doubled when he is appearing.)
But the strangest cafeteria of all is at the United Nations, where Restaurant Associates serves a population of 7,000 people. Since the U.N. is not subject to American laws, the first thing anyone notices is the blue haze of cigarette smoke hanging over the premises. There is wine by the checkout, no diet soda to speak of, a perfunctory salad bar, and a person who makes espresso so well that world citizens line up for it. The menus are established after tortuous deliberations of a special committee; there are no seasonal observances, since no one wants to risk an international incident.
To give people what they want, cafeteria managers test new dishes and hold focus groups. "Don't add fancy herbs to good soup," one Bertelsmann employee said, while another complained of garlic overload. (To which the chef replied, "I am French and I feel I must do it.")
Despite the changes, all the managers emphasized that the modern cafeteria could not subsist on salad and low-fat yogurt. Saatchi's dessert station always includes big bowls of Jell-O, chocolate and rice pudding and whipped cream; at Ogilvy, the most popular dish is meat loaf; at Mount Sinai, fried chicken is very big. Even at Rockefeller University, where the fat gene was isolated, there are plenty of burgers and fries -- all the standard artery cloggers that even intellectuals, it seems, crave.

HEADLINE: Justices Consider Limit on Liquor Ads

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
A Supreme Court argument today on whether a state may constitutionally ban the advertising of liquor prices presented an interesting mix of free-speech principles and economic theory. If advertising is a form of constitutionally protected speech -- as the Court has held for 20 years -- can the state restrict truthful advertising about a lawful product to reduce consumer demand?
Lurking on the edges of the argument, never explicitly acknowledged but clearly on the Justices' minds, were the potential consequences of whatever answer they might give for Government regulation of advertising for other products, including cigarettes. 
 "Is your product special, or would the Court also be saying that the state can stop price advertising across the board" for products that can reasonably be described as harmful, Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked Rebecca T. Partington, a Special Assistant Attorney General from Rhode Island, who was asking the Court to uphold her state's restriction on liquor advertising.
"Alcohol stands in a unique position," Mrs. Partington replied. She cited the social problems caused by excessive drinking as well as the long history of Government regulation of liquor, including the 21st Amendment, which repealed Prohibition while leaving considerable regulatory power to the states.
But some Justices appeared to doubt the Court could decide the case in a way that would not have effects, perhaps unanticipated, on the regulation of products beyond liquor, especially given a 1986 Supreme Court decision that permitted limits on advertising by gambling casinos. It would be difficult to claim a unique position for alcohol on a list that already includes gambling, Justice David H. Souter suggested.
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy asked whether states could limit advertising about firearms, prompting Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to ask: "You ask about guns -- what about butter?" Justice Antonin Scalia added: "Some states may hate red meat."
Rhode Island's law, which dates to 1956, prohibits liquor advertisements that include not only prices but suggestive words like sale or wow. Two liquor stores challenged the law in Federal District Court in Providence in 1992 and won a ruling that the statute was an unconstitutional restriction on commercial speech.
But the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, overturned that ruling and upheld the law last year. The state did not have to prove its theory that the advertising restriction would translate into lower liquor consumption, the appeals court said, noting that all that was required was for the state's rationale to be reasonable.
Arguing today for the liquor stores, Evan T. Lawson said the state should not be permitted to restrict speech when it could achieve its regulatory goal of lowering consumption by increasing the state tax on liquor or by setting minimum prices.
Mr. Lawson acknowledged that states are free under the 21st Amendment to ban liquor sales entirely. "But you can't say that because you have the power to ban something, you have the power to ban speech about something you're not banning," he said. Mr. Lawson said the state had failed to provide even minimal proof that the advertising restriction reduced consumption, adding that liquor consumption in Rhode Island was relatively high compared to that of other states.
"Isn't there a certain latitude allowed to a state to indulge a common-sense presumption?" Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist asked.
In her argument on behalf of the state, Mrs. Partington said "generally accepted economic principles" support the reasonableness of the state's view that the advertising restriction will lead to generally higher prices that in turn lead to reduced consumption, serving the state's goal of curbing alcohol abuse and "promoting temperance."
Ten other states, including Connecticut, prohibit or restrict the advertising of liquor prices.
In an advertising restriction that extends beyond price, the city of Baltimore has banned billboards and other outdoor advertising of alcoholic beverages in some locations. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, dismissed a constitutional challenge to the Baltimore ordinance earlier this year. Last week, Anheuser-Busch appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.
The case before the Court today, 44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island, No. 94-1140, attracted wide attention, with the liquor stores receiving support from organizations not usually found on the same side of constitutional debates. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a brief describing the state law as a restriction on truthful information that should receive the most strict constitutional scrutiny. A conservative public interest law firm, the Institute for Justice, filed a brief describing the law as economic protectionism that intrudes on the normal operation of the market for liquor.
Many of these groups are also carefully watching the evolution of national policy on cigarette advertising. In August, President Clinton proposed Federal regulations to curb smoking among teen-agers by limiting cigarette advertising in magazines with young readerships, prohibiting outdoor advertising of cigarettes within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds and limiting promotions and store displays. Tobacco manufacturers promptly filed suit, as did a coalition of advertisers and advertising agencies and the Magazine Publishers of America.
The fact that the Justices posed hypothetical questions today about so many products other than cigarettes may have reflected their assumption that they will soon have to address restrictions on cigarette advertising in the context of a real case.
In a second case today, the Court heard arguments in an employee-benefit dispute that could determine the legal obligation of employers who administer health and welfare plans to make sure employees understand any weaknesses in the plan or any limitations on their eventual right to benefits.
The case is an appeal by the Varity Corporation, a Buffalo-based manufacturer of industrial machinery. Varity, faced in 1986 with serious weaknesses in some product lines, spun those products off into a new company, the Massey Combines Corporation, and persuaded thousands of employees to transfer to the new company by telling them that its prospects were bright and their benefits would not be changed. Retired Varity employees were simply transferred into the new company's benefits plan without being told.
In fact, Massey Combines had a negative net worth when it was formed and went into receivership within two years. Current and retired workers lost their health benefits and brought a successful lawsuit under a Federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, usually known as Erisa.

HEADLINE: Ukraine Sells Its Companies, but Buyers Are Few

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine

 BODY:
Almost a year ago, Washington eagerly promoted a Ukrainian plan to sell 8,000 state companies and pledged tens of millions of dollars and squads of Western consultants to help accomplish the task quickly.
The transfer of the enterprises to private hands was to be the centerpiece of an ambitious billion-dollar post-cold-war aid program to bolster a financially ravaged and politically precarious Ukraine into a stable buffer between Russia and Eastern Europe. 
 Since early last year, after Ukraine finally agreed to dismantle its nuclear weapons, Washington has increased its total aid package to $900 million for 1994-95, including the privatization program. This makes Ukraine the fourth largest recipient of American foreign aid, behind Israel, Egypt and Russia.
But the showcase privatization program, which Washington expected to be a key to a market economy, has run into deep trouble.
American and Ukrainian officials say Washington pushed ahead on the plan despite grave doubts about its effectiveness, and knowing that Ukraine's powerful directors of state companies were resistant.
In the last year, nearly $67 million has been spent on privatization by the United States Agency for International Development and the companies it hired to carry out the program, A.I.D. officials here say.
But only 300 of the 8,000 companies have been sold, and fewer than half the eligible Ukrainians have bothered to pick up the free certificates that entitle them to be shareholders in privatized companies, the officials added. In a comparable time Russia, which also received substantial A.I.D. money for privatization, has accomplished much of its program.
The A.I.D. director here, Gregory F. Huger, said in September in a sharply worded letter to Prime Minister Yevhen Marchuk, "The program is now at risk of collapse."
Mr. Huger, whose letter was also signed by top officials from the European Union and the World Bank, warned that Ukraine's entire economic reform program was in jeopardy because of the slow pace of privatization.
To try to rescue the program, Mr. Huger urged the Government to take a number of quick steps, including lowering share prices. But the Government went in the opposite direction: in early October, Parliament barred privatization of half the 8,000 companies, and Mr. Marchuk presented an economic program that gave short shrift to privatization.
For most Ukrainians, privatization seems to be unfathomable, or at the very best a dubious offer.
Vesker Ihorovych, a director at the South Building Construction Company in Kiev, has been trying to interest his 1,700 employees in picking up their certificates and investing them in their company. But he is concerned, despite his campaign, that the company will remain unsold.
"Everyone asks: 'Concretely, what am I going to get out of this?' " he said. "For me to say in these hard times that if you get your share, you will get your dividends tomorrow, and then put a smile on my face -- -- it's a tough sell."
The desultory pace of privatization is clearly visible in Donetsk, the most populous province in Ukraine.
The newly opened privatization center, which is managed by Price Waterhouse, the main company hired by A.I.D., is in an unmarked out-of-the-way office building. The cramped, poorly lighted office is staffed by a young Ukrainian and a Peace Corps volunteer, one of six hired by Price Waterhouse to keep down costs on the firm's $26 million contract.
But on one recent morning, the volunteer, Richard Chitwood, did not speak enough Russian or Ukrainian to deal with his first visitor, a local plant manager. After a translator helped Mr. Chitwood, a recent graduate of business management school in Texas with no practical experience, the manager left in disgust.
"Before delivering lectures here, the American guy should learn the laws," said the manager, Igor Shinkorenko, stuffing the paper Mr. Chitwood gave him into his pocket. "It's not the U.S. Congress that delivers laws here, but the Parliament of Ukraine."
Down the street, at the State Property Fund, Vladimir Altinnik, a former Communist Party secretary who selects state companies for privatization, was equally miffed as he sat at a desk littered with the business cards of foreign consultants.
"I tell the foreigners, 'Let's define the goals, and I'll give you my opinions on how to reach this goal,' " Mr. Altinnik said, dismissing an inch-thick manual on privatizing that had been prepared by Price Waterhouse. "But they never ask for my opinions. They say, 'You must solve the task the way we say.' Why should we have American experts when there are Ukrainian experts?"
More than 60 foreign consultants who live in Kiev and scores of others who fly in and out work for the eight private companies hired by A.I.D. for the privatization effort; the agency has 30 foreign employees of its own in Kiev.
These Americans have been involved in setting up 26 regional centers like the one in Donetsk and equipping them with computers and staff members to collect information on companies as they go through the sale process. They have run a public education campaign and have started to open share registries, establish a capital system and give advice to new Ukrainian investment funds.
But the program has failed to take off largely because of in-built flaws that Washington knew about but decided not to rectify before spending the money, those involved in the program said.
"We inherited a very complicated process," said John R. Johnson, the director of Price Waterhouse in Kiev. "If it's complicated for the consultants, it's complicated for the Ukrainian public.
Among the problems Mr. Johnson listed are these:
*Unlike the certificates used in Russia, those given to Ukrainians are not transferable and do not operate like proper shares.
*The companies put up for sale at monthly auctions are overpriced.
*Managers and officials like Mr. Altinnik have been reluctant to allow companies to be sold. Only four companies in Donetsk, for example, were up for auction in October.
"U.S.A.I.D. said to themselves: 'Do we wait until the Government agrees to the ideal program, or do we proceed with the less optimal program?' " Mr. Johnson said. "They decided to go ahead with the compromises, and that is one of the big reasons for the delays."
An American official involved in the program agreed that Washington rushed. After a reformist President, Leonid Kuchma, took office last year, there was pressure in Washington to seize the opportunity and get privatization going.
"Ukraine was a high priority for us, and we wanted to get reform started," the official said. "We knew there would be problems with their program, but we thought we would go the extra effort and hope they'd come along with us."
Officials said Washington made gestures like bowing to a Ukrainian demand to have the certificates printed in Washington rather than in Ukraine, for better security, even though it was much more expensive.
Other Washington officials said A.I.D. could have been stricter in overseeing the work done by its contractors, which in addition to Price Waterhouse include Burson Marsteller ($6.6 million for public education), the Center for Financial Engineering and Development ($5.5 million for bus-company privatization) and Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. ($3.2 million for regulation of investment funds).
Even on the simplest elements like television commercials, billboards and leaflets to educate Ukrainians about privatization, the message is often misguided.
One television advertisement shows an elderly Ukrainian woman in a rocking chair, sitting in a large empty room; she says a privatization certificate will solve her financial woes.
But several Ukrainians said they found the advertisement mystifying: rocking chairs are unknown in Ukraine, and Ukrainian rooms are usually small and crammed with furniture.

F.B.I. Seeks Huge System For National Wiretapping
The F.B.I. has proposed a national wiretapping system on a huge scale that would allow law enforcement officials to monitor 1 percent of the phone lines in some high-crime areas of the country, far exceeding the recent annual average of less than 1 in 174,000 lines.
The plan, which depends on Congressional financing, would still require a court warrant for wiretaps. Both phone-industry executives and privacy-rights advocates see the specter of a Big Brother capability and ask why the F.B.I. needs such broad access. [Page A1.]
 
G.M. and Chrysler Limit Sales Drop
General Motors and Chrysler surprised analysts with smaller-than-expected declines in October sales. G.M.'s sales dropped 2.7 percent from October 1994, compared with forecasts as high as 6 percent, while Chrysler's sales fell 2.8 percent, compared with an expected 5 percent. [D4.]
 
Chrysler's production appeared threatened by a U.A.W. strike at a Detroit plant that produces most of the auto maker's windshields. [D4.]

Peco Energy Halts Bid for PP&L
Peco Energy called off its effort to buy PP&L Resources, a rival Pennsylvania utility that rejected a sweetened $4.3 billion bid. [D4.]
 
Big Gold Mine Loses Insurance
The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation has canceled $100 million in political risk insurance for a huge Indonesian gold-mining project. [D6.]
 
Chemical Outlines Lending Plans
Chemical and Chase said they would lend $18 billion to small businesses, nonprofit organizations and low- to moderate-income homeowners in the five years after their merger. That represents a 5 percent increase from the current pace of investment. [D5.]
 
Budget Talks at an Impasse
Budget talks were conducted at the White House, but President Clinton and Republican Congressional leaders said that nothing had been accomplished. The first moment of crisis -- when the Government runs out of money -- is not expected for nearly two weeks. [B10.]
 
Treasury Securities Rally
Prices of Treasury securities surged after a report showed unexpected weakness in manufacturing. The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 16/32 , to 107 25/32 , sending its yield down 4 basis points, to 6.29 percent. [D10.]
 
Stocks rose moderately, with the Dow industrials closing up 11.20, at 4,766.68. [D12.]
 
S.E.C. Negotiates With N.A.S.D.
The S.E.C. may be willing to drop its inquiry into the securities dealers' group, if it agrees to a tougher disciplinary process. [D12.]
 
Intel Upgrades the Pentium
Intel introduced an upgraded Pentium chip, with stronger performance and a lower price than expected. But the new chip is not likely to have much immediate impact, because it runs best on newer, more advanced systems. In some cases, its performance is comparable to that of work stations. [D2.]
 
Advertising Suit at Supreme Court
The court heard arguments on whether a state can ban some liquor advertising. The case could affect cigarette ads. [B14.]
 
 
Ukraine Privatization Falters
Ukraine's privatization program is in deep trouble. Washington has promoted the program as the key to a market economy. But only 300 of 8,000 state companies have been sold, and fewer than half the eligible Ukrainians have picked up the free certificates that entitle them to be shareholders in privatized companies. [A1.]
 
Mexico Spurring Savings
Mexico took steps to increase savings by overhauling its social security system. President Ernesto Zedillo said that individual retirement accounts would generate savings to help Mexico in its economic crisis. [A15.]

HEADLINE: Chase and Chemical Pledge $18 Billion in Community Loans

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
The Chemical Banking Corporation and the Chase Manhattan Corporation said yesterday that they would lend $18 billion to small businesses, nonprofit organizations and low- to moderate-income homeowners in the five years after their proposed merger.
That nationwide commitment represents about a 5 percent increase from the current pace of their combined investment in those areas. 
 It is in the banks' interest to come up with an impressive figure because their merger could be blocked if the Government found they were not meeting their obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to lend in areas where they do business.
To reach $18 billion, the banks included a wide range of activities, including all their small-business lending, whether to urban grocery stores or suburban antique dealers. The largest category is loans to first-time home buyers under programs sponsored by the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Administration and other agencies.
A much smaller category is cash grants to nonprofit organizations, which will increase from $12 million this year to an average of $14 million in each of the next five years.
Despite the banks' plans for a 5 percent overall increase, some community activists criticized the total for being too low, though others praised the banks' long-term records. But bank executives said their announcement was meant to reassure the communities they serve that despite the job cutbacks and branch closings that would result from the merger, the new bank's commitment to community development would be undiminished.
"We tried to pick a number that is realistic, not one that would be impressive," said Mark Willis, head of Chase's community development unit. "If there is $20 billion worth of business out there, we will do it."
The bulk of the planned lending includes $13.5 billion in mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income home buyers. That amount represents a continuation of lending at current levels, not an increase.
"The mortgage market is very unpredictable," said Carol Parry, head of Chemical's community development group. "We think even saying we will maintain our effort is an aggressive commitment."
This explanation did not appease those activists who have criticized Chase for shunning low-income and minority mortgage customers outside the New York area.
"If we felt that Chemical and Chase's performances were adequate, then a commitment to stay at the level would be all right," said Matthew Lee, director of Inner City Press/Community on the Move, a Bronx group that has been in a long battle with Chase over its national mortgage lending. "But we don't think that Chase's performance has been anywhere near adequate."
While Chase has defended its record, the commitment yesterday included a promise to create mortgage counseling programs in 21 cities. The bank also said it would open a branch in the South Bronx, one of Mr. Lee's longstanding demands. That branch, however, would have cash machines and customer service officers, but no tellers.
The main change in the banks' commitment is a promise to increase their $500 million a year in small-business lending by 10 percent annually. About 30 percent of this lending will be in low-income areas.
To achieve this growth, the merged bank plans to open an office to assist small businesses in Brooklyn and will create a program to offer Government-subsidized loans to small retailers in low-income neighborhoods.
The banks promised to invest $1.2 billion in housing and economic development projects in the four states where they have branches: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Texas.

HEADLINE: Nongdao Journal;
Far From the Mad Whirl, China's Ageless Rhythm

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: NONGDAO, China

 BODY:
In parts of China, women from a certain generation do not have an identity separate from their husbands. Thus the only way to introduce the old couple living on the dirt path leading into this village in southwestern China is to say: Meet Man Han, age 77, and Man Han's wife, 70.
While millions of Chinese are frenetically trying to get rich, Mr. and Mrs. Man live in a house under a banyan tree on the remote and rural sidelines of China's economic transformation. 
 And, seemingly, they couldn't care less.
"Before about five years ago, we had never seen a car," Mr. Man frankly admitted.
"Now," Mrs. Man added cheerfully, "wherever you go you can take a bus. Before that, you had to walk."
They have raised six children, brought in more than 100 rice and wheat harvests with their neighbors over the decades, and survived the Japanese occupation and the civil war between the Communists and Nationalists that followed Japan's defeat. Now, they spend much of their days on the dirt stoop in front of their straw-mat house chatting with neighbors and whoever happens by.
"All the kids are grown up," Mr. Man said. "I don't have a lot to worry about. I guess I'm pretty contented and I'm lucky because I haven't lost any of my teeth."
Sitting on a stool, Mr. Man pulled up his pants leg to reveal an extraordinary tattoo covering most of his right thigh in a blue-black lace pattern.
"During the anti-Japanese war, we all got tattoos to show that we are of the Dai people and not Han Chinese so the Japanese would not kill us," Mr. Man said. The Han are China's dominant ethnic group, representing 95 percent of the population of 1.2 billion, while 56 minorities make up the rest.
Why people of China's Dai minority thought the tattoos would protect them from slaughter by Japanese troops is not clear, but on the strength of rumor, thousands of them endured the painful embroidery more than 50 years ago.
"I got this tattoo in 1944 because all the other people did and, besides, it looks pretty nice," Mr. Man said.
Asked her opinion, Mrs. Man seemed unwilling to countenance her husband's display of self-satisfaction.
"He thinks it's pretty nice," she said, "but when he had it done, he had to go through all kinds of pain. But he still wanted to do it." Her tone indicated that this subject had been well discussed over the years.
But Mr. Man was on to another topic.
"Japanese forces occupied this place 53 years ago after the Americans built an airplane factory over there," he said, vaguely pointing over his shoulder.
Several times, Mr. Man referred to a road that was the object of so much attention during World War II. In the Dai dialect, it came out sounding like "sze-te-er-wa" road, known in English as the Burma Road or, to the people here, the Stilwell Road, named for Joseph W. Stilwell, the American general who was doing all he could to build and protect a supply line to the Nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek.
"When the Americans were here, it was pretty peaceful," Mr. Man said. "For a while, we used American money. I remember because American coins were so big."
The war made a greater impression on Mr. Man than anything that has happened since, including more than 45 years of Communism. The tumultuous political campaigns of the Great Leap Forward and the Great Proletarian Revolution under Mao Zedong were not as devastating in some of China's most remote border regions, like this one.
The greatest rhythm in life here is that of the agricultural seasons, especially the harvest.
As the Mans chatted on, most of the able-bodied men and women of this Dai village were in the fields with Meng Zai, the 34-year-old village chief, who had organized the day's rice harvesting.
It is a 10-minute walk across the paddies and past a dozen water buffalo to the concrete threshing ground. There, Mr. Meng was leaning against a haystack as about 25 villagers separated rice husks from their stalks in a motorized variant of the traditional way.
First, a tractor was driven, in reverse, in fast and furious circles over the dried rice stalks. The process resembled a dangerous rodeo stunt as the tractor bounded over 5- and 6-foot piles of rice stalks, narrowly missing farmhands, women and children who pushed and pulled at the straw to insure that all of it got run over several times.
The crazy dance of the tractor caused most of the rice grains still inside the husks to separate from the stalks. The peasants then bundled and beat the stalks against the side of a wooden box, collecting as many grains as they could. The stalks were then built into stacks, which would be burned to fertilize the fields.
The rice grains were left on the concrete slab mixed with the debris of the stalks. After a few more hours of raking and hurling the debris into the air, the rice was finally separated from the chaff and the harvest was bagged for storage.
The rice was carefully separated on the threshing surface because the day's harvest belonged to two families. The other villagers came to help because that is the tradition: each family that needs help for the harvest lends a hand with another's harvest.
Mr. Meng speculated that this year's harvest would exceed 900 pounds per mu, a measure of land that equals about one-fifth of an acre. "Our best year was 1,000 pounds, so this is not bad," he said.
As he adjusted his sarong, a now familiar lace tattoo was visible on his right thigh. Mr. Meng is far too young to have marked himself in this way to avoid Japanese bayonets.
"When we saw it on the old people," he said, using the plural to refer to the men of his generation, "we thought it was very handsome, so we got it also."
Rural life, he chuckled, is not without its vanities.

HEADLINE: Stocks Post Modest Gains Despite Surge in Bonds and Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks picked up only moderate gains yesterday, even though bonds and the dollar rallied strongly.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 11.20 points, at 4,766.68, after trading in a narrow 26-point range all day. 
 Broader market indicators were also higher, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up 2.72 points, to 584.22. Volume was moderately heavy on the New York Stock Exchange, with 378.1 million shares traded, little changed from Tuesday.
Stocks pulled back after an initial surge yesterday, and some traders attributed the market's uncertainty to the unresolved Federal budget negotiations in Washington. But Barry Berman, head stock trader at Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee, said concerns about the budget talks were an "excuse to try to do as little as possible between now and year-end."
Many investors who have seen huge gains in their stock portfolios all year are likely to sit out the last two months, "as long as there isn't anything in the news to force people into action," Mr. Berman said.
Stock investors showed little lasting reaction to a substantial run-up in bond prices. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 16/32 , while its yield fell to 6.29 percent from 6.33 percent. They also sloughed off a rally in the dollar that pushed it up 1.36 Japanese yen, to 103.32 yen.
The bond market surged yesterday after the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of economic activity dropped to 46.8 percent in October from 48.3 percent in September.
The purchasers' report reinforced a Commerce Department report that the Government's main forecasting gauge of future economic activity fell one-tenth of a percentage point in September, its second decline in the last three months.
The slowing economy could encourage the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates before the end of the year.
But Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst at Interstate-Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C., said the sluggish economic data might ultimately be be a negative for stocks. "There are more concerns that the slowing economy could affect earnings before long," Mr. Harrington said.
The concern about earnings was particularly noticeable in economically sensitive issues, including some technology stocks, which tend to respond sharply to changes in economic outlook. International Business Machines fell 3/8, to 96 7/8, and Micron Technology lost 2 1/2, to 68. In Nasdaq trading, Microsoft fell 1 5/8, to 98 3/8.
Bucking the downdraft in technology shares was Intel, which rose 15/16 , to 7013/16 , on heavy Nasdaq volume after the company introduced its new Pentium Pro computer chip. Also on the Nasdaq, America Online rose 6 1/4, to 86 1/4, after the company declared a 2-for-1 stock split. And Sierra Semiconductor, rose 1 1/2, to 19 3/8.
The Nasdaq composite index, which is weighted with technology stocks, gained 4.44 points, to 1,040.50.
Transportation stocks, which are viewed as vulnerable to swings in the economy, fell. The Dow Jones transportation index dropped 11.24 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,924.88. Shares of Norfolk Southern fell 1 3/4, to 74 7/8.
Financial services stocks and utility stocks, which u8, to 67 1/4.
The Dow Jones utility average rose 1.85 points, or 0.86 percent, to 216.39, led by Peco Energy, up 5/8, to 29 7/8. PP&L Resources Inc. rejected a sweetened $4 billion buyout offer from Peco, prompting the neighboring utility to drop its takeover attempt. PP&L's shares eased 1/8, to 22 3/8.
Among other issues, Federated Department Stores rose 1 1/8, to 26 1/2. The stock is being added to the S.& P. 500 index.
Humana rose 1 5/8, to 22 3/4, after the health care company reported favorable third-quarter results.
Boeing rose 2 1/2, to 68, after it received an $800 million order from Japan Airlines.
Chiron fell 6, to 85, after the biotechnology company reported disappointing earnings late Tuesday.
Advancing issues led declining ones by about 7 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Big Board's composite index was up 1.41, to 311.02, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index was up 0.97, to 522.64.

HEADLINE: Peco Drops $4.3 Billion Bid For PP&L Resources Utility

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Peco Energy Company yesterday abandoned an effort to buy PP&L Resources Inc. after it rejected a sweetened $4.3 billion bid from Peco, its Pennsylvania rival.
PP&L, based in Allentown, Pa., said it spurned one of the utility industry's largest hostile offers because the combined company would have increased its exposure to nuclear-plant liabilities that might not be covered by future revenue. PP&L also said that a deal with Peco, based in Philadelphia, would give its shareholders a dividend payout that was 4 percent lower and would increase rates for PP&L customers. 
 "The board has concluded that Peco's revised proposal is not in the best interests of PP&L Resources and its shareowners, customers, employees or the communities it serves," PP&L said in a statement.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, shares of PP&L fell 12.5 cents, to $22.375, while Peco shares rose 62.5 cents, to $29.875.
"This wasn't exactly a surprise," said Bert Kramer, an analyst with Paine Webber.
On Oct. 23, Peco raised its bid to $27.50 a share after its original $24-a-share proposal was turned down. While Peco's August offer was a 28 percent premium on PP&L's share price of $18.75 at that time, PP&L has since won a 4.5 percent rate increase from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission that made its stock more valuable, Mr. Kramer said.
Peco's buyout offer is one of a flurry of mergers in the utility industry this year. The deal-making has been spurred by a drive to cut costs as utilities brace for deregulated markets and increasing competition.
PP&L said yesterday that it was taking steps to prepare for competition, including job cuts and reduction in capital expenditures, and that combining with Peco would have made it less competitive.
"Before the rate case came in, there was an economic reason for PP&L merging," Mr. Kramer said. "There's still an economic reason for everyone to merge, to lower costs, but the compelling reason for PP&L is gone."
Shareholders may not be happy with PP&L's decision. Analysts said a higher bid from another utility was unlikely.
"The chairman of PP&L will have to justify to shareholders why he turned down $27.50 a share for a stock that was at $18 before the offer came," said Thomas Hamlin, a utilities analyst at Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond. "It's a tough spot to be in."

HEADLINE: Economy Is Slowing, but Fed Isn't Expected to Cut Rates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
The American economy has slowed this autumn, several new reports showed today, but Federal Reserve officials said in interviews that the signs so far did not appear likely to lead them to lower short-term interest rates at their next meeting on Nov. 15.
After expanding at an ebullient annual pace of 4.2 percent in the third quarter, the economy lost momentum in recent weeks, the new reports showed. 
 Together, they portrayed a fairly consistent picture of a gradually slowing economy. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index of growth in manufacturing had dropped for the third consecutive month. The Commerce Department said that its index of leading economic indicators dropped by one-tenth of a percentage point in September. And in a review of the economy's health that comes out only eight times a year, the Federal Reserve said that a pause in retail sales appeared to be braking growth.
The bond market rallied on the reports, with prices rising and the yield on the 30-year bond falling to 6.29 percent from 6.33 percent. Stocks were also up, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 11.20 points, to 4,766.68.
But the Federal Reserve may wait for progress in the budget debate and further evidence of economic slowing before reducing the short-term interest rates again, senior Fed officials have suggested in interviews today and over the last week.
The gradual slowing of inflation "gives us room to ease in the future," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve Board governor. "I think as long as the inflation picture continues to be favorable and as we resolve uncertainties about the fiscal position -- assuming they are resolved in a favorable way -- ease might be appropriate."
If Fed officials do not reduce interest rates on Nov. 15, their next meeting is scheduled for Dec. 19 and they might cut rates then.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has long been known to distrust a single month of evidence that the economy is slowing after a quarter of strong economic performance. And in a series of little-noticed hints in his Congressional testimony earlier this year, he expressed a desire to wait for financial market reaction to any budget deal before deciding whether to reduce interest rates. Congress is still at least two weeks away from sending President Clinton a bill, and since all sides expect him to veto the bill when he gets it, negotiations could drag on to the end of the year.
A sharp drop in interest rates in the financial markets right after a budget deal would indicate that most investors accepted the accord as a credible sign of Congressional determination to reduce deficit spending. That would provide political cover for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further without risking criticism that it was rewarding a Republican pledge that might not be fulfilled to balance the budget over seven years.
Still, several economic indicators due out in the next couple of weeks could alter Federal Reserve officials' impressions of the economy and persuade them that a quick cut in interest rates was appropriate. The most important indicator is likely to be the Labor Department's release on Friday of unemployment patterns during November. And a slew of data will be coming out on the morning that the Fed officials meet, including the November figures for consumer prices, industrial production and business inventories.
But today's economic reports were mostly subdued in tone. "Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve districts suggest that moderate growth in economic activity continued in early fall, although perhaps at a slower pace than at the time of the previous set of reports," said the Federal Reserve report, known as the beige book for the color of its cover.
Prices for paper and other industrial materials showed the largest drop in 15 years, a sign of weak demand for raw materials in the nation's manufacturing sector. The falling prices dragged down the index of leading economic indicators, which most economists had expected to show a slight rise.
The exception to the string of soft numbers today was the Commerce Department's report on construction spending in September, which rose by 1.2 percent, or slightly more than expected. Home builders and construction companies with Government contracts are doing particularly well.
But manufacturers and retailers appear to be in worse shape. Auto sales are weak, shipping costs are declining for lack of demand, and many store chains are beginning to struggle.
"There's a definite loss of thrust and momentum entering the fourth quarter -- it's showing up in retail sales, auto sales, and I think it's showing up in capital goods spending," said Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers. "What's unknown is how consumers will behave at Christmas."
The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates seven times during a 12-month period beginning in February 1994 for fear that very strong economic growth would lead to inflation. When growth slowed briefly early last summer, the Fed's top officials trimmed the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.75 percent.

HEADLINE: Battle Ahead: Can Mexico's Social Security Net Be Tightened?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 1

 BODY:
President Ernesto Zedillo today announced a sweeping overhaul of Mexico's 52-year-old social security system with the goal of improving medical services and increasing the sagging rate of domestic savings.
Mr. Zedillo said the social security system was inefficient and the health system in danger of financial collapse. He also said that allowing Mexicans to establish individual retirement accounts, a central feature of both the social security plan and the economic recovery program announced on Sunday, would generate millions of dollars in domestic savings to help the country in its current economic crisis. 
 Pension savings could be used to encourage investment and replace some of the $29 billion in short-term foreign capital that has left Mexico since last year's disastrous devaluation. The domestic savings rate has fallen below 16 percent of the gross domestic product, from a high of 22 percent in 1988.
"More domestic savings will mean more investment and more growth," Mr. Zedillo said. "That economic growth will mean more jobs, and more jobs will mean more security for society."
But Mr. Zedillo is likely to face a difficult political battle in trying to take apart something as sacred as social security. Unlike Social Security in the United States, the Mexican system does a lot more than provide retirement benefits. The huge system also runs nearly all of Mexico's clinics and hospitals, and 455 day-care centers.
Over the years, the system has also taken over management of 149 discount stores, 38 theaters, 4 recreation resorts and 16 funeral parlors.
Although business and labor leaders support the reforms, social security workers have already launched an aggressive campaign to keep the system from being dismantled. The workers argue that giving private managers a chance to handle the national pension fund, which they say is worth about $4.25 billion, is an invitation to corruption.
"We believe with all certainty," the workers said in advertisements in Mexico City newspapers, "that if Congress authorizes these initiatives, inefficiency and ineptitude will be rewarded, and that will have negative repercussions for most Mexicans."
Under the plan, which Mr. Zedillo plans to send to Congress in the current session, workers would be allowed to choose between the existing pension system and individual retirement accounts. The accounts would offer a higher rate of return than the current system, and thus encourage workers to save more.
The entire social security system would be broadened to expand medical coverage and lower costs. Today about 39 million Mexicans with salaried jobs have coverage. Most of the other 53 million Mexicans -- most of them self-employed -- are not covered.
Social security contributions now come from employers, workers and the Government, and are considered high in comparison with other countries. The reforms would try to end the practice of subsidizing money-losing parts parts of the system, like the day-care centers and the theaters.
To improve the medical care, which is widely criticized as insensitive and inadequate, patients would be allowed to select their own doctors at health maintenance groups.
The number of social security employees would be reduced, an implicit suggestion that operations like the discount stores or resorts would have to be able to stand on their own or be dropped.

Sluggishness At Factories Lifts Prices Of Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities surged yesterday after a report showed unexpected weakness in manufacturing.
But the rally lost some of its steam late in the session as traders locked in profits with an eye toward tomorrow's report on employment in October. Still, yesterday's data bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve would reduce short-term interest rates again, although few analysts expect the Fed to do so at its Nov. 15 policy-making meeting. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 16/32 , to 10725/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction to the price, fell to 6.29 percent, just above the 6.27 percent low for the session and below Tuesday's close of 6.33 percent.
The prices of Treasury securities rallied after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index of manufacturing strength had fallen to 46.8 points in October from 48.3 in September. Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York, a market research and analysis concern, said the report showed that "the manufacturing sector is still mired in mud and not moving very quickly."
"Weak exports and a flat auto sector are holding it back," he said.
The market's positive reaction to the weak news sparked some short- covering activity, in which market participants who sell borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices and pocket the difference, are forced to buy back securities in a rising market to limit their losses.
Other data released yesterday portrayed an economy slowing steadily from its strong growth in the third quarter. The Federal Reserve's survey of business conditions around the country showed only modest growth. The Commerce Department said that its index of leading economic indicators dropped by one-tenth of a percentage point in September, a slightly weaker result than expected.
Although construction spending rose strongly in September, by 1.2 percent, Mr. Palash of MCM Moneywatch noted that housing was continuing to benefit from low interest rates.
"In balance, the mixed numbers represent a favorable background for bonds," Mr. Palash said, "in that growth is moderate enough to keep inflation down and keep open the door for a Fed easing at some point." The timing of the Fed move, he said, will depend on the negotiations in Washington on the Federal budget. "At this point, my best guess is that the Fed will ease in the first quarter of next year," he said.
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said the signs of moderate growth "have led many to expect a Fed ease sometime down the road, with the bond market already pricing it in."
The bond market had little reaction to the Treasury's announcement yesterday of tentative plans for its quarterly refunding. The Treasury plans to sell $18 billion in three-year notes on Tuesday and $13.5 billion, up from an expected $13 billion, in 10-year notes on Wednesday.
But the Treasury also said the sales would go ahead only if Congress raised the national debt limit from the current $4.9 trillion.
The possibility of canceled auctions did not appear to alarm traders and investors yesterday.
But the uncertainty prevented the start of activity in securities traded on a when-issued basis. By late in the day the cash market's current three-year note was trading at a price of 100 25/32 , to yield 5.56 percent, and the 10-year note was trading at 10328/32 , to yield 5.97 percent.
Today, the Treasury plans to sell $6 billion in 48-day cash management bills and $8 billion in 83-day cash management bills. Mr. Palash said these auctions were designed to get the Treasury past temporary cash shortages.
In futures trading yesterday, the December bond contract set another high, 11731/32 , with the low at 11621/32 . It closed the session at 11716/32.

HEADLINE: Sterling Forest Pledges to Maintain Open Space

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Oct. 23 editorial on a potential acquisition of Sterling Forest in New York State leaves the reader confused about Sterling Forest Corporation's commitment to maintaining open space in the forest and willingness to sell the property to the public. We have been willing to sell all or part of the forest to the public at a fair market price as long as negotiations are fair and timely. 
 However, no willing buyer with committed financing has presented an offer to purchase the property, and, as you reveal, the prospects for government funding of an acquisition grow uncertain.
Consequently, we must continue the process for gaining the necessary approvals for our plan. Even if the public does not acquire any of the property, we are committed to maintaining open space in the forest at no cost to taxpayers.
For the past six years we have pursued a balanced, environmentally sensitive plan for our land. We have worked with top planning experts to insure that our plan's environmental and economic features balance open space preservation with the growth facing our region.
As a result, the plan permanently sets aside 76 percent of the forest for protection as open space at no cost to taxpayers. We remain committed to preservation of open space and welcome public or private support to reach that goal.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Athletics And Tigers Courting Showalter

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
While Yankee executives met in Tampa, Fla., yesterday to discuss who their next manager should be, Buck Showalter, their former manager, started his life without the Yankees feeling very wanted. Showalter was immediately courted by the Detroit Tigers and the Oakland Athletics about their manager positions and will interview with both teams on the West Coast this weekend.
Even though Showalter is looking forward to the interviews, a part of him still wondered about his negotiations with George Steinbrenner and why he is no longer the Yankee manager. Except for the 22 days he spent unemployed after being dismissed as the third-base coach before becoming the manager on Oct. 29, 1991, yesterday marked the first day Showalter was not a Yankee since 1977. 
 "I would have listened to him if George had called me last night," said Showalter, regret in his voice. "It's a little bit disappointing. I called him last and I rejected the offer as it was stated to me. Maybe we could have gotten something done."
Joe Torre is expected to replace Showalter sometime soon; General Manager Bob Watson told officials he wanted to select a manager by tomorrow. Watson met with Steinbrenner and Gene Michael, the former general manager, for several hours about Showalter's successor and said they trimmed "a short list even shorter." Even though Watson claimed there are three or four candidates and said interviews will be conducted today, Torre is still believed to be the front-runner.
"We want to get the right guy," said Watson, who refused to divulge the names of any candidates, even Torre. "That's so important to us. We had a negative situation with the last manager who was here. We want to move on and think about winning."
Meanwhile, Showalter bit his tongue whenever he was asked about the ugliness that has enveloped his departure from the Yankees after four seasons. Steinbrenner and Showalter have refused to call each other since last Thursday, when the manager turned down a two-year, $1.05 million contract offer that included the provision that the batting coach, Rick Down, be dismissed. Several of Steinbrenner's employees have criticized Down, one of Showalter's closest friends, and the manager ever since.
"I'm just disappointed in it all," said Showalter, who has insisted that he never resigned, contrary to Steinbrenner's opinion. "I'm disappointed in so many things that happened. Just disappointed. Just write disappointed. I'm trying not to say anything else."
Asked if he thought that his disagreement with Steinbrenner could cease long enough for him to miraculously return as manager, Showalter said, "I doubt it."
Detroit General Manager Randy Smith said he will interview the Cleveland infield coach Buddy Bell today and the Texas third-base coach Jerry Narron on Saturday, so he is likely to interview Showalter tomorrow. Smith, the former Padres general manager, has a home in San Diego, and Showalter already planned to venture to Oakland to be interviewed Saturday.
Oakland General Manager Sandy Alderson said Showalter is one of many candidates for the spot vacated when Tony La Russa left for St. Louis. Alderson interviewed Gary Jones and Dick Scott, Oakland's Class AAA and AA managers, yesterday and will interview Jim Lefebvre, the A's hitting instructor and the former manager of the Cubs and Mariners, and Davey Lopes, San Diego's first-base coach, today.
"I think Buck's record and his credibility and his reputation stand for themselves," Smith said. "We've got several guys who are candidates, but the one thing that Buck has over them is he's got a track record at the major league level."
Showalter is more interested in the Tigers because they have a new general manager, will eventually have a new stadium and have emphasized that they will overhaul their team with the hopes of contending by 1998. The A's are in the middle of severe budget cuts and are not as appealing.
"I feel like someone is interested in something I have to offer and that's pretty flattering," Showalter said.
Smith hoped to name Sparky Anderson's successor within the next month, but he could make a decision sooner. While Showalter has been called the leading candidate, Smith declined to rank the candidates.
"I think he knows he's in demand," Smith said of Showalter. "I don't think we were even the first team to contact him. I think he knows he has options and he has more than two."
Since Smith said Showalter has more than two opportunities and the 39-year-old is only interested in managing, there could be a third team prepared to erase a manager and pounce on the available Showalter. Showalter distanced himself from this ticklish theory. He looked to the future without forgetting the past.
"I don't think anything is going to taint the times I had with the Yankees and the things that I hold dear," Showalter said. "If I end up with another organization, I'll always feel good about being a Yankee."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 The Yankees received a one-day extension on DARRYL STRAWBERRY's $1.8 million contract option so they must make a decision by today. . . . Pitcher SCOTT KAMIENIECKI had surgery to remove bone spurs from his right elbow and second baseman PAT KELLY had shoulder surgery to repair a torn labrum. The injuries will surely impact how the Yankees feel about the players for 1996. Both were operated on by Dr. FRANK JOBE in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: G.M. and Chrysler's October Sales Better Than Expected

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 1

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation surprised analysts today with smaller-than-expected declines in October sales.
At General Motors, total sales fell 2.7 percent from October last year, while Chrysler's sales fell 2.8 percent. Analysts had anticipated a drop of 5 percent for Chrysler, while some analysts saw G.M. sales dropping as much as 6 percent. 
 "They were a little better than expected," said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst with S. G. Warburg & Company, who on Tuesday cut his fourth-quarter earnings estimate for Chrysler on concerns that its car sales would be off by 15 percent.
Chrysler's car sales were down 10 percent, to 52,222. Its truck sales, led by brisk movement of its popular Dodge Ram trucks and mini-vans, were up 2 percent, to 113,487 vehicles.
Strong car sales, however, were evident at G.M. Sales rose 6.6 percent for the month to 272,830 cars, partly offsetting a sharp drop in truck sales.
"We don't expect any grandiose numbers, just decent numbers, and that's what we're getting," said Michael Schmall, director of auto supplier forecasting for J. D. Power & Associates, a consulting firm in Troy, Mich.
October sales are closely watched because it typically is the strongest month in the fourth quarter. An overall decline was expected, as cautious consumers worried about job security and the direction of the economy.
Analysts are projecting an annualized industry selling rate of about 15.1 million vehicles this month, compared with last October's strong rate of 15.3 million.
G.M. released its results after the stock market closed, and Chrysler released its sales just before. Shares of all three American auto makers fell on the New York Stock Exchange today. G.M. shares fell 37.5 cents, to $43.375, and Chrysler's stock fell 75 cents, to $50.75. Shares of the Ford Motor Company fell 25 cents, to $28.50.
Ford is expected to report its October sales on Friday.
G.M.'s October truck sales dropped 16 percent, to 147,578 vehicles, much lower than expected. The company recorded its sharpest decline in truck sales in at least five years, the company said, because shipments to dealers were hobbled by a strike against a unit of Ryder, the principal vehicle hauler for General Motors.
Though the strike ended Oct. 7, shipments of cars and trucks are still backlogged. For instance, about 20,000 Blazers are stacked up at G.M.'s plant in Moraine, Ohio.
"I dispatched a couple of drivers to go down there this morning" and get some Blazers, said Mark Worthington, sales manager of Jack Cauley Chevrolet in West Bloomfield, Mich.
"My customers are getting anxious and I was afraid I'd lose them. My drivers tell me there were tons of people down there picking up vehicles."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against the Yen As Maturing Debt Leaves Japan

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar surged to a six-week high against the yen yesterday, bolstered by optimism that Japanese investors had sold domestic investments and sent money overseas.
About $4 billion of Japanese debt matured at the end of October, and some analysts estimated that as much as 10 percent of those funds were being reinvested in higher-yielding Australian, German, Swiss and United States bond markets. 
 "A lot of domestic instruments matured," said Marc Chandler, currency analyst at Deutsche Bank. "Some of those funds are believed to be finding higher yields abroad."
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 103.32 yen -- its highest since Sept. 20, when it touched 104.65 yen -- from 101.96 yen on Tuesday. The dollar rose to 1.4177 German marks from 1.4070 marks and to 1.1355 Swiss francs from 1.1353 francs. The British pound slipped to $1.5783 from $1.5810.
Weaker European currencies, benefiting from thinner trading than ususual, regained some ground against the mark yesterday, leading to a more optimistic climate for the dollar. Trading was light because of holidays in France, Belgium, Italy, Hong Kong and other countries.
The Quebec referendum, in which a razor-thin majority of voters chose to remain within Canada, was a positive factor for the dollar after the resignation of Premier Jacques Parizeau of Quebec, a leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois.
"Europe and North America are no longer in quite such turmoil," said Kevin Harris, international economist at MCM Currency Watch. "Whatever gyrations Canada has to go through to get over the referendum, the worst is over."
Currency traders also bet that the battle to balance the United States budget would eventually be resolved, and any prospective debt default averted.
"The underlying feeling" is that it "will be resolved," said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst with Smith Barney. "Both sides are fighting for pretty good changes."
The dollar's upward momentum managed to overcome renewed pressure on the Mexican peso, which fell below 7.35 to the dollar before recovering to 7.265 to the dollar.
Weakness in the Mexican peso typically hurts the dollar because of the close economic ties between the two countries. The speculative selling of the peso came a day before a national holiday in Mexico, when financial markets will be closed.

German Socialists Question The Single-Money Canon

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Can Europe's nations fuse so intimately that they become a kind of United States? No, say Europeans like Chancellor Helmut Kohl, especially if they cling to their currencies -- as if Texans used dollars and New Yorkers used rubles.
Thus, the notion of creating a common European currency to supersede the national coin and forge monetary union has become something close to dogma in Germany,and the Chancellor preaches it with the same sense of infallibility as theologians ascribe to the Pope. 
 Imagine, thus, the fuss when leading members of the opposition Social Democratic Party said the other day that monetary union might be no more than "some idea or other" that should become a major issue in Germany's next national elections in 1998.
"Cheap populism," countered Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of the Free Democratic Party, the junior coalition partner in Mr. Kohl's Government.
"Playing with fire," said an editorial in the daily Suddeutsche Zeitung on Tuesday.
Beyond such debate language, though, lay one of the puzzles of Europe's integration: if Germany's will to create a single currency is weakened by domestic pressures, who else will raise the banner of monetary union? And, if the drive to integration stalls, will Europe revert to a splintered and troubled past?
In economic terms, the introduction of a single European currency would represent a revolution in the way Europeans transact business.
Without monetary union, Suddeutsche Zeitung said darkly, "Europe will go backward and Germany will again become a problem for its neighbors."
The preparations for a common currency are supposed to be completed by 1999 with the creation of common standards of fiscal management throughout the European Union. At present, only Germany and Luxembourg meet those standards.
Last weekend, however, Rudolf Scharping, the beleaguered leader of the ailing Social Democrats, voiced what opinion surveys say is the majority view among Germans. "I would regard it as wrong," he said, "to give up the German mark in return for some idea or other that in the end produces neither economic nor monetary stability."
Gerhard Schroder, the Social Democratic state premier of Lower Saxony, forecast a "huge controversy" at the 1998 elections and declared that at last the Social Democrats had discovered "a national theme" on which to campaign.
The Social Democrats' bid to rewrite the national agenda obviously annoys Chancellor Kohl and his allies.
"No one can play political games with an issue like the European currency that is vital to the nation's future," said Friedrich Bohl, a senior aide to the Chancellor. Theo Waigel, the German Finance Minister, accused the Social Democrats of misusing the issue to "divert attention from their own squabbles."
If that was the plan, though, it has backfired. Even in Mr. Scharping's ranks, his latest utterances drew criticism.
"Neither the timetable nor the criteria for entering the European monetary union may now be brought into doubt," said Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Mr. Scharping's own deputy leader.

Welfare time limits raise the specter of more street dwellers.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
NEWT GINGRICH and Bill Clinton agree: the time for time limits on welfare has come. But what happens when the welfare checks stop? "Not a lot of people have thought about it," says LaDonna Pavetti, a researcher at the Urban Institute.
They will soon have to. A dozen states have already received Federal waivers to set time limits. The others will probably not even have to ask: both the House and Senate welfare bills would drop any requirement to provide monthly stipends. But researchers who watched the states cope in haphazard fashion with rising caseloads in the early 1990's are not sanguine about the consequences. 
 At best, they say, time limits on cash benefits will force the dependent poor and the bureaucrats who serve them to focus on finding work for the able-bodied. Those who cannot find work on their own will be shunted into public service jobs that teach the value of work and help to break the cycle of dependence.
But it is also possible that welfare will become meaner as well as leaner. Tens of thousands now live on the streets. Perhaps Americans will learn to turn their backs on tens of thousands more.
The idea of time limits was part of what Judy Gueron, president of the nonprofit Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, calls "the liberal-conservative consensus" that dominated thinking about welfare for much of the last decade. From this perspective, public assistance was a right -- but only as long as those who needed it did their best to get off it.
Society would never abandon the irredeemably dependent. But the notion of a fixed limit on cash grants meshed with the new emphasis on "workfare." Some, it was assumed, would find jobs before the time limit. The rest would earn their welfare checks raking leaves, helping in child-care centers or cleaning storm drains.
The catch, well known to policy specialists if not to taxpayers, is that workfare is very expensive unless a high percentage of chronic welfare recipients find jobs. For even if public service jobs pay little, the cost of providing day care and administering the programs would far exceed the cost of welfare as usual. Indeed, it was fear of the price tag that stood in the way of welfare reform on the workfare model during the Bush and early Clinton years.
But the liberal-conservative consensus is gone, victim to the priorities of the new Republican majority in Congress. If the Republicans have their way, there will be no new money for public service jobs. Indeed, there will be $100 billion less for welfare over the next seven years. What's more, states will be free to spend fixed block grants any way they please.
How they please will almost certainly include time limits: 24 states have already applied for waivers to set limits. And while a few are committed to workfare, the link between time limits and jobs of last resort is fraying and will likely be severed once state legislatures understand that Federal aid is no longer linked to the ambitions of state welfare programs.
Everyone expects deadlines to create "a sense of urgency" among welfare recipients, says David Butler, a policy analyst at the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation and the co-author of the organization's first study of time-limited welfare. But just how far will a kick in the pants move the welfare system?
The typical user of welfare is off the dole within two years. But the majority of those on welfare at any one time are there to stay: Ms. Pavetti estimates that three-quarters of four million to five million adults currently on welfare will remain dependent for at least five years. And she is skeptical that a large proportion of them can soon be bullied or cajoled into private-sector jobs.
Even if they could, it is far from clear that the bitterly competitive market for unskilled labor would make room for them. Sheila and Sheldon Danziger of the University of Michigan found that just one-third of the nonelderly adults without children forced off Michigan's "general assistance" welfare roles in 1992 snagged full-time jobs within two years. And those were years of falling unemployment. "All bets are off for recessions," Mr. Danziger concludes.
So what happens to the losers? Those who subscribe to the old workfare consensus hope that the prospect of poor families living on the streets will force Americans to face up to the reality that reducing dependence is a time-consuming and expensive business.
But Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution is skeptical it will come to that. More likely, extreme poverty will be driven underground, as families stripped of welfare grants get by on a combination of temporary work, food stamps, Medicaid, charity and help from relatives.
"We shouldn't kid ourselves that time limits will make most recipients' lives better," he said.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Jim Lehrer Carries On In the Post-MacNeil Era

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
The deliverers of television news occupy a significant place in many a family's routine. The main network news programs signal the end of the workday and lead into tube time; whether it be Peter or Tom or Dan, millions have grown accustomed to their space. And that must be even more emphatically the feeling of the fewer but no less loyal viewers who have come to dote on "The MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour."
Whatever your comfort level with the network anchors, after all, they supply pretty much the same goods. If one of them decided to go on to more challenging work, fans might miss their favorite for a while, but they could switch channels and be assured of finding a reasonable facsimile. Robert MacNeil, by contrast, has come to represent something special for television, so his recent departure from the distinctive and distinguished program that was marked by his style as well as his name may give his fans the shakes. 
 A look at life after MacNeil, then, is in order. With the caution that "The Newshour With Jim Lehrer" is still young, still settling into a post-MacNeil mode, here is how matters appear so far.
The most conspicuous loss, it seems to me, is an authoritative voice. Mr. Lehrer's down-home address remains easy to take, easier perhaps than Mr. MacNeil's stiffer, more buttoned-up style (maybe that is why the two played off each other so well) but the MacNeil persona carried decidedly more weight. Even when he was away for a day or two, the center did not hold quite as firmly.
Still, I don't want to make too much of that. The program's considerable strengths, developed over the years, reside less in its estimable on-screen presences than in its serious attitude toward the news and the time it accords to major doings. Last week, for a not untypical example, on an evening when the three network news programs led off with a story about a school-bus accident, "The Newshour" gave more minutes to a report and a discussion about the budget battle in Congress than the networks gave to all the day's events put together. On Monday, Charlayne Hunter-Gault, the MacNeil-Lehrer veteran, did a useful 15-minute interview with Richard Holbrooke, the American negotiator on Bosnia.
The general rule of civility in interviews, particularly welcome given the commotion that substitutes for discussion on shows like "the McLaughlin Group," also seems to be safe. In one of "The Newshour" 's series of talks with Presidential hopefuls last week, Margaret Warner, businesslike but not adversarial, pressed Pat Buchanan about his notions of "economic nationalism" and allowed him to reveal himself as an old-fashioned isolationist.
The problem with civility is that it can easily edge into hospitality, which is what happened that same evening in Elizabeth Farnsworth's encounter with Yasir Arafat. It was a sort of tea party, with Ms. Farnsworth courteously allowing herself to be led by her guest and even helping him to a few answers. She seemed too genteel to handle this practiced performer and was notably more comfortable on Monday in the pleasanter job of encouraging Doris Kearns Goodwin to rhapsodize about baseball.
"The Newshour" has often been chided for concentrating on Beltway biggies. That is no crime. Particularly when Washington is being moved and shaken as it is these days, you want to hear from the movers and shakers. And they usually have more pertinent things to say than the just-folks around the country whom the producers, perhaps hoping to shed their elitist reputation, have taken to assembling periodically as the Voice of the People.
But the habit of bringing on the pols can turn silly, as it did on Friday, when Thomas Foley, Democrat and former Speaker of the House, and Robert Michel, the former Republican minority leader, as unstimulating a pair as Washington could yield, were hauled in to talk about Congressional tactics. It was a desperate tactic for producers seeking a fresh approach to an aging story, a parody of a "Newshour" interview.
That sort of mishap occurred on Mr. MacNeil's watch too. It also occurs with fair frequency on the Sunday morning network interview programs; Washington veterans being even more skilled at evading than Washington journalists are at inquiring, time wasting is probably inherent in the form.
What redeems "The Newshour" from the occasional longueur is the guarantee of its steady attention on what matters, be it the budget or race, Bosnia or the Middle East. If the program is not noted for scoops, that may be because of its concentration on substance, giving healthy chunks of time even to unglamorous subjects like the new president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. When it gets the story in focus, as it usually does, it has little competition.
With Mr. MacNeil's departure, "The Newshour" has also lost its New York City connection. Not that the program has ever shown any particular devotion to New York, but at moments the city's spirit, so unlike that of Washington, where the program is now being produced, did manage to make itself felt. Maybe one of the essayists, say, Roger Rosenblatt, that confessed New Yorker, can sneak some big-city smarts into the show.
So I think Mr. MacNeil is already missed, probably by Mr. Lehrer more than anyone, and he does not seem readily replaceable. But let's not overdo the television cult of personality. The real tribute to the departed will be if the program he did much to craft stays true to its mission and, with the support of viewers like you and me, goes on being an important part of the television day.

HEADLINE: In Bridgeport, Not Only Bettors Eye Hounds With Hope

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Nov. 1

 BODY:
Years of intense, expensive lobbying to expand gambling here and to create jobs in this ailing industrial city yielded their first results tonight as dogs began running at a greyhound race track, the Shoreline Star.
Overshadowed by the battle to bring a $500 million casino with 9,000 jobs to Bridgeport's harbor, just blocks away, the $30 million dog track, employing 600 people, nevertheless is the largest development to be built in the city in years. 
 While animal-rights demonstrators outside the track protested the racing industry's treatment of greyhounds tonight, inside the track, below an elevated section of the Connecticut Turnpike, Mayor Joseph P. Ganim praised the track and its owner, A. Robert Zeff, for bringing new jobs and revenue to the city.
"This is the largest investment in this city in decades," Mr. Ganim said. "This is a first-class, A-1 dog track here in Bridgeport, open today, but it's also jobs and the beginning of revitalization for the city."
The arrival of hounds in the heart of Bridgeport's manufacturing district, one small step in the city's pursuit of gambling as the only industry interested in redeveloping its waterfront, illustrates the opportunities and hazards for communities as gambling spreads rapidly.
Elsewhere in the nation, including in eastern Connecticut, the opening of casinos with slot machines has pushed dog tracks and other slower-paced forms of betting to the brink of bankruptcy.
Some of the kennels racing greyhounds here, in fact, came from Kansas City, Kan., where a seven-year-old dog and horse track, the Woodlands, is failing because of competition from riverboat casinos in Missouri. The track's owners are lobbying Kansas legislators to allow slot machines in race tracks.
In Bridgeport, a casino would open just across the turnpike from the dog track if Connecticut legislators authorize the Mashantucket Pequot tribe to build here. And no one knows whether that would help or harm the track.
The track's general manager, James S. Gartland, who also came to Bridgeport from Kansas City, shrugs when asked about the effect of a casino.
"When I hired on, I told Mr. Zeff that regardless of a casino, there was enough population for a track to do all right," Mr. Gartland said. But, he added, "You can't compete against what I call the mindless gaming of pulling a slot-machine handle."
Mr. Zeff, who made his fortune as a trial lawyer in Detroit before opening a jai alai fronton on Kossuth Street here in 1976, has done his best to offer customers constant action. The fronton, which operated only six months a year, has been converted into an off-track betting parlor televising dog and horse races from around the country.
Across the parking lot, the track's clubhouse, with a capacity of 2,900, has 230 television sets for bettors to watch between the greyhound races, which are run every 15 minutes but are over in less than 35 seconds.
Mr. Zeff has also hedged his investment in other ways.
Original plans, projected to cost $76 million, were scaled back, creating a smaller clubhouse that should be easier to fill, especially since there is not another dog track between Bridgeport and West Virginia.
When Donald Trump proposed a casino in Bridgeport and began looking for a site, he discovered that the obvious one, the former Carpenter Steel factory yard on the harbor, was already taken, by Mr. Zeff. The site is now being used for parking for the track, although he had bought it for a casino to be built by Mirage Resorts.
When Steve Wynn of Mirage proposed a casino earlier, he learned that Mr. Zeff would be the most powerful opponent in Bridgeport to any plan that might harm his track, so he made him a partner.
Now Mr. Zeff is hoping to win permission to put slot machines in his clubhouse, over the objections of the Pequots.
In Bridgeport, the dog track is being praised by many residents after years in which the fronton was often criticized for not bringing prosperity to the East Side, one of the city's poorest neighborhoods.
From the clubhouse, the vista beyond the track is still one of deteriorated tenements, vacant warehouses and empty lots. But along the track's property, city streets have been widened and repaved and trees have been planted.
For the blocks beyond, the track helped start a neighborhood development corporation that received a $5 million Federal loan for street improvements, housing rehabilitation and store renovations. The loan will be repaid from the 1 percent of the track's daily betting receipts that it gives the city, in addition to an estimated $1.5 million a year in taxes.
"If they are successful, we will be successful, or at least the neighborhood won't die," said Luis Hernandez, the owner of a furniture store on nearby East Main Street, who is part of the development corporation.
Although the East Side's main business area is farther north, the loan will be spent to fix up only the southern end of East Main Street, where turnpike ramps lead to the track. But the entire community should benefit, Mr. Hernandez said.
"If you come in and see a lot of debris and a lot of ugly things around, you won't want to come back, even to the dog track," he said. "Let's not forget, the track is employing 600 people, and they will buy in our neighborhood. So we're not protecting the track, we're protecting our own jobs."
The track is also being welcomed by its new employees, who have year-round, full-time union jobs; the fronton had a full-time staff of only 20 and 260 part-timers. At a recent job fair, 2,500 people applied for the 350 jobs that were not taken by former fronton workers.
"I think I'm going to love it," Evelyn Felix, a former fronton bartender, said this week as her son, newly hired as a waiter, showed her how to operate a computerized cash register in the clubhouse. "This is the only thing I have to get down right now."

HEADLINE: Clinton Analyzes His Term, And Finds Himself Wanting

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
In his first two years in the White House, Bill Clinton behaved "like a prime minister, not a President," was not "pleased with" the welfare overhaul plan he proposed and "lost the language" of the moderate new Democratic thinking that helped to elect him in 1992.
Who made that trenchant analysis? 
 Bill Clinton himself, in the latest of a series of public explanations and apologies that run counter to the White House's official message of resolute determination. Once again, he left his aides scrambling to absorb and account for his words.
Mr. Clinton's most recent self-criticism came last week in a nearly hourlong telephone call to Ben Wattenberg, a neoconservative columnist and author of a new book, "Values Matter Most." The book argues that social conditions in the nation have deteriorated so much over the last 25 years that "values issues like crime, welfare and school disorder are now even more important than economic concerns," and the President called to praise it.
Mr. Wattenberg recalled in a telephone interview today: "I was sitting in a hotel room in San Diego last Thursday, and he called and said, you know, he's been reading it and skimming it, and he praised it at great length. It's a book that in certain parts is quite critical of him, but he said it was the most honest criticism of his Administration."
In his syndicated column to be published Thursday, Mr. Wattenberg quotes Mr. Clinton as saying that he was initially too interested in the "legislative scorecard, rather than in philosophy," focusing like a prime minister on shepherding his party's legislation, instead of using the bully pulpit like a chief executive. The column says Mr. Clinton said he was "so anxious to fix the economy" that he "changed philosophically and missed the boat."
Noting that the Clinton Presidential campaign stressed centrist themes of personal responsibility, Mr. Wattenberg goes on to quote Mr. Clinton as saying he had "lost the language" on taking office, and had "let Democrats down" by not drumming that message home.
Tonight, the White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said Mr. Clinton disputed some of the quotations attributed to him, and in particular did not believe he said that he had "changed philosophically." On other points, Mr. McCurry said, the President thought Mr. Wattenberg had "truncated" some "very nuanced discussions about policy" on issues like welfare and education in ways that altered Mr. Clinton's meaning.
Asked if the President was sore at Mr. Wattenberg, Mr. McCurry said, "You know, he said, 'Look, Ben's characterized about half of this conversation.' "
Mr. Wattenberg writes that when he told Mr. Clinton he had not liked the President's original proposal for overhauling welfare, believing it was too soft and weak, the President agreed, saying, "I wasn't pleased with it either." Mr. Wattenberg said Mr. Clinton said he should have introduced a welfare bill as soon as he saw that his health care plan was in trouble, but did not.
But Mr. McCurry said the President had actually been reflecting that the lack of money available for adequate child-care programs as part of any welfare plan had forced him to be less stringent about requiring welfare mothers to find jobs in a fixed time than he would have preferred.
By the time of the 1994 midterm elections, Mr. Wattenberg writes, Mr. Clinton said he realized he had created "a cardboard cut-out" of himself. But now, Mr. Wattenberg adds, Mr. Clinton intends to recapture his moderate philosophy. He said the President praised Congressional Democrats for moving toward the center on issues like welfare and crime. Mr. Wattenberg said Mr. Clinton hoped to compromise with the Republicans on an "honorable budget," though Mr. Clinton has repeatedly vowed to veto any budget that does not protect his priorities.
Mr. Wattenberg said he did not tape the conversation, but rather took longhand notes and transcribed them on a lap top computer after a discussion that lasted between 50 minutes and an hour. He said he informed Mr. McCurry of his plans to write about the conversation, and Mr. McCurry confirmed that the President had expected that.
Mr. McCurry said he did not know where the President was when he made the call, but said Mr. Clinton apparently did so on his own without consulting any aides or advising them of his intentions. Mr. Clinton is fond of calling all sorts of friends and advisers at all hours of day and night just to talk, and swap ideas and advice.
But in telephoning Mr. Wattenberg, Mr. Clinton took some obvious risks, since the columnist has made no secret of his belief that Mr. Clinton won as a moderate but veered left on taking office, and he could have been expected to spread the word of any Presidential second-thoughts.
Mr. Wattenberg said, "For someone like myself who's literally been writing for 20 years that the Democrats are not going to make headway until they acknowledge they've made some mistakes, it was a joy to hear that."
White House aides were clearly chagrined that Mr. Clinton had once again meandered into a discursive public discussion about his failings that seemed all but certain to muddy the White House's official message of the week, which is resoluteness in the face of Congressional Republicans' plans to cut the Federal budget in ways Mr. Clinton opposes.
Two weeks ago, at a fund-raising dinner in Texas, Mr. Clinton told wealthy contributors that he raised taxes "too much" in his first budget in 1993, only to insist a day later that he had simply meant to say no one likes to raise taxes. Six weeks ago, the President said he was trying to lead the nation out of a "funk," only to insist he had never meant to say he believed citizens were still depressed, but that they had been before last fall's elections. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 3, 1995, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about President Clinton's recent discussion with the writer Ben Wattenberg about his missteps in office included an incomplete quotation from Mr. Wattenberg in some editions. His comment should have read, "For someone like myself who's literally been writing for 20 years that the Democrats are not going to make headway until they acknowledge they've made some mistakes, it was a joy to hear that."

HEADLINE: A JAPANESE BANK IS INDICTED IN U.S. AND ALSO BARRED

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Federal and state bank regulators yesterday ordered Daiwa Bank Ltd., the big Japanese bank, to close its operations in the United States within three months. The order came as a Federal grand jury accused the bank of illegally covering up $1.1 billion in trading losses at its New York branch.
The expulsion and the Federal indictment appear to be an action without precedent against a large foreign bank, Federal officials said. If convicted, Daiwa could face fines of as much as $1.3 billion. 
 Daiwa did not disclose the huge losses to American regulators until late September, two months after Toshihide Iguchi, an executive at the bank's New York branch, confessed to executives at Daiwa that he had lost $1.1 billion over 11 years in unauthorized bond trading and that he had then illicitly sold securities belonging to the bank and its customers to cover up his losses. Even when the bank did report the losses, as is required by law, it attributed them to a rogue trader and did not mention that it had known about the losses since July.
But the indictment returned yesterday asserted at great length that the bank's top management had communicated extensively with Mr. Iguchi between July and September about how to handle and even conceal the losses from regulators and the financial community.
In part, the action yesterday reflected the sharply different reactions authorities in Japan and the United States had to the Daiwa scandal. The Japanese Government's initial instinct was to keep everything quiet and paper over the problem, dealing with it as a family matter. In the United States, prosecutors viewed the actions surrounding Daiwa as plain and simple fraud compounded by an elaborate cover-up. [Page D5.]
Tokyo moved today to prevent possible panic over the sanctions against Daiwa from spreading to the rest of the banking system. And Japan's Finance Ministry ordered Daiwa to cut back its international operations and asked Sumitomo Bank to help close Daiwa's businesses in the United States. [Page D5.]
The charges against Daiwa include conspiracy, mail and wire fraud, obstructing an examination of a financial institution, falsification of bank records and the failure to disclose Federal crimes. The former general manager at the Daiwa branch, Masahiro Tsuda, was also indicted on charges of conspiring to deceive regulators. Mr. Tsuda's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, said yesterday that his client, who had only become general manager in July, was innocent. Mr. Tsuda resigned from the bank last month.
Daiwa, based in Osaka, said in a statement yesterday in New York that it intended to defend itself against the Federal charges. Takashi Kaiho, the recently appointed president of Daiwa, said the bank was motivated by its desire "to investigate thoroughly the unauthorized activities by which it was victimized, to take all necessary action to protect our customers, and to act in a way that was not harmful to the international banking system."
Mr. Iguchi, the Daiwa trader, pleaded guilty last month to bank fraud and is cooperating with the United States investigation. At his hearing, Federal prosecutors said for the first time they believed that Daiwa executives had participated in a cover-up of the losses for two months.
The indictment against Daiwa sets out new information detailing a more extensive and intricate deception at the bank, involving misrepresentations made to bank regulators and examiners for several years. In early August, the indictment said, as top management became involved in the cover-up, the bank even considered concealing the whole trading loss at a company in the Cayman Islands.
That plan, though, was "ultimately rejected by Daiwa's senior management as not feasible," the indictment said. Daiwa had used that technique before, the indictment asserted, when in about 1987 the bank "successfully concealed a multimillion-dollar trading loss at Daiwa Bank Trust through a Cayman Islands entity." The Daiwa Bank Trust Company is a Daiwa subsidiary in the United States.
Mr. Iguchi first confessed his losses in an extensive letter sent to Daiwa's president in mid-July. But yesterday's indictment detailed as many as five letters that Mr. Iguchi wrote to his superiors as they pondered what to do about his horrendous losses. It also outlined Mr. Iguchi's associations with his bosses as they discussed the losses, including meetings held in late July at the Park Lane Hotel in Manhattan.
As she announced the indictments at the Federal courthouse in Foley Square, Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney for Manhattan, said that "The message to the financial community from today's indictment should be clear and unambiguous: Law enforcement will not tolerate financial institutions who unlawfully attempt to mislead regulatory authorities and cover up criminal conduct by their employees."
The order to shut down the operations was issued by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the New York State Banking Department and regulators in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Florida and Georgia, states where Daiwa has operations. Even though operations here are closed, Daiwa can still trade with American firms from Japan.
The tough action against Daiwa comes as Japanese financial institutions are under considerable pressure because of billions of dollars of nonperforming loans, a slow economy and sagging confidence.
It is now several weeks since the news of Daiwa's trading losses became public and markets have already adjusted to them. The Standard & Poor's Corporation, the rating agency, for example, said the actions yesterday would not immediately affect Daiwa's credit rating because the agency had already downgraded Daiwa two notches from A- to BBB.
"The action taken by U.S. regulators goes a bit further and will have a more serious effect on the bank's activities than we expected," said Ernie Napier, an S.& P. analyst. "It's a major setback, but it's one they can cope with," he added, noting that overseas operations represent only 10 percent of Daiwa's profit.
But Mr. Napier expressed concern that the bank's business in Japan could be hurt by the defection of Japanese clients who want a more international bank, or at least one with full access to markets in the United States. Mr. Napier said that even if Daiwa was hit with a large fine, the penalties should not have a ripple effect on the troubled Japanese banking system.
While Daiwa has been shaken by the scandal and its two top executives in Japan have resigned, analysts said it should be able to pay whatever penalties it might suffer. At the end of 1994, Daiwa had equity capital of $6.9 billion and total assets of $304 billion, ranking it the 15th largest bank in Japan and the 19th largest bank in the world, according to American Banker, a trade publication. (Daiwa Bank Ltd., its New York branch and its United States subsidiary, the Daiwa Bank Trust Company are not related to the Daiwa Securities Company, the Japanese brokerage firm.)
The charge that the bank deliberately evaded regulators has had a damaging effect on confidence in Federal regulation, some experts said. Daiwa's conduct "is very disruptive because it has undermined the examination process," said Michael Bradfield, a former general counsel to the Federal Reserve and a partner at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue.
Deliberately concealing information, as prosecutors contend Daiwa Bank did in the last several years, is inconsistent with the entire theory and practice of examinations, Mr. Bradfield said.
"The whole system of bank regulation works on the basis of full availability of records to examiners and a willingness to cooperate with supervisors when they discover problems," he said. Mr. Bradfield said that harsh action against Daiwa was justified.
But the stiff potential penalties could leave the Government open to criticism that it has employed a far harsher standard for a foreign bank than has been applied in cases involving American brokerage firms.
For example, prosecutors elected to bring no criminal charges against Salomon Brothers Inc. for having illegally obtained millions of dollars through fraudulent bids in the Treasury markets in 1991. No charges have yet been brought in a case involving a trader at Kidder, Peabody & Company, who was accused by the firm of engaging in a series of bogus trades strikingly similar to those at Daiwa.
And last year, Ms. White, the Federal prosecutor, chose not to indict Prudential Securities for taking more than $1 billion from 100,000 investors through the fraudulent sale of risky limited partnerships. Indeed, while the Government said in court filings that Prudential executives knowingly committed the fraud, no individual has ever been charged with a crime.
Some prosecutors yesterday drew parallels with previous Federal regulatory action against the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. B.C.C.I. was the rogue bank based in Luxembourg and with headquarters in London that was closed by regulators around the world in July 1991 after it had become extensively involved in money laundering, falsifying accounts and many other infractions.
But B.C.C.I., unlike Daiwa Bank, was never formally admitted into the United States, or allowed to operate branches in this country. It did, though, secretly and illegally buy banks and other financial institutions in the United States.
Just what regulators in the United States knew about Daiwa's New York branch, and when they knew it, is still a murky issue. According to several former Federal Reserve officials, there was considerable concern about Daiwa's sloppy controls and trading practices as long ago as 1993. But it seems Fed regulators took Daiwa's assurances that the bank would redress the shortcomings they had identified.
Congress is now preparing to hold hearings on Daiwa, the trading debacle at its New York office and regulatory oversight of the bank. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, said in an interview yesterday that the actions against Daiwa were "an appropriate response to illegal activities."
Senator D'Amato said that his committee's hearing would look into what procedures might minimize the chance of a recurrence of the Daiwa scandal. He said his purpose was "not to admonish the regulators, but to ascertain from them what they are doing" and "to ask them to explain what did happen."
 
Iguchi's Letters
 Prosecutors have accused Daiwa Bank and several top executives of conspiring for months to cover up $1.1 billion in losses incurred by a trader, Toshihide Iguchi, through unauthorized bond trading. In addition to the confession letter from Mr. Iguchi that set off the whole chain of events, prosecutors say Mr. Iguchi wrote at least four more that figure in the cover-up.
 
1. The Original Confession -- July 21
 
Addressed to Daiwa's then-president, Akira Fujita; Mr. Iguchi characterized it as his "honest confession" and said he had "caused approximately a $1.1 billion loss from trading in United Staes Treasury bonds at the New York Branch." He suggested that the bank should "keep the secret until the bank and possibly the Japanese authorities can take appropriate measures," and he added that "it is clear from a legal standpoint this will make the continuation of the U.S. operation difficult."
 
2. No One Will Catch On -- July 24
 
Along with another copy of the confession letter, Daiwa received a second letter from Mr. Iguchi in which he said, "I can clearly say on the basis of the experience I gained from the Fed inspection the year before last, that there is a zero possibility that this case would be found out in the United States if we bought back (the Unites States Treasury obligations). . . "
 
3. Ways to Hide the Losses -- July 25
 
Addressed to the deputy president of Daiwa Bank Limited; the indictment says that in this third letter Mr. Iguchi "outlined his suggestions for ways in which the defendant Daiwa could continue to conceal the $1.1 billion loss."
 
4. More Details on the Trading -- July 28-29
 
According to the indictment, three senior executives met with Mr. Iguchi in late July. Masahiro Tsuda, Daiwa's managing director in New York, said at the meeting that the losses would not be announced until late November, after Daiwa was due to announce financial results, and that keeping the losses secret in the meantime was imperative, the indictment says.
 
The next day, the indictment says, Mr. Iguchi gave the three executives a fourth letter explaining his trades, losses and unauthorized sales of bonds to cover his losses in greater detail; Mr. Tsuda then asked Mr. Iguchi "to destroy the computer disk on which he had prepared the confession letter."
 
5. A New Undated Confession -- Aug. 4
 
The indictment says another of the three executives directed Mr. Iguchi to "prepare another version of the confession letter, which was to be undated," and told Mr. Iguchi "to discuss only his unauthorized trading losses and the losses that resulted from that trading" and omit mention of "other matters" addressed in the first confession letter in July.

HEADLINE: California Smog Cloud Is Cleaning Up Its Act

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 2

 BODY:
The noxious haze of smog that hangs over Los Angeles and the surrounding urban basin has long been the thickest, unhealthiest and most infamous in the country, as much a symbol of the city to many people as Hollywood.
But the latest pollution measurements show that however noxious the cloud might be, determined cleanup efforts are steadily reducing its size and toxicity. 
 Thirty-five years ago, the pollution level in the basin, as measured by the presence of ozone, exceeded the minimum Federal Government health standard of 0.12 parts of ozone per million parts of air on four of every five days.
But now, new measurements show, that safety standard is exceeded on fewer than two of every five days because of two decades of stringent emission controls on vehicles, factories and even private residences.
There is still far too much air pollution over the Los Angeles region, irritating eyes and lungs and causing more illness and premature death than anywhere else in the country. Some days the gray-brown haze hangs so heavy that it seems that no progress has been made.
But, in fact, at least two-thirds of the health-threatening pollutants have been stripped out, air-quality experts say. Few other major metropolitan areas can match that progress.
"This is a good news-bad news situation, but there's now more good news than bad news and that's remarkable," said James M. Lents, who heads the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the state government body that monitors and enforces the cleanup.
"Keep in mind," Mr. Lents added, "that this dramatic progress occurred while the number of people and cars in the region essentially tripled and new industry sprouted everywhere. So if we keep making headway against odds like that -- we need to eliminate two-thirds of the pollution that's still left and there's some resistance -- we just might have truly healthy air again by as soon as 2010."
Federal officials, the ultimate arbiters of the country's air quality, are equally encouraged.
Arnold Robbins, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency's regional office in San Francisco, said: "California in general and the Los Angeles area in particular have been very aggressive national leaders in air cleanup. They have adopted measures that other places are just now beginning to consider."
Back in the bad old bad-air days in the Los Angeles basin, smog often covered the region from the mountains to the sea, obscuring the bright California sun, hiding the tops of skyscrapers, seeping under doors and leaving most everyone wheezing.
Motorcycle messengers sometimes donned gas masks.
On the very worst days, government officials would close schools and businesses and urge everybody to remain shut up indoors.
But these days the sun shines through -- more often than not.
The peaks of the distant San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains once again soar, still a little hazily, but nevertheless visible.
And in coastline towns like Pacific Palisades and Santa Monica, the pollution cloud has lightened and pulled back so much that itchy eyes and irritated lungs are a rarity.
Even in the heart of the cloud, 30 miles or so east of downtown Los Angeles, the really bad days are farther and farther apart, the visibility better and better.
So far this year, there have been only 13 days when air quality in the basin deteriorated to the Stage 1 level of 0.20 parts of ozone per million parts of air. That is the polluted point above the basic 0.12 safety threshold at which government health experts publicly warn that air quality has slipped from being simply "unhealthful" to being "very unhealthful."
Last year at this time, there had been 23 Stage 1 alerts. In 1990, there were 41; in 1985, there were 83, and a decade earlier there were close to 120.
Not since 1988 has there been a Stage 2 alert in the basin, the point when ozone reaches the 0.35 level and some industries are ordered to slow operations, driving is curtailed and schoolchildren are not permitted on playgrounds. And not since 1974 has there been a Stage 3 alert, when ozone reaches the 0.50 level and a general holiday is ordered.
"Any way you measure it, things are a lot better," said Linda Waade, the executive director of the Coalition For Clean Air, a California public interest group that lobbies for stronger cleanup efforts.
But Ms. Waade worries that the conservative political tide now sweeping the country could result in a loosening of the strict health standards that made California the national leader in mandating such cleanup devices as catalytic converters on the cars, vapor traps on fuel and solvent sources and soot screens on smokestacks.
She noted "growing opposition" to government-ordered development of electrically powered cars. She said that new emission standards for planes and trains were a year behind schedule and that plans for reducing smoke emissions from restaurants were two years late.
Business leaders counter that such delays result from a growing acceptance of the need for "pragmatic" trade-offs between the environment and the economy.
"Local and state air quality officials are now more receptive in taking economic concerns into account," said Ray Remy, the president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.
Whatever the case, pollution experts at the South Coast Air Quality Management District calculate that every day a minimum of 8,000 tons of noxious hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide and miscellaneous microscopic particulates are still sent skyward by the region's 10 million cars, trucks, trains and planes, its 40,000 or so industrial sites and the private homes and apartments of its 14.5 million residents.
A study by the district estimates that each year the resulting bad air, even at reduced levels, costs basin residents $10 billion in health problems, sends 1,600 people to a premature death and causes at least 15 million days of lost work, study and play.
The district's air problems are exacerbated by unusual weather and topographical factors.
The Los Angeles basin is so tightly hemmed on the land side by mountains and hills that prevailing offshore Pacific winds are unable to push out the pollution and, in fact, often tamp it down with a heavy, damp cloud layer.
Then the hot sun burns relentlessly on the trapped mixture, chemically cooking some of its pollutants into still another particularly unhealthful pollutant, ozone.
"We've got a lot of things working against us besides pollution," said Joseph C. Cassmassi, the district's senior meteorologist.
Actually, several California communities must contend with similar air-quality factors.
Of the 10 urban areas in the country considered by the Environmental Protection Agency to have the worst air pollution problems, nine are in California. Most are along a line stretching roughly from San Diego, up through Los Angeles and the Central Valley and on to Sacramento. But the Los Angeles area is easily the worst of the 10, with almost twice as much pollution as any other area -- still.
The only non-California city on the top-10 list is Houston, which ranks sixth. Beyond that list, ranking 11 through 15 in order of pollution are a string of five cities in the Northeast: Bridgeport, Conn., Hartford, New York, Trenton and Philadelphia.
In recent years, on average, the pollution in those five cities has exceeded the minimum 0.12 Federal health standard only four days a year.
Even with all its progress, Los Angeles still has at least 25 times that many bad days.

HEADLINE: SHRINKING THE CITY: Sector by sector;
How New Yorkers Feel Budget Squeeze

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
At Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, one physician is now responsible for the care of all 60 patients in two of the hospital's general medical wards each night from 8 P.M. to 6 A.M. Doctors consider that a nearly impossible task; until recently, five doctors, including several residents, covered the shift.
At Joseph Pulitzer Intermediate School in Jackson Heights, Queens, some classes were so overcrowded this week that in one class, nine students had to stand all through class, using windowsills or the tops of radiators as desks. 
 On the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to Main Street in Flushing, Queens, only 35 trains ran between 4 and 6 P.M. one recent afternoon. The number was 43 a month ago, and the official schedule says it should now be 37.
Over the last 10 months, the city and state governments have made extraordinary cuts in spending, and additional cuts from Washington seem virtually certain. The effects are just beginning to reverberate throughout New York City.
An examination by The New York Times, which surveyed 14 city and state services whose budgets were reduced, shows that shrinking the size and cost of government has produced a significant, and in some cases striking, diminution in services.
Sometimes, the changes have been modest or mundane. In many cases, though, the quality of municipal services has declined markedly. Class sizes have swelled at virtually all levels of public education, and fewer courses are being offered in both secondary schools and universities.
Libraries have cut back spending for new books and related materials by more than 30 percent. Litter baskets on street corners in many parts of Manhattan are overflowing by midafternoon because there are fewer midtown trash pickups.
And while the cleanliness of city playgrounds has improved now that welfare recipients have been put to work with rakes and brooms, more sophisticated work, like maintaining swings and slides, has sharply deteriorated. Nearly half the no-parking signs in three neighborhoods were found to be faded, unreadable or simply missing, and half the storm drains in three other communities were clogged with leaves and trash.
Some city services have been maintained or even improved. The police and fire departments have been spared major budget cuts; in fact, the Police Department's budget was actually increased, reflecting Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's view that some services are so important to the city that they should be held above the others.
When Mr. Giuliani introduced his $31.1 billion budget in April -- with a $1.1 billion spending cut, the largest since World War II -- he vowed that city services would not suffer, and that most New Yorkers would feel no effect. The reductions, he said, were carefully selected to avoid an erosion of services.
The Mayor repeated that view last week. "There is no correlation between high budgets and delivering effective services," he told a group of student journalists. "Nor is there a correlation between budget cuts and reducing services."
Not all the service reductions result from decisions by Mr. Giuliani. While New York City's budget was reduced, so were state contributions to the city. In fact, some services in the city are provided mainly or entirely by the state or Federal governments.
For example, the City University system receives most of its government support from the state, and the new state budget cut $100 million from the system -- a 16 percent reduction. One result was a tuition increase of $750 a year, a rise of 31 percent.
The state, as well as the city, reduced its contribution to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the quasi-independent agency that oversees New York's subways and buses. That helped lead to service cuts and the 25-cent fare increase that goes into effect on Nov. 12.
But most services examined by reporters for The Times are financed by the city. And so the changes in the quantity or quality of services are largely the result of fiscal decisions made by Mr. Giuliani, the City Council and to a lesser extent, former Mayor David N. Dinkins, who started scaling back some city spending in the early 1990's.
The Mayor did not make his decisions in a vacuum. For several years, independent officials who monitor the budget have warned that the city's tax base can no longer support New York's vast array of government services. City services will have to be reduced, they said.
But some of the same officials have also been concerned that as the budget is cut, services might deteriorate so badly that individuals would be hurt and New York's standing as a capital of finance, commerce and culture would suffer.
In a city as vast as New York, no one can comprehensively assess the relationship between spending reductions and changes in the broad array of government services. The Times's examination was anecdotal; reporters visited schools, parks, municipal hospitals, social service agencies, libraries and subway stations, trying to measure how services were delivered.
For example, reporters spent 22 hours on subway platforms, counting trains on six lines on which service were cut back in September.
What emerged were snapshots of New York City in a year of unequaled spending cuts. And the anecdotal evidence shows that all but the most affluent New Yorkers are exposed to the effects of the budget cuts in ways large and small.
Public hospitals and social service agencies, which the city's poorest residents use, received some of the largest city and state spending reductions, and recipients of these services have noticed the effects.
But many services that affect a wider cross-section of New Yorkers have also begun to show the consequences of diminished financing. At Bernard M. Baruch College in Manhattan, there are 51 students, on average, in history classes this fall. Two years ago, the average was 33.
While playgrounds are cleaner, stolen or broken equipment often is not being replaced. At Morningside Playground in Harlem, four of six swings for small children are gone. At Gen. Douglas MacArthur Park on Staten Island, two of four swings for older children are missing. At the Speradeo Brothers Playground in East New York, all four swings are gone.
In midtown Manhattan, trash baskets are filled or even overflowing, because of modest cutbacks in Sanitation Department pickups. In many parts of midtown, local crews working for private Business Improvement Districts have begun emptying the trash themselves and collecting it in colorful plastic bags with their own logos; sometimes six, eight or a dozen such bags surround the city's litter baskets on street corners.
For some services, there were noticeable disparities between neighborhoods. A park in Riverdale, the Bronx -- with six tennis courts, groomed softball fields and brand new playground equipment -- stood in sharp contrast to the rundown playground in East New York, Brooklyn.
In Gravesend, Brooklyn, a middle-class area near Coney Island, only half as many parking signs were legible per block, on average, as on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. More than 40 percent of the alternate-side street signs in Gravesend were so faded that they were unreadable. And on many blocks in the South Bronx and East New York, most signs were simply missing.
Mr. Giuliani, who declined requests for an interview for this article, has long contended that he had no choice but to reduce the overall size of city government, given the city's huge budget gaps. Mr. Giuliani also argues that by shrinking the municipal work force and lowering taxes, he can stimulate the local economy.
The survey of 14 city services suggests that the city, as well as the state and the quasi-independent agencies like the public schools, the City University and the M.T.A., are often doing less with less.
Data from the city's own annual management assessment, the Mayor's Management Report, also indicates many other areas where city services have declined, particularly compared with the same services in the mid- and late-1980's, when tax revenues soared and New York ran up huge annual surpluses.
The report says the city took an average of 37 days last year to provide an elderly person with a home-care attendant after the person was determined to be eligible; five years ago, it took 20 days.
When a New Yorker was denied welfare, but then was determined to be eligible on appeal, the city began providing assistance within 30 days of the appeal decision 78 percent of the time last year. In 1991, 96 percent of those found eligible on appeal received assistance within 30 days.
The backlog of sewers in need of repair was 5,735, on average, during the fiscal year that ended in June. In 1990, the average backlog was 1,898.
In addition to short-term inconveniences, several officials said service reductions may pose long-term problems for the city.
"A city's competitiveness, its ability to be an attractive place for people to reside in and work in, hinges on two major considerations: cost and quality of life," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group that monitors the city's finances. "From that I think it follows that if services are being diminished substantially, then it's a serious issue for the city's future."
 
 
 
City Help Lines Keep On Ringing
 Over several days, calls were made to 35 city agencies, many with fewer employees as the result of budget cuts. The phone numbers were taken from the government section of the Nynex White Pages. In 21 cases, the phone was answered within three rings. In five cases, the line was continually busy, or there was no answer.
At these agencies, the outcome was more unusual:
PARKING VIOLATIONS BUREAU The phone rang 96 times (10 minutes), then switched to an automated help line. An operator answered in one minute.
HEALTH DEPARTMENT The 24-hour crisis line rang 20 times, then went dead.
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE Its general information line rang once, then it transferred to an automated message. But once a selection was made, the line disconnected.
RECORDS AND INFORMATION SERVICES DEPARTMENT The number for obtaining birth and death records rang 35 times, then switched to a busy signal.
HOUSING AUTHORITY Its line for applications for project apartments was continually busy on two afternoons.
CITYWIDE INFORMATION LINE After two rings, the line switched to an automated message that did not include an option to speak to a person.
CITY TAX 24-HOUR LINE After one ring, a caller was switched to a five-minute-long automated message with no option to speak to a person.
DEPARTMENT OF INVESTIGATION A line for callers to report corruption complaints rang five times before a tape recording listed the department's office address and hours. The message then requested that the caller leave a message.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks to Shore Up Muslim-Croat Federation

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, Nov. 2

 BODY:
On the second day of Balkan peace talks here, the outlines of the Clinton Administration's strategy are already clear: strengthen the Muslim-Croat federation and seek to oust the separatist Bosnian Serb leadership as a means to cement the fragile unity of the single Bosnian state envisaged in any peace agreement.
A statement issued today by the State Department said the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, and the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, had agreed on steps to shore up the tenous federation brokered last year by the United States. 
 The federation, whose creation stopped the 1993 war between Muslims and Croats, recently came under acute pressure when a Muslim-Croat offensive in western Bosnia last September turned into a race for territory between the two armies that twice degenerated into fighting between them.
Under the accord, about 300 Muslim families are to return to two towns, Jajce and Stolac, that are controlled by the Croats. At the same time, 300 Croat families are to return to two central Bosnian towns, Travnik and Bugojno, controlled by the Muslim-led Government. Up to now, mutual suspicions have prevented such returns of refugee families.
The federation is viewed as critical by United States officials because, without it, Bosnia would disintegrate altogether. The Croats control about 22 percent of Bosnia and their strong inclination is to govern this territory directly from Zagreb rather than work with the Sarajevo Government.
The overall peace plan presented here today to the Presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia calls for the establishment of several centralized institutions, including a presidency and a parliament, and for what Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Wednesday called a Bosnian state "with a single international personality."
But at the same time it envisages splitting the country roughly in half between a Muslim-Croat federation and a republic of Serbs.
The Serbs, who have fought since 1992 to establish their own state in Bosnia and now control about 48 percent of the country, have told American officials that they want the central Bosnian institutions to amount to no more than "a paper roof."
It is this tension -- between the centralized unitary state sought by the Bosnian Government of President Izetbegovic and the very loose union that might open the way to eventual secession sought by the Serbs -- that lies at the heart of the peace talks. It is by no means clear that the diplomatic acrobatics of the chief American mediator, Richard C. Holbrooke, can resolve it.
Mr. Christopher made clear in a television interview broadcast today that the United States expects Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the political and military leaders of the Bosnian Serbs who have been indicted by an international tribual in The Hague as war criminals, to be ousted in the very near future.
This statement amounted to by far the boldest demand yet made by the Clinton Administration for the removal of two men who would certainly work determinedly to insure that Bosnia is irrevocably split in two.
"We can't really expect that forces of NATO would be there at the same time as these individuals are in positions of power," Mr. Christopher said.
Because a NATO force, including at least 20,000 American soldiers, is expected to go to Bosnia almost immediately after any peace agreement, this statement suggested that the Clinton Administration now wants the two men removed within weeks. This demand appeared to reflect the impact on the Administration of recent Serbian massacres of Muslims in Srebrenica and northwestern Bosnia.
Up to now, however, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has only offered to work for the removal of Dr. Karadzic through elections that would take place within the next year, Western officials said.
Thus considerable new pressure is being applied to Mr. Milosevic and it appears by no means clear that his response will be positive. The Serbian President heads a delegation that includes three senior Bosnian Serb officials.
The aim of the American policy seems clear: open the way for Bosnia to be knitted together again by removing the men most identified with its division. But the risks are considerable, for the two men have solid bands of highly armed supporters with little to lose.
Nicholas Burns, a State Department spokesman, said the three delegations were today handed four draft documents of an eventual peace. He said the papers included what he called "the general peace agreement" -- covering the overall terms of an accord -- and separate papers on the organization of elections, constitutional issues, and the separation of military and paramilitary forces.
The documents were mainly drafted by the State Department and the team working with Mr. Holbrooke. But they were reviewed by delegations from Russia and the European Union. Other documents, on issues like economic reconstruction, are still under review.
Apart from the highly contentious issue of territory, and particularly the status of Sarajevo, the question of elections is also a highly charged one, officials said.
Apart from their objections to any role for Mr. Karadzic and General Mladic, the Bosnian delegation wants the central parliament to be elected by direct, popular vote. The Serbs want its members to be appointed by the respective parliaments of the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb republic in order to insure that ethnic balance of its members is roughly even.
In an indication that the meeting will last at least another week, the United States Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, and a European mediator, Thorvald Stoltenberg, were sent today to eastern Slavonia, the one remaining Serb-held area of Croatia. They are to return to Dayton in about a week.
Mr. Tudjman and Mr. Milosevic agreed on Wednesday to work "toward full normalization of relations" between Croatia and Serbia, but no accord was reached on the fate of eastern Slavonia. Mr. Tudjman, who is to leave Dayton today and return next week, said recently that Croatia would take the area by force or negotiation by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Vote Set on Bills to Keep Government Operating

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Republican leaders in Congress said today that they would vote next week on temporary measures to keep the Government in business while lawmakers and President Clinton try to resolve their differences over the budget.
The leaders -- Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican whip in the Senate, and Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader in the House -- said no decision had been made on what form the new measures would take or what length of time they would cover. 
 Only 2 of the 13 appropriations bills to provide money for the Government's departments and agencies in the current fiscal year have been enacted. A stopgap appropriations bill lapses on Nov. 13.
In addition, the Government is close to exceeding the $4.9 trillion statutory limit on how much it can borrow. Unless the ceiling is raised, the Treasury may not have enough money to pay $25 billion in interest due Nov. 15 on Government bonds.
President Clinton told Congressional leaders at a meeting at the White House on Wednesday that he would like the borrowing limit and the appropriations legislation to be extended past the first of next year. The leaders would like to have the laws expire in early December.
Republicans would like to use the extension of the laws as a lever to force the President to accept some of the measures he is likely to veto. One suggestion tonight was that the extensions be tied to a bill to abolish the Department of Commerce, but there was no indication that this is what the leaders intended to do.
Meanwhile, Republican staff assistants, and in some instances the lawmakers themselves, had meetings all across the Capitol to try to work out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the big budget bills approved last week.
Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, said an agreement was near on how much to cut financing for student loans over the next seven years. The House voted to cut the program by $10.2 billion and the Senate by $4.7 billion. A staff assistant said a likely compromise was in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion.
In New York tonight, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said he was confident that Congress and the Administration would adopt legislation to balance the budget. Mr. Greenspan spoke to the Concord Coalition, a public affairs group that works for deficit reduction.
Mr. Greenspan has hinted in the past that the Federal Reserve Board might be more receptive to lowering short-term interest rates if a plan to balance the budget became law. But the chairman did not make such a suggestion tonight.

Daiwa Ordered to Close Its American Operations
Banking regulators ordered Daiwa Bank of Japan to close its operations in the United States within three months as a Federal grand jury charged the bank with a criminal cover-up of $1.1 billion of trading losses at its New York branch. The former general manager of the branch was also indicted. Daiwa could face fines as high as $1.3 billion. [Page A1.]
 
Daiwa is curbing its foreign operations for various violations of foreign exchange and banking laws, under a Finance Ministry order. Daiwa said it asked Sumitomo Bank to help close its operations in the United States. [D5.]
 
The harsh American action demonstrates once again the degree to which two powerful countries that talk to each other constantly rarely seem to communicate. [D5.]
 
Stocks Scale New Peaks
Led by transportation, technology and retail issues, the stock market surged. The Dow industrials climbed 41.91 points, to 4,808.59, eclipsing the average's previous high of 4,802.45, reached two weeks earlier. [D6.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities rose, on hopes that the soft numbers for retail sales and jobless claims would let the Fed cut interest rates. [D17.]
 
Anemic Growth in Factory Orders
Strong demand for commercial aircraft pushed factory orders up 1.5 percent in September, but that was barely half the rate recorded in August, showing the manufacturing economy is slowing. [D13.]
 
Head of Ex-Im Bank Quitting
Kenneth D. Brody, a former Goldman, Sachs executive who transformed the once-lethargic Export-Import Bank, is quitting. Congressional budget cutters contend the Federal agency provides welfare to companies like Boeing and G.E. [D17.]
 
Chrysler to Think Things Over
Chrysler's board said it would take three months to consult with shareholders and consider its options before deciding on most of the proposals from Kirk Kerkorian, Chrysler's largest private shareholder. [D2.]
 
Republicans Plan Deficit Vote
Republicans said they would hold a vote next week on temporary measures to keep the Government in business while lawmakers and President Clinton try to resolve their differences over the budget. [A24.]

Carnival in Talks With Kloster
Carnival is reportedly close to acquiring a majority interest in Kloster Cruise Ltd., by making an investment of $50 million. [D13.]
 
'Dream Girls' of Madison Avenue
As advertising heralded the rise of the American consumer society, women often became the focus, and subject, of ads. An exhibition coming to New York, "Dream Girls: Images of Women in Advertising," shows how women were presented as symbols of ideals as disparate as purity (Psyche, the White Rock girl) and pleasure (Jean Harlow for Lucky Strike cigarettes). Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D18.]

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
End the War

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The Million Man March on Washington, a largely middle-class gathering, left tormenting questions about the black underclass. What can be done to break the cycle of despair in our inner cities? What, especially, can be done for their lost young men?
If we are prepared to look past shibboleths, one answer should come to mind. That is to end the so-called war on drugs. 
 Drugs are terrible. But it is not drugs that have done the real damage to our society. It is the misbegotten effort to use the criminal law against them.
We tried Prohibition to end alcohol abuse. It brought so much crime that we quickly gave up the Noble Experiment.
Prohibition of drugs began in 1915. The experiment has been going for 80 years now, and by every rational test it is a ghastly failure.
The huge amounts of money spent in recent years on the drug war have not reduced addiction. Per capita use of cocaine has in fact increased.
And the effort to stop drug use by harsher and harsher criminal penalties has had devastating side effects. It has made importation and distribution of the forbidden products immensely profitable. That in turn has lured large numbers of young men, even children, into the trade.
"We're giving these kids a criminal identity," Joseph D. McNamara, former police chief in San Jose, Calif., said, "when we should be trying to find every possible way to keep them in school and get them into employment."
Mr. McNamara is now a research fellow at the Hoover Institution in Stanford, Calif. Last May, Hoover put on a conference about drug policy. The participants included George Shultz, the former Secretary of State, and Milton Friedman, the economist -- both also at the Hoover Institution -- and dozens of police officials. The participants ended by favoring, overwhelmingly, medical and educational alternatives to the war on drugs.
"Any objective group that studies the war on drugs has to recognize that it's a disaster," Mr. McNamara told The Palo Alto (Calif.) Weekly. "It is not stopping the spread of drug abuse, it's causing a good deal more crime and violence than we'd otherwise have, and it's having severe negative effects on race relations in America."
Another terrible cost of the drug war is the incarceration of enormous numbers of people. This country now has more than one million prisoners, many of them sentenced to long terms for nonviolent drug crimes. It costs us upward of $20,000 a year for each one -- and it will cost hundreds of billions to build new prisons.
The racial impact of the drug war is particularly devastating. One third of this country's black men between 20 and 29 are now in prison or under supervision of the criminal justice system, most of them for drug crimes.
Then there is the murderous quality of life in urban ghettos. Guns accompany the drug trade, and small children are incidental victims of the street battles that result. By one estimate, we have 10,000 drug-related homicides a year.
If we began to decriminalize our drug laws, there might be an increase, perhaps temporary, in casual use. But against that possibility one has to weigh the great gains for society in taking the profit out of the trade.
That is one point made in a compelling piece on drugs in the October issue of The Washington Monthly. By Joshua Wolf Shenk, it argues that we must try to limit drug use -- but not use methods that do more harm than good.
Cigarettes have been found to addict young users more than any other drug, Mr. Shenk points out; and 400,000 Americans die prematurely each year because of tobacco use. But we fight that problem not by criminal prohibition but by rules and education, which have substantially reduced smoking.
Politically, it is very hard to talk sense about drugs. President Clinton has just signed legislation rejecting a recommendation of the Federal Sentencing Commission to end the grotesque disparity of sentences for crack and regular cocaine: up to 100 times more for the former.
But some day we may have political leaders brave enough to do what most of the police authorities and judges who are on the front line have concluded is essential: Stop the self-destruction of the war on drugs.

HEADLINE: At Last, a Watershed Agreement

 BODY:
Every once in a while something happens to demonstrate the powers of firm political leadership coupled with the good will of ordinary citizens. A case in point is the agreement announced yesterday between New York City and upstate communities to clean up the 2,000-square-mile watershed that supplies drinking water to seven million city dwellers and one million suburbanites.
There are weaknesses in the plan, but it represents a huge step forward. On a purely financial level, it will spare the city and its taxpayers the cost of building an $8 billion filtration plant. Politically, it represents a rare triumph of good sense over once insurmountable grievances. 
 To grasp the importance of this agreement it is necessary to understand some complicated history. New York City has long had the power to acquire property around the city's 19 reservoirs and to regulate development on adjacent lands. Because the city did not exercise that power for many years, local residents naturally got the idea that they could do whatever they liked. Development proceeded rapidly, first in Westchester County, later in Putnam County and now in the Catskills. Water quality declined, and in 1989 the Federal Government ordered the city to clean up the watershed or build a filtration plant it simply could not afford.
The city then decided to enforce its powers, announcing that it would acquire thousands of acres of land to provide buffer zones around the reservoirs and writing new regulations governing sewage treatment plants and septic tanks. Upstaters bridled at these restrictions and filed one lawsuit after another. Not an acre of land was acquired, not a single sewage treatment plant upgraded. The watershed continued to deteriorate, and Washington renewed its threats.
Enter Gov. George Pataki, who had promised during his campaign to save the watershed. Seven months ago, he convened all the interested players -- city officials, environmentalists, representatives of the Coalition of Watershed Towns and observers from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. There were more than 200 meetings, many of them bitter and unproductive. But in the end -- the last details were worked out at 4:20 yesterday morning -- the combatants agreed on a plan.
Under the plan, the city will spend some $1.2 billion to acquire more than 100,000 acres of land from willing sellers, to upgrade 100 or so sewage treatment plants, to repair many of the region's 128,000 septic tanks and to underwrite a program to reduce runoff from farms.
The project will be administered by a new Watershed Council made up of residents, city and E.P.A. officials, and environmentalists. They have an important custodial and enforcement job ahead. Environmental groups, for example, complain that the restrictions on new sewage treatment plants are too weak and thus an invitation to destructive development.
On balance, however, there were no real losers in this deal. If everything works out, upstaters will get an economic transfusion. New Yorkers will continue to receive inexpensive, high-quality drinking water. The water rates may rise $4 to $7 a year per household, but this is a pittance compared with the carrying cost of a multibillion-dollar filtration plant.
Mr. Pataki deserves a lot of credit, as does his chief counsel, Michael Finnegan, who ran the meetings with inexhaustible patience. But they were not the only heroes. Various environmental groups -- chiefly the Hudson Riverkeeper -- sounded an early alarm. Two successive bosses of the city's Department of Environmental Protection -- Al Appleton, who worked for Mayor David Dinkins, and Marilyn Gelber, the incumbent -- represented the city's interests. The Coalition of Watershed Towns deserves credit for sacrificing local commercial ambitions to regional harmony, which is what this agreement is about.

HEADLINE: Allies of Two Minds

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
From the start, United States officials and their Japanese counterparts never agreed about how to deal with a huge financial institution that misled regulators in both countries and sought to hide losses of $1.1 billion in illegal trades.
But the stunning American response today to the Daiwa Bank scandal again demonstrates the degree to which two powerful nations, which constantly talk to each other, rarely seem to communicate. 
 The Japanese Government's initial instincts in the bond-trading scandal were to keep everything quiet and to paper over the problem, dealing with it as a family matter. For six weeks, the Finance Ministry did not even tell the United States Treasury Department or the Federal Reserve that officials suspected a huge banking fraud had been committed on American soil.
Full disclosure, Japan's rattled financial officials feared, might further shake the foundation of the nation's once-proud banking system.
In the United States, the attitude has been the reverse. Federal prosecutors viewed the case as a fraud, plain and simple, compounded by an elaborate cover-up in which the Japanese Government may have been an accomplice in recent months.
Their instinct was to trumpet the extent of the problem, much as American officials eventually did in the savings and loan crisis, and to make an example of the offenders.
Publicly, officials like Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin never expressed anger at the actions of the Japanese Government. But the Clinton Administration's views were privately conveyed in a phone conversation with Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura. Mr. Rubin and many others here were upset.
So when regulators made brief inquiries around Washington about whether high-level diplomatic concerns should take precedence -- as they probably would have in the past -- the only message that came back was to deal with the whole affair by the book.
"It tells you everything about the wide gap in how the two countries deal with the transparency of the financial system, and in the nature of the relationship between the government and corporations," said Michael Mochizuki, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who studies the relationships between the two governments. "In Japan, there would have been a ritual resignation, and the old boys would have taken care of it. And that is why there is so much shock in Japan these days that this has been dealt with so severely -- that the U.S. views this as such a breach of trust."
American officials made every effort today to argue that this was a legal, not a diplomatic dispute, and that no one in political channels was even involved in the decision making about how Daiwa should be punished.
But it only added to the unpleasant air already surrounding President Clinton's visit to Japan scheduled to begin on Nov. 17. Senior officials, led by Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, are in Japan this week trying to calm a political storm involving the Japanese-American security treaty, one fueled by accusations of the rape of a 12-year-old girl on Okinawa by three American servicemen. Then there were disclosures that the Central Intelligence Agency spied on Japanese trade negotiators.
The broad significance of the order that Daiwa Bank give up its American operations was noted today by Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, the House Banking Committee chairman. "As profound a legal and regulatory issue that this may be for one institution," he said, "it is far more serious for U.S.-Japanese economic relations."
Perhaps the only precedent for today's action took place late in the cold war. In 1987, a scandal erupted over the actions of a Toshiba Corporation subsidiary, which was accused of shipping submarine propellers to the Soviet Union, making its underwater nuclear fleet harder to detect.
For months, the United States prodded Japanese authorities to look into the situation more closely. The Japanese fumed, as they did in this case, and investigators in Tokyo contended that the evidence was scant. Finally, Washington retaliated, barring the Toshiba Machine Company from doing business in the United States for years and going so far as to include intelligence-agency reports in leaking details of the secret deal.
The Americans were intent on making an example of Toshiba. The Japanese, by contrast, were interested in skating past the incident as smoothly as possible. Washington's handling of the affair bred resentment in Tokyo for years: television never tired of showing a film clip of American lawmakers smashing a Toshiba stereo system to bits. For many Japanese, that image embodied the term "Japan bashing."
Nothing so graphic is likely to emerge from today's indictment, but the resentments may be no less acute.
Already, some Japanese officials argue that the United States has wildly overreacted to the Daiwa case. Japanese magazines have suggested that Washington is kicking out a big Japanese bank because of some kind of resentment over the power that Japanese financial institutions wielded in the late 1980's, when they went on buying sprees through the United States. There are conspiracy theories galore.
And some Americans charge, without any clearer proof than the Japanese theories, that the penalty applied to Merrill Lynch last week for a relatively minor infraction of Tokyo's own rules was a tit-for-tat response to the Daiwa case.
In Japan, bank executives are highly unlikely to go to prison for the kinds of actions contained in today's indictment. Like Toshiba's top leaders, two of Daiwa's senior executives have already resigned or retired.
But the American action suggests that Daiwa's top managers may not receive the rehabilitation accorded to Toshiba's, who gradually reappeared on various advisory boards. The bank has caused something of a national humiliation abroad, the sort of thing that is not dealt with lightly in Japanese society. The American court action is likely to force into public view documents and accounts of the bank's internal operations that would ordinarily stay under wraps.
"The Japanese banking world is such a cocoon," said a top official at a rival Japanese bank in New York, "that it is hard for everyone to understand that when you go overseas, the usual protections do not apply. This is the real meaning of 'getting internationalized.' "

HEADLINE: In America;
Strength in Numbers

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
On Tuesday Secretary of Labor Robert Reich said, "There is something wrong with rising profits, rising productivity and a soaring stock market, but employee compensation heading nowhere."
The Labor Department had just reported that an expanding economy had driven stock prices to record levels in the past year but the earnings of American workers had risen by only 2.7 percent, the smallest annual increase on record. 
 The report was not surprising. American workers have been on a downhill slide for years, losing wages, losing benefits, losing jobs, losing respect, and in all too many cases, losing hope.
Now comes Sara Horowitz, young and energetic and optimistic, with a project that is bold and timely and just might work.
Ms. Horowitz is the president of a new organization, based in New York, called Working Today. It is (or, more correctly, aspires to be) an employee lobby, an association of all types of workers modeled on the American Association of Retired Persons.
"It is open," said Ms. Horowitz, "to all those who work or want to work: professionals and service workers, managers and time-clock punchers, consultants, freelancers, and part-time and seasonal workers, as well as all those who are unemployed."
Downsized managers and part-time hamburger flippers (the distinction is not as great as it might seem; some individuals inhabit both roles) are among the millions of American workers adrift in the bewildering new world of employment. It is a world that increasingly favors the fortunate few at the very top.
For millions of others in all income groups the mere thought of the workplace can provoke anxiety and dread.
The smart set, obsessed by the impact of technology and the global economy, would have you believe there is not much that can be done to counter the humiliation of American workers. That mystical force called the market has spoken. The message is as follows: Bill Gates has an operating system that is more efficient than you, and Bangladesh has workers that are far cheaper than you.
Now what was that you said about a raise?
Ms. Horowitz and her colleagues, including Prof. Herbert J. Gans of Columbia University, who has been studying the problem of unemployment since the 1960's, offer a somewhat different message:
"That companies are able to shift from offering good jobs with benefits and security to offering poorly paid jobs with no benefits and no security is due, in part, to the absence of a strong voice from those who work."
Working Today hopes to remedy that by being an advocate on issues important to the 150 million workers or potential workers who have no unified national voice, and by providing practical services and advice to its members, who pay a $10 annual fee.
The organization, with headquarters at 25 West 43d Street, is in its earliest stages. But members are signing up, some foundation money is coming in, and Ms. Horowitz's plans are moving smartly ahead.
Some of the issues are obvious -- job creation, wage stagnation, the portability of health and pension benefits. Some are less obvious. People who work at home, for example, have to pay for office supplies, which can be hugely expensive. Working Today will try to find ways to pool resources and buy in bulk, thus providing discounts for its members.
Ms. Horowitz is a lawyer who recently finished a stint at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. She is a strong believer in civic participation and cooperation, and believes the same principles should be applied to the workplace.
"People are focusing so much as individuals, and they don't really have the organizations or institutions to bring them together," she said. "When these big problems like downsizing start happening, it's almost as if everyone sort of looks at each other and says, 'Now what?' "
An important goal of Working Today is to link individuals and groups from around the country that are already working on employee issues. "We're designing an Internet strategy," Ms. Horowitz said, adding, "We're trying very hard to reach people, to connect people and ideas."
She made it clear that advice and expertise and any other type of support would be welcome.
Working Today is a big project and worth rooting for.

HEADLINE: Rates to Rise 2% at Most Under Plan to Protect City Reservoirs

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Water rates will rise 1 to 2 percent, or less than $7 a year for the average residential customer, under a $1.2 billion plan bringing upstate and urban interests together to protect New York City's drinking water.
The plan, released yesterday, is intended to avert the need to build a multibillion-dollar filtration plant and promote nonpolluting economic development around the city's 19 upstate reservoirs. 
 Under the agreement, the city will try to triple its land holdings within the drainage basins that feed its reservoirs, spend $350 million on environmental protection projects for communities in those basins, and institute the first revisions in water protection rules since 1953.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said much of the cost of the program had been anticipated in the Department of Environmental Protection budget. Since the late 1980's the city has been facing a Federal ultimatum: Protect your water, or filter it. The added expense, the Mayor said, will be about $400 million over the next 10 years.
He added that the new rate increase, which takes effect in 1997, is a tiny fraction of the $8 billion that would have to be raised if increasing pollution forces New York City to build a filtration plant.
Satisfied with the new plan, Federal officials said they would delay until December 1999 any decision to order New York City to filter all of its water.
In a rare display of regional harmony, officials from the city, the state and the communities around the reservoirs stood shoulder to shoulder with environmentalists yesterday to announce the pact at a news conference at the World Trade Center.
Congratulating several dozen negotiators who had forged the agreement in 250 meetings over seven months, Gov. George E. Pataki said they had somehow found consensus "after years of fighting and lawsuits that literally threatened to tear this state apart and split it between upstate and downstate, between the city and the suburbs."
He added, "This was an issue in which people not only couldn't reach agreement, they couldn't even talk to each other."
The agreement entailed substantial compromises on all sides from positions staked out at the beginning of 1995.
A key component is a commitment by the city to spend $350 million to help local communities cut pollution in the watersheds and spur economic growth in many of the economically depressed communities in the Delaware River Valley and the Catskills, regions west of the Hudson River that together supply 90 percent of New York City's drinking water.
In return, the upstate communities agreed to drop several lawsuits and abide by new rules written by New York City governing everything from the installation of septic tanks to the creation of parking lots. The detailed package of rules is to be released in a month, city water officials said.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer for the Hudson Riverkeeper Fund, a private environmental group, said, "This partnership program is a recognition that we cannot have strong environmental protection if we don't also make sure that these communities have strong economies. That was an extraordinary philosophical step for the city to take."
Reflecting the dramatic change in the tone of the watershed debate, at the ceremony yesterday Mr. Kennedy, who for years had been openly reviled by many watershed residents, stood smiling alongside Anthony Bucca, the Supervisor for the Village of Hunter and a politician who once railed against New York City for trying to regulate how watershed towns buried their dead.
Any municipality can choose not to participate in the program, city water officials said, but would then not share in the economic development funds.
Along with the new rules and the funds for upstate development, the city added $60 million to the $201 million already set aside for expanding a buffer of city-owned land around its reservoirs.
In a major concession, the city agreed to forgo forcing landowners in those areas to sell through condemnation.
Watershed communities did not win veto power over proposed land deals, but will be allowed to review them and ask the state to assess whether a purchase is justified.
Eric Goldstein, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental group, criticized the land-purchase plan because it does not include a firm timetable and targets for acreage.
He also said the agreement will allow the flow of treated wastewater into the reservoirs to continue to increase, when more than half of the reservoirs are already overloaded with phosphorus and other unwanted nutrients.
Michael C. Finnegan, Mr. Pataki's counsel and the person credited with orchestrating the negotiations, said the Federal Government will monitor the water-protection effort until the summer of 2001 and will be able to demand changes if water quality declines.

HEADLINE: A Volley Over Chrysler Quality

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 2

 BODY:
A perverse computer can vaporize hours of work; a bad pair of contacts can strain the eyes. But a flawed car can do untold damage to the body or psyche.
And what intricate, vulnerable products they are: aggregates of some 30,000 bits and pieces, racked by thousands of explosions a minute, abused by weather and roads, controlled by one frequently neglectful mind. 
 Yet the disturbing truth is that customers and investors cannot pin down the quality of any model or company. Although the industry says it has made great strides in measuring itself, its public benchmarks of "quality" -- surely the most overworked, elastic term in the business -- are incomplete.
This fogginess is enveloping the dispute between the Chrysler Corporation and Kirk Kerkorian, its largest private shareholder. Mr. Kerkorian and his proxies have seized on Chrysler's reputation for shoddy vehicles as a wedge to split institutional investors from management, and perhaps to separate some managers from their jobs.
It is a handy tool, since Chrysler vehicles have been tarred for decades with an image for fits that don't, finishes that aren't, and little engines that can't. But company executives say this corrosive reputation is outdated.
Each side supports itself with popular yardsticks of quality. Spokesmen associated with Tracinda, Mr. Kerkorian's company, use them to bash Chrysler's cars, Chrysler to praise its light trucks and boast about how much better its cars score as they age. Chrysler also argues that the numbers do not reflect buyers' enthusiasm, which it says outweighs the aggravation caused by, say, too much wind noise or hard-to-adjust headrests.
"There is no other area in the field of human communications that is as rife with disinformation as the story on Chrysler quality," Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's president, declared in an interview.
The trouble is, neither side can prove its case, a standoff that will probably work to management's advantage. As Chrysler marshals its counterarguments, the dispute seems likely to blur, leaving Mr. Kerkorian without the cut-and-dried case that investors may insist on before ejecting managers and directors of a profitable company.
Consider the most widely used measure, the Initial Quality Survey conducted by J. D. Power & Associates. Jerome B. York, Mr. Kerkorian's chief strategist, turns the survey against Chrysler, saying it shows that "Chrysler has the second-lowest car quality among all manufacturers." Chrysler's cars did score a hefty 33 percent below the industry average for 1995 models.
Chrysler prefers to emphasize other findings: that its light trucks scored slightly better than average and better than those of the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation. Chrysler sells more mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickups than cars, and generally makes more profit on each one.
One reason for the low car scores is that Chrysler, like other manufacturers, has trouble switching to new models, and it has overhauled its car line in the last three years.
But the debate ignores a basic issue: the Power survey, though widely used in news reports and advertisements, is not intended to measure how vehicles hold up, surely a crucial issue for customers. It scores vehicles after 90 days, long before mufflers fall off or ashtrays flop open.
The study is widely credited with forcing auto companies to improve as-built quality sharply. But long-term quality at Chrysler could be better, or much worse, than the numbers reveal.
Mr. York, who has commented publicly on Chrysler's quality since he was hired by Mr. Kerkorian two months ago, declined to be interviewed on the record for this article.
Power also publishes a five-year survey, but it is rarely cited. In it, Chrysler scores below average. Mr. Kerkorian's group has not referred to that study, perhaps because one group member, Lee A. Iacocca, was running the company five years ago.
Within the Power numbers, variation is small. The best car on this year's initial quality survey, the Honda Prelude, scored 48, meaning that of 100 Preludes sold, owners complained about an average of 48 defects; one of Chrysler's mediocre performers, the Dodge Intrepid, scored 130, far worse than the industry average of 103. Stated one way, this suggests that the Intrepid's quality is, appallingly, nearly three times as bad as the Prelude's.
But if each Prelude averaged 0.48 defect, and each Intrepid averaged 1.30 defects, the gap averages out to about four-fifths of a defect. That is the same as the gap between Chrysler cars as a whole and those of Infiniti, Nissan's luxury division, which is the industry leader in the study. Four-fifths of a defect is doubtless enough to break some owners' hearts, but it may not be enough to sustain a shareholder revolt.
Chrysler's worst-performing car, the Eagle Talon, scored 217, lagging behind the Prelude by a far more substantial 1.69. Some Talons have a Chrysler engine and transmission, but the car is assembled by Mitsubishi in Illinois.
Stephen C. Goodall, senior partner at Power, acknowledged that the gap between domestic and Japanese companies had "substantially closed." But, he cautioned, "The funny thing is that customer expectations have also increased."
Chrysler insists that the Power numbers and studies by Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, do not capture owners' enthusiasm because they measure "things gone wrong," rather than "things gone right."
That's like analyzing a company "based purely on costs and not looking at the revenues," said Mr. Lutz, the Chrysler president. "What we have frankly focused on and strongly believe in is to minimize the things gone wrong -- i.e., the costs -- while maximizing the things gone right, to wit, the revenue."
That is a delicate balance; a dramatic curve that excites buyers may make a car's doors fit less snugly. Mr. Lutz argued that Chrysler makes the right trade-offs between solid, dull cars and sexy, temperamental ones. In between "is the sweet spot," he said, "and we've got it."
Chrysler's critics dismiss its talk about things gone right as an attempt to duck the quality issue.
But Chrysler says that because things are going right, owner loyalty -- how many owners buy another Chrysler vehicle -- has climbed to 57 percent from 46 percent five years ago. If its cars fall apart, Chrysler asks, why do people come back?
In tacit acknowledgment of such complaints, Power began a new survey in October that seeks to measure how pleased buyers are after four to five months of ownership. Power has released the names of only the top vehicles in several categories.
But Mr. Goodall said that over all Chrysler outscored Toyota, including its Lexus luxury division. Chrysler's cars did slightly better than Ford's, and worse than G.M.'s, he said. G.M.'s score is particularly impressive, given its recent reputation for building unreliable, unlovable clunkers.
As Chrysler defends itself to investors, its message appears to be sinking in. "All this stuff about quality is the most ridiculously overdone thing I have ever seen," said Seth Glickenhaus, the independent-minded chief of Glickenhaus & Company, a money management firm and large Chrysler shareholder.
Mr. Glickenhaus said Mr. Kerkorian was manipulating the press by harping on quality. "He nitpicks at this stuff and you people pick it up," he said.
But the other quality indicator that Mr. York has zeroed in on could anger shareholders. He said that Chrysler's warranty costs had jumped 50 percent since 1993, to $2 billion or more.
Without citing numbers, Chrysler acknowledges that costs have climbed, pointing to changes in its warranty coverage and to more sophisticated components that cost more to fix. The numbers show, it said, that warranty incidents have dropped. But for shareholders, the fact that Chrysler has fewer, more expensive claims is cold comfort.
Again, though, an apparently clear measure turns fuzzy. Mr. York appears to base his assertions about warranty costs on internal Chrysler documents. But since such costs are among the industry's most closely guarded secrets, comparisons are impossible. Industry analysts say Ford pays less per vehicle for warranty claims, but no public data support that.
Chrysler is walking a narrow line: insisting that its cars and trucks are competitive in quality with the best in the business, while trying to assure investors that quality is improving rapidly. Mr. Lutz goes out of his way to praise Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, who sits squarely in Mr. Kerkorian's cross hairs.
Mr. Lutz said Chrysler started "making quantum leaps in quality" with Mr. Eaton's arrival three years ago. Mr. Eaton has sharply increased spending on training, considered a key to quality, from $145 million in 1993 to just under $300 million this year. And he created a "Special Quality Fund" -- $100 million in each of the last two years -- to finance unusual quality-related improvements.
Such moves appear to be paying off. While Chrysler's cars do relatively poorly when introduced, after a year they score far better. In the 1995 initial-quality study, Chrysler had five of the nine-most-improved models.
Longer term, Chrysler is trying to discipline production. Modeled on the approach at Toyota, the "Chrysler Operating System" is supposed to break down each work station into a precise series of steps, encouraging workers to root out waste and wring out flaws.
Dennis Pawley, Chrysler's manufacturing chief, says the system will help Chrysler achieve its goal of being the world's "premier" auto company by the end of the decade. Down the road, Mr. Pawley says he hopes Chrysler workers will say that "what they did back in the late 1990's is the reason we're the company we are in the year 2030." They could well say exactly that -- whether or not Mr. Kerkorian wins his fight.

HEADLINE: Stocks Jump, With the Dow Up 41.91 to Another High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks rose sharply yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing to a new high, as weak economic data pushed up bond prices and reignited investors' hopes for lower interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 41.91 points, to 4,808.59, eclipsing its previous high of 4,802.45, reached on Oct. 19. 
 Leading the market higher were stocks closely tied to the performance of the economy, including transportation, technology and retail issues.
"The current thinking is that if interest rates drop, it's going to benefit the economy, and benefit the cyclical stocks first," said Thom Brown, market strategist at Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood in Philadelphia.
The Dow Jones transportation average shot up 60.56 points, or 3.15 percent, to close at 1,985.44. Among the biggest transportation gainers were Federal Express, up 4 1/8, to 86; and the CSX Corporation, up 3 5/8, to 85 3/4.
Technology stocks, which often move with the economy, were sharply higher as well, with the Nasdaq composite index climbing 16.82 points, to 1,057.32. The technology advance was led by Internet-related stocks like Netscape Communications, which surged 9 1/4, or 10 percent, to a record 98 1/4.
Stocks got a lift from bonds, which began climbing early in the session after the Labor Department said first-time claims for jobless benefits rose by 6,000 last week to a six-week high. Analysts had expected a slight drop and said the rise pointed to sluggish job growth.
The Commerce Department said orders to factories for durable goods rose 1.5 percent in September, in line with analysts' expectations. Manufacturing inventories rose.
Meanwhile, major retailers reported October chain-store sales were mostly weak, with a few notable exceptions. And separate reports from auto makers late Wednesday said car sales fell about 6 percent in October.
Taken together, analysts said the data could indicate that the economy was growing slowly enough to justify another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
Even some retail stocks, a cyclically vulnerable sector, weathered mixed reports on October sales to come out ahead. Dayton Hudson jumped 5 1/4, to 73 7/8; Gap surged 3 7/8, to 42 3/8; Kmart rose 1 1/8, to 9 1/2, and and Wal-Mart rose 1 1/4, to 23 1/2.
"When sales slow and inventories are high, that combination puts the lid on the manufacturing sector," said Hugh Johnson, the First Albany Corporation's market strategist. "That means we can continue to grow, but growth will be very moderate. I'm having trouble having something wrong with this picture."
The market's surge was broad based, with advancing issues leading decliners by more than 16 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 397.1 million shares, up from 378.1 million shares on Wednesday.
Among other indicators, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.50 points, to 589.72; the Big Board's composite index rose 2.67 points, to 313.69, and the American Stock Exchange's, market value index rose 5.40, to 528.04.
Big gainers on the New York Stock Exchange included I.B.M., up 2 3/4, to 99 5/8; Motorola, up 2 1/4, to 67 1/4, and Advanced Micro Devices, up 1/2, to 23 1/4. In Nasdaq trading, Intel led in volume and rose 2, to 72 7/8, a day after it introduced its new Pentium Pro chip.
Leading the surge in Internet-related stocks was Spyglass, a software maker, which soared 13 3/4, to 70 1/2, after it posted stronger-than-expected results late Wednesday. Other Internet gainers included UNET, up 5 3/4, to 67, and Netcom On-Line, up 5 1/8, to 68 5/8.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Rise On Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose for the third time in as many days yesterday, as traders gained solace from soft chain store sales reports and talk of softer numbers to describe how many jobs were added to the nation's payrolls last month.
Investors bought on rising expectations of a Fed easing sometime soon, with December likely. 
 The initial rise in prices came from on an unexpected jump in the weekly initial jobless claims report for the week ended Saturday. Claims increased 6,000 over the previous week to 365,000. Economists had forecast a slightly lower 356,000 reading.
By the close of the New York market the current issue 30-year Treasury bond was up 24/32 , to a price of 108 17/32 to yield 6.24 percent, down from 6.29 percent on Wednesday.
Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said the market remained in a bullish mood and it was hard to find anything that would keep it down at the moment. "It has been impressive the way it has ignored even strong data, and rallied considerably on any signs of weakness," she said.
"I think the market is putting all its chips on a Fed easing and ignoring the particulars coming from a budget agreement, since the impact wouldn't be felt for a couple of years at least," Ms. Rupert said.
Retailing companies that report same-store sales on the first Thursday of every month reported weak numbers yesterday, analysts said, and that may have helped raise expectations of a weak retail sales report for October due on Nov. 14. Market participants say it gives the Fed a stronger case for an easing down the line.
The Commerce Department said September factory orders were up 1.5 percent, which was lower than expected and down from the August gain of 2.7 percent. The Conference Board's help-wanted index fell 4 points, to 126 in September. While the level is still respectable, analysts say, the direction was enough to fuel perception of a sluggish job market, especially considering the rise in the weekly initial jobless claims yesterday and forecasts for a payroll gain of less than 100,000 in today's employment number.
The Conference Board added that job growth had softened after the spring/summer gains.
Jay Goldinger of Capital Insight, Beverly Hills, Calif., said: "On a day when everybody is bullish, I may be the only voice of cautiousness here. The unemployment picture obviously gets painted tomorrow. No matter what the news is tomorrow, I think we're going to have sellers in the market."
The mentality of the bond market right now, he said, is very similar to that of the stock market, which is to buy on every dip, and within a week you have a profit.
"The market is probably a little frothy and over done," Mr. Goldinger said, "and no matter what the news is tomorrow, the market is set up for some selling."
Larry Berman, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data, Boston, forecast some profit taking would occur. "We have reached short-term targets on a yield basis at 6.25 percent, and that should add some selling pressure by position traders" who expect to take profits at these levels, he said.
He said the longer-term picture remained very bullish for a move to the 6 percent level, but cautioned that it would not be an easy ride, as the Government faces several key economic issues, including the debt ceiling and budget problems.
Since next week's note auction dates are not concrete because no debt ceiling has been passed, there has not been any when-issued trading, but in the cash market the current three-year note is yielding 5.52 percent and the 10-year note, 5.88 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of new 48-day and 83-day cash management bills, which the Government occasionally sells to meet cash flow shortages when it needs to meet interest payments.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Kept Rising In September, but Rate Slowed

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
The Commerce Department said today that strong demand for commercial aircraft pushed factory orders higher in September, though the orders grew at only half the rate recorded in August.
The report added to signs that the manufacturing economy is slowing under the weight of bulging supplies of goods, with caution evident ahead of the holiday shopping season. 
 September orders increased 1.5 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $306.5 billion, down from a revised 2.7 percent gain in August.
The figure was heavily influenced by aircraft orders, which are received infrequently and cost millions of dollars. Excluding transportation, which includes aircraft and parts, orders rose only two-tenths of 1 percent after an August rise of nine-tenths of 1 percent.
In another worrisome sign, inventories mounted in September for a 12th consecutive month.
"The manufacturing sector is still struggling to come out of this inventory correction," Astrid Adolfson, an economist with MCM Moneywatch in New York, said. "As long as they're struggling, they're likely to choose to extend their workweeks when they need to and to be cautious about hiring."
Underlining that trend, the Labor Department reported today that the number of workers applying for state unemployment benefits climbed by 6,000 last week.
New claims for unemployment pay in the week ended Saturday rose to a seasonally adjusted 365,000 -- the highest in six weeks and more than the 356,000 that had been forecast.
In another sign that job prospects were scarcer, the Conference Board said its index of help-wanted ads dipped in September from August. "After rising through the spring and early summer, want-ad volume has softened," Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, said.
The Commerce Department report showed that durable goods orders, which account for more than half of total factory business, rose 3 percent in September to $168.9 billion. Orders for nondurable items like food, clothing and paper products weakened one-tenth of 1 percent, to $137.6 billion in September.
Transportation equipment orders posted the largest rise, up 10.6 percent after a 17.6 percent jump in August. Shipments of motor vehicles and parts rose just 3.1 percent in September after a 16.5 percent increase in August.
Hugh Johnson, an economist with First Albany, said that the factory-orders report strongly implied the overall economy was slowing and would continue to do so.
"There was a third-quarter buildup in inventories that simply is unsustainable, and it's going to require both production and employment cutbacks," Mr. Johnson said.
Manufacturing inventories rose six-tenths of 1 percent, to $415.6 billion, in September after an August increase or two-tenths of 1 percent.
Shipments of manufactured goods, which reflect more immediate demand than orders, rose four-tenths of 1 percent in September after a much stronger August increase of 3.3 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Indictment of Daiwa Produces Spurt in Already Rising Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar surged past 104 Japanese yen yesterday after Daiwa Bank of Japan was indicted on charges of conspiring to deceive American regulators.
The dollar, which had been steadily rising all day, jumped in afternoon trading in New York after the first reports that Federal and state banking regulators had ordered Daiwa to cease all operations in the United States. 
 Currency traders saw the situation as a sign of deep-seated problems among Japan's banks. New trouble in the Japanese banking industry, they said, could further strengthen the dollar against the yen by prompting sales of the Japanese currency. "We're going to know more about the Japanese banking system in this one incident than at any other time," said Marybeth Slack of MCM Currency Watch.
Weakness in the Japanese banking system could lead to increased sales of the yen against the dollar, as Japanese investors seek safety in more stable, and better yielding, investments overseas.
Yesterday, the dollar rose as high as 104.13 yen -- its highest level since Sept. 20, when it touched 104.65 yen -- before settling at 104.02 yen, up from 103.32 late Wednesday. The dollar also increased to 1.4232 German marks from 1.4177 marks and to 1.1457 Swiss francs from 1.1355 francs. The British pound edged up to $1.5788 from $1.5783.
The dollar has been strong in recent days on growing optimism that Japanese buyers were moving funds overseas. "Japanese investors want to buy foreign-currency bonds," said Toshio Sako, chief dealer at Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank. "The reason is they fear the Japanese economy is still not good."
The dollar also benefited from strength in other European currencies against the mark. Dealers said investors seemed confident that political trouble in France and Italy had eased and felt more comfortable putting money into their high-yielding assets.
"Some of the pressures in Europe have subsided and have taken some of the upward pressure off the German mark," said Bob Lynch, currency analyst at MMS International. "That's giving dollar-mark a little bit of breathing room."
The Mexican peso did not trade yesterday as financial markets were closed for the Day of the Dead, a holiday dating from pre-colonial times, when Mexicans pay tribute to their departed ancestors. The holiday provided a breather for the recently slumping peso, which has also weighed down the dollar.

HEADLINE: Rosalind Cash, 56, at Home on Stage and Screen

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
Rosalind Cash, an original member of the Negro Ensemble Company and one of its most vibrant and versatile actresses, died on Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 56.
The cause was cancer, said her agent, John Sekura. 
 Although she was best known for her acting in naturalistic dramas like Lonne Elder 3d's "Ceremonies in Dark Old Men," Ms. Cash was equally at home in musicals and in classics, portraying Goneril to James Earl Jones's King Lear for the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1973.
Before joining the Negro Ensemble Company in 1968, Ms. Cash had a widely diverse career, singing in nightclubs and performing Off Broadway (in "Junebug Graduates Tonight!" at the Chelsea Theater Center) and on Broadway (in "The Wayward Stork"). Cast in "The Great White Hope" at the Arena Stage in Washington, she decided to forgo that play, and paid the Arena the equivalent of two weeks' salary so she could return to New York to join the new black theater company.
In the first season of the Negro Ensemble Company, she was featured in "The Song of the Lusitanian Bogey" by Peter Weiss, Wole Soyinka's "Kongi's Harvest" and Richard Wright's "Sweet Daddy Goodness." In "Ceremonies in Dark Old Men" the next year, Douglas Turner Ward played a barber facing economic hardship. Ms. Cash was his strong-minded daughter, the family's principal wage-earner. The role remained a hallmark of her career, and in 1975 she repeated it in the ABC television version.
After her initial success, she moved back and forth between theater and films. In 1980 she returned to the Negro Ensemble Company to appear in "The 16th Round" by Samm-Art Williams.
In Hollywood, she repeatedly battled stereotype. Calling herself "a one-lady movement," she was not afraid to speak her mind, realizing that as an actress, "if you yell loud enough, someone will listen." Her movies included "Klute," "The Omega Man," "Hickey and Boggs," "The New Centurions," "Uptown Saturday Night" and "Wrong Is Right" (in which she played the first black woman to become Vice President of the United States). In 1995, she was in "Tales From the 'Hood."
On television she appeared in Melvin van Peebles's "Sophisticated Gents," Maya Angelou's "Sister, Sister," "A Killing Affair" and the American Playhouse adaptation of James Baldwin's "Go Tell It on the Mountain." She was Mary Mae Ward on the soap opera "General Hospital."
Ms. Cash was born in Atlantic City and attended City College of New York.
She is survived by a sister, Helen Cash Jackson, and two brothers, Jack and Robert.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Discreetly or Scrappily, They Defied the Soviet Line

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
Chapter by chapter, the story of Soviet art in this century has been told in recent exhibitions, and it turns out to be Tolstoyan. Its first part, meaning the revolutionary years when Lenin and company denounced everything associated with Russia's czarist past, unfolded in events like "The Great Utopia" at the Guggenheim Museum. The P.S. 1 Museum in Queens presented paintings from the next era, the years when Stalin denounced the art of the revolution. Those paintings came from the basements of Russian museums to which they had been exiled when Khrushchev denounced Stalin in 1956.
Thirty years or so later, the Soviet people took matters into their own hands and denounced the whole lot of them. About the art of that volatile period in between, meaning the decades from Khrushchev's 1956 speech to the unraveling of the Soviet empire that began in the late 1980's, there have been occasional shows, but no major survey. Until now. 
 With the donation by Norton and Nancy Dodge of 12,000 works of so-called nonconformist art to the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University, in New Brunswick, N.J., it is possible for the first time to look in depth at what the artists who refused to toe the line in the Soviet Union were doing during those momentous years. The first installment of several hundred works from the collection has just gone on view.
Mr. Dodge is an American professor of Soviet economics who, beginning in the 1960's, managed to smuggle vast numbers of sometimes very big paintings and sculptures out of the Soviet Union. Precisely how he did so, not to say how he managed to pay for them, remains something of a mystery, which, as John McPhee writes in "The Ransom of Russian Art," a new book about Mr. Dodge and his collection, seems to be the way Mr. Dodge wants it. In any event, what matters is his heroic effort, and the unparalleled breadth of what he acquired.
Breadth is not quality, and as Mr. Dodge admits, the quality of his collection varies. You have only to see the careful selection of works by Ilya Kabakov, Leonid Lamm, Ernst Neizvestny and Oskar Rabin, to name a few artists who are in the "Russian Jewish Artists" show now at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan, to realize that important figures are not always represented at their very best at the Zimmerli. But this is what you would expect even of a private collection as formidable as the one the Dodges put together, and it is worth mentioning only because their collection is so big it might be mistaken for the last word on nonconformist art. It is not, though it clearly makes the Zimmerli, and so the New York area, all at once a major center for the study of late Soviet art.
If the study of late Soviet art sounds like an arcane pursuit, it shouldn't. Counting Soviet Socialist Realism, Hitler's fascist art and the art of Communist China, totalitarian art may have as much of a claim on the cultural identity of this century as high modernism does. Which means the reaction against it, by nonconformists in totalitarian states, has historical significance, too. We in the West tend to dismiss much nonconformist art as merely derivative, too much like Cezanne or Pollock. But the nonconformists thought in terms of artists like Isaak Brodsky and other official painters and sculptors conscripted by Soviet leaders to extol the virtues of Communism. Context is everything, and while our context is modernism, for the nonconformists it was not. Or more precisely, modernism signified something different to them than it does to us: among other things, it signified political resistance of a kind Pollock, at least, never intended.
It will take a while, then, for us to learn how best to interpret nonconformist Soviet art. The installation at the Zimmerli is divided into familiar categories like Surrealism, religious art, geometric abstraction and primitivism, none of them acceptable to a regime that sanctioned Socialist Realism and nothing else. But the categories aren't altogether precise. You may wonder, as I did, what the difference is between Assemblage, say, and the Art and Object section next to it, or what to make of artists who appear in several different sections. Which is not meant to slight the Zimmerli's largely straightforward effort at organization so much as to underscore the notion that nonconformist art ultimately may make most sense when it does not conform to our own expectations.
Many of the artists themselves have made clear they prefer "nonconformist" to "dissident" or "underground," because those words imply a level of political engagement that wasn't always the case. Some artists, like Mr. Lamm, were indeed sent to prison. Others were forced into exile. Yevgeny Rukhin, one of the leading nonconformist painters, died in a mysterious fire. But many artists went about their business as discreetly as possible on the fringes of Soviet society, sometimes getting money and materials by working as illustrators for children's books, or being supported by their wives. (Nonconformist female artists seem to have been rare, and often worked as official artists to support themselves and their husbands.) Some artists clearly made a little money selling art on the sly to Mr. Dodge. But most just showed their modest works surreptitiously to friends in cramped apartments, as they had no access to public exhibition spaces, much less to the art market.
For a while, during a thaw after Khrushchev's 1956 speech, exhibitions of work by Picasso and other European and American modernists were permitted in the Soviet Union. The thaw prompted a generation of independent-minded Soviet citizens to explore styles and subjects that had been banned under Stalin. This period of official tolerance lasted only until Khrushchev visited a show of contemporary Soviet art in Moscow in 1962 and concluded that a little freedom had been too much freedom. Another crackdown ensued, but by then there was no way to make people unlearn what they had learned. The nonconformists were around to stay.
Occasionally during the next years they would organize hit-and-run shows, which the authorities would shut down as quickly as possible (one show lasted 15 minutes). And when several nonconformist painters displayed their works on a vacant lot in a Moscow suburb in 1974, the authorities sent in bulldozers and water cannons. Yet even these repressive measures couldn't undo the nonconformists, not least because Western journalists' accounts of events like the "bulldozer exhibition," as it came to be called, gave the artists precisely the exposure that the authorities had tried to quash.
One of the paradoxes of life in the Soviet Union was that fact and fiction were reversed. The authorities claimed Socialist Realism depicted real life there, but of course it was fantasy. On the other hand, when nonconformists made works that dealt explicitly with the hardships that Soviet citizens had to endure, they were condemned as decadent fantasists. No wonder, in this Alice Through the Looking Glass existence, that irony became a favorite mode of artistic expression. Which partly explains the triumph of so-called Sots artists like Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid, with their tongue-in-cheek remakes of official art, and of Conceptualists like Viktor Pivovarov, Vadim Zakharov and Mr. Kabakov.
Mr. Kabakov's art has achieved a certain fashion in the West during the last decade, aided by the resurgence of Conceptual art here. Which is interesting, since what is largely distinctive about his nonconformist work, like much other Soviet Conceptualism, is how much it deals with the specific facts of Soviet life: how local the art is. For example, Mr. Kabakov's "Where Are They?" in the Dodge collection is a series of pages on which are neatly printed, in Russian, of course, lists of familiar objects along with the names of old and sometimes lost friends and colleagues, followed by the phrase "they are not . . . " You can regard the work as Dadaist, maybe, or Minimalist, if you think in terms of Western models. But with its anonymous visual style and the almost incantatory sameness of its prose, it is really a moving commentary on everyday Soviet existence -- though only if you know Mr. Kabakov's context to start with.
Many of the nonconformist works of the 70's and 80's, not just Mr. Kabakov's, involved language, which makes sense considering Russia's great literary heritage. Other Conceptualist works entailed performances that seem indebted to the tradition of Meyerhold and early Soviet theater. There's a Russian source for abstract paintings like those by Eduard Shteinberg, too ( whose pictures are at both the Zimmerli and the Jewish Museum), namely the art of Malevich and the Constructivists.
I belabor the parochialism of these works because the question arises: In the absence of a Soviet foe, and with the diaspora of nonconformists since the Soviet Union's collapse, what is to distinguish the artists today? Soviet existence, in its grim insularity, also turned out to be a creative hothouse. But now what? The essayist Joseph Bakshtein, in the catalogue to the Zimmerli show, writes that the drama of the nonconformist's life has become "the realization that if one were to speak of paradise in Russia, it would exist not 'now' but 'then.' "
Which seems oddly right: after all, it's one thing to make art that derives its edge from opposition to the status quo. But it's something else altogether to make art in the absence of that opposition. And many nonconformist artists evidently have yet to figure out what it means, in a sense, to be conformist. So while the story of Soviet art may now be over, there are clearly chapters still to be written about once-Soviet artists.
"From Gulag to Glasnost: Nonconformist Art From the Soviet Union" is a permanent display of works from the Dodge Collection at the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. The museum is at the intersection of George and Hamilton Streets in New Brunswick. "Russian Jewish Artists in a Century of Change, 1890-1990" remains at the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92d Street, in Manhattan, through Jan. 28.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Tries to Calm Any 'Financial Anxiety'

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Nov. 3

 BODY:
The Japanese Government moved immediately today to prevent possible panic over sanctions against Daiwa Bank Ltd. from spreading to the rest of Japan's banking system.
"I hope there will be no damage to the confidence in the Japanese financial system," Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura told Japanese television this morning. "We will make every effort to restrain the spread of financial anxiety." 
 The Bank of Japan also said it was ready to provide Daiwa with money if liquidity problems arose. Japanese financial authorities also seemed to be playing a behind-the-scenes role in encouraging discussions about a possible merger between Daiwa Bank and Sumitomo Bank, one of the country's largest institutions.
The growing concerns about Daiwa come a day after Daiwa was indicted in the United States for its involvement in a trading scandal and ordered to close its operations there. Today, Japan's Finance Ministry ordered Daiwa to scale back its other international operations sharply.
Toshio Morikawa, Sumitomo's president, said this morning that his bank had not held detailed discussions with Daiwa about a merger. But he added that "in the process of the support, if both banks agree, we may discuss it," Mr. Morikawa said.
Sumitomo agreed today to take over at least some of Daiwa's operations in New York and Los Angeles. Daiwa said Nomura Securities, the world's largest brokerage house, had also agreed to help it dispose of its American operations.
The American actions against Daiwa come against a backdrop of growing financial problems for Japanese banks, which have been increasingly shaken by billions of dollar in bad real estate loans and a sluggish domestic economy. The Japanese financial community seemed stunned and sobered by Daiwa's latest setbacks.
The Federal Reserve's order to close Daiwa's American operations and the bank's indictment could result in more problems for other Japanese banks. Foreign banks have already been tightening up on loans to Japanese banks, and the actions by American authorities are likely to intensify these problems and could lead to liquidity problems.
Some analysts said that the stiff measures by American regulators could act as a wake-up call to Japanese financial authorities to take swifter action to rescue Japan's banks.
"It is a shock for the financial system and the authorities, and also a bit of an offense," said Richard A. Werner, chief economist at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. "But if they feel a bigger sense of crisis, they may clean up this mess in the financial system."
Daiwa was ordered by the Finance Ministry to cut back its international operations because of violations of Japan's foreign exchange, trust banking and banking laws. Daiwa will have to shrink its foreign exchange activities by October next year, but the Kyodo News Service said that the ministry would suspend Daiwa's foreign exchange trading activities at both its New York branch and at its headquarters in Osaka.
The ministry also ordered Daiwa not to open any new foreign branches.
Daiwa's new chairman, Takashi Kaiho, said he was arranging to have Daiwa's American branches transferred to Sumitomo, although he and other Daiwa executives did not release details about the arrangements. Japanese press reports, however, said that Daiwa executives believed that a merger with Sumitomo "is possible."
The Finance Ministry also told Daiwa to to reduce the balance of its international lending and cut its securities holdings in international operations. Daiwa has international loans outstanding of $25 billion and securities held overseas of $5 billion, but apparently only $4.5 billion of those assets are actually held in the United States, the Finance Ministry said today.
Daiwa said that its chairman, Sumio Abekawa, will step down immediately, rather than sometime in March as it had said earlier. Mr. Abekawa, however, will remain as an adviser to the bank.
In the last few weeks, much speculation has focused on how the $1.1 billion loss by Toshihide Iguchi, a bond trader in Daiwa's New York office, would affect the overall reputation of Daiwa in Japan. Some financial specialists have said that Daiwa's name has been so sullied that it would be better off merging with another Japanese institution.
Daiwa also announced a reorganization of its worldwide operations, which would include closing all branches in the United States and consolidate or shrink its branch in London and elsewhere in Europe. While it said it plans to expand in Asia, it will also close down branches in Seoul and Malaysia.

HEADLINE: Gaffney Holds Lead in Suffolk Race

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., Nov. 2

 BODY:
In his four years as Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney has often faded into the background, overshadowed by an aggressive County Legislature and a combative, colorful District Attorney.
But when brush fires swept across the heart of eastern Long Island two months ago, Mr. Gaffney took center stage, marshaling firefighters and appearing hourly on live news reports from the front lines. 
 It was the perfect opportunity to counteract charges by his opponent, Tony Bullock, that he is a a do-nothing official, too laid back to be an effective manager.
When it was over, Mr. Gaffney, with flags waving and bands playing, led tens of thousands of thankful Suffolk residents -- and voters -- in a daylong celebration honoring the firefighters.
Whatever the impact of the fires on his image, Mr. Gaffney enters the final days of his re-election campaign with a solid 2-to-1 lead over Mr. Bullock in a Newsday poll.
It is a race that defies stereotypes. Mr. Gaffney, the Republican, was raised in a family of Democrats from Brooklyn; his father was a telephone worker. Mr. Bullock, the Democrat, is from a Republican family. He grew up on Manhattan's Upper East Side, attended St. Paul's School in New Hampshire and graduated from Yale University.
Mr. Gaffney, 51, a lawyer and a former F.B.I. agent, said he had done a good job turning the county government around, charging that his Democratic predecessor, Patrick G. Halpin, had left the county "in absolute chaos."
"Our economy was in shambles," he said, "the bond rating had been reduced to below investment grade, the Police Department had not been tended to in years, the Department of Social Services was literally hemorrhaging taxpayers' dollars, and taxes had been increased by 160 percent in some areas. But four years later, we have made dramatic progress in all these areas.
"The bond rating is up, we've had four consecutive balanced budgets, the Police Department has a record number of officers on the streets, Social Services has become a model for agencies throughout the country."
"If re-elected," he said, "I would do much the same and continue to cut costs where possible in hopes of reducing taxes."
Not surprisingly, Mr. Bullock paints a far less rosy picture, accusing Mr. Gaffney of increasing county spending by $365 million since he took office "through waste, patronage and gross mismanagement."
Mr. Bullock, 38, who has served four two-year terms as Supervisor of East Hampton, said Mr. Gaffney had failed to keep his promises to lower the county's 8.5 percent sales tax, the highest in the country, and to cut the Long Island Lighting Company's electric rates, also the highest in the country.
"Bob Gaffney does a lousy John Wayne imitation about Lilco, but the truth there is that Lilco rates have gone up every year he's been in office," Mr. Bullock said.
While both candidates know that attacking Lilco is a sure way to reach voters, they also know that whoever is elected on Nov. 7 will be facing an $80 million bill from Lilco for overpayment of property taxes on the decommissioned Shoreham nuclear power plant.
Mr. Bullock says that had Mr. Gaffney fought to pay the Lilco refund sooner, he would have saved on interest that could increase the bill to $400 million. Mr. Gaffney, in turn, blames the County Legislature, controlled by his fellow Republicans, for refusing to issue bonds for the $80 million. Mr. Gaffney also said he hoped that a public-private takeover of Lilco, now being studied by the state, would spare Suffolk from paying Lilco the refund.
Mr. Bullock said his first step toward cutting county spending would be "an honest budget that does not hide expenditures, misstate expected revenues and mislead taxpayers."
One of Mr. Gaffney's biggest mistakes, he said, "was his failure to reinvigorate economic development."
"For example, I'd like to encourage film production," he said. "Hollywood is moving east and we're ideally suitable for studios to make their home here. I'd also like the county to lead in the construction of a convention center and a baseball stadium here. We've got the sites and the location and the fans. We just need the leadership to move ahead on this."
Mr. Bullock said he was confident that he could overcome Mr. Gaffney's lead, even though Republicans outnumber Democrats in Suffolk by 2 to 1.
"As a Democrat, I'm well aware of the odds," he said. "And I have won seven elections against those odds."
Although his backers include entertainment industry heavyweights like Steven Spielberg, Alec Baldwin and Billy Joel, Mr. Bullock has raised only about $500,000, far shy of the $2.5 million campaign war chest provided by the well-organized Suffolk County Republican Committee.
To date, Mr. Gaffney has outspent Mr. Bullock by almost 4 to 1, spending $100,000 a week just for television advertising. Mr. Bullock said he was saving the bulk of his funds for a blitz this week.
An issue that greatly separates the two candidates is Mr. Gaffney's proposed a $1.6 billion budget for 1996, which promises a tax cut of up to 3 percent for some residents. Mr. Bullock contends that the budget figures are wrong and that taxes will rise 7 percent next year because of a $17 million deficit.
Mr. Gaffney defended his budget figures and questioned Mr. Bullock's fiscal record. "What Tony hasn't told you is that he's increased taxes in the Town of East Hampton in five consecutive years."
Republican Party officials say Mr. Bullock is not serious about running for county executive, but is laying the groundwork for a race for Congress against Michael Forbes, a Republican and a strong supporter of House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
But Mr. Bullock said: "I'm not running for Congress. I'm running for County Executive, and I'm going to beat Bob Gaffney."

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
A Front-Runner's Commercial

 BODY:

BODY: Broadcasts of Senator Bob Dole's first campaign commercial in Iowa, site of the first Presidential primary, begin on Friday. It will later run in other states, including New Hampshire. The 30-second commercial, titled "Historic Conservative Reforms," contrasts Mr. Dole's conservative record with what the advertisement portrays as President Clinton's liberalism.
 
PRODUCER: Stuart Stevens, The Stuart Stevens Group.
 
ON THE SCREEN: The commercial starts with a still picture of Mr. Clinton taking the oath of office in 1993 with his wife, Hillary, looking on. On top of the photograph are the words, "Liberal Agenda." Under it appears a text saying "largest tax increase," "huge spending increases" and "government-run health care." The scene shifts to Mr. Dole, smiling and waving, amid a group of well-scrubbed young people waving American flags, smiling or working in a manufacturing plant. Under these scenes is a text ticking off what the commercial calls "conservative reforms" for which Mr. Dole takes credit: "middle-class tax cuts," "balanced-budget plan" and "real welfare reform."
 
TELEVISION SCRIPT: Announcer: "From Day 1, Bill Clinton shocks America with his liberal agenda -- the largest tax increase in history, huge spending increases, government-run health care. Bob Dole leads the fight against the Clinton agenda. Dole rallies the nation and Congress passes historic conservative reforms: true middle-class tax cuts, the first balanced-budget plan in a generation and real welfare reform, putting people back to work."
The spot ends with a close-up of Mr. Dole addressing a campaign rally in an emphatic voice. "I am not afraid to lead, and I know the way," he says.
 
ACCURACY: It is not true that the $240 billion tax increase approved by Congress in 1993 at Mr. Clinton's behest is the largest in American history. When adjusted for inflation -- the only way to make comparisons of dollar amounts from different years -- a tax increase engineered by Mr. Dole in 1982, when he was the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was larger. Mr. Dole's claim to have rallied the nation to get Congress to pass several conservative proposals is also dubious. It was Speaker Newt Gingrich, not Mr. Dole, who largely developed the conservative agenda known as the Contract With America.
 
SCORECARD: This is clearly a front-runner's commercial, made for a candidate so far ahead of his rivals for the Republican nomination they may need a bloodhound to pick up his scent. Mr. Dole makes no mention of the other Republican contenders, instead attacking Mr. Clinton -- whom he refers to as "Bill Clinton," rather than by his title of President -- as if the general election campaign has already begun. In keeping with this strategy, Mr. Dole's tag line seeks to contrast what he claims is his steady, focused leadership with Mr. Clinton's purported flip-flopping style.

HEADLINE: Panel Seeks U.S. Pledge on Bosnia War Criminals

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
The international tribunal on war crimes in Bosnia has formally asked the United States to make the surrender of indicted suspects a condition for any peace accord, a tribunal official said today. It also plans to indict 30 more people by the end of the year.
The commission is investigating whether Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, or any other Serbian officials are implicated in war crimes, the official said. 
 While the panel's actions and its request about the surrender of suspected war criminals have no direct effects on the peace talks that began on Tuesday in Dayton, Ohio, they could complicate the negotiators' already difficult task.
Two of the central figures in the Balkan crisis, Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military commander, and Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader, already face war crimes indictments. It seemed unlikely that the Bosnian Serbs would accept any accord under which the two would have to be turned over to prosecutors.
As President of Serbia, the dominant partner in what remains of federal Yugoslavia, Mr. Milosevic is regarded by American officials as an instrumental figure in the peace talks among Balkan leaders at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. "We cannot deny that he is a suspect," the tribunal official said, referring to Mr. Milosevic. "He is a suspect. So are many others."
Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the Secretary of State in the waning days of the Bush Administration, asserted nearly three years ago that Mr. Milosevic and several other high-ranking Serbian and Croatian officials were possibly war criminals. He cited their "political or command responsibility" in connection with the Bosnian Serbs' early "ethnic cleansing" campaigns against Bosnian Muslims.
No charges have been brought against Mr. Milosevic, but the United Nations tribunal has indicted 43 Bosnian Serb and Croatian officials for war crimes. The July 24 indictment of General Mladic and Dr. Karadzic focused on their leadership role in the "ethnic cleansing" and reported massacres and organized rapes that marked the first months of the Bosnian war.
Senior Clinton Administration officials have publicly and emphatically insisted in recent days that there will be no amnesty for those charged with war crimes in Bosnia.
Indicted war criminals, the White House officials say, will not be allowed to run for office in any post-war election the United States supervises. Any country that harbors war criminals, they say, will not be allowed to participate in international organizations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, or the United Nations. At best, General Mladic and Dr. Karadzic can hope to be exiles in their homeland.
But American officials say privately that the Dayton talks may not go as far in guaranteeing the arrest of indicted war crimes suspects as the tribunal has asked. Administration officials say they have drafted proposals for all sides to cooperate with the war crimes inquiries. But the refusal of one to do so, one official said, would not be a "show stopper."
"We 're going to do as much as is realistic," one official said. "We're not going to take on a mission that may be unachievable and make it hostage to the larger peace settlement."
The tribunal's hopes that the United States would make war crimes prosecutions a cornerstone of any peace deal were conveyed in a letter from Richard J. Goldstone, the chief prosecutor for the United Nations commission, to Madeleine K. Albright, the American delegate to the United Nations, American officials said.
The letter also raised questions about whether the United States had turned over all of the evidence it had gathered about reported recent Bosnian Serb atrocities after the fall of the United Nations-designated "safe area" of Srebrenica. American officials say they have handed over all its evidence.
Administration officials said that a host of questions about the handling of war crimes remain unresolved.
Mr. Milosevic has told American officials, for example, that he will arrange for Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic to leave the political stage in Bosnia. But that does not address the question of where the two Bosnian Serb leaders would live. American officials said that if Serbia itself harbored war criminals, Belgrade would not be eligible for the international aid it needs to rebuild its economy.
But what if the two Bosnian Serb leaders remain as residents of the newly-created Bosnian Serb autonomous region within Bosnia? American officials say the sanctions would apply to the Bosnian Serb province as long as it gave refuge to war criminals.
The American officials added, however, that it was not yet clear how such economic pressure could be applied to one part of what is supposed to be a unified Bosnia.
The war crimes tribunal was created by the United Nations, and all members are obliged to arrest anyone charged under its authority. That means Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic have a very limited number of nations to which they could flee.
It is not clear how much progress the tribunal has made in its investigation of Mr. Milosevic. The United States has shared highly classified intelligence data with the tribunal, some of it with the proviso that it only be used to develop other leads.
The tribunal official said that a case against an incumbent president would have to be able to withstand "international scrutiny" and could only be based on the testimony of eyewitnesses who would be available for cross-examination and testimony in open court.
This is particularly difficult in the case of political leaders like Mr. Milosevic who might be charged with "political or command responsibility" for war crimes.
There has been speculation since the Bosnian war began in April 1992 about the role of Mr. Milosevic and the Belgrade-based military officers who provided crucial assistance to the fledgling Bosnian Serb army.
A former American official said the evidence provided to the United Nations in 1992 by Mr. Eagleburger suggested that the Bosnian Serbs' "ethnic cleansing" campaign of Muslim areas of Bosnia had been coordinated by military leaders in Belgrade. The documents, this official said, included intercepts of conversations on military radio networks.
Earlier this year, American and European officials disclosed that the Yugoslav Army, over which Mr. Milosevic has political authority, was continuing to funnel materiel and other essential supplies to their Serbian comrades in Bosnia.
There has been speculation in Washington that the tribunal was delaying its indictment of Mr. Milosevic at the request of American officials eager to work out a peace settlement. The tribunal official adamantly denied that charge.
"There's been no political interference at any level," the tribunal official said. "We're targeting all the people we regard as potentially responsible for the crimes."
One issue that has been settled, American officials said, was whether the international force sent to monitor the peace accord will make an active effort to find and arrest war crime suspects inside Bosnia. They will not.
Senior officials said a war crimes suspect like General Mladic would be arrested only if the peacekeeping troops came across them in their normal duties, such as manning checkpoints or patrolling roads.
"If they were to encounter war criminals, they would have the authority to arrest them, but they're not going to comb the countryside and track down war criminals," one official said.
 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 4, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about the international tribunal on war crimes in Bosnia referred incorrectly to correspondence between the tribunal and the United States Government. A confidential letter asking that any peace accord compel cooperation with the tribunal's inquiries was sent to Madeleine K. Albright, the American delegate to the United Nations, by the tribunal's president, Antonio Cassese, not by its chief prosecutor.

More Talk of Possible Sumitomo-Daiwa Deal

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Saturday, Nov. 4

 BODY:
The Sumitomo Bank Ltd. is negotiating to take over the beleaguered Daiwa Bank, creating the world's largest bank, two leading Japanese newspapers reported today, bolstering widespread speculation on such a deal in the Japanese financial community.
Masaji Tamura, a spokesman for Daiwa Bank, said of the reports: "There has been nothing decided yet about a merger with Sumitomo Bank. I think that all the Japanese press reports have been written with too much certainty about this." Nevertheless, it is not unusual for word of pending negotiations to be leaked to Japanese newspapers, allowing companies to gauge the reaction before committing themselves. 
 On the other hand, Sumitomo's president, Toshio Morikawa, suggested to reporters that a merger was possible, although he declined to disclose details, saying only that Sumitomo would assist Daiwa with its American operations in whatever way possible.
There have been rumors that a Sumitoma-Daiwa merger is a possibility, but today's reports went further and quoted inside sources as saying that some form of agreement had already been reached.
"Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Bank have basically agreed to merge next fall and they are going to enter into discussions of concrete issues," The Nihon Keizei Shimbun, Japan's leading economic daily, reported under a big headline in this morning's editions.
If Sumitomo and Daiwa merge, the combined bank would have assets of more than $600 billion, eclipsing what was expected to be the world's biggest bank: the merger of the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. and Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., which is scheduled for April 1996. That institution would have assets of roughly $550 billion.
Reports about the merger come two days after Daiwa was indicted in the United States for its involvement in a $1.1 billion trading scandal. Daiwa was also ordered by the American authorities to close all of its operations in the United States, while the Japanese Ministry of Finance also ordered Daiwa to scale back its international operations.
Two Japanese newspapers cited industry sources, but several executives at the two banks would not discuss the issue this morning when they were reached at home.
Most Japanese newspapers carried reports on the prospects for a merger, and in recent weeks, the market has focused on speculation that Daiwa Bank's reputation has been so tarnished that it may need a white knight to save it.
Daiwa's new president, Takashi Kaiho, said on Friday that Sumitomo had agreed to help Daiwa dispose of its American operations. Daiwa executives declined to release details about the transfer and about whether all the American branches would be sold, or whether some would be closed and a few transferred to Sumitomo.
Speculation in recent weeks had focused on other possible takeover candidates for Daiwa. When asked why Sumitomo was playing a role in helping assume Daiwa's American operations, Daiwa executives said that the relations between the two banks were close and that they were both based in Osaka, Japan.
The Yomiuri Shimbun, another major Japanese daily, quoted an unidentified executive at Sumitomo Bank as saying that the merger would have to be delayed for about a year.
"Both banks share in wanting to go in the same direction," The Yomiuri Shimbun reported. "On the timing of the merger, next April may be impossible. The earliest would be next October."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS MAY PAY MORE FOR HEALTH AS CONGRESS CUTS

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Businesses tallying the effects of projected cuts in Government health care spending are beginning to worry that they will have to help make up the difference.
At the heart of their concerns is cost-shifting -- the notion that as projected Medicare and Medicaid spending shrinks, hospitals and doctors will demand that employers and their insured workers pay a greater share of health care costs. 
 Economists and Washington business lobbyists warn that millions of working people and their employers could end up paying more for health care and that many people who work for small businesses could lose their insurance altogether.
"If you cut your price to one customer, you increase it to another," said Raymond Brusca, a vice president of the Black & Decker Corporation, the maker of power tools. "Whatever gets squeezed out on the Federal side through budgetary constraints will be shifted to the nonpublic sector. All we're doing is shifting dollars around."
Michael Rourke, a senior vice president with the A.& P. grocery chain, said, "If these cuts go through, there will be an increase in insurance premiums, because hospitals and other health care workers will have to cover the costs now provided by Medicare."
By one estimate, the increase in employers' costs from the projected $270 billion reduction in Medicare and Medicaid spending over seven years would be $90 billion. That figure would increase if dwindling Government payments result in the closing of some public hospitals, pushing more of the uninsured and underinsured into private-sector hospitals that in turn would tack the added costs onto private payers' bills.
Republican sponsors of the spending restraints dispute the predictions of cost-shifting. Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he was confident that the program he has shepherded would not result in costs being transferred to the private sector. He added that limits on malpractice claims against doctors and hospitals, along with new hospital- and doctor-sponsored health plans encouraged by the Republican legislation, would produce "efficiencies" that would make cost-shifting less likely.
In general, business organizations have been among the prime supporters of the Republican program to shrink the Federal Government and cut taxes. Groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable have not wavered in their endorsements. Lobbyists for business groups say most of their clients are more concerned about reducing the deficit and putting a lid on the Medicare payroll tax than the possibility of higher health care costs.
Their clients, though, are just beginning to hear about the increased costs that the Medicare and Medicaid changes may shift onto employers and employees -- in particular, the 55 million people covered by traditional fee-for-service health plans.
"The containment of Medicare costs, the way they're going after it, is a double-edged sword," said Ken Heller, president of the Nutech Environmental Corporation, a Denver company with nine employees. "Reducing payments to doctors and hospitals will encourage cost-shifting to small business."
That has been the pattern in the wake of previous efforts to curtail Medicare spending. In 1993, for example, hospitals said they absorbed losses of 11 percent on treating Medicare beneficiaries and 7 percent on Medicaid patients, but made up the losses by charging private payers a 29 percent markup.
"We are likely to see health care premium increases back in the double digits as a result of this legislation," said John Galles, president of National Small Business United, an advocacy group in Washington.
The yearly increase in employer health costs per employee reached 18.6 percent in 1988 and stayed above 10 percent for the next five years. But that trend reversed and costs actually fell in 1994, as medical inflation abated and employers moved more workers into lower-cost health plans, according to Foster Higgins, a benefits consulting firm.
Many corporate health care experts note that the Republican plan, after much internal debate, does not include strong financial incentives to encourage elderly people to switch to H.M.O.'s and other managed-care health plans.
 "Unless Congress gives Medicare patients an incentive to move from fee-for-service to more cost-efficient managed care, the patients won't make the move and that will undercut efforts at reform," said Jack Stair, a senior consultant with E. I. du Pont de Nemours, who studied the issue for the Financial Executives Institute, a business advocacy group.
Cole Tremain, a vice president of the LTV Corporation, the big steelmaker, said the Medicare cutbacks were "not being matched by reduced benefits or increased costs to retirees in higher deductibles or co-payments" that might make people think twice before visiting a doctor.
Employees who are still working will come under renewed pressure from their companies to move into health maintenance organizations and other managed-care health plans. And many experts say that traditional fee-for-service health plans will lose even more members.
For some procedures, LTV already pays about 50 percent more, on average, than Medicare. For example, LTV pays $33,519 for a coronary bypass with catheterization, while Medicare pays $21,455, Mr. Tremain said. By one estimate, with the projected impact of cost-shifting, the same procedure could cost the company $34,693 seven years from now.
"Our real concern is that Congress not make an already serious problem into one that would be a grave issue for American industry," Mr. Tremain said.
A study by Lewin-VHI, a health care research firm based in Alexandria, Va., concluded that about 45 percent of the projected reductions in Medicare payments to hospitals and doctors, or at least $66 billion, would be shifted. Those shifts would add 2.3 percent to the costs for employers, employees and self-insured individuals, the firm concluded. The Lewin study was done for the National Leadership Coalition on Health Care, a group of employers, unions and consumer and medical groups. Other estimates of the potential shift range from 25 percent to 50 percent.
An estimated $24 billion would be cut from projected Medicaid spending and passed on to private payers, the Lewin study said. This would add about 3.2 percent to their costs. "We low-balled the Medicaid estimate, because of the uncertainty" about how states would administer the program, said John Sheils, a vice president of Lewin-VHI.
The study said that employers, in turn, would require their employees to absorb much of the increased costs "in the form of reduced wages," truncated or denied pay increases, and less generous health coverage. About 523,000 people would lose their insurance coverage entirely in 2002, the final year of the proposed Government spending restraints, the study said. Medicaid cuts might leave five million more without insurance.
Even without the cost-shifting phenomenon, Stephen H. Long, an analyst with the Rand Corporation, said the number of uninsured Americans would surge to 55 million from 41 million as the population grows, if employers continue present trends in health coverage.
"If Medicaid is cut, the number would go even higher," he said.
Most experts said companies with employees enrolled in health maintenance organizations and other managed health plans would be relatively insulated from the Government spending shifts, because they would have the upper hand in negotiating rates with hospitals and medical groups.
But even companies well protected by managed-care arrangements are likely to face increases if the number of uninsured people grows. "The uninsured are going to need care, and those costs are going to be picked up by the businesses and citizens that pay health care bills," Walter B. Maher, a Washington-based health care expert with the Chrysler Corporation, said.
Small employers are scrambling to join health care purchasing groups that would give them more bargaining power, but such groups are scarce in many parts of the country. Indeed they are prohibited in some states.
"The employer with three or four employees is still having a hard time out there, shopping for health care," said Mark Isakowitz, a lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business.
But he said his group had been more concerned about the prospect of increases in payroll taxes to pay for Medicare than about health care cost issues. Very small businesses often pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes. "Providing health insurance is voluntary," he said. "Payroll taxes are not."

HEADLINE: An Underdog Democrat Is Gaining in Mississippi

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: STARKVILLE, Miss., Nov. 2

 BODY:
If it is still possible for a progressive Democrat to win statewide office in the Deep South, the pollsters and consultants say, it is by forging a coalition between black voters and white women.
That theory will meet a significant test in next Tuesday's election for governor of Mississippi. Although Mississippi is one of the most conservative states in the nation and has enjoyed robust economic health in recent years, Dick Molpus, a Democrat, has managed to stay within striking distance of Gov. Kirk Fordice, a Republican, by seeking a large black turnout and appealing aggressively to women. 
 In that effort, Mr. Molpus, who has been Mississippi's Secretary of State for 12 years, has received some unexpected help from Mr. Fordice.
Two weeks ago, during a lunch meeting with reporters, Mr. Fordice mockingly imitated the soft drawl of Mr. Molpus's wife, Sally, who appears in a television advertisement criticizing the Governor's record on education. It provided just the opening that Mr. Molpus's stagnant campaign needed.
Mr. Molpus, 46, quickly condemned Mr. Fordice for insulting his wife, and added, "Frankly, I'd like to take him out behind the woodshed." A few days later, after a televised debate, Mr. Fordice approached Mr. Molpus and told him, according to Mr. Molpus, "This 61-year-old man will take you to the woodshed," adding, in Mississippi vernacular, that he would harm him.
The exchange, which the Fordice campaign refuses to confirm or deny, has helped Mr. Molpus focus attention on Mr. Fordice's bombastic brand of Mississippi machismo, and Mr. Fordice's approval ratings with women have deteriorated correspondingly.
A poll of registered voters conducted by Mason-Dixon Political/ Media Research from Oct. 30 to Nov. 1 found that Mr. Fordice's 20-point lead in August had shrunk to 5 percentage points -- 45 percent for Mr. Fordice to 40 percent for Mr. Molpus. Among women, Mr. Molpus has turned a 49 percent to 37 percent deficit into a 46 percent to 39 percent advantage, according to the poll, which has a margin of sampling error of three percentage points.
Since Mr. Fordice's indiscretion, Mr. Molpus has positioned himself as a Mississippi gentleman defending the honor of his aggrieved wife. At a forum at Mississippi State University here today, he told Mr. Fordice, "Any person who would treat someone else with that type of arrogance and contempt does not deserve to be Governor."
Mr. Fordice, a construction magnate from Vicksburg who was elected four years ago as Mississippi's first Republican governor since 1874, has a well-chronicled history of government-by-bluster. He has offended blacks by threatening to call out the National Guard if the courts forced him to raise taxes in order to increase spending on historically black colleges. He has offended Jews by referring to the United States as "a Christian nation."
The Molpus campaign has forsaken subtlety in portraying Mr. Fordice as a man out of control. "I think they've got him on some kind of calmer," said Patsy Brumfield, the campaign's press secretary, "but it's always possible he might not take his pill and he could go off like a volcano."
The Fordice campaign, meanwhile, has tried to soften the Governor's edges by pairing him in television commercials with one of his young grandchildren. "I'll be tough while I'm Governor so our grandchildren, like Nathan, and all our children, won't have it so tough in Mississippi when they grow up," he says.
If victorious, Mr. Fordice would become the first Mississippi governor elected to a second term since the state began allowing governors to succeed themselves, in 1986. Republicans also have long-shot hopes of gaining a majority in the State Senate, where Democrats now hold a 34-to-18 edge.
In addition to the state's increasingly Republican leanings, the Republican Party has the benefit of what Mr. Fordice calls "the Mississippi miracle." Since he took office, the state has added 115,000 jobs, an increase of more than 12 percent.
Two-thirds of Mississippi's job growth has been in retailing and the service sector, where wages fall below average. Almost a quarter of the new jobs have been generated by the state's boom in casino gambling, an industry that Mr. Fordice once opposed (although not enough to return the industry's campaign contributions).
Both candidates support cutting taxes, with Mr. Fordice pushing for a three-year, 10 percent cut in income taxes and Mr. Molpus proposing a 50 percent cut in the state's 7 percent tax on groceries. That plan, Mr. Molpus said, should have special appeal to women, as should his emphasis on improving Mississippi's perennially substandard schools.
Yet, even Molpus supporters acknowledge that the economy and the state's relatively low unemployment rate of 6 percent give Mr. Fordice a strong platform. "To defeat an incumbent who's sitting on top of that is awfully difficult," said Joseph B. Parker, a political scientist at the University of Southern Mississippi.

HEADLINE: Mixed Reports for New York and New Jersey

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in New York State fell to 6.3 percent in October from 6.8 percent in September, but the number of people with jobs also declined, the Labor Department reported yesterday. In New Jersey, the jobless rate increased to 5.8 percent from 5.7 percent, but employment increased.
In New York, the number of residents employed in October fell by 38,000, to 7.99 million. The size of the labor force shrank by 91,000 people, to 8.52 million. 
 The decline in employment followed three consecutive months in which New York recorded its highest total job counts since it sank into recession in 1990.
So far this year, New York has added 81,500 jobs in the private sector, at a rate that is 11 percent higher than the national average. Manufacturing employment, while declining over all in the United States, has risen by 5,700 jobs in New York.
 New York City, which accounts for about half the state's work force, added 15,100 jobs between January and September, according to the city comptroller's office. But the number of jobs in the city's public sector declined by 12,000 during the period.
Data for Connecticut will come out later. It is not one of the 11 states for which the Federal Government provides jobs data when the national employment figures are released each month.
New York officials welcomed yesterday's report. "Business has renewed confidence in New York State," said Charles A. Gargano, Commissioner of the State Department of Economic Development.
If so, that confidence has required a lot of coaxing. State and city officials last month offered one of the most generous packages of subsidies ever provided in New York City to persuade the board of the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange to cancel plans to move to Jersey City. The move would have cost New York as many as 5,000 jobs.
 When Oxford Health Plans Inc., a managed-care company, announced last month that it had hired 500 people at its operation in White Plains, it praised the help provided by Gov. George E. Pataki's administration.
Despite the increase in New Jersey's unemployment rate last month, the number of residents employed rose 40,000 from September, to 3.84 million.
Still, job growth has slowed in New Jersey this year to a monthly average of 3,700 through September, compared with 6,100 last year. Chris Biddle, a spokesman for the New Jersey Industry and Business Association, said manufacturing employment had fallen by 12,900 jobs since last year, to 494,000 jobs, the lowest level since the 1930's.
The state's retail businesses have also suffered. The Jamesway Corporation and Petrie Retail Inc., two retailers based in Secaucus, have entered bankruptcy proceedings.
Jamesway, a discount chain, dismissed 200 people at its headquarters last month and said it would close all its 90 stores. It employs 5,900 in several states. Petrie, a women's retailer operating 1,700 stores under various names, expects to close at least 276 stores.

HEADLINE: Russians in a Panic Over New Currency: The U.S. $100 Bill

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 3

 BODY:
It is unlikely that most Americans will pay much attention when the United States Treasury introduces a redesigned $100 bill in January. The old bill will still be accepted everywhere of course, and it's not exactly as if hundred-dollar notes are the coin of the realm.
But things couldn't be more different here, because Russians are completely obsessed with C-notes. They covet, hoard and trade them more than in any country other than America itself. 
 Despite the fact that it is illegal to use dollars for retail trade, people who can scrape them together routinely use hundred-dollar bills to buy cars, trucks or houses. Whenever they can get away with it, wage earners demand their salaries in hundreds, too.
No currency in any part of the former Soviet Union -- not the German mark, the British pound or the yen, and certainly not the ruble -- carries anything like the buying power and prestige of the hundred-dollar bill. According to the best guesses of the Russian Central Bank, there is at least $15 billion in United States currency circulating through Russia -- more than in any other foreign country -- and much of it is in hundred-dollar bills.
So it didn't take long for people to realize that the new hundred would make quite a splash here. But nobody was prepared for what has already happened and what might come to pass when the bills actually show up on the streets: Word of the new bill has filled people with such dread that many are already trying to dump their current hundreds and exchange them for marks.
Exchange counters, which routinely reject hundreds that are dirty, old or marred in even the smallest way, are already beginning to charge an extra commission on all old bills.
"We have a real problem," said Vitaly E. Sidorov, executive director of the Association of Russian Banks, which represents most of the country's biggest financial institutions.
"I think it's going to get bigger and bigger. People may simply refuse to accept old bills when there are new bills. Currency exchanges will tell people to go away and if we can't convince people that their money is still good the black market will return and prosper."
The United States Government, which is introducing the bills because they will be harder for counterfeiters to copy, has made several attempts to reassure Russians that their cash will always be welcome whether it is clean or dirty, new or old.
Explanations of the fact that all American currency is created equal have been delivered repeatedly and unequivocally. But in countries like Russia currency can be a deeply emotional issue and promises about cash mean nothing to people who have watched in horror as the ruble become almost worthless in a few short years.
"All American Federal Reserve Banks will accept all old-design U.S. banknotes at 100 percent of face value forever," Theodore E. Allison, a senior Treasury official, told Russian bankers on a recent visit here to discuss the new bills.
Moreover, he said, the United States Government will make certain that everyone who wants new hundreds can get them so there will be no need to panic.
Soothing words, perhaps, but currency reform in Russia usually means exchanging old money for new money. And when that happens, most recently in 1991, the result is always the same: desperate citizens stampede banks hoping to get new money before it runs out. Panic and currency reform run as one in Russia.
That is why there has been such a public relations offensive about the new bill. Front-page articles in major newspapers have repeatedly made the point that the old bills are as good as the new bills, and so have television news shows. Bankers clearly understand it, but a public that has grown deeply suspicious of any government that changes its money and says everything will be all right could hardly be more upset.
Most people standing in line at a shabby currency exchange office in central Moscow this week looked upon the introduction of a new hundred as a personal insult. Russians have so little faith in their own money, which has been ravaged by inflation and devalued continually since the fall of the Soviet Union, that even the notion of change scares them.
"We have no order here at all," said Nadezhda V. Pashanova, 38, who was waiting patiently in line to change a hundred-dollar bill. "In Russia it is always hard to predict what will happen, but we always expect the worst. I have already started having problems changing the old notes so I have had to get 5 percent less than usual for them."
Like most people interviewed, she said she would exchange her hundreds for new ones the moment she had the chance.
Most exchange offices in Russia refuse to accept any bills issued before 1988, despite a directive sent in 1993 from Russia's Central Bank to all commercial banks informing them they are obliged to take all American currency they receive, even bills that are 75 years old. Every person who uses hundred-dollar bills in Russia -- and that's every person who can -- has been turned away at least once by a skeptical hotel clerk, a rigid banker or even an obstinate baby sitter.
"I went to three banks and an exchange office," a teary-eyed Svetlana Zolorariova said last week after selling an expensive lacquer box and receiving her payment the usual way -- in hundreds. She then produced the offending note: a 1993 hundred-dollar bill so crisp it seemed as if it might crack.
"Look there," Miss Zolorariova said, pointing to two tiny ink marks on the back of the bill. "Nobody is going to take that."
There is at least some reason to take that second look at hundred-dollar bills here: estimates of counterfeiting in Russia range from significant to incredible. American officials say the amount of counterfeit currency in circulation is minimal, but as one senior Treasury official who asked not to be identified said, "To the degree counterfeiting is a problem it is a problem in Russia."
And with two-thirds of all hundred-dollar bills in circulation outside the United States, most counterfeiters don't waste their time on twenties or tens. The new hundred will help reduce the threat, and in an age when color laser copiers and digital technology can make the fake look strikingly real, nobody is arguing that the threat is getting smaller.
"You can say anything you want about what we should take and what we shouldn't," said a clerk at a currency exchange near Red Square. "But why is America of all countries issuing new currency if the old currency isn't a problem? So if your job is to earn a living exchanging money, you are telling me you would treat the safe new bills exactly like the bills they already know how to copy? What kind of sense does that make?"

HEADLINE: Along Bosnia Dividing Line, Federation Is Only on Paper

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzego vina, Nov. 3

 BODY:
To speak with her daughter and granddaughters in Los Angeles, Adila Glavovic must use the telephone of a friend who lives 10 minutes away, across a river in her hometown of Mostar.
On the other side is also the apartment she once lived in, groceries that are more affordable and the medical care her husband needs. But the west side of Mostar is largely forbidden to Mrs. Glavovic and people who, like her, are refugees in their own city. 
 The Croats, who govern the west side of the city, make it almost impossible for the Muslims, who live in the east, where the Bosnian Government has control, to cross the Neverta River. This divide exists in spite of the fact that Mostar, a 500-year-old city in a narrow mountainous valley, was supposed to be the showcase of the Bosnian-Croatian federation forged by Washington last year.
But if anything these are two peoples moving apart, not together. Each side has different license plates, currency and passports, and diametrically different views of what Bosnia should be.
Several days of travel through Croatian-held areas of central and western Bosnia show the federation to be little more than a piece of paper. That piece of paper, drafted to bring an end to fighting between Muslims and Croats, is also central to the American plan for peace in Bosnia, and its importance was underscored this week when negotiators in Ohio announced yet another agreement to strengthen the federation.
"It doesn't exist," a senior Western diplomat in Zagreb said. "We invented the federation and forced the sides into it."
Far from seeing the alliance between the Croats and the Bosnian Government as an enduring one, some diplomats and United Nations officials in the region fear that the alliance of Muslims and Croats might end in conflict between them after a peace agreement is signed.
Washington's peace proposal divides Bosnia between the Muslim-Croat federation (51 percent) and the Serbs (49 percent). In reality Bosnia's Croats control 20 percent of the territory of Bosnia, and the Muslim-dominated Government in Sarajevo, 30 percent. There are now an estimated 350,000 ethnic Croats in western Bosnia (about half the number before the war) most of them in the Herzegovina region.
"If there were a referendum, the people would vote not 90 percent, but 99 percent, not to be part of the federation," said Krunoslav Kordic, a Croat who is mayor of Capljina, 25 miles southwest of Mostar.
The Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, said in a recent interview that the Croatian people in the region want to be part of Bosnia, but that paramilitary units with aid from Zagreb are stoking the flames of separatism. But Western officials in the Mostar area say that Mayor Kordic's view of public opinion appears to be closer to the truth.
In front of Mr. Kordic's office, among the evergreens and leafy trees, flies the red, white and blue flag of the Croatian Republic of Herzog-Bosna. Asked where the Bosnian flag was, he said simply, "We don't recognize it." Bosnia's flag, with gold fleurs-de-lis on a blue background, is seldom seen in Herzegovina, nor are federation policemen.
The self-declared republic, which has its capital in Mostar, has not been internationally recognized. But it is a reality. It delivers the mail, collects taxes, generates electricity, educates children, and with its own 50,000-man army defends the territory of Herzegovina (with help from neighboring Croatia). Police officers wear the same blue uniform as the Croatian police, with an almost imperceptible alteration in the red and white checkerboard shield on their shoulder patches.
Don't try to buy beer or bananas, gasoline or shaving cream in Herzegovina with the Bosnian dinar. The legal currency in Herzegovina is the Croatian kuna, or the German mark.
The Bosnian Croats carry Croatian passports, not Bosnian ones. They vote in Croatia's elections, and in last week's parliamentary elections, they did so overwhelmingly for the Croatian Democratic Party of President Franjo Tudjman.
Under pressure from Washington and the European Union, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia has publicly vowed support for the federation. But Western officials say they do not believe that his public stance matches his real feelings.
"In Zagreb, they don't want it to exist," a Western diplomat there said about Croatia's attitude toward the federation. Mr. Tudjman is under strong American pressure to go along with the federation.
One of the provisions of the 1994 federation agreement was that all people forced out of their villages during the Muslim-Croat war would be allowed to return home.
That has not happened. "The federation has brought about no integration of ethnic groups," said Kris Janowski, a spokesman here for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
This week's agreement in Ohio aims, in fact, to allow 300 Muslim families and 300 Croatian families to return to homes in areas occupied by the other group. Even if it works, these numbers are tiny in a country with nearly 700,000 internal refugees.
Mohammed Elezovic was born in the historic Muslim town of Stolac, where his family's roots go back 400 years. He was expelled by Croats in July 1993. Mr. Elezovic, 55, a professor of Slavic languages, has still not been able to go back, not even to pick up his poetry or albums with pictures of his children.
When Croatian troops recently recaptured the strategic town of Jajce from the Serbs, they moved Croatian civilians back in but did not allow displaced Muslim residents to return to their homes.
The grievances are not one-sided, however.
In Zenica, an industrial city controlled by the Bosnian Government, more than 12,000 of the city's 20,000 Croats have been forced out since the federation agreement was signed, European officials said this week.
"The federation is rubbish," said a 21-year old Croatian man, who said that he is unable to return to his village near Konjic.
There are only two ways to make the federation work, said a United Nations official. One is military force, the kind Washington does not want to use. The other is investing "billions" of dollars in Bosnia, so that there is an economy strong enough to provide jobs for everyone.
But the lesson of Mostar is that spending money is not enough.
In the last 15 months, the European Union has spent more than $200 million to rebuild and reunify this city. The reconstruction has been a success -- children are in schools, the hospital has clean sheets and medicines for patients, traffic lights work, water flows. The work has been carried out on both sides of the city.
What disturbs European Union officials in Mostar is that, because political unification has not been accomplished, the facilities are essentially segregated.
For example, teenagers from the east cannot attend high school in the west as they did before the war, and special permission is needed for Mrs. Glavovic's husband, who had a heart attack five years ago, to go to the hospital, which is in the west.
The failure of political reunification is why Mrs. Glavovic cannot call her daughter without applying for a permit and waiting 10 days for permission to make the 10-minute walk, and why she and her husband cannot return to their three-bedroom west Mostar apartment with balcony views of the valley, even though they can see their former home from where they now live as refugees with their relatives.
It is why reconstruction of the 400-year-old mosque in east Mostar is hampered. The quarry with the right quality of stones is on the other side of a river, explained Hussein Lulic, 71, a stonemason working at the mosque.
Croatian officials do not deny that they are restricting movement. If they did, they would be "demographically occupied" by the Muslims, said Mile Puljic, the deputy mayor of west Mostar, with the Muslims from the east coming west.
With money from Croatian and German business executives, west Mostar is thriving and lively -- like West Berlin was -- with sidewalk cafes where Croatian soldiers in camouflage engage in conversation with chic young women.
East Mostar, which was poorer before the war, and was more heavily damaged by Croatian shelling during the fighting, has suffered from a lack of significant private foreign investment since the end of the war. Muslims are still struggling to dig out from the rubble, and an old man was seen this week poking through garbage in search of something of value to him.
"The people live in a ghetto," Hans Koschnick, a German who is the European Union's administrator for Mostar, said about the Muslims in east Mostar. "I know something of ghettos. I don't like it."
As for the federation, what the Bosnian Government wants is a country built on the principle of one person one vote, the basis of the American proposal. It would like at least Herzegovina to be included, and the Serbian territories as well.
The Bosnian Croats, if they cannot get unification with Croatia, want to be an essentially independent state in a confederation with Bosnia. But the Bosnian Government rejected this two years ago, and it is not part of the American peace plan.
Mr. Puljic, the deputy mayor of west Mostar, calls the American idea "totally unacceptable."
"To Mr. Holbrooke, I wish him all the best," he said, referring to Richard C. Holbrooke, the chief American negotiator. "But it is not as simple as he supposes."

HEADLINE: Rage Grows in Okinawa Over U.S. Military Bases

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: GINOWAN, Okinawa, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Children are flipping through their books and a teacher is passing out note pads when suddenly the floor trembles and the classroom is engulfed in a roar.
It is not an earthquake, or Armageddon, but an interruption that occurs at least hourly: A military helicopter soars into the sky from the American air base next door. 
 "Almost every time a plane flies over, I lose my concentration, I raise my voice, or the kids raise their voices," said Miyoko Uema, the 42-year-old librarian at No. 2 Futenma Elementary School here in Okinawa, in the south of Japan. "When the sound comes, the day automatically stops."
To listen to Okinawans, the American military presence here is not a source of comfort or protection, but an annoyance and a threat.
The result is a growing outcry to evict the American troops and American bases from Japan, or at least curb their presence. The uproar, backed by a recent protest of more than 50,000 demonstrators, is threatening to spoil the summit meeting this month between President Clinton and Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.
The meeting, which is to begin Nov. 17, was supposed to solidify the military alliance between Japan and the United States, based on the presence of nearly 60,000 American troops in Japan. But now Mr. Clinton is set to arrive in Japan just as record numbers of people are wondering whether American bases are necessary at all.
Part of the anger in Okinawa is directed at the Tokyo Government, which has never really paid much attention to what Okinawan people think. But the rage of the Okinawans -- particularly after the rape in September of a 12-year-old girl, in which three American servicemen have been charged -- echoes in some ways the discontent and rising nationalism of the Philippines in the late 1980's. As in the Philippines, many leaders want to keep the American bases but are reluctant to speak out against the rising tide of public opinion.
Yet even if no one knows where the tide of anger will lead, few doubt that the tide has been growing. For people like Rino Kayo, a 12-year-old girl clutching her notebook outside a classroom at the No. 2 Elementary School, the reasons are palpable.
"It's very scary," she said of the helicopters and jets. "I heard that a plane once crashed." In the last 23 years, Okinawans have seen 36 air crashes. Four years ago, a helicopter made an emergency landing and erupted in fire near the school.
"I would like the bases to just disappear," said Tamotsu Tokeshi, a homeowner whose seven-bedroom, two-story house is 765 yards from the double airstrip of Japan's largest air base, Kadena.
Mr. Tokeshi, who keeps a sound meter on his roof, says the American jets start revving their engines at 4 A.M. and run late into the night. For most of this year, daily noise levels have reached 100 decibels, compared with the acceptable standard in Japan of 70 decibels. So Mr. Tokeshi has filed a suit, along with more than 900 other local residents, to demand that the flight schedules be changed.
To damp the noise, local residents often reinforce their windows, thicken their walls or add a layer of tile to their rooftops, but there is little they can do about crime. Since 1972, 4,700 crimes have been committed by American military men, including a dozen murders, according to the Okinawan police.
Crime by American military men has actually been on the decline, but the rape of the sixth grader in September seems to have deeply touched Okinawans.
"Since the rape, people's feelings against the bases have become stronger," said Yoshiko Chibana, a 36-year-old mother of two children. "I feel it very keenly because I have children now, so it's not just someone else's problem."
Shuden Teruya, a retired Government worker in the Okinawan city of Naha, feels so strongly about ousting the bases that he is willing to forgo the majority of his income to see it happen. Mr. Teruya is a landlord who leases nearly two acres of residential land to Kadena Air Base, and along with nearly 3,000 local landlords, or about one percent of all the local military landowners, Mr. Teruya is refusing to renew his lease, which expires in 1997.
"I hate war, and I want the bases to be removed entirely," said Mr. Teruya, whose brothers, in contrast, are renewing their land leases. "We Okinawans are rather gentle people. There have been past murders that lead to small protests. But this rape, this time -- well, we feel we cannot put up with any more."
Mr. Teruya refused to renew his lease eight years ago, but the Governor of Okinawa appropriated the land-use rights and gave them to the Americans. But the new Governor, Masahide Ota, says he will not sign over the land-use rights anymore.
The result is that beginning in March, chunks of American bases could revert to the original landowners. In fact, Prime Minister Murayama will probably overrule the Okinawans and himself initiate a long legal proceeding to sign over the land-use rights to the Americans.
To be sure, the overwhelming majority of landowners want to continue renting their land to the American military because they want the rent.
Their uneasiness rises when they look at a 530-acre plot of barren land that the Americans returned in the 1980's. The Government has plans for a big development, but they are mostly still plans.
"For me, all my land assets are being used by the Americans," said Kaoru Shinjo, the president of the Federation of Landowners Association, which represents owners of land leased to the American bases. "So if they just returned them and left without there being any plans for development, the land could turn into wilderness."
Mr. Shinjo and others who like the American presence have not been getting much attention, but they are still numerous. While most people in Okinawa, where 75 percent of American bases and nearly half of the American troops are concentrated, want the Americans out in the long run, overall in Japan there is still a slim plurality in favor of maintaining the United States-Japan Security Treaty.
But the same poll showed 40 percent of Japanese want to scrap the treaty, up from 29 percent before the rape. Because the treaty has been the bulwark of foreign policy for most of the postwar period, the figure has stunned Japanese politicians.
American officials have also been alarmed, and have profusely apologized for the rape. But Defense Secretary William J. Perry said during a visit to Japan this week that the United States cannot close a major base or reduce its troop presence.
Ambassador Walter F. Mondale, said: "It provides stability in the region. The cold war ended in Europe, but it has not quite ended here."
Over the years, the contribution of the bases to the overall economy has fallen from 15 percent in 1972 to about 5 percent. But another withdrawal of sorts also seems to be taking place on the American bases, especially among the nearly 19,000 marines stationed in Okinawa.
Marines, many of whom are young and single, are banned after midnight from Okinawa City, and many unit commanders are admonishing their marines to stay out of trouble over the weekends.
These restrictions seem to have kept marines out of the local shops in general. One reason may be simply that tensions are in the air and that marines no longer feel as welcome as they did.
"I walk down the street and they step aside and walk away from me," said Pfc. Michael Caballero, one of the few servicemen out one evening on the streets of Okinawa City. "We're not all rapists."
Some Japanese and Americans argue, though, that the military breeds a macho atmosphere that allows incidents like the rape to happen.
To be sure, marines interviewed here said they were shocked by the rape, and some have contributed to a collection for the rape victim. Yet part of the problem is that in Japan, the marines have a reputation as a fearless force, trained to kill, and thus somewhat violent.
That reputation is growing as word spreads of the reason that one of the defendants, Marcus D. Gill, a Navy seaman, has reportedly cited for the rape.
"It was just to have fun," said Matsunobu Matsunaga, a Japanese lawyer for one of the defendants in the case. "He said he didn't have money to buy prostitutes."

HEADLINE: Race for Kentucky Governor Slows to a Trot

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: HOPKINSVILLE, Ky., Nov. 1

 BODY:
Staring down at her scrambled eggs and ham this morning at Roundie's Restaurant here, Joan Buckley said she would probably vote Republican in the Kentucky governor's election on Tuesday.
As a retired middle-school teacher, Mrs. Buckley said, she does not much care for the changes in the state's public education policies that were passed in 1990 -- and as she understood it, neither does the Republican candidate, Larry Forgy. 
 Poking a fork at his own ham and eggs, her husband, Delmar, shook his head. "I haven't made up my mind yet," he said. "I just might kill her vote by voting Democrat. It's happened before. But I just don't know right now."
With their sentiments apparent if passionless, the Buckleys are typical of the divided and disengaged electorate this year in Kentucky, which the Census Bureau ranks as the nation's sixth-poorest state.
Neither Mr. Forgy nor his Democratic opponent, Lieut. Gov. Paul Patton, has generated much excitement among voters despite sharp differences in the candidates' positions and the increased nastiness of their campaigns. Most experts predict an unusually light turnout, even though the polls show that the race is virtually even.
The current Governor, Brereton Jones, a Democrat, is barred by law from seeking a second term.
"It has been a lackluster campaign," said Penny Miller, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. "There has been no silver-bullet issue to get the attention of the public."
Even Mr. Patton conceded today, after an appearance at a center for the elderly here, that the race lacked a burning issue, and added, "I don't know if that helps me or hurts me."
Much of the lack of interest is a result of Kentucky's new campaign finance laws, which limit each candidate to $1.8 million in spending and reduce individual contributions to $500 from $4,000. The spending limits have cut down on television advertising, leaving many voters unfamiliar with the candidates until recently. Mr. Forgy's television advertisements began running only last month.
Mr. Forgy, a wealthy lawyer who has run for governor before, has campaigned as a conservative Republican, opposing abortion and favoring lower taxes, less government regulation and a return to the methods of education that prevailed before the passage of the Kentucky Education Reform Act in 1990. That law placed greater emphasis on writing and group work in public schools. Mr. Forgy is running strong with farmers, religious conservatives and opponents of abortion rights.
Mr. Patton, a former coal mine operator, favors modest tax cuts, greater economic development and only modest changes in the education system. He has union support and has won editorial endorsements from the state's two largest newspapers, The Louisville Courier-Journal and The Lexington Herald-Leader.
In the closing days of the race, the candidates have used national issues to criticize each other. With tobacco as the state's leading cash crop, Mr. Forgy has tied Mr. Patton to the Clinton Administration's talk about regulating nicotine as a drug. Mr. Patton has warned elderly voters that Mr. Forgy's would-be colleagues in Washington, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, favor reduced Medicare benefits to help balance the Federal budget.
But the only real sparks in the campaign have come from personal attacks.
Mr. Forgy has said his opponent is part of "the most entrenched, corrupt political machine in the United States," and has called the Lieutenant Governor "a tax-and-spend-liberal." With great relish, Mr. Forgy has reminded voters of the Democratic politicians who are now serving prison terms for their role in recent state and Federal scandals, although he fails to mention the state's Republicans who have been imprisoned for similar offenses.
Mr. Patton has accused his opponent of telling voters "what they want to hear, then worry about it later." He has also suggested that by not making public all his income tax results, Mr. Forgy is "hiding some kind of business deal."
Both candidates agree that the main battleground of the campaign may be here in western Kentucky, where Democrats are no longer the automatic favorites they once were.
The Buckleys said the shift toward conservative candidates followed demographic changes in the area. Older residents, like Mr. Buckley, who followed his parents' lead and voted for "whoever the Democratic person was," are moving away or dying, he said.
"And the younger ones vote for people, not parties," Mrs. Buckley said. "The new generation is more receptive to change."
Even Mr. Patton has recognized the need to stay abreast of the political trends. Tonight, at the end of his final debate with Mr. Forgy, the Lieutenant Governor peered into the camera and earnestly asked voters to support "our conservative agenda for the citizens of Kentucky."

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
It is pretty clear where most American Jews stand in the cultural wars now dividing the nation. It is not so clear where Judaism stands.
Most Jews in the United States continue to vote Democratic, back abortion rights, uphold strict separation of church and state, favor Federal initiatives to combat discrimination and inequality, respond with alarm to the emergence of a conservative Christian political movement and generally feel that the more secular the society, at least in its public demeanor and certainly in its government policies, the safer it is for the Jewish minority. 
 But some Jews -- a large segment of the Orthodox, plus a battalion of increasingly conservative intellectuals -- have challenged these positions as "liberal pieties" that, whatever the situation in the past, now contradict Jewish interests. Both Jewish camps in the culture wars contend that they have Jewish tradition on their side.
That is why the Jewish Theological Seminary, the intellectual nerve center of Conservative Judaism, situated on Manhattan's West Side, organized a series of lectures and dialogues on "Revisioning America: Culture Wars and the Jewish Tradition."
Running from mid-October to mid-November, the series features an impressive cast of Jewish intellectuals: Leon Wieseltier, Midge Decter, Michael Walzer, William Kristol, Leonard Fein, Jack Wert heimer, Richard Bernstein and Irving Levine.
Two weeks ago, the seminary's Chancellor, Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, debated the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, neoconservative Roman Catholic theologian and the one non-Jew in the series, on "The Role of Religion in the Public Square."
Father Neuhaus argued that an adamantly secular "public square" in the United States, where more than 9 of 10 citizens base their morality on religion, was doomed to be anti-democratic. That, he said, would set Jewish interests against the overwhelming majority and be a formula for disaster.
A public life stripped of religion "is the most dangerous of places" for minorities, he warned, for it undercuts "inhibition against unspeakable evil."
In his rejoinder, Rabbi Schorsch disagreed that religion had been banished from American public life. The issue, he said, was the removal of religion not from society but from the state: a religiously neutral state did not mean a religiously neutral society.
In any case, the proposition that more religion in either state or society was better for the Jews "had not been verified by the Jewish historical experience" in Europe, he said, and Jews were loath to conduct a fresh experiment in the United States.
Father Neuhaus and Rabbi Schorsch carried on their exchange in a low key that held out the promise of common ground. Less so with the exchange on Jewish liberalism and conservatism last Thursday between Mr. Walzer, professor of social science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and the co-editor of Dissent magazine, and Ms. Decter, essayist and former head of the Committee for the Free World.
Liberalism, Professor Walzer said, has two meanings today: a liberalism of civil liberties, individualism, toleration and pluralism and a liberalism of the New Deal, welfare state, distributive justice and trade unionism. The Jewish connection to the second, he said, is clear; it was the first he wished to address.
This liberalism was relatively new to Judaism and Jews, he said: A century and a half ago, with emancipation from the ghetto, many Jews took up opposition to all enforced orthodoxies. "Like new converts," he said, "we were more liberal than the liberals."
"One cluster of liberal values appealed especially to Jews who wanted to be emancipated and who wanted to be Jewish at the same time," Professor Walzer said, "toleration, freedom of association and their derivative, cultural pluralism."
The latter implied political and economic integration in the larger society, he said, but also a cultural distinctiveness maintained by means of a full panoply of Jewish institutions, from nursery schools and community centers to philanthropic organizations and theological seminaries.
In current jargon, Professor Walzer said, this cultural pluralism could be called "meat-and-potatoes multiculturalism," -- not "a rhetorical, gestural, ideologically strident multiculturalism" but one focusing on "the actual institutions that make a common life possible," institutions that, in a liberal, pluralist society, frequently receive state help.
Not only is this meat-and-potatoes multiculturalism threatened, Professor Walzer said, from those who "aim at turning multiculturalism into a literal separatism" and, in the Jewish case, from those calling for "a Christian or at least Christianized republic." It is also threatened, he said, by those calling "for a market society in the strongest sense," which would remove the financial props now provided by government.
The liberal pluralism and multiculturalism that Professor Walzer defended, Ms. Decter described in starkly different terms. It was a liberalism that by the 1970's had grown hostile to merit and meritocracy and favored racial and sexual quotas. It was a liberalism, she said, that let itself be identified with "a deep-going decadence," rejecting all standards of achievement and moral conduct.
If Jewish conservatives like herself are willing to make common cause with Christian conservatives against this liberalism, she said, it is because the secularism that both oppose is "taking the country down into nihilism." She said, "Jews will not long continue to thrive under its umbrella."
Did Ms. Decter think that the "market society in the strongest sense," to use Professor Walzer's phrase, might have a good deal to do with "deep-going decadence?" Did Professor Walzer see anything embedded in the individualist and multicultural liberalism that he described that might have something to do with Ms. Decter's horizon of horrors?
Unfortunately, in the questions-and-answer period that followed their remarks, the opportunities to bring the two perspectives into useful confrontation always slipped away. Maybe that, more than anything else, is the curse of the culture wars.

HEADLINE: Man Accused of Fake Calls; One Led to an Officer's Death

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Since the beginning of September, officers from the 10th Precinct in Chelsea had responded more than a dozen times to false reports of pistol-toting men, drug deals and gunshots in the blocks around the Chelsea Houses on West 26th Street.
Yesterday, officers were sent to the Chelsea Houses again. But this time they made an arrest, charging a 38-year-old unemployed laborer with making 13 false 911 calls to increase the police presence in his quiet neighborhood. One bogus call in late September led to the death of a police officer in a car crash. 
 Investigators said they thought that the man, Manuel Perez, who lives in a ground-floor apartment in the project near Ninth Avenue, may have been making the calls since late 1993. "It's our belief that he wanted police protection in the area, and he would use these calls to get a response," said John F. Timoney, the First Deputy Police Commissioner. He added that the arrest was "the first time in the history of the department, to my recollection, that we've been able to conclude a case effectively by tracing phony calls to 911."
It was Mr. Perez's report of gunshots to a 911 operator at 9:32 A.M. on Sept. 23 that sent Officer David Willis, 29, and his partner, Officer Robert Avezzan, 31, racing down 11th Avenue 10 minutes later. According to a transcript of the call released yesterday, Mr. Perez told the 911 operator: "I just heard about, about 10 to 12 shots, and I looked out my window and they, they hid something."
As the officers responded with their lights flashing and sirens blaring, they were hit broadside by a postal van headed east on West 30th Street, and Officer Willis was thrown through the side window of the patrol car, breaking his neck.
He died two days later at St. Vincent's Hospital. Officer Avezzan, who was driving, was not seriously injured because the air bag in the car, a Chevrolet sedan, was activated by the crash.
Mr. Timoney said investigators began looking into a pattern of false calls in the neighborhood after the officer's death, placing an electronic tag on calls that came from the area and that involved reports of gunshots or drug dealing. On Oct. 28, Samuel Sams, a 911 operator, saw the alert flash on his screen when a man called to report a drug deal near the Chelsea Houses, and Mr. Sams called Nynex to have the call traced, Mr. Timoney said.
Detective Tom O'Malley of the 10th Precinct said Mr. Perez did not know that his call had resulted in the officer's death. "He is very, very broken up about it," Detective O'Malley said. For the Sept. 23 call, he was charged with falsely reporting an incident in the first degree, a felony that carries a sentence of up to a year in prison. He was charged with misdemeanors for the other calls.
Residents in Mr. Perez's building said officers went frequently to the building for the last several months and often frisked or questioned groups of teen-agers who congregated near a main entrance to the Chelsea Houses, only feet away from a window of Mr. Perez's apartment.
Mr. Timoney said false 911 calls, especially exaggerated reports made to draw officers more quickly to the scene, are a problem across the city.
"People in family disputes or even minor nuisance calls will jack it up, and it's very, very dangerous," he said. "The reason why there are priority calls is that officers obviously respond at different rates of speed and in a life-threatening situation, which this was, the officers are going as fast as they possibly can to get there."

HEADLINE: Dow Hits a High for 2d Day Despite a Drop in Bonds

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average advanced to a record high yesterday for the second consecutive day, defying a dip in bond prices that followed a mixed employment report.
The Dow average spent most of the session in barely positive territory. But a burst of buying near the close propelled it 16.98 points higher, to 4,825.57, topping the closing high of 4,808.59 set Thursday. It was the blue-chip average's 52d record this year and sent it up 83.82 for the week, more than recovering its 52-point loss last week. 
 Advancing issues led declines, 1,290 to 940, on moderate volume of 345.5 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Broad market indexes rose but were shy of their records. The Standard & Poor's 500 list added 0.85, to 590.57, closing just below its record close of 590.60 on Oct. 19. The New York Stock Exchange's composite index rose 0.58, to 314.27. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 8.34, to 1,065.66, just under its Sept. 13 high of 1,067.40, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index climbed 1.07, to 529.11.
Stocks rose even as the 30-year Treasury bond dipped a quarter-point, following a Labor Department report that the nation's unemployment rate dipped to 5.5 percent in October, the lowest level in seven months. But October payrolls increased by 116,000, below expectations, and the Government sharply lowered its September estimate. Average hourly earnings rose 6 cents in October to $11.59.
Analysts said the mixed employment figures did nothing to change their view that economic activity was slowing after a summer spurt.
"A weakish report was more or less expected," said James Solloway, research director at Argus Research. "It wasn't the kind of report that really elicits much inspiration.
"Manufacturing is still on the weak side, still being hurt by the earlier inventory buildup we saw in the first half of the year. And with retail sales being quite sluggish here, there is not any burning reason why the markets should do much of anything."
John Shaughnessy, the Advest Corporation's director of research, said he was surprised at the market's continued strength. "My own sense is that we're probably in for a choppy two weeks or so until we get the budget deficit problem worked out in Washington," he said.
Congressional Republicans and President Clinton remain at odds over the budget issue.
Mr. Shaughnessy said that after the budget matter was resolved, however, he believed the Federal Reserve could justify cutting short-term rates again, paving the way for a year-end rally for both stocks and bonds.
"The underlying fundamentals are solid," he said, including growing earnings and comfortable interest rates.
Several technology shares gained. On the Big Board, I.B.M. rose 1 7/8, to 101 1/2, and Micron Technologies rose 3/4, to 68 1/4. Silicon Graphics added 4, to 36 1/4, after First Chicago said the stock could go to 50. Sun Microsystems jumped 531/64 , to 8423/64 after the company set a 2-for-1 stock split.
Applied Materials was the volume leader in Nasdaq trading and gained 2 3/4, to 55 3/8, after Prudential Securities began coverage with a "buy" rating.
Transportation issues, the other impetus for the market on Thursday, were mixed. Delta Air Lines rose 1 1/4, to 69 1/2. But Federal Express slipped 1 1/8, to 84 7/8. The Dow Jones transportation average rose 5.51 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,990.95.
The EMC Corporation led in volume on the Big Board and rose 2, to 18 1/2. The company said that AT&T and Hewlett-Packard would sell EMC's Symmetrix 3000 open storage system. EMC also said it expected more than $250 million in 1996 revenues from the agreement.
Edison Brothers Stores Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, becoming the second major mall-based specialty retailer after Petrie Retail Inc. to seek protection in the last month. The stock was halted from trading, but the news send many other retail shares down; they had gained on Thursday after posting October sales. Dayton Hudson slipped 7/8, to 73, after jumping 7.6 percent.
In Tokyo the market was closed for Culture Day, a national holiday. In Frankfurt, the DAX Index of 30 shares fell 2.26 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2181.72,

HEADLINE: Voters Will Decide Whether to Curb State-Imposed Programs

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

 BODY:
Testing New Jersey schoolchildren for curvature of the spine sounded like a good idea when it was proposed in the 1960's.
Today, however, the program is considered by some the epitome of what is wrong with local governments being ordered by the state to adopt programs without receiving the money to operate them. 
 New Jersey voters will be asked on Tuesday to approve a constitutional amendment to prohibit the state from imposing programs on schools, counties or municipalities without providing money, unless the programs are approved by three-fourths of the Legislature.
Three other public questions appear on the ballot. Voters will be asked, among other things, to authorize a $340 million bond issue to allow the state to acquire additional land for conservation and recreational use.
As for the mandated programs, critics say that they waste millions of dollars in administrative costs every year, that they survive long after they have outlived their usefulness and that they eat up money better spent on services that communities really want.
The requirement that schools test for curvature of the spine offers a case in point, these critics say. It was useful to identify affected children in the initial survey, they point out, but the law as written requires annual testing of all public schoolchildren 10 or older, even if they are routinely examined by family physicians or have never exhibited any signs of the ailment.
Opponents of the amendment say voters should not throw the baby out with the bath water. Every effort should be made to weed out unnecessary or outdated programs, they maintain, but the mandates remain a useful tool to establish uniform economic and social policies that local governing bodies might otherwise neglect.
"We feel the Legislature already has the power not to pass irresponsible mandates," said Barbara Bohi, vice president for advocacy of the New Jersey League of Women Voters, a group that opposes the amendment.
Another opponent is the New Jersey Environmental Federation. "When efforts are made to shape policy based on budgets rather than the public good," said Amy Goldsmith, the federation's executive director, "then the needs of the public will not be met."
But the measure has the backing of powerful forces, including Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and the Republican leadership of the Legislature, as well as the League of Municipalities, the Association of Counties and the School Boards Association.
"Passage of the amendment will change the way business is done in Trenton," said William G. Dressel Jr., the league's executive director. "From now on legislators will need to analyze the costs of a bill in a public forum and who is going to pay for it."
The amendment would apply only to future or expanded state programs, not existing ones. Nor would it affect Federal requirements like welfare and environmental spending. It would provide for the creation of an independent, bipartisan council to determine whether new state laws or regulations imposed mandates on local governments without providing money.
The land-conservation-bond issue is being put before voters for the eighth time. A total of $1.1 billion has been approved to acquire 250,000 acres of woodlands, parks and farms. This year's bond issue asks for $30 million to be used to buy coastal property endangered by a rising sea and property subject to flooding along the Passaic River.
Also on the ballot are these items: a measure creating a state redistricting commission to redraw Congressional districts after every Federal census, and a resolution dedicating an increased portion of state gasoline taxes to the transportation fund, which is used for state roads.

HEADLINE: Job Growth Was Sluggish Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3

 BODY:
Despite fresh signs of stability in factories, the economy generated new jobs at a lackluster pace in October as the unemployment rate edged down to 5.5 percent from 5.6 percent, the Labor Department reported today.
The figures, the most comprehensive gauge of economic performance for the month, tended to confirm other recent indications -- including weak store sales -- that the economy had decelerated in recent weeks after a surge in the summer months. In terms of job growth, the rise of 116,000 in nonfarm payrolls last month was below economists' expectations. 
 The Clinton Administration, while contending that the economic expansion remains "on track" after four and a half years, still expressed some uneasiness about the economic outlook.
"This is not an environment where consumers are apt to run to the shopping malls," Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich said in an interview. He pointed to sluggish wage growth and a "mountain" of inventories as two factors that were likely to continue to restrain job growth.
Still, the employment report did not provide the financial markets with clear new indications of a sharper slowdown that might push the Federal Reserve to reduce short-term interest rates soon, and bond prices slipped. [Page 40.]
In one bright spot in today's report, the unemployment rate in the Northeast, which has long been higher than the national average, eased five-tenths of a percentage point, to 5.6 percent. In New York State, for example, the jobless rate fell to 6.3 percent from 6.8 percent. But in New Jersey, the rate edged up one-tenth of a point, to 5.8 percent. [Page 38.]
The other three regions of the country showed virtually no change.
Other upbeat elements included an increase in the index of production hours; 18,000 more jobs in finance, insurance and real estate, and 2,000 more factory jobs after accounting for strikes.
But the dominant assessment of today's mixed report was that it portrayed business conditions that have become markedly less robust.
"The economy is generating jobs at a very paltry pace," said Lacy H. Hunt, an economist at HSBC Holdings Inc. in New York. Along with the modest gain of 116,000 in payroll jobs last month, he noted that the Labor Department made a big downward revision that cut September's job growth to 50,000 from the 121,000 that it initially reported.
In fact, various analysts noted, the October payroll gain was slightly less than what the Labor Department calls the bias adjustment, that is, the number of jobs -- 118,000 for the fourth quarter -- that it assumes were created by new companies not yet captured in its statistical net.
And while the private-sector workweek expanded by 12 minutes, the factory workweek and factory overtime both contracted by that amount, portending further weakness. Factory hours are a component of the index of leading economic indicators, a widely followed forecasting gauge.
Irwin L. Kellner, senior economic adviser to Chemical Bank, said that the labor market was "weaker than it looks" and that the holiday shopping season would suffer because job growth had been concentrated in lower-paid industries. "Buying power," he said, "isn't growing."
Another negative sign, economists said, was a 15 percent decline, to 753,000, in the number of people who quit their jobs last month, an indication of workers' judgment that it would be difficult to find a new one.
Also, job growth in services was just 57,000 in October, the second consecutive month in which the increase was below the monthly average over the last year, Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said in an appearance before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
Robert L. Marks of SOM Economics Inc. in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., was one of several analysts who found little significance in the 6-cent rise in average hourly earnings, the fourth significant advance in the last five months. This volatile series tends to jump in the first month of each quarter and, moreover, the 12-month rise is only 3 percent, he noted.
But others fretted about incipient wage inflation after figuring that hourly earnings had risen in the latest five months more than twice as fast as in the first five months of the year.
The Labor Department's survey of households showed an employment gain of 259,000 last month, which absorbed another very modest -- 57,000 -- rise in the labor force and cut the ranks of the unemployed by 202,000. As a result the unemployment rate, which must change slightly more than two-tenths of a point to be regarded as statistically significant, was calculated at 5.5 percent, the lowest since March, compared with 5.6 percent in August and September.
Among the largest states, the main changes were a decline of 1.3 points, to 5.1 percent, for Pennsylvania; a rise of 1.1 points, to 6.7 percent, for Florida; a decline of eight-tenths of a point, to 3.9 percent, for North Carolina, and a rise of six-tenths of a point for California, to 7.8 percent, that exactly offset September's decline.
The department has said it will stop its early reporting of the data for 11 large states in the new year if budget cuts force a reduction in sample sizes and thus make the results less reliable.
In another development, Commissioner Abraham announced that payrolls for March 1995 are now estimated to be 590,000 higher than previously thought, a benchmark revision, based on actual unemployment insurance reports, that would be somewhat higher than average.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Down on Profit Taking After a Week of Posting Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar retreated yesterday, hurt by weaker-than-expected economic news in the United States, a drop in the Mexican peso and traders who sold the dollar to lock in profits from its run-up during the week.
"The market clearly was going to consolidate," said Bob Near, vice president of the Bank of New York. "Then the baton was passed over to the Mexican peso problems, and people sold the dollar on that." 
 In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar fell to 103.90 Japanese yen from 104.02 yen on Thursday. The dollar also fell to 1.4160 German marks from 1.4232 marks and to 1.1392 Swiss francs from 1.1457 Swiss francs. The British pound slipped to $1.5787 from $1.5788.
The dollar first weakened after the Labor Department reported that the number of new jobs was far lower than expectations of at least 125,000. Payrolls grew by 116,000 in October, and the September figure was revised from 121,000 to 50,000. That suggested to many forecasters that the economy was slowing, a trend that would tend to diminish demand for dollars.
Just as the European markets were closing, the dollar retreated further on rumors of a possible military coup in Mexico. Many traders reacted to the rumors by dumping dollars in favor of marks and other European currencies.
The peso also weakened on the rumors, moving to 7.67 pesos to the dollar, from 7.35 on Wednesday. (Mexican financial markets were closed on Thursday for a national holiday). The peso later recovered, with the dollar settling at 7.365 pesos.
Even though the peso regained much of the lost ground yesterday after the coup rumors were found to be groundless, the damage to the dollar against the European currencies was already done.
Coupled with the strong gains the dollar had made through most of the week -- hitting six-week highs against the Japanese yen -- traders concluded that it was prudent to sell dollars going into the weekend, and the dollar fell further.
"The market just settled down," said Al Pugliesi, a foreign exchange trader for Bank Julius Baer in New York. "Nobody was willing to take dollars on a Friday."
The dollar might have fallen further, some traders said, if not for renewed concern about President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, who has been hospitalized for a week with heart trouble and was shown on Russian television yesterday. The uncertainties over Mr. Yeltsin have generated an underlying demand for dollars, a safe-haven currency.

HEADLINE: New York State Depends on Its Dairy Farmers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
After reading Richard Schrader's Oct. 28 letter about dairy policy and milk marketing, I suggest he visit a farm and see what's really going on. 
 The price New York dairy farmers get for their milk is no higher than it was a decade ago. Dairy farmers have already tightened their belts beyond the choking point.
Mr. Schrader claims dairy farmers get an average $42,000 annually from the Federal Government. I'm sure he would be surprised to learn that the Federal dairy program costs about $158 million a year -- which is more than covered by assessments paid by dairy farmers.
He would also be surprised to learn that dairy farmers work in excess of 80 hours a week and that the average net income of New York milk producers is less than $14,000 a year. Furthermore, the Federal milk programs have provided abundant supplies of low-cost dairy products for food giveaway programs.
The Federal market orders provide a stable market for dairy farmers and stable prices and supplies for consumers. The state's October price survey shows Upstate New York consumers paid $2.18 a gallon -- 1 cent less than the price Mr. Schrader said Wisconsin consumers are paying -- while New York City consumers spent $2.48. Instead of looking to blame Federal milk marketing orders, he should look within the city for the problem.
The loss of the Federal milk marketing orders would devastate New York dairy farms, reduce open space areas, including land in the New York City watershed, and severely reduce the $1.5 billion New York dairy farmers pump into the state economy. The economic shock waves from the loss of the Federal orders would be felt from the rural economies of the state all the way to New York City.

HEADLINE: J. Bradbury Thompson Dies; Designer and Art Director, 84

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
J. Bradbury Thompson, whose talent for graphic design and art direction left its mark on America's books, magazines and postage stamps and influenced generations of students who studied with him at Yale University, died on Wednesday at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. Mr. Thompson was 84, and lived in Riverside, Conn.
Mr. Thompson's work extended to such limited-edition books as a masterly lectern Bible, Stephen Crane's "Red Badge of Courage" and Herman Melville's "Typee"; to art and fashion magazines like Art News and Mademoiselle, and to the design of more than 120 United States postage stamps devoted to subjects like architecture, belles-lettres and history. 
 Because Mr. Thompson was the design coordinator of the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee from 1969 to 1978, his taste and influence extended beyond those stamps he created himself. These included 16 Christmas Stamps from Old Master paintings in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the "Love" series stamp with the word "Love" stacked five high and each "v" replaced by a heart, and United States Bicentennial stamps honoring George Washington, John Paul Jones and the Marquis de Lafayette.
Mr. Thompson's bold experiments with typography, photographic reproduction and color combined the best of traditional design and modernism. His strong sense of design, coupled with his belief in the power of the printed word, characterized his teaching to four decades of students at Yale, where he was a visiting professor of graphic arts from 1956 until ill health forced him to curtail his work there this year.
Many of Mr. Thompson's students went on to become art directors for well-known magazines, newspapers and corporations.
His artistic autobiography, "The Art of Graphic Design," was published by Yale University Press in 1988. It won the Art Libraries Society of North America's George Wittenborn Memorial Award as best art book of the year and was praised in The New York Times Book Review as a book in which "art and design are gloriously and daringly mixed."
Mr. Thompson, who was born in 1911 in Topeka, Kan., embarked on his career by designing yearbooks at Topeka High School and continued at Washburn College in Topeka. While working toward a bachelor's degree in economics in 1934, he was the editor and designer of the yearbook.
When he sent off copies of his work to Conde Nast's art director, he was encouraged to come East. Mr. Thompson arrived in New York City in 1938, and before long he was designing an official catalogue for the 1939-40 World's Fair.
With the outbreak of World War II, he went to work as art director for the Office of War Information's publications division, designing the magazines Victory, U.S.A. and America.
In 1938, Mr. Thompson began a 24-year association with the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company. The pages of its arts journal, Westvaco Inspirations, became a showcase of his experiments in typography, photographic reproduction and color.
In 1958, Mr. Thompson began designing the American Classic Book Series for Westvaco, using period typography and engravings in innovative designs for books like "The Red Badge of Courage" and "Typee."
From 1945 to 1959, he was the art director of Mademoiselle, where he hired many progressive artists to illustrate the magazine's strong fiction section, from Andy Warhol, who was then unknown, to Joan Miro, Willem de Kooning and Jasper Johns.
In all, Mr. Thompson designed or redesigned more than 35 magazines, including Business Week and the Harvard Business Review; in 1969, the Smithsonian Institution hired him to create the design for Smithsonian magazine, a classic format that has been maintained for more than a quarter of a century.
Mr. Thompson's work in mass-market books included Time-Life's "Library of Art" and "Foods of the World," both series that received design awards from the American Institute of Graphic Arts.
In 1969, Marshall Field 4th commissioned Mr. Thompson to create a great lectern Bible in the tradition of the Gutenberg folio edition. This resulted in what was widely regarded as Mr. Thompson's masterpiece: The Washburn College Bible, published by Oxford University Press in 1979 in a limited edition of 400 copies. Although Gutenberg's Bible was printed in columns of type of identical width, Mr. Thompson set the type of the Washburn College Bible in a flush-left, ragged-right format that allowed the lines of text to be printed in the phrases in which they were spoken.
Mr. Thompson was a recipient of the American Institute of Graphic Arts gold medal for lifetime achievement and the National Society of Art Directors Gold T-Square for career distinction, and was a member of the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame.
He is survived by his wife, Della Deen Dodge; two sons, Mark Thompson of Philadelphia and D. Dodge Thompson of Washington; two daughters, Leslie Keller of Cleveland and Elizabeth Riley of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.

HEADLINE: PROFILE;
Applying the Silber Standard to Boston U.

BYLINE: By David Barboza; David Barboza is writing a book on John R. Silber.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
It is just after 10 A.M., and John R. Silber, the tough-talking president of Boston University, is giving the incoming freshmen an earful.
"This is not Pinocchio's Pleasure Isle," he tells the class of 1999. "At Boston University, we take a very hard line on both alcohol and drugs. No drugs are allowed on this campus and you are not allowed to take alcohol into the dormitories. If you violate these rules, you will be subject to sanctions." 
 Mr. Silber adds that the university will not provide condoms in the dormitories. "If you are not smart enough to know how to use a condom and where to find one by the time you get to this university," he says, "you are too dumb to be here! We are not going to offer you lectures on 'safe sex,' because we don't know how much safer 'safe sex' is than just plain old sex. These are issues that, as far as we are concerned, are up to you as morally responsible adults."
Introductions like these are what Mr. Silber calls "reality therapy." They come from a man accustomed to harsh circumstances. His right arm, which ends at the elbow because of a birth defect, is always prominently displayed. And he expects others to be just as unflinching. He has been known to grill tenure candidates on their political views and churn out detailed critiques of their scholarship. In fact, his style harks back to the era of the commanding college president, like Harvard's Charles William Eliot in the late 19th century and the University of Chicago's Robert Maynard Hutchins in the 1930's and 40's. What sets Mr. Silberapart is what the Harvard sociologist David Riesman calls his "heroic indiscretions." Perhaps no other college president today is so admired for his boldness nor so savagely reviled for his arrogance.
"I don't wait for a plebiscite to find out who I am, what I am supposed to do, or whether I can hold my head up," said Mr. Silber, a wiry man of 69. "I know where my moral North Star is."
He has, however, sought public endorsement in a role not often pursued by a college president: In 1990, he ran for Governor of Massachusetts as a conservative Democrat, losing by only a narrow margin to William F. Weld. And he seems not to have lost his taste for public office. Last year he lobbied hard to become Boston's Superintendent of Schools, although the Mayor, Thomas M. Menino, eventually considered him too risky a choice. A man as outspoken as Mr. Silber, he indicated in published reports, would perhaps not have the diplomatic skills for the post.
While Mr. Silber's supporters consider him a man of great moral courage, his detractors say he is a tyrant who has enriched himself through his board of trustees. They point out that he is the nation's highest-paid college president, with total 1993-94 earnings of $564,000, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education's latest survey. In comparison, the president of M.I.T. earned $337,000, and the president of Harvard received $278,000.
"He came up from Texas a poor boy with a cardboard suitcase and now he's a millionaire," said Richard Rapacz, a retired professor of education at Boston University. "People don't know you can steal a university, but he did."
Financial operations at the university have raised questions. Three years ago, Mr. Silber and the university's trustees were the subjects of a lengthy investigation by Scott Harshbarger, the Massachusetts Attorney General, concerning charges of financial improprieties. Among the concerns were contracts between the university and the companies represented by various members of the board of trustees, and whether Mr. Silber had personally profited from university business. The investigation found that Mr. Silber had received a $386,700 bonus from the trustees in 1989 as a reward for his work on the sale of Seradyn Inc., a university-owned biotechnology company, to Mitsubishi. Mr. Silber explained that he had returned the bonus in 1991 and, in the end, Mr. Harshbarger said no laws were broken. But he did press the trustees to enact new conflict-of-interest policies because of the appearance of unsound business practices.
Mr. Silber said simply: "The facts speak for themselves. Harshbarger came up with nothing but a smear."
For all the controversy Mr. Silber engenders, there is one point on which his supporters and his critics would probably agree: John Robert Silber does not shy from a challenge. Born in San Antonio, he is the younger of the two sons of Paul Silber, a German-born architect whose business collapsed during the Depression, and Jewel Silber, a schoolteacher. His parents, Mr. Silber says, were stern but loving. His mother tailored his clothes to expose his deformed arm, and his father held him to the same standards as his brother. As a result, he says, he hardened himself to the schoolyard bullies who called him "One-armed Pete." Today, he often uses the toelike projection on the end of his right arm to grasp his briefcase.
Raised a Presbyterian, and deeply religious as a young man, Mr. Silber enrolled at Trinity University in San Antonio, where he met his future wife, the former Kathryn Underwood. After graduating with honors, he tried divinity school and then law school before deciding to pursue a doctorate in philosophy at Yale, where he became acquainted with the writings of Immanuel Kant. Reading Kant, he said, persuaded him to build his ethical life on reason rather than the religious guilt that arose from his Calvinist background.
"It changed my virtue from an impure act of contrition to a pure act of contrition," he said. "I regretted failing to live up to things, not out of fear of hell or hope of heaven, but just out of the rightness or wrongness of it."
After getting his Ph.D. in 1955, Mr. Silber returned to his home state, where he rose from professor of philosophy at the University of Texas in Austin to department chairman and, finally, in 1967, dean. But after a power struggle with Frank C. Erwin, the chairman of the board of regents, over Mr. Erwin's plans to split the College of Arts and Sciences into three separate schools, Mr. Silber was asked to resign as dean in 1970. He was wooed almost immediately to his current home, and there he has stayed. At a time when college presidents serve, on average, seven years, Mr. Silber has led Boston University for a quarter-century. Only Charles E. Young of the University of California at Los Angeles has served longer.
Mr. Silber has revealed, though, that his presidency is winding down. Last April, a committee he set up selected his provost, Jon N. Westling, as his eventual successor, even though Mr. Silber has not yet set a date for retirement. Not surprisingly, this choice, too, has become controversial. Some faculty members say that the president engineered the selection of Mr. Westling, who is his longtime aide. They also note that although Mr. Westling is a former Rhodes scholar, he never completed work on his doctorate. Meanwhile, retirement from the presidency does not necessarily mean Mr. Silber's departure. When he steps down, the board of trustees is expected to name him university chancellor, a position to be created especially for him.
In a series of interviews in his wood-paneled office overlooking the Charles River, Mr. Silber was at once charming and volatile. Although he bristled at even the slightest criticism, he moved easily into quoting Shakespeare or Dylan Thomas, or reciting a poem by Yeats, imitating the poet's wispy cadences. He often illustrated his points with sketches -- showing off some artistic talents from his youth -- and occasionally, he lighted a cigar and paced impatiently. He is a man of many moods, and periodically his temper flared with a thundering denunciation of his critics.
Mr. Silber insists, for example, that there is a "natural aristocracy" of intelligence and reason, and argues that American universities are not supposed to be democratic institutions.
"The hospital is not a democracy," he said. "You mean, when we come into the operating theater, the surgeon is supposed to ask the nurses: 'What do you think I ought to do next? How many are in favor of my making the incision here?' No, the decision is made on the basis of the exalted competence of the surgeon. You don't go out in the hall and say, 'Let's get a couple of janitors and see what they think about it.' "
Mr. Silber's critics say he looms large over the life of the university, but he dismisses such talk as jealousy, pettiness and the rantings of what he calls "second raters," who simply refuse to acknowledge "the greatest transformation in the history of higher education." By insisting on excellence, he says, he has been able to lure to his faculty some of the best and brightest. They include three Nobel Prize winners -- Saul Bellow, Derek Walcott and Elie Wiesel -- as well as Christopher Ricks of the English department (formerly the King Edward VII Professor at Cambridge University) and the composer Lukas Foss. He is proud of what he calls a "murderer's row" of great poets: Mr. Walcott, Robert Pinsky, Rosanna Warren and Geoffrey Hill, the Englishman whom Harold Bloom of Yale calls "the best living poet."
To attract such scholars, Mr. Silber has sometimes offered lavish salaries. For instance, in 1984, on the recommendation of Sheldon Glashow, a Nobel laureate at Harvard, he spent $5 million to lure a team of physicists from the University of Michigan.
"The tectonic plates in Boston are shifting," Mr. Silber said, looking out across the Charles River toward Harvard and M.I.T. "There are now three great universities on the Charles."
Mr. Silber doubted, however, that the Ivy League would acknowledge the achievements of Boston University, which was founded as a Methodist seminary in 1839. "There are not only glass ceilings for some women," he said, "but there are also glass ceilings for some institutions, and you simply have to butt your head up against that ceiling and break it."
Independent ratings bolster Mr. Silber's claims. In the National Research Council's 1995 study of graduate education, Boston University ranked in the top 40 schools in nine liberal arts categories. Moreover, its economics faculty ranks eighth in productivity, according to a 1995 University of Texas survey that rated department faculties by the times their members had published in prestigious journals.
"I don't think there's anything quite as dramatic as what they have in economics," said Dale Jorgenson, the chairman of Harvard's economics department. "It's a great success story, and John Silber has to get a lot of credit."
Part of Boston University's success can be seen in numbers. While Harvard, Yale and Columbia have had deficits in recent years, Mr. Silber has balanced his university's budget 24 years in a row. The university's current endowment is $416 million, up from $18 million in 1971, and the university now attracts significant Federal support. According to the National Science Foundation, Boston University received $102 million in Federal funds for research and development in 1993, the last year for which figures are available. That statistic puts it in 27th place among the nation's top research institutions, up from 77th place in 1971 and above Princeton, the University of Chicago and Emory.
Boston University has also become more competitive, even in the face of rising college costs. (Tuition, excluding room and board, now stands at $19,420, making the university as expensive as many Ivy League schools.) Last year, for instance, the university received 23,600 applications for its 4,400-member freshmen class, up from 10,000 applications in 1975. Moreover, the average combined S.A.T. score of this year's incoming freshmen is 1,158, 248 points above the national average.
And the university continues to grow. Under Mr. Silber's leader-
ship, it has nearly tripled its property holdings and financed over $700 million in new construction. Mr. Silber has also created a number of profit-making enterprises on campus, including several university-run convenience stores, a glitzy food court and a 60,000-square-foot bookstore. The bookstore, now operated by Barnes & Noble, should net the university a $10 million profit over five years, he said.
Arthur G. B. Metcalf, chairman emeritus of Boston University's board of trustees, called Mr. Silber a "visionary" who has saved the university from bankruptcy. "He had to do a lot of things that were unpopular," Mr. Metcalf said. "John Silber is not a nice Nellie or a doormat. He doesn't suffer fools gladly. If someone asks a question, they'll get a frank answer and it may not be a diplomatic answer."
Mr. Silber is the first to acknowledge that his reforms were harsh. But when he arrived in January 1971, he said, the university was like a patient near death, and he warned the trustees: "The surgery will be radical, and the patient may not survive. But he is certainly not going to survive without radical intervention." Within a year, he discovered that the university finances were heading toward an $8.8 million deficit and inaugurated a period of retrenchment that lasted for the better part of five years.
One of Mr. Silber's budget cuts concerned faculty members he considered "dead wood." He called his strategy "creative exportation," and said he told his deans: "See how many times you can transfer a faculty member from this university to another university, such that you can improve both institutions. We have plenty of second-rate professors in this university who would be ornaments at lesser colleges and universities, but who are a drag on this one."
Although Mr. Silber's presidency has been less volatile in recent years, faculty tenure continues to be a thorny issue. Recently, Mr. Silber overrode the university's tenure committee, which had voted 14 to 1 in favor of Michael Lynch, a sociology professor.
"It's an autocracy there," said Mr. Lynch, who now teaches at Brunel University in London. "There are a lot of disgruntled people at B.U. because their decisions are batted down by the higher-ups who think they're smarter than everybody else. The bottom line is that I had to write to please Silber and his staff. And I don't think that's academic freedom."
Mr. Silber countered that he had read Mr. Lynch's book "Scientific Practice and Ordinary Action," which recently won the Robert K. Merton Award from the American Sociological Association, and concluded that it was not very good. "He was writing in an area that I am very competent in, and that man's writing was just plain jargon," he said. "I'll stand by that decision." Arguing that the "two ablest members" of the sociology department were against tenure for Mr. Lynch, Mr. Silber summed up his opinion: "When you have a bunch of third raters saying 'yes' and two first raters saying 'no,' you go with the first raters."
Other areas have been contentious as well. Michael Manove, a professor of economics at Boston University, agrees with the president's admirers that he has increased the school's visibility, but Mr. Manove says that Mr. Silber has also damaged its credibility by promoting risky investment strategies and forming close business ties with members of the board of trustees.
"He is our Lenin and our Stalin," Mr. Manove says. "Perhaps the revolution was necessary, but what has followed is its undoing."
James Iffland, the former head of the faculty council, said: "It's almost as if you're living in some kind of banana republic. The bottom line on Silber is he doesn't know how to lead, he knows how to control."
Mr. Silber doesn't take such accusations lightly. In a faculty meeting a few years ago, he accused the faculty council of using "spin doctor techniques" in its reports and sharply criticized Mr. Iffland for circulating charges from anonymous sources. "I don't know what is more distressing," he told the group, "that Professor Iffland does not understand the moral and intellectual squalor of faceless accusations, or that he understands it and carries it on nevertheless." After the meeting broke up, Mr. Iffland said Mr. Silber approached him and began shouting at him, calling him a "liar and a coward." Then, Mr. Iffland said, the president stared him down and declared, "It's a shame the institution of dueling was abolished."
 But if Mr. Silber has sometimes alienated his faculty, he has consistently won over the people who count: the members of the board of trustees. Many of them are prominent in business - they include John F. Smith Jr., the president and chief executive of General Motors; Allen I. Questrom, the chairman of Federated Department Stores, and Karen Elliott House, president of a Dow Jones & Company operating group - and have praised Mr. Silber's entrepreneurial skills.
 "At Boston University, we have generated over the 24 years around $274 million in surpluses," Mr. Silber said. "Why should the board of trustees disagree with that? That's pretty good." In fact, it has been so good that last May the board awarded Mr. Silber an honorary degree, noting that in transforming the institution he had become "the rarest of public men."
 His supporters say his private life is just as distinguished. "There are many private, unrecorded charities of John that he wouldn't want anyone to know about," said Ketih Botsford, a friend and a Boston University professor. "Away from the university, away from contention, there is another John, a largely amiable, affable, funny man. And yet he is irritated with a world not going exactly as it ought to. He lives under high pressure and makes great demands on himself."
 Those demands include heading a large family. Mr. Silber and his wife, who has devoted her life to taking care of the couple's children, have raised six daughters, one son and two children who joined the household after their own parents, neighbors of the Silbers', died.
 "I can't think of anyone I'd rather be on my side if I got in trouble," said Kathryn Silber of her husband. "He's so generous. When anyone's in trouble he wants to help." The couple's son, David, an actor, died of AIDS in
their home last December at the age of 41, and the family's friends say that Mr. Silber supported him unstintingly and delivered a moving eulogy at his funeral.
"I think he's a really kind-hearted person," Mrs. Silber said. "I really do." But, she added, "When you come in and make tough decisions, you do make some people unhappy. He's not really tactful sometimes in the way he talks, and that's fine with me; I think that makes for some very interesting dialogue."
Mr. Silber insists that his ultimate concern has always been the students. By making their experience tougher, he said, "you make it easier." He added: "I want to encourage their virtue, and I can't do it by pandering to them. I can't by accommodating their willfulness and accommodating their ignorance. Now that may come across as hardness or as hostility. As a matter of fact, it's grounded upon genuine compassion."

HEADLINE: Classroom Journal: Am I Really Ready for This?;
A college freshman finds in independent living a 'revelation.'

BYLINE: BY CHANA SCHOENBERGER 

 BODY:
I THOUGHT THE HARDEST PART ABOUT MOVing away from home for college would be sharing a bathroom with the three strangers who would be my roommates.
Instead, what I've found in the first few months of my freshman year at Harvard University is that the difficulty lies in becoming totally independent, from buying my own toothpaste to weighing the comparative merits of used textbooks versus new ones. My entire support system -- family, friends who have known me for years, high school teachers to whom I looked for advice, my Jewish youth group -- is back in Bethesda, Md., close enough for occasional phone calls, of course, but no longer in my everyday life. 
 In September, during "shopping week," when entering students here visit different classes to help them decide what to take, I began to realize the difference between high school and college. In my small private school, I knew most of the teachers and all of the administrators, and I had at least one friend who had taken every class I planned to take. When it came to choosing classes, there were no surprises and hardly any choices; I took the same six subjects every year.
At Harvard, I intend to major in social studies, but when I arrived for shopping week, no one could tell me what aspiring social studies majors should take to prepare themselves. (My parents could quote my high school's course book from memory.) Harvard's 788-page Official Register, with its thousands of courses and complex numbering system, offered no guidance. For the first time, I was entirely on my own.
So I visited classes, trying out five history and government classes for a single slot on my schedule. I finally decided on four courses: the basic economics sequence, a physics class that would satisfy a core curriculum requirement, expository writing (also required) and a Government class taught by three big-name professors. Whatever I learn in these classes will be added to the lesson I picked up choosing them: Advice, when you can find it, is only valuable up to a certain point, after which you have to decide for yourself.
This goes for life outside the classroom, too, of course. At first, the complete lack of an adult presence was a revelation to me. My parents, who insisted on a midnight curfew up until the day I left for school, had been constantly involved in everything I ever did. They even helped me pick out my prom dress. At college, however, I can stay out until 3 A.M. ("school nights" aren't an issue), oversleep and miss my economics lecture. Nobody's watching. If I do poorly on that week's set of economics problems, I have no one to blame but myself.
I can eat nothing but Lucky Charms and skim milk, as my roommate Mary does. I can fling butter at the ceiling of the Freshman Union cafeteria in hopes of getting it to stick, as the football jocks do. When I come home from class and I have an hour to spare, it's up to me to make the mature decision and do some assigned reading.
I'm also learning that self-reliance has its limits. "You don't learn to be self-sufficient, not freshman year," said Ben, an upperclassman and a friend of one of my roommates. "You learn who to ask for what you need. You learn to be self-motivatedly dependent."
I have followed his advice. I actually visit my professors and teaching fellows during their office hours. When I do my physics problems, I work with friends from the class.
Having to make an entire new set of friends is terrifying. During Freshman Week, before classes started, I went from mixer to mindless mixer, shaking hundreds of hands and asking the Three Freshman Questions: "What's your name? Where are you from? Which dorm are you in?" Some days during my first few weeks, I walked clear across campus without seeing a single person I knew. Even the people who became my close friends (in September, "close friend" meant my roommates, the people in my dorm and anyone I saw more than once a day) were people I didn't really know very well.
I've had to think about dating in a new way, too. Two words sum up the difference between going out in high school and going out in college: proximity. You can see the guy you're dating four times a day -- eat with him, study together, go out afterwards. Wherever he lives, it's nearby. He knows your roommates; he's around them a lot. You know the guys your roommates are dating; you're around them a lot. It helps if you all get along.
Finally, there's the question of food. I keep kosher and am therefore a functional vegetarian when I'm eating out. But the Freshman Union's nightly vegetarian dinners range from the awful to the inedible. Occasionally, I may have a salad, which translates into a few bites of lettuce and a piece of dehydrated broccoli.
But usually I eat starch three times a day: cereal for breakfast, a cheese sandwich for lunch and pasta for dinner. I'm terrified that I'll gain the freshman 15.
But I'm definitely adjusting. By now, my roommates and I are real friends. My schedule is working. I finally remember where I put the bottles of Advil when I moved in. I've found the late-night coffee shops. Over Thanksgiving break, I expect, I'll have to adjust to being home again.

HEADLINE: MONDERU-SAN'S LAST CAMPAIGN

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; Nicholas D. Kristof is the Tokyo bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
EARLIER THIS YEAR, Walter F. Mondale stayed at a famous traditional inn in the ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto. As is customary, Mondale and his wife, Joan, were each given a yukata, or light kimono, to wear while they stayed in the inn. So Mondale disrobed and packed his bulky frame into the yukata, carefully tucking the right side over the left.
He walked into the banquet room with the former Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, and his wife, Kayoko -- and the Japanese began to laugh. 
 The Japanese traditionally wear the kimono with the left side tucked over the right. But when used to dress a dead body, the kimono is arranged the opposite way, so Mondale was walking into the banquet inadvertently dressed as a corpse.
Learning the proper way to wear a yukata has been part of the education of the Mondales since he became Ambassador to Japan two years ago. "The most important relationship in the world," as Mondale and his predecessors alike call the American-Japanese partnership, is in a state of flux and uncertainty following the end of the cold war. Japan is impatient with its "little brother" role. It wants to grow up and get a Security Council seat and have an independent foreign policy and do the other things big countries do, and it has been engaged in a series of bitter disputes with the United States about trade and economics.
This relationship will become a focus of attention later this month, when President Clinton is scheduled to visit Japan. Clinton is preparing to participate in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Osaka -- a bit like a G-7 summit meeting of the leading industrialized countries, except that participants are all from the Pacific Rim and mostly represent economies growing twice as quickly as those of the G-7 nations. Then Clinton plans to travel to Tokyo for wide-ranging discussions with Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.
Mondale's dream had been to participate in such meetings, and he will this time -- albeit not as President but as Presidential envoy. He has played a key role in preparing for the talks and in smoothing over crises that threaten to undermine them. The most recent erupted when three American servicemen in Okinawa were accused of kidnapping a 12-year-old girl, binding her with adhesive tape and gang-raping her. The incident has inflamed smoldering resentment at the American military presence in Japan and has raised calls for the closing of the American military bases in Okinawa. Late last month, 50,000 or more people took to the streets to protest the rape and to demand an American withdrawal from at least some bases.
While most Japanese officials want the American military presence to continue, the rape trial, which is to begin this week, is helping to jeopardize a strand of the Japanese-American relationship that Mondale has worked passionately to preserve: the military partnership. Mondale apologized publicly for the rape -- he is one of the best apologizers in the diplomatic world, and his remarks helped to soothe tensions -- but the tensions that the rape provoked will take months to work out fully.
Mondale, at first glance, is poorly prepared to serve as the President's emissary to Japan at such a crucial time. As a Senator from Minnesota, and then as Vice President under Jimmy Carter, Mondale was interested primarily in domestic affairs rather than foreign policy. He never focused on trade or international economic affairs. And although Mondale arrived hoping to learn some basic Japanese, a language so fiendishly complex that it has been described as the greatest barrier to human communication ever devised, he gave that up after one lesson. The only reference to Japan in his biography (now translated into Japanese and selling in the bookstores) is an incident when he was a boy during World War II. He made an ugly comment about "Japs," and his father reprimanded him, saying of the Japanese, "They are individuals under God just like us."
Nevertheless, Mondale has fit in well in Tokyo almost from the moment he donned a morning suit and traveled in a horse-drawn carriage to call on Emperor Akihito to present his credentials. He has cultivated a network of Japanese contacts, pressed the Japanese to open their markets further and worked the scrambler phone ceaselessly to keep a channel open between Tokyo and policy makers in Washington. Some Americans in Tokyo say they would prefer a Japanese-speaker and expert on Japan in the Ambassador's office, but almost everyone acknowledges that Mondale is a good argument for Big Cheese ambassadors.
Monderu-san, as he is known in Japan, is the most powerful foreigner in the country these days. He was deeply involved in this year's effort to improve access to the Japanese market for American cars and auto parts, and he is constantly advising Washington on how to pursue other trade issues. But perhaps more important for the long run, he has emerged as a leading spokesman for close security ties between the United States and Japan and especially for an expansion of student-exchange programs so that more Americans can live in Japan and learn Japanese while they are young.
There are not that many ways a former Vice President can feel useful, and being the Ambassador to Japan is one way he can remain active and important -- and enjoy perks like a $100 million mansion that comes with a pool and a vast garden, not to mention a residential staff of 16.
"Life here is very enjoyable," Mondale says as he relaxes in his spacious office, decorated with posters and photographs from a life in politics. It is a bit odd for Americans who remember Mondale as the boy politician -- Minnesota's Attorney General at 32 and Senator at 37, Vice President at 49 -- to see him now, at 67, as a gray-haired elder statesman.
He was an icon of American liberalism, a bleeding heart in the days when it was still respectable to be one. Mondale was not telegenic, and that may have been one reason he was soundly defeated by Ronald Reagan in the 1984 Presidential election. But to his fans, his difficulties with television only confirmed his sincerity and honesty. In an age of television packaging, Mondale made a terrible product, partly because his best-known campaign promise was to raise taxes.
In person, Mondale comes across as everything he does not on the screen: warm, personable and relaxed. He seems comfortable with his own status now, perhaps because he no longer has his eye on the Oval Office.
"This is a nice time of my life," he says. "I have no political aspirations, and haven't for some time. I find this to be a cure -- there's no medicine for it -- because I know I won't ever run for anything again. So this is a way of being in public life, doing something different and in a strange way having a kind of independent operation here."
Mondale has given up not only on learning the Japanese language but also on certain Japanese customs. The Japanese bow a dozen times a day, the degree of incline carefully calibrated to the status of the other party, but Mondale does no more than nod. "A Minnesota bow," he calls it. Similarly, just about everybody in Japan hands out business cards at meetings, except the Emperor and Empress (not only would it be undignified, but they don't have a last name). But as an "omono" -- literally, a "venerable being" -- Mondale leaves his cards at home.
Since he knows much less about Japan than does his staff at the embassy, many of whom speak excellent Japanese and would not be caught alive with their kimonos tucked right over left, Mondale is at his best when using his considerable political skills to push the American agenda. He is charming but forceful in pressing Japan to open its markets, and he exudes prestige.
Mondale as a politician was an oddity in that he was always a conciliator, never a polarizer. "The thing that is most evident about Mondale is that he's nonabrasive," said Hubert H. Humphrey, his fellow Minnesotan and patron. This skill for peacemaking makes Mondale's adjustment to diplomacy easier than it would be for many politicians.
Still, there is no question that in some ways Japan has been a monumental disappointment for Mondale. He arrived at a very hopeful time, shortly after the collapse of a system that had kept the Liberal Democratic Party in power for 38 years straight. It looked as if Japan were undergoing a revolution. There was hope that red tape and bureaucracy would come crashing down, easing the way for a flood of American goods.
No wonder Mondale said, before he arrived in Tokyo, that he wanted "a more dignified relationship" based on something more than fistfights about trade. He said then that he had not been drawn back into public service to spend his time badgering Japan over semiconductors and wood products.
And then the Japanese revolution collapsed. Hosokawa resigned after being tarred by scandal. Within a year, the Liberal Democrats had effectively returned to power. Mondale found that his appeals to open markets were stonewalled, just as similar appeals had been for decades before. He seemed to those around him to drop into what his former boss, Jimmy Carter, might have called a deep malaise.
"There was just a businessman in my office from New York," he tells his assistant, Andrew Myers, as he stands in the corridor outside his office. "He's trying to sell medical equipment here. He's been buying equipment here for years, and now with the high yen, he's trying to sell as well. But he just can't get in." Mondale sighs and turns to a visitor. "I hear that story 10 times a day."
Mondale grew increasingly frustrated as time passed. One of his ancestors in Norway, before his great-grandfather left the eponymous Mundal village in 1856 for America, is said to have been a seventh-century chieftain who consolidated power by inviting rivals to a banquet in a building with one door and no windows. When the guests were all drunk, the host excused himself and locked the door -- and then burned the building to the ground. Asked if he was ever tempted to try the same tactic during arduous trade negotiations, Mondale smiles enthusiastically. "It came pretty close," he says.
It was during this irritating period of Japanese political paralysis that Mondale apparently decided that he would be more than an elder-statesman Ambassador. He waded in and twisted the arms of Japanese officials. The man who once curled up his lip at the idea of badgering the Japanese about microchips has lately been badgering the Japanese about cars, air freight and Kodak film.
In Mondale's office, as in his home, there is a telephone console that enables him to make scrambled calls to Administration officials without the risk of Japanese eavesdropping. Among the speed-dial buttons, the one labeled "Kantor" is near the top, well above "Christopher."
Of course, Mondale does talk regularly to Warren Christopher, the Secretary of State, as well as occasionally to President Clinton. But he seems to talk most to Mickey Kantor, the trade negotiator. And that, in turn, perhaps says something about the Administration and its emphasis on trade as a central element of foreign policy.
"The way in which we connect with each other in the post-cold-war world is increasingly based on trade and investment, international economics," Kantor says. "Ambassador Mondale understands this as well as anybody, and he has tried to change that embassy to be more responsive to and have personnel trained with regard to economic issues and trade issues."
Kantor and Mondale go way back, to 1969, and Kantor describes the Ambassador as a mentor as well as a friend. "I value his input almost more than that of anybody else," he says.
During the auto talks, Mondale was a major force in determining strategy, as well as applying pressure on the Japanese Government and the heads of the auto companies. Some Japanese believe, however, that Mondale misread the situation -- partly because he listens to trade hawks -- and advised Washington that the Japanese were more willing to compromise than they actually were. That, they believe, is why the negotiations reached a dangerous impasse before a final round of talks in Geneva at the end of June, when both sides finally retreated and declared victory.
Mondale was in the fray throughout. During a break in a World War II memorial service in Okinawa, he met with Japan's Trade Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, to work out the last-chance meeting in Geneva. Then he met secretly with Shoichiro Toyoda, the chairman of the Toyota Motor Corporation, to discuss Toyota's plans for voluntary purchases from America and how this could be used to avert sanctions.
During the final hours, he stayed up all night to remain in telephone contact with Kantor and other negotiators in Geneva. The final agreement, a package of steps that will make it somewhat easier to sell cars and parts in Japan, was reached in the early morning, Tokyo time, and Mondale stayed up to watch television coverage of the pact. Shortly after 7 A.M., Japan's Foreign Minister, Yohei Kono, called to invite him over for a victory breakfast in the nearby Okura Hotel.
"It was terrific," Mondale said a few hours later, his eyes still puffy from lack of sleep. "We had a great time. And I think we have a good trade agreement." The bottom line, he said, is that the deal will mean far more sales of American auto parts and vehicles in Japan, and thus more jobs in America. And he argues that progress in reducing the American trade deficit with Japan will in turn foster a much healthier overall relationship between the two countries.
"If we've made important progress in autos, that removes one of the most contentious issues," Mondale said. "You know, I remember the semiconductor agreement -- a few years ago, that was one of the biggest issues, but now the heat has come out of it. Every time you solve one of these hard problems, one of these basic areas, you take some of the heat out of the trade relationship."
Conversely, the case can be made that one of the most important consequences of the auto negotiations was to bolster the side of Japanese nationalists who argue against caving in to American pressure. Hashimoto, the Trade Minister, is a master of kendo, or Japanese fencing, and keeps his equipment ostentatiously in his huge office, as if to challenge any impertinent American to a duel at a moment's notice. Throughout the negotiations, Hashimoto took a consistently tough line, and it helped him politically, so that this fall he became Deputy Prime Minister and head of the Liberal Democratic Party, the nation's biggest political party. He thus stands an excellent chance of becoming Prime Minister and incorporating his tough negotiating style into the broad range of relations with the United States. American diplomats who butted heads with Hashimoto over trade may now butt heads with him over security issues as well.
In speeches and meetings, Mondale constantly tells Japanese officials that it is in Japan's own interest to deregulate and open up its markets. But while officials often agree in principle, changing specific regulations is a grueling process. Sometimes the interest groups that will be most affected by the new rules are effectively in charge of drafting the changes, and the bureaucracy often leads the Parliament, or Diet, instead of the other way around.
"In the Diet, when you see bureaucrats also participating in the debates, answering questions, preparing amendments, preparing the budgets, you realize that this is a society in which the publicly elected side is very limited," Mondale says. Political change will come, he believes, but very slowly.
"This has been the toughest part of my job, without any question," he says. "Boy, trying to get a more open Japan economically has been very difficult. You can talk forever, but you don't get anywhere. I keep looking for some way of getting it done, but I haven't been able to find it."
Despite his frustrations with Japan's trade restrictions, Mondale wishes that the United States would learn from Japan in some other respects. Japan's savings rate, for example, is several times higher than that of the United States. And the safety of Japanese streets and the absence of guns are also worth pondering, he says.
"I believe the U.S. is too violent and has too many guns," Mondale says. "It's no longer just a domestic issue. I think it cuts across America's moral authority in the world. Maybe we have something to learn from Japan about how people are raised to prevent violence, to be more thoughtful toward one another."
As a former Vice President, Mondale is hugely respected in Japan. In the Japanese culture, "retired" executives sometimes still run companies they have quit, and "retired" politicians control prime ministers. The Japanese know that Mondale is no longer at the center of power, but he is undoubtedly appreciated more in Tokyo than in Washington.
Yet he has been less active on the rubber-fish lecture circuit and less prominent in the public eye than his predecessor, Michael Armacost. Mondale has invested much of his time in diplomatic functions and behind-the-scenes meetings and has been less energetic and less visible than Armacost was in calling on Japan to change its ways. Armacost's tactics were not popular -- he was nicknamed Mr. Gaiatsu, or Mr. Foreign Pressure -- but they did have an impact in helping set the public agenda. Mondale is better liked but less conspicuous.
Mondale does make some public appearances, of course, and he seems to thrive on meeting young people. During a recent question-and-answer session at Keio University in Tokyo, the question that engaged him the most was why more Americans are not studying in Japan.
"If we could get many, many more Americans over here as high-school students living in homes, it would make a tremendous difference," Mondale replied. But he cited various problems, including Japanese Government restrictions on branch campuses of American universities.
The gap in students is something that deeply troubles Mondale, and he often notes that 45,000 Japanese study at American universities while only 1,700 Americans study in Japan. The American Embassy is studying ways to boost the number of Americans studying in Japan, and negotiations are under way on some proposals to open the doors.
"I'd like to see 50,000 American students over here, starting at the high-school level," Mondale said at Keio. "I feel very strongly that that's the most important thing. Politicians and diplomats deal with what is there. All we can do is kind of move the chairs around the table a little bit. Your generation can move the whole thing, by opening up, by coming to know each other better, by learning each other's languages and cultures."

HEADLINE: The Lake District

 BODY:
To the Editor: For newcomers to this beautiful corner of England, it serves neither economy nor comfort to sleep cheaply and dine expensively. Ms. Spano could have joined the Youth Hostels Association, which, including her membership for one year, would have provided more comfortable if somewhat less Spartan conditions, and breakfast and dinner for $25 a day. Or she could have used one of the many bed-and-breakfast hotels throughout Keswick, Borrowdale and Buttermere for very little more than her average cost of $39 a day. 
 A little prior research, by purchasing a copy of A. Wainright's guide "The Central Fells" (Michael Joseph, London), available from larger New York City bookstores, would have counseled her on wearing two pairs of socks in her boots to avoid blisters and on buying Bartholomew's one-inch map (easier to follow than the Ordnance Survey Map). Mr. Wainright's walking guides are bibles to the fell walkers and offer incisive information along with easy-to-follow routes and drawings and would have saved Ms. Spano that four-hour slog along the busy shore road of Lake Derwent Water in favor of a relaxing and scenic trip on the lake steamer from Keswick to Ashness Bridge for Watendlath. En route the boat stops at High Brandlehow, once the home of Sir Hugh Walpole, which I mention only because as she enjoyed her tea, scones, jam and thick clotted Devon cream in the tea shop she apparently did not notice a plaque: "This is the home of Judith Paris, heroine of the novels of Hugh Walpole."
 
BERNARD J. CUNLIFFE
Sparta, N.J.
 
Susan Spano responds: The Buttermere Youth Hostel, Derwent Water launch, a B &B in Keswick for $25 a night, and Alfred Wainwright were all mentioned in the article. I got blisters not for lack of an extra pair of socks but because my boots needed breaking in, and I would never call the walk along the beautiful east side of Derwent Water a slog. Finally, though the barns where I stayed offered few amenities, which I wanted to make perfectly clear, walking between them was for me a wonderful experience.

HEADLINE: Politically Correct? Perish the Thought!

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
HE is the co-author of several children's books, one of which, "My Brother Sam Is Dead," is usually getting banned somewhere on the contention it is too profane and excessively violent.
He thinks that public school education, particularly when it comes to teaching history, runs the gamut from deplorable to terrible. 
 And he doesn't think Nathan Hale should have been designated as Connecticut's official state hero.
Is this some spokesman for the anti-education lobby or a radical who wants to rewrite history to his own liking? No, not really. In fact, not even close.
He is Christopher Collier, professor of history at the University of Connecticut and official historian of the state of Connecticut. An author, scholar, swimmer, hockey player, water skier, figure skater, even trumpet player, Mr. Collier is a man of many parts, and certainly of many opinions.
At home in Orange, in a lovingly restored 18th-century home where he lives with his wife, Bonnie, a librarian at Yale, Christopher Collier fits the image of the man of academia, surrounded by books and graceful furniture.
Then he starts to talk and the Mr. Chips image starts to implode. This is no tweedy educator selecting his words slowly and carefully, as if he were addressing a class of freshmen. This is a man of opinions, freely stated. The words come tumbling out on any subject that happens to come up, none excluded. On some subjects he happens to be more passionate than others. Historical revisionism, for instance. He's for it.
"All historians are revisionists," he said. "They change as new evidence comes to light."
What he disagrees with, very much so, is with people who revise history simply to make it more acceptable, to soften it up, even to deny some things ever happened or some words were ever used: the N word for instance.
Mr. Collier often has used the loathed word in the historical novels for children that he writes with his brother, James Lincoln Collier. It is the word, of course, also sprinkled through Mark Twain's "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," a more famous work banned now and again because of it.
The two Colliers use the word in their books, Christopher Collier said, because it was a common word in the America of the 18th and 19th centuries and indeed much later.
The Colliers explained in an addendum to one of their books, "Who Is Carrie?" that they had to consider very carefully the use of the word because they know it is offensive to modern readers "but it would have been a distortion of history to avoid its use entirely."
In any case, the sometime-banning of "My Brother Sam Is Dead," the story of a Connecticut boy caught up in the Revolutionary era conflict of his Tory father and his rebel brother Sam, has not affected the prestige, or sales, of the book since it was published in 1974.
It received accolades from the start (one reviewer said it "assumes for once that children can think"), was named of a Newbery Honor Book and has sold more than 1.5 million copies to date.
What bothers Christopher Collier perhaps even more than people who distort history for acceptability is how badly he believes history is being taught today.
"I know some superb teachers, but generally teaching is mediocre to terrible in elementary schools," he said. "Some teachers are teaching American history with only one semester of it in college, which is all that is required. We've fought to make it two semesters and that should be the minimum for anyone teaching it."
He is no great admirer of public education as it is today in general, certainly not of what he considers to be less than a substantial effort put forth by many teachers. "We need a more professional attitude," he said. "Teachers should be working 50 to 80 hours a week and then rest in the summer, which they get off anyway. If we're paying them $50,000 to $60,000 a year, they should be willing to do this."
One thing that particularly disturbs him, he said, is the lack of writing assignments, a lack he traces to the reluctance of high school teachers to spend the time reading and correcting papers.
Several years ago, he said, one of his sons was a student at Amity Regional Senior High School in Woodbridge and at a school event for parents the principal mentioned that they were welcome to drop in at classes any time. So one day, Mr. Collier did just that, spurred on, he said, by questions such as why his son had had only one writing assignment in English for an entire school year and no writing assignment in history at all.
He was not happy by what he encountered. His appraisal of the faculty that taught his son: "He had one superb teacher, in physics. The rest were mediocre to terrible."
As much as Mr. Collier is critical of secondary school teachers -- "You can tell kids aren't ready for college by the way they write, there's very little worthwhile instruction in writing in high school" -- he is more critical of parents.
"The central problem is television," he said. "Parents are more interested in watching TV. If kids aren't reading, the blame should go to the parents. There are real failures in education because teachers are failing but parents are failing more."
It might be assumed that he would take take a softer stance about teaching history at the college level, his level. Drop that assumption. He is pacing around his living room, as he is wont to do, and says that he really doesn't want "to get into something with my colleagues, but teaching of history in college is some of the worst I have ever seen."
One professor, he said, announces at the start of a term that he will not entertain any questions from his students. Another reads, in a monotone, from a prepared script. Some just want students to memorize dates that will get them through a quiz -- but which they will have forgotten two days after the quiz.
Teaching, he said, should be better than that. "The first thing any teacher should do is not think about teaching but think about learning. I want students who are involved in a project. I want active involvement, not passive listeners."
He seldom sits in his classes. "I walk around, I wave my arms." In one class, he climbs onto his desk and then leaps off to make a point about the beliefs of early American settlers, explaining that as today's people believe explicitly in the laws of gravity so did the settlers believe explicitly in the power of good and evil and in witchcraft.
He seems to be possessed of an unlimited store of energy, which he burns off in many ways.
"I was never very good at athletics when I was younger," he smiles, "but I had a second adolescence when I was in my 50's." His wife is a very accomplished figure skater, so he took that up. Then he extended it to playing hockey and other sports. Last month was a good one for the band in which he plays trumpet: three gigs. All this activity keeps him as lean and fit as a middleweight boxer.
Somehow, he finds time to be the state historian. "I spend most of the time answering questions," Mr. Collier said. "People call up and I can answer some of the questions off the top of my head but others take two hours of research."
The job originated with the state's tercentenary celebration in the 1930's, and Mr. Collier has been the historian since 1985, recommended by the trustees of the University of Connecticut and appointed by Gov. William A. O'Neill.
The job paid nothing but a stipend of $4,800 a year was allocated for expenses. That was cut out five years ago because of the state's economic crunch, so now Mr. Collier spends his own money for such items as postage stamps. "I even buy the letterhead," he said.
He is not happy about it but accepts it philosophically and the office does give him a platform for what he considers a more realistic view of history. Nathan Hale, for example, the Revolutionary War figure hanged by the British who was named by the General Assembly as the state's official hero several years ago.
"It was inappropriate," Mr. Collier said. "Nathan Hale was a failed spy alleged to have made one statement, but we don't know that he said it." ("It," of course, was "I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.")
He also isn't thrilled that Prudence Crandall, who opened a school in Canterbury for young black women in the first half of the last century, has more recently been designated as the state's official heroine. "She was a one-issue person and her case was doomed from the start."
In an age of political correctness, Connecticut's state historian can be most politically incorrect and that doesn't seem to bother him at all.
He doesn't believe in politically correct.

HEADLINE: Outside Southern Counties, Prices Are Often Lower

BYLINE: By VICTORIA WHITE

DATELINE: INVERNESS, Fla.

 BODY:
OUTSIDE southern Florida, many parts of the state offer housing that Northerners find attractive, often at a lower price than in Dade, Broward or Palm Beach Counties, and in a more relaxed environment as well.
But there is also dynamic growth, and the center of it at present is the Orlando area. Jacksonville is another growth center, and by some accounts it has become one of the better locations for young people seeking starter homes. 
 The housing stock around the state is varied -- from modest two-bedroom houses for as little as $30,000 in rural outposts to properties selling in the millions in Orlando, Tampa and Naples. One common thread for many of them, in this peninsular state, is their access to water.
Waterfront properties can be found well inland from the coasts, as the many lakes and rivers offer their own natural vistas. Waterfront always comes at a price, but the price varies greatly by location. In the tiny town of Inverness, the seat of the rural central Gulf Coast county of Citrus, two-bedroom, two-bath condominiums on Lake Henderson go for as little as $55,000. Fifteen miles away, in Crystal River, that much money would buy a one-bedroom, one-bath unit on the water.
In the Orlando area, waterfront land is especially pricey. Lakefront land is selling for $400,000 to $750,000 an acre, according to Seminole County Property Appraiser Bill Suber. At those prices, people are buying the land only for large luxury homes. While there are still smaller 1950's-era homes on the lakes, they are beginning to be razed to make way for the pricier fare.
Near Jacksonville, beachfront property is selling for $3,000 to $7,000 a front foot.
The market for resale -- as opposed to new -- housing is described by brokers as "normal" -- neither in a boom nor a bust. In the Orlando area, four- and five-bedroom houses in gated communities are priced roughly between $200,000 and $300,000. Three-bedroom patio homes are listed from $150,000 and up.
In the Tampa Bay area, a favorite among retirees, two-bedroom, two-bath condominiums in gated communities list from $140,000 on up. Luxury homes on the west coast -- with more than 3,500 square feet of living space in golf-course communities -- are priced upwards of $300,000.
Then there are the rural counties, which offer great value for housing dollars for those who prefer the small-town or country experience. George Rusaw, whose Citrus County-based Rusaw Homes constructs 50 houses a year, said that in comparison with south Florida, "here a person can get a lot more property for a lot less money."
Mr. Rusaw's customers typically want to build on half-acre lots. In one of Citrus County's more upscale communities, Citrus Hills, a typical price for a half-acre lot would be about $15,000, he said. In urbanized south Florida, "half an acre would seem like an estate," Mr. Rusaw said. The houses he builds range in price from $60,000 to $160,000, and about 70 percent are sold with pools.
The company used to aim at a slightly higher market, but has discovered in the post-recession years that its customers -- many from the Northeast -- are arriving in Florida with fewer dollars to spend. "We feel that there are just fewer people who are selling up north, either by choice or the economy," he said.
TWO Rusaw customers, Norbert and Louise Galle, are typical. They sold their two-family home in the Glendale section of Queens for $250,000 two years ago. Had they sold earlier, they said, they might have received as much as $375,000 for it.
In Citrus County, they had Rusaw Homes build a house for $150,000. For their money, they got a 2,800-square-foot house with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a fireplace, living room, kitchen, dining room, washroom, two-car garage and a screened-in garden in a community with a clubhouse and pool.
The Galles chose Citrus County for its beautiful countryside, rural flavor and low traffic and crime. "After all those years in New York, I wanted to be in a nice quiet place," said Mr. Galle, a 58-year-old retired butcher.
Though a few years old, the 1990 census can give some indicators of the range of home values in the state. The median home value in Florida then was $77,100. The median in some rural counties was significantly lower. In Holmes County, on the Alabama border, the median was just $36,200. Other Panhandle counties also had modest values.
By contrast, the median value in Palm Beach County was $98,400. In the Florida Keys county of Monroe, the median value was $151,200.
The Orlando growth is fueled in large measure by the success of Disney World. The leader in the big-ticket amusement-park business is now delving into housing development. Disney Development Company is creating a planned community called Celebration just minutes from Disney World. First occupancy of homes will begin next July.
Celebration is planned to include 8,000 residential units. Town houses and detached homes are priced at $127,000 to $600,000. No units have been built yet, but interest has been brisk. Thousands have visited the Celebration preview center since it opened last summer.
Celebration is to include a golf course, school, parks and a mix of retail.
Elsewhere in the Orlando area, new housing is cropping up around the University of Central Florida in the $75,000 to $100,000 range. On the other end of the scale, said Mr. Suber, the appraiser, large, expensive homes were being constructed to cater to the many executives employed by the growing corporate presence in Orlando.
"We have several different developments which give you a country-type atmosphere, with very large homes of 4,000 to 6,000 square feet," he said. "They range in value from half a million to $7 million or $8 million."
IN Jacksonville, "there's an area that's just exploding," said Duval County Property Appraiser Ernie Mastroianni. Butler Boulevard stretches from the Intracoastal Waterway near the beach to Interstate 95.
"They can't build houses fast enough," Mr. Mastroianni said. "You're talking about tens of thousands of acres that used to be nothing but trees."
"As South and Central Florida are becoming more and more saturated, people are looking here," he said. "You can buy a much nicer home for the money than in Orlando, Tampa or Miami. You can get a starter home of maybe 1,200 to 1,400 square feet for $60,000 to $70,000. You're not going to find that in most places."

Plugging Into the Right Niche for New Housing

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
HOUSING starts in Connecticut were down through late summer and early fall by as much as 20.3 percent from last year. But a developer who knows his or her niche can do surprisingly brisk business.
Two projects in different parts of the state at disparate but regionally competitive prices are currently attracting ready buyers thirsting for new construction. 
 Fox Glen, a 22-acre wooded tract in North Stamford, has sold houses from three blueprints on 8 of its 13 one- to two-acre lots, with combined prices ranging from $540,000 to $625,000. Prices rose within the last few months from an initial $525,000 to $595,000, "on the broker's advice," said the developer, Anne Leepson, president of Grayson Construction of Westport, "because there was no price resistance."
In Middlebury, 18 buyers snapped up the entire first sector of lots after seeing two models at Steeplechase, a 53-acre, 75-home cluster development. The houses, priced at $189,000 to $219,000 since opening for sales on Oct. 9, will soon cost $10,000 more.
Both builders expect to have buyers moving in by spring.
Location is still a high priority, but customizing has become a major component of the successful subdivision. The time when buyers were willing to accept a few cookie-cutter models as the only alternative to an individually designed and built house are as passe as the hula hoop.
Ms. Leepson operates on the one-stop shopping principle. "We do everything -- people like that," she said. "I am the designer, I have a draftsman who draws up the floor plans and an architect who does the blueprints."
Under Connecticut law licensed architects are not required to design homes, but local building officials are empowered to require architects for very large or complex residences.
"I design from a woman's point of view," said Ms. Leepson, "from the inside out. You buy a basic one-story A, B or C model and the land at the basic price. Then we sign a separate contract for customization. We will add a second story, even do the interior decorating if the customer wishes."
Lest anyone underestimate her basics, they include marble and hardwood floors, two bedrooms and convertible den, 2-and-a-half tiled or marble baths with whirlpools and bidets, carpeted bedrooms, 9-foot ceilings, fireplaces, granite or Corian kitchen countertops, top-grade appliances, oversized closets, central air-conditioning, flagstone patios, cedar siding, landscaping, and 2-car garages.
OTHER basic features might be an inner courtyard surrounded by the kitchen, living room, master bedroom and a glass-walled passage connecting two of the rooms. Or buyers may choose a vaulted great room open to the kitchen. Small sitting rooms and dressing rooms off the bedrooms are also basic in the 2,275- to 3,155-square-foot homes.
Ms. Leepson has been a builder for 15 years, the last four as head of her own mostly female company. Her vice president of operations is Susan McKeon and the administrator is Lynn McArdle.
"Years ago I had a kitchen guy who thought I was the little woman who owned the house," she said. "He couldn't understand that I was the general contractor. But over the years I've developed a group of men who work well with me."
Fox Glen homes are being sold to a growing market of empty-nesters in their 40's through 70's who spend a lot of time traveling or at a second home, and who no longer need to accommodate children.
Common charges of around $300 a month will pay for maintenance of landscaping, a small community pool, snow plowing and an elaborate security system that will encircle the complex. A key punch will open the gate and each house will be connected to a 24-hour monitor for fire and freezing emergencies and ambulance dispatch.
The developers in Middlebury named their project after the traditional horse race whose finish was marked by a distant church steeple, and whose course traversed the kind of unspoiled rolling countryside that prevails in this 188-year-old village. Some 6,200 people live within its 18 square miles, at the center of which are a small green, three venerable churches, a Town Hall, some Colonial houses and lots of very old, very tall trees.
Steeplechase Development Corporation of Woodbury bought the raw land in 1985. It was granted a zone change for clustered development and its site plan was approved just before the recession. The project was shelved in the late 80's.
Last year the group entered into a joint venture with Pemberwick Associates of Greenwich, an established development firm owned by Sy Schwartz and his son, Eric.
"Steeplechase was attractive to us," said Eric Schwartz, "because of the quality of the architecture, the high regard in which the town and its schools are held, the availability of public water and sewers, and the fact that there has been no comparable new construction in the area for decades."
He convinced the Yankee Gas Company to extend its main two miles from the town of Oxford to supply the complex with gas for heat, cooking, clothes drying and water heating.
While only two models have been built, five are available, designed by Drexel Yeager, an architect with Atelier Associates in Waterbury. Sales are going so well from plans that "we may never build the other models," said Mr. Schwartz.
Home sizes range from 1,700 to 2,200 square feet, surrounded by about a fifth of an acre of landscaped land. Some lots will be bordered by old stone fences, some will overlook a large natural pond.
CATHEDRAL ceilings and oversized windows, enormous closets, fully equipped kitchens, tiled baths, one to three bedrooms, lofts overlooking the foyers, family rooms open to the kitchens, one and two car garages, security systems, and wood-burning fireplaces are some of the basics in various models.
Large finished storage areas behind knee-walls, decks, central vacuum systems and air-conditioning are optional. Dormers can be built out for additional space.
The smallest house -- a 2-family model with two and three-bedroom units of 1,180 and 1,280 square feet, respectively -- will provide 20 percent of the total units. They will be scattered throughout the development and be available to people with household incomes of $49,000 to $56,350. The units will sell for $134,900 and $149,900.
In municipalities where less than 10 percent of the housing is for low- to moderate-income residents, developers who provide 20 percent of their units for such buyers may receive a density bonus. To be eligible, buyers must earn 80 percent or less than the area's or the state's median income, whichever is lower.
A menu of common charges will be available because "in this price range we felt that some people could not afford a mandatory $150 or $200 a month," said Mr. Schwartz. Everyone will pay $69 a month for maintenance of common areas, but residents may choose whether to enroll in individual maintenance plans at extra cost. Those who neglect their properties will be billed by the homeowner's association for having the work done for them.
Prospective buyers should be aware that Steeplechase is under the flight path of the Oxford Airport, two-and-a-half miles away, where 150,000 arrivals and departures of small private planes and corporate jets take place annually. Peter Zguzenski, the airport manager, said that there was a master plan for expansion, adding that flights would not increase unless area businesses in a 25-mile radius grow. So far, he said, "we haven't had any serious problems with neighboring residents."

HEADLINE: In Florida, A Market That Plays by Different Rules

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

DATELINE: BOYNTON BEACH, Fla.

 BODY:
"I NEVER had any intention of moving to Florida!" said Gloria Olsher. But there she is, to her astonishment, in the Palm Isles active-adult community in Boynton Beach, amid a bevy of new friends.
A retiree in her 60's with three children "back North," she made the move a year ago, yielding to the advice of old friends who were in Florida already. She bought a large villa unit -- a single-level home in a building with four units -- for $140,000, plus a few thousand more for upgrades such as larger floor tiles and patio screening. 
 Now she is happy beyond her expectations. "I bought a way of life," said Mrs. Olsher, who burned her bridges by selling her co-op in Bayside, Queens. "The people I'm friendly with feel the same way."
Florida still exerts its spell upon older adults and retirees who yearn for a leisured life in a warm climate. Many have already been visiting or vacationing there for years. The state also draws its share of younger Northerners who also seek a pleasanter style of life, but have career aspirations as well.
But if Mrs. Olsher is like many others who have preceded her, her first housing choice will not be her last. Interviews with people who have relocated full time to south Florida from the North, recently or long ago, underscore the fact that whatever people find on arrival, they often want or require something else eventually -- something better, different or elsewhere.
The breadth of choice is impressive. Not only is the inventory of available resale housing in south Florida substantial -- as even a glance at the thick weekly real-estate sections of The Miami Herald, The Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale, or The Palm Beach Post in West Palm Beach suggests -- but also much more new construction is under way than a visitor from the Northeast may be prepared for.
Some of that new construction is serving families on the move because of damage caused by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and some of it is the result of corporate relocation and job movement. And some, buyers candidly admit, is caused by ethnic change. The very pace of new construction has the effect of limiting the rate of appreciation in existing housing that doesn't offer a special characteristic like an ocean view.
Geographically, the new development in south Florida stretches from the Florida Keys northward through Miami Beach and sections of Broward and Palm Beach Counties. There are several current development hotspots, including some farther north in St. Lucie, Indian River and Brevard Counties.
The range of housing styles and prices is striking as well. Much of the development is in large-scale communities with gated entrances and common recreational facilities. New infill housing on unbuilt land in already developed neighborhoods, common in northern communities, would be an unusual sight in south Florida.
There are high-rises on or near the ocean, and single-family, patio, villa and condominium units, built to varying densities, often in subdivisions that take several years to complete and sell out. Most of it is meant as primary housing for middle-income Floridians.
There are also adult communities for older people, with a considerable range in house sizes and styles, amenities and prices. There may be a large clubhouse, or a modest one, or none at all. A golf course, or golf courses, may be on the site. At a country-club community there will be not only a golf course but also a membership club in which an equity participation is part of the purchase price.
Many of the adult communities emphasize the "lifestyle" they offer rather than the housing only, because they are heavy on elaborate well-staffed clubhouses with ongoing recreational activities and even theaters, and they sometimes have an age restriction: one member of the household must be over 55. But many developments describe themselves as "family oriented" because they are light on clubhouses and organized activities, and even those that have them and are clearly oriented toward retirees may shy from describing themselves as age restricted. Why turn away buyers?
Finally, there are continuing-care and assisted-living developments for people who want still higher levels of services. New arrivals are usually in their 70's, or older.
Compared with the mid-80's, the pace of new development is subdued. "There have been times when there was so much on the market you couldn't give it away," said James G. Mueller, a principal in Prudential Florida Realty, which has 65 Florida offices. "Now there's an ample inventory, but less than last year. The hardest thing to find is waterfront property at a modest price." By "modest" he means under $250,000, he said. Many others seem to want units on golf courses for under $125,000, also not an easy find.
For moderate prices many out-of-staters have been turning toward mid-Florida -- the Orlando area in particular -- or the Tampa-St.Petersburg-Clearwater area on the west coast, or the farther northern reaches of the east coast, Mr. Mueller said.
In the Miami Beach area there has been a mild resurgence in new high-rise construction. It includes such projects as the oceanfront Grand Bay Residences on Key Biscayne Island; the 44-story Portofino Tower in the Latin-flavored South Beach section of Miami Beach, and the 32-story Mirabella condominium off Collins Avenue, also in Miami Beach. New high-rises are taking shape in the Aventura section of North Miami, and farther north in Fort Lauderdale, in Broward County.
In the more westerly reaches of Broward County the region is witnessing its largest current burst of new primary housing. Pembroke Pines, which also has one of the newer Century Village retirement communities, is a new center of this growth. Farther north, the communities of Coral Springs and Parkland are also centers of new residential construction. Such builders as Lennar Homes, Engle Homes, GL Homes and Minto Builders, a company based in Ottawa, are putting up small-lot single-family houses in gated subdivisions, with pools and tennis courts. In this relatively low-land-cost area new housing can be found in the price range of $100,000 and $200,000.
FARTHER north, in Palm Beach County, the new offerings range beyond age-mixed family housing to include communities more specifically attractive to older adults and second-home owners. In Boca Raton, Delray Beach, Boynton Beach, Lake Worth, West Palm Beach, Palm Beach Gardens, and Jupiter farther north, builders are catering to middle-income, upper-middle-income and wealthy buyers. Prices may range from $150,000 to $400,000 and beyond.
Still farther north, another growth center is in St. Lucie County, with both primary and retirement housing emerging in Port St. Lucie and St. Lucie West. Prices are lower than in Palm Beach County. New housing can be found for under $100,000, brokers say, and rarely costs more than $200,000.
"The emphasis now in new construction is on detached houses at more affordable prices -- even in the luxury country-club communities," said Lewis Goodkin, a Miami-based consultant to national building companies. Buyers who used to find attached housing or "stacked" units in condominiums on two to four levels now are buying detached houses, frequently at prices $10,000 to $20,000 lower than such houses would have cost in the late 80's, Mr. Goodkin said.
Sales activity has grown steadily since the recession years of the early 90's, and in 1994 reached its highest level of the 90's in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties, he said. But this year, to widespread surprise, the sales trend has turned downward. Mr. Goodkin projects an 11 percent drop in new-home sales and about 7 percent in resales.
One reason may be that that higher prices have frozen out more buyers at the lower end of the market, he said. Another may be that the economy has picked up in the Northeast so that the exodus of jobs has slowed.
Figures prepared by Appraisal and Real Estate Economics Associates Inc., a Miami consulting firm, show that in the last few years about one sale in every four is of a new house rather than a resale house -- a high proportion in comparison with the Northeast, where older housing historically has attained favorable appreciation rates in many locations.
Last year, for example, 11,600 new houses were sold in Broward County and there were 36,200 resales. Through June of this year there were 4,500 new-home sales and 16,400 resales.
The resellers are often buying new houses. Among them are many buyers who came originally from the North.
Two such are Irwin Schwartz, 65, and his wife, Estelle, late of Fair Lawn, N.J. They moved 15 years ago, largely to escape Northeastern winters. They had been living in a house in Pembroke Lakes, in western Broward, but now have bought a $170,000 house in a new gated community called Pembroke Falls, a mile away, to be finished next year. Eventually there will be 2,000 single-family houses on 1,500 acres, including a lake, but so far there is mostly raw land and a sales office. Engle Homes, based in Boca Raton, is the developer. The couple exemplifies the move-up buyer of retirement age. Their new house will have four bedrooms, three baths and a two-car garage, a view over a manmade lake, and young families with children all around. One bedroom will be used by Mr. Schwartz as an office for his work as a part-time arbitrator in the juvenile-justice system. Another will be Mrs. Schwartz's art studio. The third will be a guest bedroom for their grandchildren. The fourth will be for themselves.
"This home will appreciate in value, whereas if I bought a smaller house it wouldn't appreciate as much," Mr. Schwartz said. "Who would you sell it to? Empty-nesters or people without children. The sales advantage is to too small a group."
Then there are Michael and Tobi Altholz, who left Brooklyn 23 years ago. They lived 11 years in Kendall, in southwest Dade County, and bought a house six years ago in Weston, a 10,000-acre Arvida/JMB Partners planned community in southwest Broward. Now they have moved to the exclusive Jasmine section of Weston, with houses ranging from $300,000 "to the millions," Mr. Altholz said, declining to disclose what he paid.
"It's not easy to make a profit on a resale," said Mr. Altholz, a 52-year-old sales manager for International Paper. He bought a house with 2,700 square feet of air-conditioned, or under-the-roof, space (and 3,500 square feet if the patio-with-pool and two-car garage are included), while managing to sell a more modest house at Weston for about the $140,000 he paid for it five years ago. Sellers in Florida, as at Weston, are frequently in competition with developers building new houses at the same location, and the preference for the new is pervasive among many Florida buyers.
AT Weston one of the more unusual new models is in the Bay Isles section of Weston Hills, a country-club community within Weston. It utilizes the courtyard approach: The front door opens on a courtyard, in which there is an in-the-ground swimming pool. Visitors can be let in by buzzer in from the house itself, which has 2,650 square feet of air-conditioned space. A 200-square-foot studio apartment occupies the front side of the courtyard, well-suited as a guest apartment. The house with pool sells for $267,000, or $285,000 with the guest house.
A more elaborate use of the courtyard approach is to be seen in the Ballentrae community in Port St. Lucie, which K. Hovnanian Companies of Florida is developing. Dr. Michael Carelli, a 31-year-old optometrist, and his wife, Leah, who relocated to Florida in 1991 from the Grasmere section of Staten Island, bought a $260,000 two-bedroom house with 2,700 square feet of air-conditioned space and a 1,650-square-foot courtyard with a swimming pool and Jacuzzi. A 500-square-foot studio apartment faces the courtyard.
"We'd been living in Florida for six years and never seen anything like it before," Dr. Carelli said.
Real estate consultants often use figures from the Internal Revenue Service as an indicator of where people from other states choose to live when they move to Florida. The I.R.S. data show the changes in residence of taxpayers, by county.
Last year, for example, of the 761,000 returns filed from Dade County, 25,000, or 3 percent, had been filed from a different county the year before. The inmigrants accounted for 7 percent of the 568,000 returns from Broward and 17 percent of the 412,000 filings from Palm Beach County.
It turns out that a substantial share of these new arrivals are from New York City and 10 nearby counties. These 13,400 tax returns, which presumably represent about that many households, accounted for 14 percent of the arrivals to the three counties. About 5,000 went to Broward County, 4,000 to Dade and 4,400 to Palm Beach.
What the statistics fail to show is that many of the arrivals are headed specifically for adult communities. Oriole Homes, based in Delray Beach, is one of the main builders, with seven adult communities in various stages of completion in Palm Beach, Martin and Marion Counties in Florida.
"Older people have become so much more active!" said Mark A. Levy, president of Oriole. "They're living longer and they know they're going to live longer." That means that Oriole has added a racquetball court and more tennis courts in newer communities, provided more clubhouse staffing, added classes in tax planning, investments and health, and is buying computers for residents' use.
At its Coral Lakes development in Boynton Beach -- with 1,300 units planned and 200 already built -- there is to be a 71,000-square-foot clubhouse. Catering to what has been found to be a willingness of many buyers to live in less space for a lower price, it is adding four new models to last year's four, and selling in a price range of $140,000 to $180,000 instead of $160,000 to $180,000. The smallest unit will have 1,250 square feet of air-conditioned space and sell for less than $100,000.
The contrast in housing values dollar-for-dollar in Florida compared with what buyers are accustomed to in the North is striking to many buyers. Bernard Gerson, 70, retired from automotive sales business in Philadelphia, said that he and his wife, Eleanor, had bought a three-bedroom 1,886-square-foot condominium at Coral Lakes from plans last year for $124,000. They had been dividing their time between Philadelphia and a rented condominium in Delray Beach, but now they have sold the Philadelphia apartment.
"Dollar for dollar it's a better value down here," he said, telling of a large master bedroom with three closets and a huge living room, created by making an outdoor patio into an extension of the living room by the removal of doors. An active tennis player, he was also attracted by the development's five Har-Tru-surfaced tennis courts. Eventually there will be 10.
Some of the best values appear to be in the resale market. In the Miami area, for example, there has been about a 10 percent drop in the last 18 or 20 months in the prices of higher-end units, said Ronald A. Suffield, president of the Miami-based Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors.
It is now possible to buy a two-bedroom condominium in a mid-80's full-services building on Key Biscayne Island, for example, for $150,000 to $250,000, he said, or a two-bedroom unit in a midrise building in Coral Gables, six miles south of downtown Miami near the University of Miami, for $140,000 to $160,000.
"The inventory of unsold homes is up 16 percent over a year ago," he said.
AMONG the people creating the vacancies are retirees who find their housing is no longer appropriate. "People in Florida retire twice, once in their mid-60's and then in their late-70's," said Terri Cunliffe, executive director of Edgewater Pointe Estates, a continuing-care adult facility in Boca Raton.
New entrants, even those in their 80's or early 90's, may still be in sound health and capable of independent living in their own apartments. But even those residents take two meals a day communally in an attractive dining room. And as their condition requires, personal-care services and nursing care are available to them as they age.
Edgewater Pointe Estates is owned by Adult Communities Total Services Inc., of West Point, Pa. Entrants pay a fee of $100,000 that is described as an "insurance policy," assuring residents of lifetime care at a fixed fee of about $1,000 a month whether they are living independently or in the personal-care or medical-care units.
"State regulations in Florida have made it very difficult to built a new facility," said George R. Gunn Jr., chief executive officer of the company. "The required reserves are very onerous." Reserve requirements are the liquid assets that an operator is required to maintain, currently pegged to the amount needed to carry a year's expenses for debt service, taxes and insurance, and 30 percent of a year's operating costs. There have been numerous financial failures of inadequately financed privately owned facilities for the elderly in Florida, and the state has had to step in to run them temporarily at public expense.
Mr. Gunn predicted that new facilities would not be built in Florida as the law stands. The state already has about 70 continuing-care communities housing an estimated 35,000 people.
THE newer retirees from the North typically still have their health and vigor, however, and are not focusing on the aging issue. After a year or two in Florida, they may be eager for unpressured work.
At the Wycliffe Golf and Country Club in Lake Worth, Max Samakow, who once ran retail stores at the Watergate complex in Washington and elsewhere, has opened a greeting-card shop three years after he and his wife, Shirley, bought at Wycliffe. They lived first in a condominium and later bought a $265,000 house. "We have such a social life here!" said Mrs. Samakow. "I don't have time to breathe."
Another Wycliffe owner, Norman Rubin, describes himself as a pre-retiree. He and his wife, Sandra, still in their late 50's, are in a $142,000 condominium with 2,200 square feet on the golf course, having sold a condominium they had for nine years in Bonaventura. They plan to spend four months a year back home in Randolph, Mass.
"I'm practicing for my full retirement," Mr. Rubin said. "When the time comes I'll play golf six days a week instead of three."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Will Democrats Return To the Fold on Tuesday?

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The Democrats would like this Election Day, when voters will choose the 80 members of the Assembly, to be a referendum on Newt Gingrich and the Republican revolution in Washington. Mr. Gingrich has not specifically accepted the challenge, but being venturesome, he might just be willing to.
There is plenty of evidence that Mr. Gingrich worries a lot of people in this state. Old-line Democrats who abandoned their party for Ronald Reagan and Christine Todd Whitman are drifting back to the fold, prodded by worries about layoffs and the economy. At the polls on Tuesday, we will find out if the prodigal Dems will be joined by any of the 1.1 million New Jerseyans over age 65, who have been voting Republican ever since they started living on Social Security and their pensions, but who may now wonder if a Democratic vote would send a message to Washington for Mr. Gingrich to lay off Medicare. 
 The Speaker was in Plainsboro last month at a big Republican fund-raising event where, far from urging state legislators to stick to local issues, Mr. Gingrich called the Republican anti-tax sweep of the Legislature in 1991 the model he followed in drawing up the Contract With America. He urged New Jerseyans to send a second message to Washington by re-electing Republicans this fall.
Well, a fight over Republican social spending plans is one briar patch that Tom Byrne, chairman of the New Jersey Democrats, would love to be thrown into. The Democrats believe that Mr. Gingrich and the Republicans have read the people wrong, and they believe that those senior citizens living in the piney woods down by the shore will stop worrying about Democratic taxes long enough to start worrying about Republican Medicare cuts.
After seeing Democratic strength in the shore communities dwindle with the shift in political power from cities like Asbury Park to planned communities with names like Breezy Acres Estates, Democrats in the state are hoping to pick up an extra 5 percent or so of the vote among retirees on the strength of their message about Medicare cuts.
"I think senior citizens understand now that Newt is interested in killing Medicare," Mr. Byrne said.
The Governor, however, is not interested in turning her midterm election into a national fight. Nor is she interested in being regarded as the center of focus for the race.
"This is not a referendum on me," she said on Wednesday, "so much as a referendum on the kind of government people have been getting since the Republicans took control of the Legislature in 1991."
Still, as Mr. Gingrich himself noted when the Governor traveled to Atlanta to help the Speaker raise campaign funds, Mrs. Whitman is one of the most popular public figures in the country, and in politics as in high school, popularity is what separates the winners from the rest of us.
The Governor has already won a partial reprieve from Mr. Gingrich in the schedule for reducing the growth of Medicaid payments, a change that lets New Jersey cut back more slowly on the program for poor people and the disabled than Congress had at first planned. The change will save the Governor nearly half a billion dollars over seven years, but it still leaves her facing about $300 million in reduced Federal spending over the same period.
"Does that mean we will be getting less Federal dollars? "Yes," Mrs. Whitman said loyally. "But that is the kind of thing we Republicans have to do to get control over Federal spending."
Then the Governor took a bold step, in answering a question about the impact of Federal and, perforce, state cuts in aid to the poor.
"The presumption that the poor and the elderly are going to be hurt by this is based on the presumption that we, as governors, can't find efficiencies," Mrs. Whitman said. She cited an effort to keep the elderly in their own homes as long as possible, where caring for them is cheaper than in nursing homes.
It is true that Congress is giving governors a freer hand to design and operate Federal programs at the state level, but the idea that hundreds of millions of dollars can be saved by tinkering with the mechanics of social policy is a daunting one. It is also a reminder that Mr. Gingrich may speak of first principles and root causes, but it is the governors like Mrs. Whitman who will have to make the programs work.
The Democrats are betting that she will not be able to do it, not in a way that voters will accept. But then, two years ago, the Democrats and a lot of other people also bet that Mrs. Whitman couldn't tinker more than $1 billion in tax cuts out of state operations, too.

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL;
One County's Transit Decongestant

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK

 BODY:
Chester P. Mattson has a vision. The way he sees it, roadway congestion, commuting time, employment distribution, daytime population (and what he has discovered about these things in the last few years) make the vision not only desirable but also inescapable.
Mr. Mattson, Bergen County's director of planning and economic development, wants to build a $1 billion transit system that would include trolleys, trains and ferries, use existing rail lines, and provide frequent service for the growing number of intra-county commuters, perhaps as early as the year 2000. That's what he told the County Board of Freeholders at a formal presentation last Wednesday. 
 "These are radical plans, but they fit the needs," he said. "We live in an all-day economy that's congested all day."
The plan, known as the Bergen County Year 2000 Rail Transit System, is still largely a dream,tagged with the usual caveats of availability of funds, environmental assessment and possible local opposition. But if even a portion of the system were to become a reality, it would help relieve congestion, and perhaps serve as a model for other areas, both urban and suburban.
"A flexible transit system that can accommodate traditional trips to the region's core and suburb-to-suburb trips to the periphery is something we really need," said Jon Orcutt, associate director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. "Fairly dense urban areas could take a cue from this."
These are key points of the plan Mr. Mattson hopes will offer service seven days a week.
* A nine-mile trolley line using the New York Susquehanna and Western Railway to shuttle passengers from a new garage at the interchange of the Garden State Parkway and Route 80 in Saddle Brook to the Vince Lombardi park-and-ride lot in Ridgefield.
* A 3.5-mile trolley line extending the Saddle Brook line through a refurbished Susquehanna Tunnel into Edgewater, where ferries could deliver passengers to Manhattan.
* A six-mile commuter rail line connecting the Bergen line to the meadowlands sports complex, eventually continuing to the Vince Lombardi park-and-ride lot.
* An eight-mile commuter rail line on Conrail's West Shore right-of-way from the Vince Lombardi park-and-ride to Bergenfield.
* A 10-mile trolley link from Tenafly on the Northern Branch to Edgewater.
"What Bergen County has done is given us an overall framework for how a transportation sytem can be developed long term," said Frank J. Wilson, the State Commissioner of Transportation.
The proposals, which will be presented at public hearings starting in January, culminate five years of engineering and computer studies on work, travel and demographic patterns. The conclusion was that the southern half of the county was mired in an outmoded transit system and in danger of being eclipsed economically by less congested, more accessible areas, Mr. Mattson said.
The best recourse, he said, was a transit hub at the Vince Lombardi park-and-ride to provide links not only to the five pieces, but also to other systems like the Secaucus Transfer. That project, scheduled to be finished in 2001, would enable passengers to transfer to more New Jersey Transit train lines and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.
So far, the reaction has been guarded but favorable.
"If it's not going to make Edgewater a big parking lot for mass transit, then it would be something good for the community," said Edgewater Mayor Bryan Christiansen, who attended Wednesday's meeting. "But this caught us so off-guard. It's like someone rolled up a brand-new automobile for no reason right in front of my house. If I go in and turn on the ignition, will it blow up, or will it work?"

Making Music as Business and Art

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: HOBOKEN

 BODY:
Once, Robert Tomaro and his Elysian Symphony Orchestra played the "On the Waterfront" film score in a pouring rain. Another time, he rearranged Stravinsky's "Histoire du Soldat" to accompany a screening of Buster Keaton's "Cameraman."
"I am committed to creating a synthesis of musical styles, to bring the new generation into symphony music halls," said Mr. Tomaro, whose eclectic background includes classical conducting and jazz guitar performance and composition. "We should be on the edge and play in some funky places." 
 If that's what it takes to sustain New Jersey's newest symphony orchestra, then that's what Mr. Tomaro will do. So far the group has done better than expected, putting on three concerts a year ahead of schedule and planning several more.
New Jersey has about 18 professional orchestras, professional being defined as paid. (The Elysian players earn about $175 for a concert and rehearsals, Mr. Tomaro said.) But none, except the Elysian, have started in the last five years, said John Peter Holly, president of the Association of New Jersey Orchestras.
Like many orchestras, the Elysian is the offspring of its conductor. Mr. Tomaro, 44, is an enthusiastic, ponytailed leader who feels equally comfortable guest-conducting the London Symphony Orchestra and playing guitar.
Last fall, Mr. Tomaro, who lives in Hoboken, gathered friends to form a board of directors and hired a lawyer and an accountant to file incorporation papers as a not-for-profit organization. They relied on a music contractor, Ralph Farris, who also plays viola, to recruit musicians from New York and New Jersey. Most are freelancers, so finding the right chemistry was crucial.
Board members dipped into their own pockets to print fliers. And the orchestra received a total of $21,700 from the city and private sources for three concerts.
The first, in February, was performed by a seven-piece chamber orchestra that played the Stravinsky. The second, in April, was the "On the Waterfront" concert, at the Erie Lackawanna Plaza on Hoboken's own waterfront with a 55-piece orchestra. The third, in July, featured a 25-piece orchestra playing Italian opera excerpts to celebrate the St. Ann's Italian Festival.
But the board doesn't want to rely on public money, and it has started a "Symphony 600" membership drive to sell 600 memberships, at $100 each. So far, more than 100 people have signed up.
"We all love music, but we really look at it as a business," said Robert W. Avery, a flutist who is vice president of the Elysian Symphony Orchestra and a board member of the Ridgewood Symphony Orchestra. "We're not romanticizing it as a musical, fun adventure."
Next Sunday, at the Demarest School in Hoboken, the Elysian will play works by Tchaikovsky and Barber, and on Dec. 14 it will to play Holst's "Planets," Mozart's "Jupiter" Symphony and Mr. Tomaro's "Celestial Navigation" at the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan.
Promising, perhaps, but difficult, considering the odds. The popular and acclaimed Hoboken Chamber Orchestra essentially disbanded in 1992 after 10 years because of a lack of support and a stark economy.
Some people are also cautious about Mr. Tomaro's young-generation, hybrid-music approach.
"I'm a firm believer in the repertoire; it has stood the test of time," said Larry Tamburri, executive director of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. "There's a misconception that audiences are getting older. Symphony orchestras have basically been the same age because people go to events when they have discretionary time and discretionary income."
Even so, musicians say they are impressed by the Elysian Symphony.
"It sounded excellent, and everything was professional," said Karen Stern, a harpist who played in the "On the Waterfront" concert and performs regularly with the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. "Even though he's on a budget, he's still getting top-level people. I think word's getting out that there's a new orchestra in Hoboken."

When Ships Come In, Bayonne Wants a Piece of the Action

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: BAYONNE

 BODY:
Sooner or later, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is going to need more port. Though there is still space at Ports Newark and Elizabeth and its ports in New York are underutilized, the agency is projecting steady growth for shipping in the region.
So when one of the best-located shipping ports in the area became available, the Port Authority responded. Last week, it sent a letter to the Federal Government expressing its interest in acquiring the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, a 437-acre base that juts two miles out into Upper New York Bay and was marked last spring for shutdown by the Pentagon. 
 "We anticipate increased trade for the port into the next century," the Port Authority chairman, Kathleen Donovan, wrote to the Maritime Administration of the Transportation Department on Oct. 26, "and regard the Bayonne facility as important to the total port's future capacity to accommodate that growth."
The availability of the base may be good news for the Port Authority, but in Bayonne, the agency's request was about as welcome as an earthquake.
Mayor Leonard Kiczek had hoped that the city would be able to acquire the base and sell it to a developer, generating millions of dollars in property taxes. The quasi-governmental Port Authority, Mr. Kiczek noted, does not pay taxes as such; it makes in-lieu-of-tax payment agreements with the cities that house its facilities, but usually much less than if the property were fully taxed. In Bayonne, the Port Authority pays $100,000 a year in lieu of taxes on 100 acres on which it operates an auto terminal. Mr. Kiczek said the taxes would be twice as high if the property were in private hands.
Mr. Kiczek (pronounced KEY-chek) says the chance to make money off a decommissioned base is supposed to be a community's compensation for the economic blow of the closure. The base, which has 2,445 workers, is the city's largest employer.
"The whole scheme of Federal base re-use is to get property productive again," he said.
The Port Authority said it sent the letter merely to keep the door open to maintaining the base as a port, and that the agency itself would not necessarily want to be the port's operator, though it runs all but one of the container ports in the region. "We're just putting it on the table to preserve the port for maritime use."said Gwen Williams, a spokeswoman for the agency.
Mr. Kiczek, noting that the letter states that the Port Authority "is interested in the possible acquisition of surplus Federal real property and . . . . wishes to preserve all possible rights and opportunities for acquisition," remains suspicious. His written request to the Port Authority to "reveal its true intention" had not been answered at week's end.
The future of the base is not expected to be decided for years, though Mr. Kiczek says he is already getting calls from interested developers. The military is not scheduled to vacate the property, a sprawling complex of yellow warehouses, barracks and docks that bring in tanks, cars and personnel carriers, until 1999. But Mr. Kiczek is a firm believer in planning.
He acknowledges that because of environmental damage at the site, which is built on fill, it may make more sense to maintain it as a port than to convert it into an industrial park, even though the latter would generate a lot more revenue.
But if there is to be a port, he wants Bayonne to operate it. He envisions a municipal port authority that would compete head to head with the Port Authority.
The decision on what to do with the base is largely up to the newly formed Base Re-use Commission -- of which Mr. Kiczek is chairman and on which the Port Authority sits -- with final approval from the Federal Government. Bayonne officials and businessmen have 6 seats on the 11-member panel.
"If the local redevelopment authority decides that what they want to do with the property is not consistent with the Port Authority taking it over, it doesn't go into their re-use plan," said Helen Hines, project manager for the Defense Department's Office of Economic Adjustment.
Port battles are not exactly new to Bayonne. In 1917, the city's residents rejected a $10 million bond issue to build a new marine terminal near the site of the base, largely because of fears that it would attract an influx of cheap labor.
Frustration in Trenton with Bayonne's intransigence led to a call for a bi-state committee to develop the harbor.
"It remains to be seen," The New York Times wrote in an editorial at the time, "how much of an obstacle to the greater proposal is the local prejudices of a district which controls so much of the limited total of available water frontage."
The Port Authority was created four years later.

What Does Camden Need? Education, Jobs and Mentors

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
"Let's face it: we need help."
So said Mayor Arnold Webster two weeks ago after Camden's 48th homicide this year, two shy of the city's record of 50 set in 1992 with two full months of 1995 to go. 
 These are not the best times for Camden, a city of 87,000 across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. It has a monopoly on bad breaks, and bad numbers: the murder rate is twice Newark's; one out of every five people is unemployed; more than half the population is under 25, and more than two-thirds receive public assistance.
There are encouraging signs. Since Halloween Eve 1991, when vandals started 133 fires, volunteers have kept the lid on arson and violence; this year, there were only seven building fires. New developments like the Thomas H. Kean New Jersey State Aquarium and Blockbuster-Sony Music Entertainment Center on the waterfront have been popular with visitors.
But Camden needs a lot more to wriggle free of poverty and reclaim its past as a bustling shipyard and manufacturing center. So several people familiar with the city were asked: "What does Camden need?"
 
Hubert Williams
President of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit research group in Washington, and former Newark Police director
"Camden is a city with a lot of urban problems and a diminished resource base. And the fact is, you're not going to get an infusion of money; you have to be savvy as possible about the use of existing resources.
"A city must take a good, hard look at each case to see what kind of patterns emerge. In Newark, we had problems with youths committing crimes, and a lot of kids were school-age kids playing hooky. So we got together with the superintendent of schools and picked up 9,000 kids in the first year, and the crime rate went down.
"If you have people who are selling drugs and their turf is a building, you go after the building: you go after the landlord, you use nuisance laws, whatever it takes. If they're selling drugs on the street corner, take pictures of the people on the corner. The idea is to make it as uncomfortable as possible for them to be in business."
 
Ali Sloan El
Member of the Camden Board of Education and candidate for City Council
"Let the grass-roots community introduce itself to the Police Department. If they put you and me out there, with a badge, a flashlight, and a walkie-talkie, the drug dealers won't do it. We should do it round the clock; people can do it part-time for maybe $10 an hour. It's the presence that counts.
"In the schools, we need to hire teachers from Camden city first, give them the opportunity to teach their children. Not everyone is an Einstein, so we should offer them a vocational complex that should be state-of-the-art. The children that we send out will have to rebuild Camden. They have to be counselors; they have to be teachers; they have to be policemen; they have to be carpenters, nurses.
"I've also been promoting a day curfew, from 9 A.M. to 2:30 P.M., for kids ages 6 to 16. Students are just walking around, chasing business people, robbing them during the daytime. This curfew would put them back in the school."
 
Mary Taylor Previte
Administrator, Camden County Youth Center in Gloucester Township
"Camden needs to feel safe. A lot of kids say they don't feel safe in homes, in streets, even in their schools. If someone feels unsafe, then reading, writing and arithmetic are the last things kids will think about.
"It isn't just government who can help; it's churches, schools, anyone who is a leader in the community. Parents have to spend more time with their children; on average, they spend 30 seconds a day. There's got to be a priority of family: spending time, being a role model, feeding the spirit of their children. Those are just the ABC's of parenting. Grown-ups need to be saying, 'We need more mentors.'
"The most important thing is that people need jobs. As soon as someone sees your address is Camden, they say, 'Don't call us; we'll call you.' We tell the young people to stay in school because getting an education is hard to counteract. Second, a lot of young people need a stable family that includes a very present man in their life.
"Girls will tell me: 'Ain't one house on my street with a dad. My mom gets into drugs, and I have to put food on the table.' "
 
Thomas P. Corcoran
President of Cooper's Ferry Development Association, a nonprofit organization developing the Camden waterfront
"Camden needs to create industrial parks; there are none now, and yet the city is ringed by industrial parks in Pennsauken, Cherry Hill and Bellmar. We could get some infrastructure grants or loans from state and county government to clear underutilized land, put in roads and sewage lines. You play off some businesses already located in Camden: food processing, commercial laundries, printing.
"Most job generation is going to be in the service economy, and we should look for companies that want to have back-office operations, like credit card operations, check processing, with people that can be trained in data entry. We have that labor force.
"We need to have additional restaurants and nightclubs. Next summer, we will open our first year-round restaurants on the waterfront, and we're trying to get one or two hotels to open up in a couple of years."
 
The Rev. Rick Malloy, S.J.
Associate pastor, Holy Name Church
"The main problem is the concentration of poverty. Our kids are caught in a slavery of drug-dealing. Why don't we hire a 20-man drug-seller outreach program to talk to these kids? Why don't we stop the buyer by going to his place of work and embarrassing him? Why don't we designate a certain number of social workers and Big Brothers?
"We need massive parenting programs, teaching parents how to parent kids. We need to get the young kids who go to Rutgers to come back and give to this community. We should have the unemployed rehabilitate the city's 3,000 abandoned houses.
"The frustrating thing is that Camden is doable; it's 87,000 people surrounded by wealth. To save this city would take very little in terms of investment, and you'd reap so many rewards."

Forging Links With the Past at Long Pond

BYLINE: By ROSALIE STEMER 

 BODY:
In the shadow of the Ramapo Mountains in Passaic County, Long Pond Ironworks provided the American colonies with one of their most basic needs -- iron -- as they broke away from British rule. During the Revolutionary War, Long Pond's charcoal-burning furnaces furnished the iron for stoves, axes and ammunition for George Washington's troops. Iron from Long Pond also helped make the chain blockade strung across the Hudson River at West Point to block British ships.
In 1853, Peter Cooper and Abram S. Hewitt bought the ironworks and installed high-output furnaces that were to supply iron for Union guns in the Civil War. But the advent of furnaces burning anthracite coal limited Long Pond's days. Iron manufacturers found it economical to set up their plants near coal mines, and Long Pond put out its fires in 1882. 
 A hundred years later, Long Pond began to come back to life as Louis West, who grew up on the estate owned by Hewitt's descendants, started a restoration campaign.
Now Long Pond, located in West Milford, is a 140-acre historic park under restoration. A volunteer group, the Friends of Long Pond Ironworks, will offer a two-hour walking tour at no charge on Saturday. Their number is (201) 839-0128.
Mr. West, 82, the former manager of a general store there, talked about the importance of Long Pond.
 Q. Why is this location special?
 A. What I'm standing on here at Long Pond was once under British control. The history is so deep. The iron was the backbone of the nation in the Revolutionary War. People who come here can see how the iron industry helped our country in the War of 1812 and in the Civil War, too.
 Q. What's been done so far?
 A. One water wheel was rebuilt. Two houses where ironworkers lived have been restored externally. My old country store was deteriorating something terrible, but in 1983 orders came through to repair it.
 Q. The ironworks closed in 1882, 31 years before you were born. How is it you know the lore and legend?
 A. Both the ironworks and the mines near it were operated by the Ringwood Company, which was owned by the Hewitt family. I ran the general store for the Ringwood Company from 1935 to 1954. One day in 1953, I saw the company truck going back and forth. I asked, "What are you doing?" They said: "We got orders from the New York office to get rid of all the old records of the Hewitts. We're taking them up to the dump."
That night after work, I climbed around the dump. I got some of the most important papers of the Hewitts about Long Pond that are in existence today.
 Q. When did you meet the Hewitt family?
 A. My father was hired as a superintendent of the private Hewitt estate in 1920. He was in charge of the manor house, the livestock, all the grounds. We moved here when I was almost 7, and I was brought up on the estate. I also worked in their mines.
 Q. When did you do that?
 A. In 1930. But one day when I came up from the shaft, who's standing there but Mr. Ogden B. Hewitt -- the president of the Ringwood Company. He said, "Louie, how old are you?" I said, "I'm 17, going on 18." He told me, "Don't go in the mines again. You're under age."
 Q. What did you do after that?
 A. I went to work in the mine supply house. I furnished the men with helmets, safety shoes, carbide lamps, pipe fittings and so forth. I even issued dynamite to the foreman of the shift. They didn't want me to go in the mines to work, but yet they'd let me handle dynamite. ROSALIE STEMER

Bluefish Are Running, So What's Wrong?

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
A CHILL wind whipped off the sea. Fading sunlight streaked the clouds pink as the fishing boats appeared one after the other on the horizon and chugged into port like horses in sight of the stable. On the dock, gulls as fat as Thanksgiving turkeys shrieked in anticipation.
"Late today," commented a young woman who was waiting beside a piling for one of the boats to tie up. Her brother and her uncle were on it and she had to pick them up and drive them home to Trenton. They go out fishing two, sometimes three days a month, she said. It costs about $40 each, including the boat fare, the gas, the incidentals like lunch. The idea is to catch enough fish to cover the cost and put protein on the table of a big extended family. "Coming in late is a good sign," the woman said. 
 "Why is that?"
"Means they caught a lot of fish. They get to pulling up them fish, nobody wants to come home."
By 4 o'clock, boats were nudging into berths at the sprawling Belmar marina with piles of fish glistening on their fantails. The porgies are running great. Blackfish are good. Sea bass, too. Dogfish and conger eels, but who wants them? And from Bradley to Deal, scattered schools of big blues.
The boat with the brother and uncle on it had rumbled in with a haul of big bluefish, 15-pounders and up. Once the boat was secure, a mate on the stern ran his fillet knife across a stone and started slicing thick steaks from the fish. Murmuring in appreciation, the gulls nudged in like gawkers outside a celebrity trial.
The men hauling their gear off the boat had those looks of grubby joy that you see only after a good day fishing. Most of them appeared to be in their 30's, including the small group of New York City cops on an outing with their expensive reels and coolers full of beer. In all, there were about 15 men on the trip, not counting the captain and two mates. The fare for the day was $30.
"You could eat bluefish three times a week," one man said.
It is one sign of the times that more people who take day trips on the 200 or more so-called party boats that sail out of marinas from Highlands to Cape May are now fishing to put food on the table. Despite that, the business is in bad shape -- the worst in anybody's memory.
"You work out the numbers," said Capt. Gary Fagan, owner of Big Mohawk III, a 100-footer that pulled into Belmar, also with about 15 customers on board. Capacity is more than 80. "This is supposed to be the best fishing time of the year. Ten years ago, if we were catching this quantity of fish, we'd have a big crowd. Now it's a struggle for survival. The economy won't let you raise your fare, so you're trying to get more out of less."
Captain Fagan has been running fishing boats off the Jersey coast since the day after he got out of high school 26 years ago. His co-captain, Chris Hueth, said he was amazed by the number of passengers who are also working the numbers now, fishing not for recreation but for food for the table.
"You can spot them right off," he said. "No beer, no Coca-Cola. Supermarket-brand soda. They can't tip the mate much, maybe a dollar. Yesterday, a guy caught 25 sea bass, about two pounds each. You know how many meals that makes?"
Usually, a boat makes enough money in the summer to cover the lean months after Christmas. This year was different. There were an astounding 14 drownings this summer off the North Jersey coast, a result of violent riptides swirling along badly eroded beaches. But the subtleties of coastal geology were lost on the hysterics of New York television news, who screamed alarms for six weeks about hurricane-churned seas and kept people away. In fact, Captain Fagan and others on the docks said, there were only two days the boats couldn't go out.
"I'd get calls from people watching television asking: 'What is going on down there? It sounds like the end of the world!' " said Patty Fagan, his wife, who handles phone bookings for the fishing trips.
Meanwhile, there is something else missing. As boats come in, you scan the faces and realize the geezers are gone, the retired guys who used to crowd the party boats -- the old fishermen who could arbitrate disputes about bait, demonstrate how to tie a sinker, correctly identify any fish hauled in.
Captain Fagan shrugged and hooked a thumb that pointed down the coast. "They're all in Atlantic City," he said. "Those retired guys that fished during the week and off season? The casinos offer them a $10 bus ride and $20 in free quarters plus a meal voucher. How can we compete with that? Those guys are fishing the slot machines now."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Christmas Looks Bad, So Buy Retailers

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
When Wall Street looks at America's shopping centers, it sees little but woe. The big retail chains just ended their worst month in years. The better retailers seem to consistently post disappointing earnings, while the poorer ones go bankrupt. Analysts are competing to identify the next disaster.
There seems to be little hope for a turnaround. The economy seems to be weakening. With consumer debt burdens at record levels, there are signs that Americans are keeping a tighter hold on their wallets. The holiday season is already being written off as the worst in years. 
 Clearly, it is time to buy retail stocks.
At best, this may turn out to be a time like the fall of 1990 for banks, or the spring of 1984 for long-distance telephone companies. In both cases, investors were extremely depressed about industry outlooks. The long-distance companies were involved in a seemingly endless war for market share that was destroying profits. The banks had lost who-knew-how-much money on bad loans, and investors were in no mood to trust anything they said.
On the other hand, neither industry resembled buggy whips just before Henry Ford became famous. Both banks and telephone companies were needed in the economy, and both found ways to make money, rewarding shareholders who had the nerve to buy when the stocks were hated.
Similarly, it is a safe bet that the kids will find something under the Christmas tree next month, not to mention next year. Nor will Americans stop buying clothes. Retailers are going to be around for a long time. On a long-term basis, it is hard to imagine that a diversified group of retail stocks will not show gains from these depressed levels.
The immediate question for investors is not whether all the bad news is out. It probably is not. But prices may already reflect most, if not all, of the bad news to come. One savvy broker suggests that at least some of the weakness in retail stocks last month was caused by tax-induced selling by mutual funds. Many funds have fiscal years that end in October, and have lots of taxable capital gains. Taking some losses in retail stocks helped to reduce the tax their fund holders must pay. That is the kind of selling that can signal market bottoms.
As Christmas approaches, there will be more attention focused on retail stocks. The negative -- and prevalent -- forecast is that nervous retailers will mark down prices well before Santa arrives and destroy earnings. But in such forecasts could be the seed of profit. It appears that retailers will enter the season with restrained inventories. In some cases, that reflects management caution. In others, it is because stores are being kept on a short leash by worried creditors.
That could set the stage for a surprisingly good Christmas for retail profits, even if it is not a particularly good one for sales. Stores might discover that low inventories mean they don't have to go into deep discounting.
Meanwhile, in a market that is otherwise setting records, with the Dow Jones industrial average above 4,800, you can find quality retail stocks such as J. C. Penney and Toys "R" Us trading at reasonable multiples of depressed earnings. Even that one-time growth stock darling, Wal-Mart Stores, is down to less than 20 times earnings. (In its case, the earnings have kept rising, but the stock hasn't.)
In an exuberant stock market where bargains are hard to find, it is as close to a clearance sale as you are likely to find.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4 Spyder;
Razzle-Dazzle From the Top Down

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON 

 BODY:
IT is unseemly, I guess, for a man of my years to giggle. But when I get behind the wheel of the Mitsubishi 3000GT Spyder, I just can't help it.
The mirth is contagious, too, because the sports coupe's shenanigans with its retractable hardtop -- whirring, gaping, lifting, folding, lowering and latching -- make it a sensation whenever you push the button in public, something else I can't help but do. 
 There are, of course, worse things to do while others watch. And the spontaneous laughs and comments from bystanders make it worthwhile to park at a downtown curb and put the top through its paces. One guy called the Spyder a humdinger, a word I don't think I've heard before in actual conversation.
"That is a real humdinger," he said, ho-hoing and shaking his head.
It is, indeed.
Aside from its novelty, the new model has the tighter, safer and warmer advantages of a closed car, yet a single push of a button can turn it into a convertible. Plus, it shares the virtues of its more mundane brethren.
Mitsubishi's muscular sports car has been around for five years, and the Spyder's futuristic roof adds a touch of youthful whimsy to the 3000GT's maturing warrior image. Paradoxically, it also evokes the past and the efforts by Ford to market a retractable hardtop in the late 1950's.
In fact, a surprising number of otherwise auto-passive folks who stopped to watch and comment on the Spyder's stationary performance seemed to remember the Ford Skyliner of 1957-59. That full-size convertible was an initial hit and is still one of the Fords most prized by collectors.
What killed it, eventually, was the same thing that will be a problem for Mitsubishi. When you put a metal roof into the trunk, which has just 4.4 cubic feet of space, said trunk is full to overflowing. And since the trunk lid has to be hinged at the back, loading even small amounts of cargo over the fender can be awkward.
The Mitsubishi is a different sort of automobile -- a toy instead of a family car, and as such it may fare better. Today's technology should also make repairs less of a hassle than they were with the complex retractables of the past, which actually date to the mid-30's, when prototypes were built by Riley in England and Peugeot in France.
But the '57 Skyliner was the first retractable to make it into mass production. And its top operated in almost exactly the same way as the Mitsubishi's, except for a computer. Ford used 10 power relays, 8 circuit breakers, 10 other switches, 3 drive motors and 610 feet of wiring. With computer controls, the Spyder needs a minimum of wiring and only 7 relays and 4 hydraulic cylinders.
Unfortunately, the technology and today's inflation also jack up the ante for what used to be a sports-car bargain. When Mitsubishi's do-everything 3000GT VR-4, with four-wheel-drive and twin turbochargers, was introduced in 1990, it had a sticker of $31,000. The red Spyder out in the driveway -- a '95 VR-4 with the 320-horsepower V8 and standard niceties like four-wheel steering -- has a take-home tag of $65,424, and even a "basic" hardtop VR-4 will set you back about $45,000. The Spyder can also be had in SL form, with a naturally aspirated 218-horsepower engine and a price of $58,424.
Still, the 3000GT is a strong seller in a weak market. For 1994, the company says, its sales of 15,230 outstripped the combined sales of the Mazda RX-7, Toyota Supra and Nissan 300ZX. Nissan, in fact, will drop the 300ZX after the '96 model year. Chrysler has also taken a new look at the declining market and has decided to stop selling the Dodge Stealth, its version of the 3000GT.
Mitsubishi builds both the Stealth and the 3000GT in Japan, although the Spyder is converted by the ASC Corporation of Southgate, Mich. Annual sales of the flip-top are expected to total 1,000.
No matter the model, the cars are luxurious, capable and fast. With its twin intercooled turbochargers, the "Caracas red" test car is capable of blasting from zero to 60 in about 5.5 seconds, pressing you into the leather seat and taking your breath away. Top speed is said to be 155 miles an hour, at which point the wall of air wins its battle against brute strength.
A six-speed manual is the only transmission available in the VR-4, although the nonturbo car can be had with an automatic. And it should be noted that the VR-4's console-mounted stick requires some muscle, as does the stiff clutch. The car is also hard to get into and out of -- and the confining back seat is just about impossible to use.
It goes without saying that the Spyder belongs to the driver, not the passengers, and at the wheel the comfort is considerable. The suspension and four-wheel steering make it a joy when carving curves or just cruising the open road.
Then, too, there's all that fun at the curb.

INSIDE TRACK: For convertible lovers facing winter, a wondrously silly and sensible solution.

HEADLINE: Let's Look Again at How We Treat Indonesia, China and Cuba

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Real Politics: Why Suharto Is In and Castro Is Out" (news analysis, Oct. 31) highlights failed Administration policies toward disparate authoritarian regimes. Political and economic expediency seems to drive these policies, rather than commitment to any consistent principle, including protection of universal human rights. 
 There is a major difference between clear-eyed engagement faithful to basic human rights and the chilling words of a senior Administration official, who reportedly described President Suharto of Indonesia as "our kind of guy."
In addition to human rights violations within Indonesia proper, President Suharto's Government has presided over the horror story that is East Timor, where some 200,000 East Timorese -- nearly a third of the original population -- have been killed by Indonesian troops.
How many lessons must we learn before we understand that embracing men like Mr. Suharto, who has presided over such events, is not ultimately in our national interest?
As to China, I believe the 1993 decision to delink most-favored-nation trade status from human rights conditions was taken by China as a signal that the United States will place economic self-interest before respect for human rights.
Indeed, even with "commercial engagement" of the past year, China's human rights record has deteriorated, according to the State Department, and prominent activists such as Wei Jingsheng and Chen Zemin have been reincarcerated. Ironically, as you note, United States business is reaping few benefits from what has been sown.
The ill-considered economic and strategic calculations that drive policy on Indonesia and China are underscored by United States treatment of Cuba. Where is the policy of commercial or constructive engagement when it comes to Fidel Castro? Surely that small nation, which poses no threat to the United States but has strong historical and cultural ties to our country, would be receptive to engagement.
There are human rights abuses there as well -- though not on the scale of East Timor or Tibet -- that would presumably be eased by engagement. Certainly Mr. Castro's Government could not do worse than the response given to us by the Chinese. Using diplomatic weapons at our disposal, including economic levers, to encourage fairness and human dignity, we can advance our business interests while remaining true to ourselves.

HEADLINE: The 4-1-1 On Urban Cool: Hype or Hope?

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

 BODY:
SILHOUETTED in the last light of a setting autumn sun, a group of young black men recently strolled along the teeming bazaar that is the Fulton Mall in downtown Brooklyn.
Without a word, without a smile, they walked with a stylized strut -- a graceful sway of shoulders, an easy sling of arms, a slight bob of the head. The bounce of their steps was so buoyant it suggested that Earth's gravity was everybody else's burden. 
 Amid the mall's commotion of open-air commerce, with its sonic soup of reggae, rap and rhythm and blues, these teen-agers, wearing the hip-hop ensemble of oversize clothing, moved like nightfall: smoothly, steadily. In a word, this crew from the nearby Farragut public housing project was cool. In two words: very cool.
"Cool ain't something everybody's got," said one of them, an 18-year-old who answers only to the name of E Z Don. "You know what I'm saying?
"Being cool is like money. Only some people can get it and some people have it. That's just how it is."
Or is it?
Urban cool -- inner-city-honed styles, attitudes and behavior -- has come under increasing scrutiny. This primarily black cultural expression that has rewritten the way America sings, dances and plays is now drawing the attention of more than just fashion designers and music producers. Other outsiders, from cultural anthropologists to sociologists, are examining this infectious force that, for better or worse, transforms almost everything it touches. And while urban cool may prove difficult to define, its presence is instantly recognizable.
From Trenton to Tokyo, from Kansas to Kenya, few people have not bumped into this phenomenon, perhaps in the guise of a baseball cap worn backward.
Yet, scholars are now cautioning that urban cool, especially for the young black men who feel estranged from white culture, is much more than slang, swagger or sagging jeans. Instead, experts like Dr. Richard Majors, a psychologist and senior research associate for the Urban Institute in Washington, say black cool is better understood as a complex system of coping mechanisms. And many say this premise is taking on special relevance now, as black men are becoming more introspective.
Young black women are generally not held to the same standards of urban cool. While there are a growing number of exceptions (the hip-hop singer Mary J. Blige and the rappers Salt N' Pepa, for example), a woman can be "soft" and still be accepted, said Marlene Kim Connor, author of "What is Cool? Understanding Black Manhood in America" (Crown Publishers 1995). A young man can't.
"Women are in some ways immune to the dictates of cool," she added.
Dr. Majors and others say urban cool is a much misunderstood technique for black survival in America, a thread of behavior stretching back from rebellious slaves up to the rapper Snoop Doggy Dog. At the same time, they note that cool can also be just as crippling as it can be liberating.
Being cool -- striking that delicate balance between originality and peer conformity -- is so paramount in the minds of some blacks that a 14-year-old Harlem resident recently confessed he would rather be dead than "wack," a term describing the utter absence of urban cool. But even a modest acceptance of cool's minimum demands may risk alienation from other blacks, stunt mainstream aspirations and generally heighten suspicion of the outside world.
Reef, 18, one of E Z Don's Brooklyn friends, who also identified himself by his street name, said being wack means "you're a sellout, you ain't real" and therefore not worthy of respect. Cool, he explained, is more than a fad; it is a way of life.
Langston Hughes suggested as much some 40 years ago in his poem "Motto."
I play it cool
And dig all jive,
That's the reason
I stay alive.
My motto as I live and learn
is: Dig and be dug inreturn.
"It's not all about clothes," explained Reef, whose 6-foot-3-inch frame was decked out in oversize black pants, a Halley Hansen yachting windbreaker and a pair of $180 Asolo hiking boots. "It's how you present yourself."
Unfortunately, urban cool's disaffection with the mainstream can make the leap to criminality only a short hop for some. It is hardly coincidental, many experts note, that gangster imagery is now considered very cool. And to complete the cycle, many street styles, gestures and expressions are being minted by blacks behind bars.
Cool may represent "one of the richest untapped areas for understanding black male behavior today," Dr. Majors and Janet Mancini Billson wrote in their book, "Cool Pose: The Dilemmas of Black Manhood in America" (Lexington Books, 1992).
Today, Dr. Majors remains convinced that he was right. "There's been a historic lack of opportunities and resources in this country for black men," he said. "Cool becomes his castle, his signature. It's his way to tell society that 'I am here.' "
It can also be a way of making the opposite sex to take notice. "The main reason somebody wants to be cool is for the ladies," said E Z Don, who was dressed from head to boot in the Army surplus chic of camouflage and chin straps. "You know there are a lot of goodies, females, out there that you like. You want to be noticed by them."
"You don't want to be noticed in a bad way," E Z Don added, his voice low, his words dripping like honey. "You rather them look at you as being cool than anything else."
But sometimes, he added, "you might be too cool and the girl gets away."
Long fascinated with what he saw as an almost obsessive drive to be cool by his fellow black friends and classmates -- even when it got them into trouble -- Dr. Majors decidedwhile attending college to study what he termed "cool pose." It has been a long-term exploration.
As the president and chief executive of the National Council of African-American Men, an advocacy group, Dr. Majors said he was frequently reminded that cool is often closely linked to a black man's "self-esteem, to his pride, to his culture, to his blackness." He said this condition was in stark contrast to whites, who tend to use cool more as a personality accessory rather than a source of validation.
While the film maker Spike Lee acknowledged that all black people are not cool, he said that "black and cool, for me, is interchangeable." And when he presents black characters on the screen, he said he tried to make them "interesting and truthful." Along the way, many of them -- from Mars Blackmon in "She's Gotta Have It" to Strike in "Clockers" -- have become profiles in many shades of urban cool.
"I think that coolness is something that is just inherent, just part of our culture, part of our spirituality," Mr. Lee said.
Terry Williams, a sociologist, says that historically, urban cool has been therapeutic. "Cool is a discipline to withhold anger," said Mr. Williams, a professor of community studies and ethnography at the New School for Social Research in New York. "The idea is that black folks have found a way to control their rage in America, and they do it through this rather creative way."
He suggested that an essential component of urban cool was to achieve an almost stoical detachment, or in street parlance, "to chill." For example, Snoop Doggy Dog, who the hip-hop impresario Russell Simmons recently described as the "epitome of cool," is a master of suppressing his emotions. When charged in connection with a killing in Los Angeles two years ago, he popularized the catch phrase: "It's all good, though" (pronounced "dough"). No matter how great the calamity or inconvenience, thousands of young black men shrug it off with the phrase.
"If you have that attitude," Mr. Simmons, 38, said, "when you got it rough and it's not working out, to a degree, it makes the bombs less effective. It protects you from all that."
The mastery of cool, even as its rules shift faster than the wind, also grants black men a degree of power and control in the broader society, Dr. Majors added.
Urban cool becomes the great psychological equalizer for blacks who are vastly underepresented in America's board rooms and country clubs. Beneath its display, Dr. Majors said, is a defiant message: "You can incarcerate me and throw away the key, you can unemploy me, keep away opportunity from me, alienate me, but, baby, I'm going to be here."
In fact, Dr. Majors and Dr. Mancini Billson said that much of urban cool's development was rooted in a belief held by many blacks that "classic American virtues of thrift, perseverance and hard work did not give them the same tangible rewards that accrued to whites."
OTHER experts say this connection is increasingly apparent as more young black men are coming to view mainstream society as foreign, hostile and emasculating. Consequently, the greater their sense of oppression -- real or imagined -- the greater their reliance on the mask of supreme calm, fearlessness and a practiced indifference.
Ms. Connor, the writer, said cool and manhood were synonymous in many black communities today.
"Cool is essentially a way that a young black boy in the streets of America becomes a man," she said. "When they turn to each other and they say, 'Yeah, man, he's cool,' they are giving him the highest compliment."
And cool training often begins early, she said. One of the first lessons a black man is likely to teach a child is to slap five, a gesture of greeting and congratulations. "That's the coolest thing a little kid can do," she said with a chuckle.
But for many blacks, particularly as they navigate their way through society, their measure of urban cool can become a perplexing house of mirrors.
"Cool is real and not real," Ms. Connor said. "It's real as long as you live in the inner cities and people can recognize your level of cool. But when you step outside that, it has very little meaning."
And that, she said, can be a huge problem for many blacks.
Kevin Powell, 29, a senior editor at Vibe magazine, says he is concerned about where all the cool posturing might lead. He sees a connection between the oppression of blacks and their retreat into cool.
He said, "I don't think it bodes well for our future at all."

HEADLINE: VOWS;
Alisa White and Joseph Holland

BYLINE: By LOIS SMITH BRADY

 BODY:
ALISA WHITE, a correspondent for "American Journal," a television newsmagazine, is athletic, spiritual, ladylike and often jet-lagged. She covered the O. J. Simpson trial for the program, which is syndicated, commuting between New York and Los Angeles for the last year.
She never eats desserts. And when she has a problem, she often fasts and meditates until she feels clearer about it. 
 Until a friend introduced her to Joseph Holland last March, she had dated some men who took her out to dinner and described their ocean-front houses in the Hamptons, powerful Porsches and celebrity friends. She wasn't impressed.
"It was important to me to find a man who was humble, who didn't drop names and talk about what he owned and who he knew," said Ms. White, a graduate of San Francisco State University. "I wanted to meet someone who let his life speak for itself."
By most accounts, there are few people as humble as Mr. Holland, who is the Commissioner of the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal and the former co-chairman of Gov. George E. Pataki's election campaign. Friends describe Mr. Holland as a politician for the 1990's: quiet, community-oriented and so spiritual that he has an almost monklike presence.
An All-American football star at Cornell University and a graduate of Harvard Law School, he opened the Beth Hark Crisis Center 13 years ago. It is a shelter for homeless drug-addicted men in Harlem, where he lived until recently, eating meals and sleeping in the same room with the men. He even wrote a play about them, "Home Grown," which is currently being performed at the National Black Theater in Harlem.
He owns a travel agency and also runs a Ben & Jerry's franchise in Harlem, where most of his employees are "graduates" of the shelter.
"Joe is completely selfless," said Barbara Conroy, a friend and a producer for "Inside Edition," the television program. "His father was an ambassador to Sweden; he's Cornell and Harvard educated. But he gave it all up to serve the homeless. How many people do we know who would do something like that?"
Ms. Conroy, who is also a friend of Ms. White's, introduced the couple. At her suggestion, Mr. Holland called Ms. White while she was working in Los Angeles, and for the next three weeks they talked often cross-country about politics, religion, their families, race and Harlem.
When they finally were to meet in person, Ms. White was so nervous she was afraid to open the door. Mr. Holland was not at all apprehensive. "There was a peace and a calm about meeting this woman," he said. "I'd already felt the connection over the phone."
The two are very similar. Both are in their mid-30's; they run, mountain bike, golf, pray and fast together. Just before their wedding, they moved into a brownstone in Harlem together.
On Oct. 28, they were married at Abyssinian Baptist Church on West 138th Street, in a wedding with the Rev. Calvin O. Butts and the Rev. Dr. A. R. Bernard Sr. officiating. The ceremony was like a conversation with the couple -- spiritual, philosophical, probing and unhurried.
But it was not without glamour. "Alisa sparkled all the way down the aisle," said Liz Bruder, a guest, who is a vice president at the Architects and Designers Building in Manhattan. "Her headpiece looked like a giant diamond bracelet wrapped around her hair. It was very poetic."
After the ceremony, 150 guests gathered for dinner at the Union Theological Seminary, at 120th Street. Ken Frydman, who was a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani during his mayoral campaign, said that friends of the groom had wondered for a long time when or if he would ever marry.
"Joe had everything a mate could want," Mr. Frydman said. "It was a conundrum. How does the perfect catch remain at liberty for so many years? Women often tell you there aren't many great ones. He's a great one."

RETAILING
Half Empty, Half Full
It's November, and the finish line looms, seven weeks away, for the holiday shopping season. The nation's big retailers started by reporting their lowest monthly sales growth in more than four years, raising concerns about whether a grim Christmas looms. Yet investors seemed willing to ignore the report. Shares of Dayton Hudson, the Gap and some other retailers surged; Jeffrey Feiner, Salomon's retail analyst, reasoned that the early warning of weak sales might allow retailers to get their inventories and attendant costs in hand.
 
ACCOUNTABILITY 101
U.S. Expels Daiwa
In what started as a "rogue trader" case, the victimized management has wound up answering criminal charges. Federal and state regulators ordered Daiwa Bank to close its American operations as a Federal grand jury accused the bank of illegally covering up $1.1 billion in trading losses at its New York branch. The indictment asserted that Daiwa's management had communicated at length with Toshihide Iguchi, the trader who has acknowledged creating the losses, and accused Daiwa of conspiracy, fraud, falsification of bank records and the failure to disclose Federal crimes. Daiwa said it would defend itself in court, and the Japanese Government took steps to avert panic and make Daiwa's expulsion from the U.S. as orderly as possible.

Bowing to the inevitable, Nicholas W. Leeson, the former trader, agreed to return to Singapore to face trial for the multibillion-dollar losses that sent Barings P.L.C. to its death. Speculation was rife that he had abandoned his fight against extradition in order to plea bargain, offering to implicate his superiors at Barings. That might play well in Singapore, where a report commissioned by the Government found that Barings managers were "grossly negligent, or willfully blind and reckless to the truth" in the months before the bank collapsed.

So Happy Together
With two months still to go, American mergers and acquisitions in 1995 have totaled nearly $346 billion, close to last year's record of $347.1 billion. Last week's activities included Praxair offering $2.1 billion for CBI, Comcast paying $1.6 billion for Scripps's cable operations and Softkey International paying $800 million for two educational software companies. Among the spurs to all this activity are the stock market's record levels this year and a growing willingness to undertake hostile offers.
 
CHANGE OF HEART
Delete Text
Not so long ago (1991 to be precise) Wordperfect was the market leader in computer word processors, a cleverly designed, easy-to-use, attractive program. In what might be a caution to today's various best sellers, Wordperfect is now regarded as a "sunset" product, and Novell, which paid hundreds of millions of dollars for it only a year ago, has put it on the block. Who might want it? No one's certain.
 
WAGES
Feeling the Pinch
In between the postings of strong corporate profits and record stock prices, wage increases are providing scant nourishment for American workers. In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, workers' earnings rose 2.7 percent, the smallest annual increase on record.
 
MEXICO
The Search for Stability
With neither economic balance nor investor confidence fully restored from last year's collapse of the peso, the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo signed a pact with business and labor leaders intended to control prices, cut public spending and limit salary increases. But the agreement did not address a major concern of investors, failing to provide exchange-rate controls. For a day at least, the Mexican stock market rallied on the news, before settling back.
 
PINK SLIPS
Is That a Sucking Sound?
Continuing its drive to shift operations to less expensive plants abroad, Fruit of the Loom said it would trim 3,500 jobs and close six plants in an attempt to increase profits. The nation's largest underwearmaker said the culprits were the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which had led to a flood of cheap imports.
 
THE GLOBAL VILLAGE
Betting on Sports
Gambling that the global appetite for the sweat and thrill of sports competition knows no bounds, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc., the huge cable company, are expected to set up a global sports cable network that would compete with ESPN, which is largely owned by Capital Cities/ABC and soon to be owned by Walt Disney. American sports continue to grow in popularity overseas, but whether the traffic is two-way remains to be seen. Cricket, anyone? Or tossing the caber?

The fountain in the food court at the King of Prussia Mall, in King of Prussia, Pa., typifies the new approach. The developers, who spent $225 million on the mall's makeover, hope for 10 million shoppers annually. (Tim Shaffer for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
There Are Two Sides To Every Game in Town

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
PERHAPS no American industry this decade, with the possible exception of computer software and on-line technology, has grown as rapidly and pervaded society as thoroughly as legalized gambling.
In 1988 casino gambling was legal in only two states -- Nevada and New Jersey. Today casinos, including those on Indian reservations, operate or are authorized in 23 states. In 1994 gamblers armed with lottery tickets, chips and slot machines wagered a whopping $482 billion in this country, which is more than the gross national product of China and represents a 22 percent increase over the previous year. In the same year consumers spent nearly three times as much on lottery tickets as they did on movie tickets, according to International Gaming and Wagering Business magazine. 
 Yet the first signs of a grassroots backlash also appeared last year, and the nascent revolt is taking hold in state capitals and in Washington. Last week the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee heard testimony on legislation that would establish a national commission to study the economic and social effects of legalized gambling. The House Judiciary Committee held a similar hearing in late September.
It comes as no surprise that such a measure is strongly opposed by the gambling industry, which has become a large contributor to political campaigns. President Clinton, however, announced his support last week. "Too often," Mr. Clinton wrote in a letter to sponsors of the bill, "public officials view gambling as a quick and easy way to raise revenues, without focusing on gambling's hidden social, economic and political costs."
Two Republican Presidential candidates, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Patrick J. Buchanan, a conservative columnist, have taken strong stands against the expansion of gambling. The Christian Coalition, which is devoting more attention to the issue, has pledged resources toward establishing a Washington branch of the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, a network based in Illinois.
In November 1994, from Florida to Wyoming, an overwhelming majority of state and local referendums to start or expand gambling went down to defeat. In response the gambling industry established a Washington lobbying group, the American Gaming Association, and hired Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as its president and chief executive officer.
Mr. Fahrenkopf, a Nevada lawyer, rejects the notion that the tide has turned against gambling. "All our polls show that the vast majority of Americans still support gaming and casino gaming," he said. "They've spoken with their feet and with their pocketbooks."
But opponents argue that the rapid proliferation of gambling, from riverboats that ply the Mississippi to Indian casinos in Connecticut and New York, has magnified the industry's shortcomings.
It has become clear, they say, that the benefits of new jobs and growing revenue for states' coffers have been more than offset by a draining of dollars from other industries, by crime, addiction among those gamblers who can least afford it -- especially at a time of economic uncertainty and stagnating wages -- an undermining of the work ethic and corruption of the political system. Casino jobs are often low paying and sometimes temporary. And as the market for gambling has neared saturation, some outlets, riverboats in particular, have started to fail.
 
'An Economic Bust'
 "There's always been moral opposition to it," said Robert Goodman, author of "The Luck Business: The Devastating Consequences and Broken Promises of America's Gambling Explosion." (Free Press 1995). "I think what's new is people realizing that it has been an economic bust, that it's sucking jobs out of cities, that you go to city after city and shops and restaurants are closing while the only things opening are pawn shops." In some states, gambling has revealed its dark yet familiar side: corruption. In Louisiana, a state chronically reeling from disclosures involving shady deals and good old boys, the F.B.I. is investigating a pattern of alleged payoffs to state lawmakers who orchestrated the defeat of legislation that would have allowed a vote on whether to eliminate video poker at truck stops. Voter disgust is playing a significant role in this year's gubernatorial campaign, and leading the candidates to try to outdo each other's anti-gambling proposals.
Mr. Fahrenkopf, who says the latest scandal has more to do with Louisiana than with gambling, stated that in general, "when a little mud splashes up in one corner of this industry, inevitably everybody gets coated."
Regardless of its many pitfalls, gambling may continue to be driven by the same forces that have been driving it for the last seven years -- competition among states and competition between the states and the Indian reservations within their borders.
After Congress passed a 1988 law enabling tribes to open casinos, state officials decided that they wanted a share in the industry. And as the first states began to allow gambling, their neighbors moved quickly to join them in order to stanch the flow of revenue across state lines. That instinct led New York's Legislature this year to begin the process that would allow a vote on a constitutional amendment to permit casino gambling in places other than Indian reservations. Casinos are well established in New Jersey and Connecticut.
 
The End Game
 Tom Grey, executive director of the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, said he does not underestimate the determination of the gambling industry to expand.
"This is a predatory enterprise," he said, "and it needs new markets."

HEADLINE: A Booming Colorado Weighs Its Future

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: ASPEN, Colo. Nov. 4

 BODY:
Lighting a small, makeshift flamethrower in his cluttered kitchen, Hunter S. Thompson pointed to imaginary Boeing 737's flying overhead and ranted, "Greedheads, greedheads."
Not confining pyrotechnics to his mountainside home, the irascible journalist is rallying Aspenites to vote on Tuesday against a proposal to widen and strengthen this remote resort town's airport runway to accommodate long-haul jets. 
 Executives of the Aspen Skiing Company complain that the number of skiers here has remained flat over the last 20 years. For Mr. Thompson and his fellow slow-growth advocates in this town of 6,000, that is just fine.
It is an attitude that is spreading like a dry pine forest fire in Colorado, one of the fastest-growing states in the Rocky Mountains, the region with the fastest economic and population growth in the nation. On Tuesday, slow-growth initiatives will be on the ballot in Aspen and at least five other Colorado boom towns.
"It's not in my children's interest to have six million people living in Colorado," said Richard A. Lamm, referring to predictions of a population about double that when he was Governor in the early 1980's. "We don't want Denver to become one big Los Angeles of the Rockies."
The slow-growth movement is taking hold as memories fade of the Rockies' bitter recession of a decade ago, a bust triggered by falling oil and gas prices. With Colorado's economy increasingly diversified, many economists believe that the state may be breaking a century-long boom-and-bust cycle.
Today, only 1 percent of Coloradans work in the energy field. More now work in telecommunications than energy. Denver is the capital of nation's cable television industry. Further spurring job growth there are a new international airport and a mutual fund industry whose portfolio has grown tenfold, to $50 billion, in five years.
In the first half of the 1990's, Colorado's annual population growth ran at triple the nation's rate of 1 percent a year, though it has tapered off to only double the national rate today. With quality of life increasingly important for white-collar workers, Denver now offers four major sports teams, a revitalized downtown and easy access to wilderness areas.
In this environment, more and more Colorado communities feel they can give themselves the luxury of shutting the door.
In Boulder, where job growth has run at three times population growth, turnout was light last week for a pro-growth rally billed as "a taste of unemployment."
Stephen M. Pomerance, a City Council candidate who helped found a residents group called Slow Growth, said that unemployment was not a realistic fear for most residents. "In Boulder, we have 85,000 jobs for a city with 95,000 people," he said.
On Tuesday, Boulder residents are to vote on an initiative to cut annual commercial construction in half over the next five years. Sensing a ground swell of support for curbs, Boulder's City Council voted in September to adopt a compromise measure, to cut commercial construction by 30 percent.
Boulder has been so attractive to investors that during the first nine months of this year companies scrambled to win permits for one million square feet of commercial construction, double the annual average of previous years.
To some, Boulder's ballot proposal represents the second shoe dropping. In 1976, Boulder became the first city in Colorado to put caps on housing construction, though it left commercial development untouched.
"The result is that we now have 40,000 people commuting into Boulder every day," said Paul Danish, a Boulder county commissioner, who pushed for the residential curb 20 years ago. Predicting victory for the commercial curb on Tuesday, he said, "You spend your day looking up someone's tailpipe -- and then you say get it out of my life."
The slow-growth movement is strongest in Boulder and other affluent western suburbs of Denver.
In nearby Golden, home to Coors beer, residents are to vote Tuesday on an initiative to limit housing construction to 1 percent of current square footage. Offering views of Rocky Mountain foothills, this onetime territorial capital of 15,000 people saw housing construction growth of 3.2 percent in 1994.
Similar limits are to be voted on Tuesday in three other west Denver suburbs: Broomfield, Lafayette and Longmont.
In Utah, another fast-growing Western state, voters in Midway and St. George on Tuesday will consider limits on building permits.
From 1991 to 1994, Arizona and Colorado each experienced about 11 percent population growth, fastest after Nevada and Idaho.
To some, the West's anti-bulldozer movement is elitist.
"We have a whole generation of people who believe that only worms should move dirt," said Philip M. Burgess, president of the Center for the New West, a Denver-based study group. "Growth management can degenerate into enclave development. It backfires because it raises prices, it reduces choice."
For some, Colorado's current economic slowdown and the state's history of boom and bust should be enough for communities to keep doors open to new investment.
"It wasn't that long ago -- in the mid-80's -- that we had a collapse, the bottom fell out of the energy industry, the bottom fell out of the high-tech industry," warned Kenneth N. Hotard, senior vice president of the Boulder Area Board of Realtors. "We already see companies looking elsewhere."
Alexander E. Bracken, a spokesman for Boulder's largest private employer, the Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation, said of his city's slow-growth initiative: "We hope that it will be defeated. This initiative would make it very difficult for us to grow."
Coloradans have consistently refused to adopt statewide growth controls or plans.
In Denver today, Gov. Roy Romer, a Democrat, led a symposium on "smart growth." "It is not realistic to build a wall around your state and to stop growth," he said in an interview on Thursday.
He defined "smart growth" as taking advantage of the population's high level of education to provide well-paying jobs with benefits. Colorado ranks third nationwide in the portion of its population who are high school and college graduates.
Here in the mountain towns of Pitkin County, where unemployment is nearly nonexistent, slow-growth advocates suspect that expansion of Aspen's airport is really a Trojan horse for "industrial tourism."
"They want an industrial, cruise-ship economy here," said Tim Mooney, a realtor and ski instructor, who wore a button showing the black silhouette of a Boeing 737, stamped with a red international stop symbol.
"We're in a box canyon at 7,900 feet -- there are only so many resources here," Mr. Mooney continued, his voice rising. "If the ski company thinks they can ratchet up their business by 10 percent a year, they are going to ratchet down the environment by 10 percent a year."
Down the street, the Aspen Mayor, John S. Bennett, was also skeptical. "One of Aspen's greatest assets has been lack of accessibility," reflected Mr. Bennett, a Yale graduate who owns a French restaurant here, Pour La France. "A bigger airport with heavy, metal jets, flying in from Las Vegas -- I fail to see how it makes Aspen a better community."
Today, newspapers brimmed with advertisements, paid for by the Aspen Skiing Company and other businesses that profit from the ski trade, favoring airport expansion. On Friday, over a breakfast served by a French waiter at a ski company hotel, company executives grumbled that only "elitists" were against permitting landings by Boeing 737's.
"People who oppose this are second-homeowners who come in on private jets -- they are financially bullet-proofed," said Robert A. Maynard, the ski company president. "Why, we even heard someone say, 'Only nerds fly 737's.' "

HEADLINE: Bishops Steer Middle Course On Politics

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS 

 BODY:
At a time when political conservatives are gearing up to recruit Catholic voters, the nation's Roman Catholic bishops are reaffirming today their longstanding commitment to defend the unborn, the poor and the vulnerable while guarding against attempts to enlist the church in partisan politics.
The bishops have begun the widespread distribution of a 14,000-word statement on political responsibility that sets out familiar positions on issues like abortion, welfare, immigration and arms control, but also declares, "Our moral framework does not easily fit the categories of right or left, Republican or Democrat." 
 Although the Catholic bishops have issued statements on political responsibility before every Presidential campaign since 1976, the statement, a year before November's Presidential election, comes at a time when the role of religion in politics is growing more prominent.
For the first time, the bishops are not only releasing their statement to news organizations but sending copies of the 32-page pamphlet to the nation's 19,000 parishes, with order forms for buying more. In another first, they have condensed key passages into a leaflet designed for mass distribution.
The statement was adopted unanimously at the September meeting of the 54-member Administrative Committee of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. "The bishops' interest in getting this message out far exceeds what it's been in the past," said John Carr, who oversees the bishops' offices on domestic and international issues.
"What feeds this in part is that the message echoes the Holy Father's call to protect the unborn, reach out to poor and welcome the newcomer," he said, noting that the pamphlet opens with excerpts from the Pope John Paul II's speeches in the United States last month.
But the bishops are also aware of a determined effort by the Christian Coalition, the largely evangelical Protestant political organization headed by Pat Robertson, to set up a Catholic auxiliary claiming to speak for Catholics.
The group, the Catholic Alliance, has produced fliers declaring that it "represents Catholics before the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and local governing bodies." The fliers include a "scorecard" on Congressional voting, rating representatives and senators on what the flier calls the "Catholic Alliance position."
The scorecard is the same one drawn up by its parent organization, the Christian Coalition. Although featuring issues like abortion, the scorecard lists issues like the balanced-budget amendment and term limits on which the bishops take no position, and it makes no mention of some concerns that the bishops emphasize.
For example, the bishops' political responsibility statement expresses support for the earned income tax credit for the working poor, "judiciously administered" affirmative action programs, arms control, foreign assistance, the United Nations, universal access to health care and a "generous U.S. immigration policy."
In some cases, the Catholic Alliance scorecard gives politicians positive ratings for positions that the bishops have actually opposed, like voting for welfare legislation that cuts off benefits for children born out of wedlock to mothers on welfare, or voting for legislation expanding capital punishment.
The bishops' statement also criticized "public attitudes that dismiss the legitimate role of government and ridicule public officials," saying: "Our tradition and experience teach us that markets have both advantages and limitations, that government is neither the solution nor the enemy, that private charities have essential roles, but cannot substitute for just public policies. How these sectors complement and restrain one another is a major issue for 1996."
The bishops warned against political shortcomings that are creating cynicism and disenchantment with politics. "Sound bites and symbols, war rooms and attack ads are replacing civil debate," they said.
"Too much of public life reflects our fears more than hopes, dividing us by age, race, region and class," they said, with the public agenda set by "the politics of money and polarization."
The bishops also warned against "a growing temptation to blame our sense of economic insecurity and moral decline not on cultural disarray or the failures of political and economic leadership, but on too much compassion."
The statement welcomed "the growing discussion of the role of moral values in public life," but it rejected "religious leaders telling people how to vote or religious tests for candidates."

HEADLINE: Tokyo Takes Hand in Bank Merger Talks

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 4

 BODY:
The Finance Ministry has summoned Daiwa Bank and two other Japanese institutions for consultations as early as Monday in an attempt to avert a banking crisis days after Daiwa was expelled from the United States by American regulators.
Japanese financial experts said today that Daiwa and Sumitomo Bank were discussing a merger to create the biggest bank in the world, allied with Nomura Securities, the world's largest securities firm. 
 But they cautioned that no deal had been finalized and that there were potential obstacles ahead.
Nevertheless, the discussions of mergers and alliances have captured the imagination of the business world, because the proposals on the table would have repercussions on global financial competition.
A merger with Sumitomo, already one of the world's largest banks, would create a new bank with assets of about $840 billion, according to data compiled by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic daily.
"The possible merger could trigger far-reaching restructuring in the Japanese financial sector," said Toru Nakakita, an economics professor at Toyo University.
While some of Daiwa's operations are attractive to Sumitomo, the prospect of a grand alliance with Nomura would seem to be more of an incentive.
Yet it is not clear to what extent the discussions are motivated by business considerations and to what extent by the Japanese Government's desire for a tidy, traditional Japanese-style rescue operation. Nomura and Daiwa started as one institution, and they have remained close since they split in 1948.
Sumitomo and Daiwa had apparently discussed the possibility of combining their operations earlier this year, after the Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank announced that they would merge next spring.
The new Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank will become the world's largest bank, with assets of 73 trillion yen, or about $709 billion, unless Sumitomo and Daiwa merge.
Daiwa is somewhat appealing as a takeover target because it is the only big Japanese bank with a trust business and a majority stake in a securities house, Cosmo Securities.
Both Sumitomo and Daiwa are based in Osaka and have somewhat similar styles and cultures, which could make a combination go more smoothly. The corporate culture in Osaka is more aggressive than that in Tokyo; people still sometimes greet each other in Osaka with the saying, "Mokarimakka," or "Have you made money today?"
Working against a merger is that the banks' domestic operations in some ways mirror rather than complement each other.
Another issue that would need to be resolved is how to deal with potential fines by American regulators that could reach $1.3 billion if Daiwa is convicted of all the charges it faces.
Daiwa's troubles started after Toshihide Iguchi, a bond trader in New York, abruptly confessed on July 24 to having hidden $1.1 billion on losses over 11 years. For two months after that, he and Daiwa executives are said to have continued to hide the losses from American authorities. The bank disclosed its losses to the Federal Reserve on Sept. 18.
On Thursday, American regulators ordered Daiwa Bank to shut its American operations, accusing it of conspiracy, fraud, falsification of bank records and failure to disclose Federal crimes.
Both Sumitomo and Nomura have agreed to assist Daiwa in the disposal of its American operations, but Daiwa executives have released few details on Nomura's possible involvement.
The merger, if it goes through, will not necessarily solve all of Daiwa's problems, partly because it would take nearly a year to complete, according to Japanese news reports today. Some financial specialists said that the merger diverts attention away from the real problems of the Japanese banking industry.
"People tend to think that being bigger is synonymous with being stronger," said Yukio Noguchi, an economics professor at Hitotsubashi University. "A merger would in many cases hide the problems or weaknesses of the Japanese banking industry."
Not only is financial disclosure scant and inspection sloppy, but the nation's banking institutions are beleaguered with at least $500 billion in bad loans, of which one-third are probably unrecoverable. Already, foreign banks are raising their charges on loans to Japanese banks, and in some cases they are trimming credit to them.
As for the alliance with Nomura, Kyodo News Service tonight quoted unidentified corporate executives as saying that Daiwa and Nomura had been negotiating to establish a joint financial holding company. That could transform the separate institutions into a large conglomerate.
Kyodo said Nomura and Daiwa had decided to expand their prospective partnership to encompass the new bank that would be created if Daiwa and Sumitomo merged.
Financial specialists cast doubt on this plan because such a holding company is not allowed under current financial regulations.
Still, even if a formal relationship is not established, Sumitomo's ties to Nomura would be greatly strengthened if it combined with Daiwa.
Even if a merger is never achieved, the possibility of one may help calm the markets -- and that may be in the back of the mind of banking executives involved in the negotiations.

HEADLINE: Some Say a Powell Candidacy Could Make Black Voters Abandon Democrats

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Here inside the Beltway, Republican speculation over whether a Colin Powell candidacy would thwart Newt Gingrich's conservative revolution has all but eclipsed an equally intriguing issue: Were General Powell to seek the Republican Presidential nomination -- and possibly go on to win the Oval Office -- would a significant number of blacks eventually abandon the Democratic Party?
In its most basic form, that issue is currently underlying the sound bites of former Vice President Dan Quayle -- who wants General Powell in the Republican Party -- and is on the minds of politically engaged black academics at both ends of the political spectrum. 
 Like the Republican conservatives' cold war over General Powell, this issue, too, is full of caveats and what if's simply because of two big unknowns.
First, will General Powell, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, announce that he intends to run for the Presidency as a Republican? And if he runs, can he manage the transition from book-tour celebrity to a Presidential candidate whose themes and firm positions will connect with voters, especially Republican primary voters?
Two prominent black academics -- Roger Wilkins, a professor of history at George Mason University whose views are left of center, and Glenn Loury, an economics professor at Boston University whose perspective is right of center -- believe that a Powell candidacy could, under the right conditions, move a sizable number of blacks from the Democratic Party to the Republican side of the ledger.
Though they approach politics from different viewpoints, both agree that such a long-term structural change would be good for the quality of political discourse and could improve the way both parties develop domestic policy.
For Professor Wilkins, General Powell "just happens to fit into something I've yearned for." In an Oct. 9 editorial in The Nation, a liberal weekly, Professor Wilkins wrote: "With about 85 percent of the black Presidential vote crammed into a corner of the Democratic Party, Republicans run on their whiteness and Democrats run away from 'their' blacks. That mixture is toxic. It prevents rational discourse on the broadest range of issues, from our national priorities to education reform to urban reconstruction."
With a substantial number of blacks in both parties, he said in a subsequent interview, Democrats could not take loyal black voters for granted and "Republicans couldn't use racially coded messages they've used so effectively over the years."
Professor Loury, who espouses views on abortion and affirmative action that are to the right of General Powell's, said many blacks would vote for the general if he was the Republican nominee. But whether that would pull blacks into the party in large numbers, he said, "is a longer-term proposition." He added, "It has to do with whether the party gets a soul."
So far, Professor Loury said, the success of the political revolution led by Mr. Gingrich has been fueled by "anger and disgust." What the revolution lacks, and what Powell may be able to supply if he runs and wins, Professor Loury said, is a conservative governing vision that, though differing in philosophy, is as powerful and compelling as was Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.
The possibility of persuading a significant number of blacks to become Republicans figured prominently today in remarks by Mr. Quayle, who is urging the General to join the Republican Party regardless of whether he runs. General Powell has not disclosed his party affiliation.
"I hope that people would view this as a very positive step for black Americans to seriously look at the Republican Party," Mr. Quayle said on the NBC "Today" program. "We're going to continue to reach out to people like Colin Powell and others and say, 'Our party is open, and we're also a party that represents you."
At the moment, not many blacks feel that way. Results of the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, released last week, underscore black voters' loyalty to the Democratic Party. When respondents were asked to cast a hypothetical vote for President Clinton or General Powell, 55 percent of blacks favored the President and 28 percent preferred the retired four-star general. But whites favored General Powell over Mr. Clinton by 51 percent to 31 percent.
The reliability of these soundings and other pro-Powell polls is always an issue, political analysts say, since it is difficult to tell which whites give an honest answer that fits their view of the moment and which give what they consider a socially acceptable answer. "I distrust the high poll numbers right now," said Ron Walters, chairman of Howard University's political science department. "You have to discount those numbers by some factor."
What many have forgotten, says Eddie Mahe, a prominent Republican consultant based in Washington, is that before 1964 and the battle over civil rights legislation, Republican candidates were often able to win up to 40 percent of the black vote. Since then, Mr. Mahe said, Republicans have done poorly because of a presumption that there is a racist message in the party's platform and positions. Mr. Mahe said that as a Presidential candidate "Colin Powell would be able to leap over it like a Superman."
Without the presumption of racism in the way, many blacks could compare their views to Republican positions and values. If that occurred, Mr. Mahe estimated, Republicans could win one-quarter to one-third of black votes.
Yet not everyone who tracks electoral behavior believes that having substantial blocks of black voters in both parties would improve the parties or policy making in Washington. Prof. Ron Walters of Howard University said such a development would splinter black leverage.
While General Powell ponders his choices in seclusion, he remains a vessel that Republicans, Democrats and academics of all stripes pour their hopes, hunches and dreams into. Based on General Powell's own description of himself as as a centrist of the Rockefeller Republican variety, Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, said that the General would be comfortable as a New Democrat. With President Clinton seeking re-election next year, Mr. From said General Powell could set his sights on running in 2000.
But for Mr. From, as for many others, the question remains: how would General Powell perform in Republican primaries? Mr. From said that in the 1994 Congressional elections, in which Republicans wrested control of the House and Senate, 57 percent of Republican voters identified themselves as conservatives and about 20 percent as religious or cultural conservatives. "Those numbers will be magnified in the primaries," he said.

HEADLINE: Chirac Says Deficit Cuts To Come First

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Cutting Government budget deficits is high on the agenda in France, but President Jacques Chirac has told people here to expect their taxes and social security premiums to go up, not down, during the next two years to narrow a $60 billion annual shortfall.
And the conservative majority in Parliament applauded him for it. 
 In 1995 the social security system, which covers old-age pensions and health insurance, will be nearly $13 billion in the red, according to official estimates made public last week. All indications are that Mr. Chirac's conservative Government will raise taxes, possibly by 1 percent, to make up the difference.
"The priority of priorities is to cut deficits," he said in a television interview last week.
In France, which has one of the most comprehensive and expensive welfare states in Europe, the debate is less about scaling back government largess than about how to pay for it, perhaps because so many people collect benefits.
"We started the social security system just after World War II, a period when there was great national solidarity," said Pierre Laroque, 88, who was assigned by Charles de Gaulle in 1945 to give France confidence about the future by establishing comprehensive social security. "There was a period of 30 years when life for most people just got better every year, and the French got used to the idea."
These golden years peaked by the end of the 1980's, when unemployment began to rise.
"We never foresaw that there would come a day when three million people would be without jobs and receiving jobless benefits," Mr. Laroque said.
Mr. Chirac, a political disciple of de Gaulle, did not talk about cutting back benefits, but told his television audience, "France has been spending more than it took in for the past 15 to 20 years."
Mr. Chirac was elected by a 52 percent majority last May promising that his main priority would be reducing the unemployment rate, then more than 12 percent. He attributed it then in part to the high tax burdens imposed on business and individuals here by the comprehensive welfare state. Companies have to pay government-mandated social security, unemployment and other premiums that can add as much as 65 percent to their wage bills.
Now, with his popularity at 14 percent in a public opinion poll by the Ipsos Institute, Mr. Chirac says ambitious job-creation projects and lower taxes will come only after budget cuts reduce deficits and high interest rates.
The remarks by Mr. Chirac last week ended months of uncertainty in international financial markets about whether he would stick with the stringent deficit-cutting policies required by the 1992 European Union Treaty for a common European currency by the end of the century.
French farmers and industrialists, two of Mr. Chirac's most powerful constituencies, argue that a common currency would strengthen French competitiveness, particularly with the United States.
The President is insulated from public opinion ratings because his term runs until 2002, leaving his Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, to take most of the heat if the economic policies fail.

HEADLINE: Friend Says Two Officers Stranded Man Before Killing

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: FORD HEIGHTS, Ill., Nov. 4

 BODY:
On the last day of his life, Richard Will, a 32-year-old white man, begged two black police officers in this dangerous, almost entirely black Chicago suburb to give him a ride to the police station, Mr. Will's friend says.
About 15 minutes later, after walking five blocks in search of a telephone, Mr. Will was attacked by a group of young black males. He was beaten, doused with lighter fluid and set afire. He died a few hours later. 
 Federal and state police authorities have opened investigations into the case. And the family of Mr. Will, a laborer who cleaned stables at a racetrack and who had custody of a 2-year-old daughter, is preparing to file a Federal civil rights suit against the Ford Heights police.
"The police knew the degree of danger in this town," said William Braverman, the family's lawyer. "I don't care if the person passing through is black, Caucasian or Asian. You don't just leave them in a dangerous situation."
The case bears some resemblance to an incident in 1989, in which two white Chicago police officers dropped off two black teen-agers in a rough white neighborhood known as Canaryville. One of the teen-agers was severely beaten. The Canaryville case outraged blacks here, and thousands of demonstrators took part in a three-mile protest march past the home of Mayor Richard M. Daley.
Now, many whites around Chicago are voicing anger. Some are unhappy that the Ford Heights case has not been given more attention by news organizations.
Mike Royko, the Chicago Tribune columnist, asked what the reaction to the case would have been if the police had been white and the victim black: "Would this create much of a public uproar? Demands by community and political leaders for a full investigation? Based on past events, yes, there would be quite an outcry."
Roe Conn, who is host of a morning talk show on WLS, said the radio station had been inundated by "a ton of calls and faxes off the air about this case," with many of them asking, "Why aren't you talking about this?"
Mr. Will was in a car driven by the friend, Cecil McCool, a roofer who is also white, when they were stopped by the two officers in Ford Heights on Oct. 18 at 1 A.M. A computer check found that Mr. McCool had an outstanding warrant for failing to pay child support, and the police arrested him. Mr. Will, who owned the car, did not have a valid driver's license and had been drinking, so the police towed the car and had it impounded.
Mr. McCool told The Southtown Economist, a daily newspaper that covers the South Side of Chicago and the south suburbs, that Mr. Will had begged the police for a ride, that he was so frightened of being left alone in this tough town that he was "shaking like a leaf."
Mr. McCool told the Chicago Sun-Times that after he was taken to the Fords Heights police station, one of the officers told him, "Your buddy got burned." He said the officers were smirking.
The Ford Heights police, who did not return telephone calls, have been quoted saying that they suspected the pair were in Ford Heights to buy drugs. In fact, Mr. Will, who lived in nearby Chicago Heights, did have a police record, according to his lawyer, but for petty theft, not drugs.
One of the arresting officers, Lieut. E. K. Haynie, told The Chicago Sun-Times that Mr. Will did not ask for a ride. He also said he doubted that the young men who attacked Mr. Will were acting out of racial motives.
"They were just doing something stupid," Officer Haynie told the newspaper.
Police initially arrested five people in connection with the killing, but only two have been charged: Wardell McClain, 17, and Michael Armstrong, 16. The other three suspects, two 13-year-olds and a 15-year-old, were released by the Cook County State's Attorney's office for lack of evidence.
Aldon Morris, a sociology professor at Northwestern University, who is black, said the Ford Heights case appeared to be another incident of "the police playing executioner."
As for the brutal slaying itself, Mr. Morris said, it might reflect the "growing level of hostility in poor black neighborhoods that the larger white society sees them as faceless."

HEADLINE: Doctors Seek Clue to Deaths in Nicaragua

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Doctors are struggling to identify a mysterious disease in the dirt-poor backlands of northwestern Nicaragua whose victims die suffocated by their own blood.
According to the World Health Organization, 18 people have died and more than 1,000 suspected cases have been reported in the epidemic, which first appeared in the farming village of Achuapa in rugged hills about 50 miles northwest of Managua, the capital. 
 Researchers in Nicaragua and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have determined, based on samples from the victims, that the illness is not hemorrhagic dengue fever, a disease accompanied by agonizing bone pain that is already endemic in Nicaragua. They have also ruled out yellow fever, another disease that, like dengue, is carried by mosquitoes.
Those stricken by the unidentified illness suffer from high fever, severe abdominal pain and body ache, all symptoms of dengue as well. But the patients also develop severe hemorrhaging, which fills their lungs with blood. Without treatment, they suffocate in three or four days, doctors in Nicaragua who are treating the disease said today.
Last week President Violeta Chamorro declared a medical emergency in the country, and the health ministers of the five Central American nations convened on Friday to discuss the epidemic.
Medical investigators do not know what causes the disease or how it is transmitted. But it does not appear to be passed through the air or by personal contact, a spokesman for the Pan American Health Organization, Daniel Epstein, said by telephone from Managua.
Researchers suspect there may be an animal carrier for the disease, which has been tentatively named Achuapa febrile syndrome, but have not ruled out a mutation of some familiar virus.
Achuapa is in a region of dry hardscrabble hills where water and food are scarce. But torrential rains spun off from an unusual series of Caribbean hurricanes in recent months washed rats and cockroaches from their holes and provided new breeding grounds for mosquitoes and countless other tropical insects.
The epidemic has spread to other towns near Achuapa but does not appear to have spread outside the region, Mr. Epstein said. Patients are being treated at the teaching hospital in Leon, the largest city in the area.
"If they come to us right away, we can save them," the hospital director, Dr. Donald Quintana Fajardo, said by telephone from Leon. "But Nicaraguans have a machismo complex where we pretend there is nothing wrong with us. They only come to the hospital at the last minute."
Dr. Quintana said 133 patients suspected of having the disease were under treatment in Leon. With intravenous liquids and blood and treatment to control the fever, doctors have succeeded in stopping the onset of bleeding in the lungs, he said. But blood components needed for treatment are in critically short supply.
A team of physicians from the World Health Organization, the Pan American Health Organization, the Nicaraguan Health Ministry and the Government of Cuba are scouting the Achuapa hills to detect patients and possible carriers.
In the early years of the rule of the Sandinista National Liberation Front in the 1980's, Government health programs were greatly expanded. But years of war with the contra rebels, who were backed by the United States, sapped the public health system. The Government of President Chamorro has not received the aid from the United States or other countries that she expected, and the economy has remained stalled, forcing her to limit public services.
"The living conditions in Achuapa are deplorable," Dr. Quintana said. "None of their basic needs are satisfied."
This year almost 11,000 cases of dengue were reported in Nicaragua, and cholera is also endemic.

HEADLINE: Restructuring of Medicare and Medicaid Will Affect the Low-Income Elderly Twice

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
Doris Brisson lives on the outskirts of poverty in Mesquite, Tex. She is 66 years old and gets Social Security payments of $512 a month, food stamps worth $20 a month and she barely makes the rent on a one-room apartment that she says gives cozy a bad name.
When it comes to her health care, Mrs. Brisson relies not only on Medicare, the medical program for people over 65, but also on Medicaid, which covers many of the nation's impoverished. 
 While Congress has grappled with vast overhauls of the nation's two giant health care programs independently, for Mrs. Brisson, and for as many as five million other elderly poor people, the programs are nearly indivisible. To maintain their precarious existences, they depend on both.
Together, the anticipated growth of the programs would be sliced by more than $440 billion in seven years under Republican legislation that passed last month and that President Clinton has threatened to veto.
Republicans maintain that by giving states more flexibility on spending their Medicaid dollars and by directing older people into cost-conscious managed care plans, the Government will save money while improving health care and reducing costs for people like Mrs. Brisson.
But numerous health care experts and advocates for the poor say that the financially pressed and often frail elderly, vulnerable to cuts in both programs, will become the legislation's most pathetic victims. Studies have shown that nearly a million older Americans living in poverty stand to lose some of their health coverage if these changes become law.
"For them it's a double whammy," said Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families U.S.A., an advocacy group. "They could lose Medicaid eligibility at a time when the Medicare expenses that Medicaid used to cover for them are going up. If they couldn't afford them before, how will they afford them now?"
In Mrs. Brisson's case, Medicare pays for her doctor visits, but her premium, co-payments to her doctor and her annual deductible are now covered under a special Medicaid program. The program, the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary program, or Q.M.B., has required since 1990 that states pay those Medicare costs for beneficiaries who are barely above the poverty line, which is about $7,400 for a single person and about $10,000 for a couple.
But neither program covers medicine. Mrs. Brisson is supposed to be taking medication for high blood pressure, arthritis and depression. She has the prescriptions in her purse, next to the wallet that has too little money to fill them.
"Right now, what I can't get free from the doctor, I do without," said Mrs. Brisson, who has had trouble getting full Medicaid benefits after a recent move from Colorado to Texas. "By the end of the month I'm begging dinner invitations from friends. If anybody asks me to spend one more dollar for my health care, well, I guess I'd just have to quit going to the doctor altogether."
The Republican Medicare plan raises beneficiaries' co-payments, deductibles and premiums and encourages them to join cost-saving managed care plans. By signing on for such a plan, the Republicans argue, older people with limited resources would no longer have to pay a portion of each doctor visit or a minimum amount before their benefits kicked in.
The Medicaid plan, meanwhile, ends mandatory benefits for the very poor and gives states fixed grants that they would decide how to divide among their neediest residents. Whether states would put as much money as the Federal Government now requires into covering gaps in the Medicare coverage for the elderly poor is very much an open question.
"Even if you had a combination of Mother Teresa and Albert Einstein administering these programs, the proposed cuts are so deep that needy people will lose eligibility," said Stan Dorn, managing attorney for the National Health Law Program, a public interest law center in Washington and Los Angeles that focuses on low-income health issues.
Being forced to cut back on the medical attention they get, Mr. Dorn said, will have deadly consequences for the elderly poor. "The death certificate may say 'cause of death: heart attack,' " he said, "but the real cause will be Medicaid and Medicare cuts."
Republicans said that given the spiraling costs of Medicaid and Medicare, they had no choice but to find a way to rein in expenses.
"We are opening up Medicare to the new medicine of the 90's," said Mike Collins, a spokesman for the House Commerce Committee. "States and managed care providers are going to give better care at lower costs to our needy seniors."
But a study by the Urban Institute, a Washington-based research group, found that even assuming that state governments achieve a higher level of cost efficiency in their managed care programs, nearly a million poor older Americans could lose their Medicaid eligibility in the next seven years.
Another report by Project HOPE, a Washington think tank that studies health issues, found that nearly 60 percent of people eligible for Medicaid's Q.M.B. program did not receive benefits because they did not know about the program or did not realize they qualified.
But as the economic situation for poorer older Americans declines, experts warn that more of them will be forced to seek protections, like those now offered under the Q.M.B. program. But while the Republican plan mandates that states set aside a certain portion of their Medicaid block grants to cover premiums for this group, it does not require that all the poor elderly be covered.
Each state would decide who it considers poor within the elderly population and how to distribute money among them. Currently, people with incomes up to 20 percent above the poverty level automatically qualify for Medicaid-subsidized premiums.
Under the Republican plan, states would have to cover only premiums, not deductibles or co-payments. And the amount they would be required to reserve for the premiums is far too little, critics say. It amounts to 90 percent of what they spent on this program from 1993 to 1995, when most of those who were eligible did not participate.
Health care experts also note that managed care plans are not available to more than nine million Medicare recipients because companies have not set up businesses where they live. But Mr. Collins of the House Commerce Committee said that the Republican leadership is "confident that markets will spring up" when the new plan becomes law.
The Republicans, he said, envision a scenario in which Medicare beneficiaries are courted by managed care plans eager for their business. As the competition increases, he said, the plans will recruit good doctors, offer a wide range of services and even give financial incentives to the elderly to join, knowing that if they do not, people will go elsewhere.
But while managed care companies are technically required by law to accept anyone who is eligible for Medicare, companies have a way of skewing their marketing to attract more stable and robust people whose care costs the least and increases profits most, said Lani Sanjek, associate executive director of the New York Statewide Senior Action Council. They hold recruiting seminars, for example, at times and places that are inconvenient or inaccessible to the disabled.
What is more, advocates said, the Republican plan does not provide either a framework or a budget for monitoring the quality of managed care programs.
"No standards have been established, let alone implemented," said Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Beneficiaries Defense Fund. "A lot of the elderly are too sick, too frail and too ill-equipped to make an informed choice under these circumstances. As this plan stands, the elderly poor are in danger of higher personal costs or significantly less health care."
Many of these people are already rationing their own health care, doing without medications, like Mrs. Brisson, so that they can afford meals, or are visiting doctors only in an emergency to avoid co-payments they cannot afford.
In Flushing, Queens, Irma Valentine, a former waitress, visits her doctor, because the cost is covered by Medicare. She takes her blood pressure and cholesterol prescriptions because they are covered by Medicaid, for which she is fully eligible because she is below the poverty level. But she does without arthritis pain killers and hemorrhoid medications because neither program covers those.
"I'm 80 years old and I'm barely making it," said Mrs. Valentine, who volunteers time at the Self-Help Senior Center in Latimer Gardens, the public housing project where she lives, in exchange for warm meals. "I'm miserable and I'm scared. If they ask me to give up any more, what would I take it away from? From nothing?"
What Orpha Andrukite hears about the plans debated in Washington has not reassured her that the coverage she now gets is safe. If she does fall off the Medicaid rolls, she says, she might as well "fall off the face of the earth."
She is 70, and after working more than 30 years as a practical nurse, she now lives on $484 a month in Social Security benefits and $17 in food stamps in an apartment in southeast Washington.
Until now, she has been covered by Medicare, with Medicaid picking up her out-of-pocket expenses, including most of the costs of the seven prescriptions she takes for a variety of illnesses, among them diabetes, osteorheumatoid arthritis and spasms. But if she is asked to spend any of her own money, she said, she will have to cut out the pills or the doctor visits.
She already owes money to her daughter and a friend from North Carolina who two years ago slaughtered a cow and brought 100 pounds of meat up to Ms. Andrukite on account. The meat is now gone, she said, but the debt remains.
"I'm already borrowed out, living on the edge," she said. "If they want to get another dollar from me, they may as well just come get me altogether."

HEADLINE: In Mayoral Election, Race Is Real Issue

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: GARY, Ind., Nov. 3

 BODY:
Tradition and numbers should make the Democratic candidate the odds-on favorite to win Tuesday's mayoral election in this city where Republicans and independents are vastly outnumbered and treated like embarrassing relatives. But unlike past years, the electoral outcome is far less certain.
The Democrat is white. 
 Gary's is only one of more than three dozen mayoral elections in larger cities around the country on Tuesday, including Baltimore, Cincinnati, Hartford, Houston, Philadelphia and San Francisco. But Gary's election is one of the most revealing about the American problem of race, a national heartache that never seems to heal.
The last time this overwhelmingly black city had a white mayor, Lyndon B. Johnson was President and the steel mills on the edge of town were spitting out paychecks in a blizzard of blue-collar prosperity.
But hard times rule the streets now. The mills employ only a fraction of the workers they once did. Drugs and despair crowd the sidewalks and the prospect of a white mayor has apparently so shaken some of Gary's black political establishment that they are willing to forsake their own party and to even make clumsy racial appeals to stop it.
Similar tactics helped turn Chicago, just 30 miles up the toll road from Gary, into "Beriut on the Lake" in the early 1980's when white Democrats abandoned their party in droves and voted Republican because they did not want to support a black Democratic mayoral candidate, Harold Washington, who went on to win two terms.
Last month, Gary's incumbent mayor, Thomas V. Barnes, who is not seeking re-election, wrote a fund-raising letter urging supporters to back a black independent candidate over his fellow Democrat, adding that the Democratic nominee, Scott King, a 44-year-old defense lawyer, "is Caucasian."
In his letter last month, Mr. Barnes asked for $100 to $1,000 contributions to the independent, who entered the race only after Mr. King bested several black opponents in the Democratic primary in May. Mr. King won with about 44 percent of the vote, but only about 30 percent of the Democrats turned out for the primary. In years past, winning the Democratic primary was tantamount to being elected mayor.
But the independent, Marion R. Williams, a high school principal and former city official and longtime Democrat, said he would not play the "race card" and would instead focus on the nuts and bolts of fiscal management and improved city services. His campaign posters and billboards urge people to vote for him "for all the right reasons."
"The media wants me to reach in my back pocket and pull out the race card and lay it on the table," Mr. Williams said. "I'm not going to do that. I'm going to play the credibility card."
The Republican candidate, Diane Ross Boswell, who is black, is not expected to win because recalling the name of the last Republican mayor of Gary is a parlor game for historians.
"Having a white mayor is not news," Mrs. Boswell said. "We've only had two black mayors in Gary. The possibility of having a black woman Republican is news."
Gender, she said, is the forgotten issue of the campaign.
"Being a Republican," the former prosecutor said, "is not as problematic for people as me being a woman."
Still, race never seems far from the calculus of the campaign. Mr. Williams says whites, who rarely bothered to vote in city elections before, have thrown their weight and money behind Mr. King in an effort to seize control of a city making signs of at least a slight economic recovery. Next year, river boat gambling is scheduled to come to town.
On the other hand, Jamelba Johnson, a black volunteer for the King campaign says that Mr. King's black supporters have been called "Uncle Toms" and "sellouts" in an effort to "shame us for voting for a white man."
But the election in Gary also illustrates another side of the racial divide, the bridge builders, the ordinary people who will ultimately decide this election.
Mr. King, with little political experience, could be the next mayor of this 85 percent black city because black voters are willing -- or frustrated enough with the sorry state of their city -- to cross racial lines and give him a chance. They did it in the primary.
"It's not about black or white," said Lugene Braylock, 32, an unemployed store clerk and lifelong resident of the city. "It's about the survival of Gary. It's about, can he do the job? I think King can. If he can't we'll get somebody else in there next time. We're tired of this mess."
In many cases, the "mess" had already started by the time black mayors seized power and pride in Gary and across the United States in the 1960's and 1970's only to see much of it slip away by the 80's as jobs vanished, whites fled, Federal programs were gutted and businesses abandoned urban America.
A victory here on Tuesday by Mr. King would represent yet another reversal of fortune for black mayors who have been replaced by whites in recent years in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, New York and Chicago.
Mr. Barnes, Gary's lame duck mayor, is determined not to allow what he calls "this shameful episode and trend" to continue.
In his letter last month, Mr. Barnes wrote that Mr. King had made few contributions to his adopted city and had won the primary because "of the lack of focus and unity that has existed in Gary as in too many predominately African-American communities across the country."
He added that Mr. King has the backing of the political machine throughout the state and that "as the attorney of choice for accused drug dealers, murderers, carjackers, rapists and racketeers," Mr. King "is considered by many to be part of the public safety problem facing our city."
Indeed, crime is so bad in Gary that when Mr. Barnes requested several weeks ago that 10 Indiana State Troopers be dispatched by the Governor to help patrol the city's streets, 50 were sent in for 30 days. Last week, the troopers extended their stay by at least another month.
Gary is once again on pace to claim the title of "murder capital" of the nation. Two years ago it had the highest number of murders per capita, and so far this year the city of 116,000 has about 100 homicides.
In an interview, Mayor Barnes said that issues of competence, not race, are his major consideration for shunning his party's nominee.
"I choose a highly qualified African-American in a state that has only one African-American mayor over an unqualified white candidate with no record of doing anything for the community," he said. "If the shoes were switched and you had an African-American with a similar record, he'd never make it."
A prosecutor before he became a defense lawyer, Mr. King said he did not think that Mr. Barnes and other black Democrats were motivated by race.
"It's about power," Mr. King said. "It's about patronage. It's about an old political structure trying to survive."
Still, Mr. King, who is married to a black woman and has three children, said that race haunts the campaign.
"There are some African-Americans who are voting for me because I'm white, thinking that a white man can get more out of the white establishment" he said. "There are other African-Americans who wouldn't put me out if I was on fire because I'm white. But the vast majority are making a judgment based on my platform. That's why I love Gary."

HEADLINE: Tokyo Fails To Resolve Bases Impasse

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 4

 BODY:
A last-ditch effort to break an impasse over American bases in Okinawa failed today, landing the dispute squarely in the lap of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama just two weeks before President Clinton arrives in Japan for a summit meeting.
Mr. Murayama met for almost five hours today with Masahide Ota, the Governor of Okinawa, who has refused to sign documents extending leases on land used for American bases. But Mr. Ota again refused to sign and presented the national Government with demands to curb the American military presence. 
 The first of the contested leases does not expire until March, but the Japanese and American Governments want to resolve the crisis before the summit meeting. The meeting had been intended to underscore the close military cooperation between Japan and America, but now it risks showcasing Japanese discontent with American bases.
The discontent is strongest on the sun-drenched southern Japanese island of Okinawa, where 75 percent of American bases are concentrated. Mr. Ota, an American-trained scholar who is an admirer of the United States in many respects, has led a growing movement in Okinawa against the bases, particularly since the arrest in September of three American servicemen on charges of raping a 12-year-old Okinawan girl.
"The Governor reiterated his refusal to sign the documents," Prime Minister Murayama told reporters after the meeting. "I can fully understand his position and his consideration of the people in his prefecture. So I will make a judgment on the matter myself."
Mr. Murayama is expected to override Mr. Ota and sign the documents himself, thereby assuring continuity of the American leases. But that is not certain, and it would be particularly unpleasant for Mr. Murayama, a socialist who spent most of his career opposing the American bases.
Mr. Ota said at a news conference that he was adamant in refusing to force the renewal of the leases, but he suggested that today's meeting was a step toward giving Okinawa's interests a fairer hearing.
"For the first time in history, the Prime Minister seriously listened to my explanations about the actual situation on the American bases in Okinawa," Mr. Ota said.
Mr. Ota presented the Government with 10 demands relating to the bases, few of which are acceptable now to either Tokyo or Washington. For example, Mr. Ota's first demand was that the United States return any bases that stand in the way of economic development.
Other demands included the application of noise limits to the bases; a halt to the use of civilian airports by military planes; application of regular automobile taxes to private cars owned by American soldiers, and the immediate transfer to Japanese custody of all Americans facing criminal proceedings.
Mr. Ota said that Mr. Murayama did seem receptive to one of the demands, that the American-Japanese committee on the bases pay greater attention to local opinions.
Defense Secretary William J. Perry said in Japan a few days ago that the United States was willing to work with Japanese officials in reducing the problems created by the presence of the bases. But he emphasized that the United States opposed any reduction in the present level of 47,000 troops in Japan.
In fact, the United States has only about 44,000 troops in Japan now, although it is authorized to have 47,000. That figure does not include 13,000 American military personnel who are assigned to ships effectively based in Japan.

HEADLINE: California Immigrants Make Fast Economic Gains, Study Finds

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Against the backdrop of California's immigration debate, a study released on Friday shows that many foreign-born residents in the southern part of the state are rapidly acclimating to life here. They are generally learning English and escaping poverty at a quick pace, according to the report.
In the study, which tracked members of various ethnic groups over time, some of the most dramatic results were seen among Hispanic immigrants who were between 5 and 14 years old when they arrived in Southern California in the 1970's. Although only one-third of them could speak English proficiently in 1980, nearly 70 percent could do so 10 years later in 1990. 
 The study also found that the poverty rate of male Asian immigrants between 25 and 34 years old in the 1970's declined significantly. Whereas 16.8 percent had incomes below the poverty level in 1980, only 5.6 percent of the same people had below-poverty incomes in 1990.
"The poor immigrants you see today won't be like that for long," said the author of the report, Dowell Myers, a demography professor at the University of Southern California. "Everybody is moving up at different speeds, but faster than many thought."
The nonpartisan study, paid for by a private foundation, comes at a time when many Californians are calling for stricter immigration laws and measures that would require the use of English in state business. Of Southern California's nearly 17 million residents, about 4.4 million are foreign born.
Mr. Myers culled census data from about 850,000 Southern California residents. He shows a common thread of increasing economic prosperity among immigrants over time, at rates that vary with age, sex and ethnicity.
For example, the average incomes of male European and Middle Eastern immigrants age 25 to 34 grew to $47,700 in 1990 from $23,200 in 1980. During the same period, the income of immigrant Asian men in the same age category doubled to $39,900 from $19,800. However, the earnings of Hispanic men rose only modestly in this 10-year span, to $18,900 from $14,900.
"There is evidence that Latino-Americans are capturing some of the American dream," said Abel Valenzuela, a professor of urban planning and Chicano studies at the University of California at Los Angeles. "But the debate is whether they are rising fast enough."
Nearly half of adult Hispanic immigrants have less than a ninth-grade education when they arrive, Mr. Myers said. The study found that many were not likely to be promoted at their jobs, and were less likely to learn English. In contrast, those who come to the United States at a young age go to school, generally learn English and have a lower poverty rate.
Only 21 percent of Hispanic men who moved to Southern California between the ages of 25 and 34 became proficient in English after 10 years. By comparison, 53 percent of Asian women and almost 80 percent of European and Middle Eastern men in the same age range learned English.
The rates of those obtaining citizenship after 10 years also varies: 67 percent for Asian men, 51 percent for European and Middle Eastern men and 21 percent of Hispanic men. Mr. Myers said that Mexicans and Canadians had a low rate of naturalization because of their proximity to their native countries.
Immigrants out-paced native-born residents in the percentage of those who were self-employed. Mr. Myers called this a "positive" indicator of the region's economic future.

HEADLINE: Javits Convention Center Books Giant Multimedia Expo for '96

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
The nation's largest association of companies in the interactive multimedia industry will hold a major trade show next September at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the first new major show at the center in three years, industry officials said yesterday.
The announcement reflects the growing importance of New York City as a national center in the multimedia field, which is a segment of the computer industry that takes animation, video and music and combines them into material for CD-ROM's, on-line applications and virtual reality, among other things. 
 The decision to hold a show at the Javits Center was also hailed by New York State officials as a sign that the overhaul of the center's labor force in July is beginning to attract new business and new tax dollars to the state.
Officials of the trade group, the International Multimedia Association, said their member companies felt that it was time both to consolidate dozens of smaller multimedia trade shows being held around the country and to give the industry a brighter spotlight on the East Coast, especially on Wall Street.
"It's an early playing field right now," said Patrick Ferrell, president and chief executive of Infotainment World, a subsidiary of the International Data Group, which will produce the show, called the IMA Expo, for the association.
The board of the Interactive Multimedia Association determined that the only convention hall on the East Coast large enough and well equipped enough to hold the show was the Javits Center, Mr. Ferrell said, but executives were reluctant to book space because of the center's reputation for cost overruns.
"We have been assured that our costs will be significantly less than other shows held at the Javits," Mr. Ferrell said.
He said the multimedia show, to be held Sept. 17-19, will include about 300 companies and use as much as 250,000 square feet of the center, about a third of the total floor space. It could end up taking as much as 400,000 square feet as more companies agree to participate, he said. Already, Macromedia, Intel, Horizons Technology, I.B.M., Apple and many other major players in the multimedia field have agreed to be represented, he said.
Robert E. Boyle, the center's new president and chief executive, said in a statement that he expects as many as 20,000 participants from 25 countries, pumping as much as $25 million in taxes and other benefits into the state's economy.
Gov. George E. Pataki is expected to announce the new show tomorrow at the Javits Center with industry executives.

Speedway Helps Aid A Town's Recovery

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO 

 BODY:
In the days following Aug. 24, 1992, it would have been hard to imagine why anyone in Homestead, Fla., would ever again want to see something heading toward them at 200 miles an hour. Hurricane Andrew had roared through that city -- and most of the rest of southern Dade County -- on that day with winds up to 198 m.p.h., carrying away with it 8,000 businesses, 55,000 jobs and 47,000 homes from the area south of Miami.
Shortly before 9 A.M. on Oct. 16, another whirlwind started building momentum on a 344-acre patch of Homestead's east side. This time, city officials were glad to see it. The source of the turbulence, a race car, was safely contained within the concrete walls of Homestead Motorsports Complex, the city-owned $61 million speedway that opens this weekend. 
 All 65,000 seats at the 1.5-mile track -- patterned after the rectangular Indianapolis Motor Speedway -- have been sold for the first big race today, even though the race is part of Nascar's triple-A series, and not a Winston Cup race, which the track eventually hopes to get. Next March, the Indy cars will race at Homestead, followed by major motorcycle and sports-car races.
Today's opening is the start of an 18-month stretch that will see American motor racing undergo an expansion it hasn't experienced in more than 25 years. The Homestead Motorsports Complex, about 30 miles south of Miami, is the first of four new superspeedways that will open between now and the spring of 1997.
Texas Motor Speedway is scheduled to open north of Fort Worth next June, followed by a track near Las Vegas, Nev., next September and Roger Penske's two-mile oval near Los Angeles in spring of 1997. Not since the last wave of speedway construction subsided in the early 1970's have so many tracks opened so soon.
But Homestead's main concern this weekend is its own prosperity, not auto racing's.
"We're still trying to recover from the economic disaster that the hurricane created," said Will Rudd, the Homestead city manager. The city lost about 35 percent of its population, as about 10,000 people moved farther north, and 90 percent of its homes were destroyed.
Although Rudd estimated that the track would create only about 300 full-time jobs at first, the less tangible effects may, in the long run, be more important. "I think it's going to give us name recognition," he said. "It's going to change the way people look at Homestead."
Before the hurricane, he said, the area's economy was equally divided among agriculture, tourism (it is close to Everglades National Park and is the last landfall before the Florida Keys) and Homestead Air Force Base, where Rudd was stationed as a colonel before retiring in 1993.
"The base provided a $430 million annual economic stimulus," Rudd said, "and 80 percent of that stopped on Aug. 25, 1992."
The base has not returned to its post-storm size and, because of Defense Department downsizing, never will, although it is being converted to commercial use, too.
Nonetheless, the base's presence helped ease the approval of the track project in one important area: noise complaints.
"Definitely the hurricane helped us," said Ralph Sanchez, the promoter of events at the track and the man most instrumental in getting it built.
"But the other thing that made us realize this was the spot is that the site is under the approach for Homestead Air Force Base," said Sanchez, who had to drop North Miami as a potential site in early 1992 when residents protested the potential noise and traffic. "When I saw that, I said one F-16 makes more noise than 10 race cars put together."
The track is a rarity among American speedways in that is municipally, rather than privately, owned. About half the money was provided by a Florida hotel tax of 1 percent set aside for construction of sports stadiums, a fund that has also been used to build the Lipton Tennis Stadium in Key Biscayne and to remodel the Orange Bowl.
Most of the rest of the track's financing will come in a bond issue (to be paid off by track revenues) that Homestead will underwrite with a $20 million loan guaranteed by H. Wayne Huizenga, the owner of the Miami Dolphins, Florida Panthers and Joe Robbie Stadium, and the majority shareholder of the Florida Marlins. In a separate deal, Huizenga has a half share of the promotional operation at Homestead, Sanchez the other half.
Sanchez, 47, came to the United States from Cuba in 1961 and spent most of his first five years here in an orphanage, until his parents arrived. He is the founder of Miami Motorsports, which, Rudd said, holds a 37-year contract to promote events at Homestead.
In 1983, Miami Motorsports ran its first race, in the streets of downtown Miami. At the time, the city was also looking for an image boost to counter reports of crime and urban decay. Torrents of rain washed out that first race, and Sanchez says he lost over $1 million. He was back the next year, and every year since.
Homestead's need for a major economic jump-start came just in time for Sanchez. Last March, with the port of Miami about to expand to accommodate a burgeoning cruise market, Sanchez ran his last race downtown. "The handwriting was on the wall long before that," Sanchez said. "The city basically put me on notice that it could evict me at any moment."
Now, Sanchez can unpack his bags in a home as plush as any in the sport. Among the track's amenities are a 32-camera video system and television production center and 20 corporate boxes. In the next few years, he plans to increase seating to 90,000 and add 30 more boxes, trackside condominiums and a shopping center.
Mauricio Gugelmin, a former Formula One driver who now drives Indy cars, did some test runs at Homestead last month and pronounced the facilities first-class. "They spent the money wisely," he said. "It's all pretty well thought out."
Sanchez said he would like to bring the international Formula One circuit to Homestead, to run on the 2.2-mile road-racing track built within the oval. But Gugelmin, who tried out the road course as well as the oval, said: "I think it's too narrow for a Formula One race."
Even if Formula One spurns Homestead, the track won't be empty. At present, Sanchez has booked five major race weekends, plus private test sessions and race-driving schools, making the motorsports complex considerably busier than the $20 million Homestead Baseball Complex, which stands nearby. The Cleveland Indians were supposed to make it their spring training home, but after Hurricane Andrew severely damaged it, the team went elsewhere.
To this day, the stadium has never had a regular tenant, and the city of Homestead, which is already stuck with a bill for the ball park's upkeep, is banking on racing fans to prove that if you build it, they will indeed come.
"We figured that the track would be a success if we sold about 88 to 89 percent of the seats at four events a year," Rudd said. "And now I think we will exceed that."
Rudd's main concern heading into this weekend was traffic: only eight lanes of roadway will connect the track with the nearest highway, about two miles away. "I'm worried about getting everyone out of the place," Rudd said.
Unlike the last exodus from Homestead, though, Rudd would probably like to see a lot more like this one.

HEADLINE: Chasing a Deal on Water With a Few Pitchers of Beer

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Last spring, when Gov. George E. Pataki asked his counsel and close friend, Michael C. Finnegan, to try to mediate a conflict between New York City and the communities around the city's upstate reservoirs, Mr. Finnegan took a drive up to Delaware County to take the temperature of the dispute.
As he spoke with farmers and townsfolk, he felt the heat of their anger at the metropolis to the south that for a century had flooded fields, dug up cemeteries and condemned villages to make way for its expanding water-supply system. 
 "It was kind of like talking to my Irish cousins who lost their lands to the English so many years ago," Mr. Finnegan recalled. "I was shocked to learn that in civics classes in school they were still teaching about the city's condemnation of land. This was not ancient history."
The townsfolk, whose backyards and pastures gather the rain and snow that produce the drinking water for 9 million people in New York and nearby suburbs, were newly inflamed because the city, to avoid having to spend perhaps $8 billion to filter the water drawn from the region, was planning to acquire even more land and enact strict new rules to prevent pollution in the watersheds.
Dozens of economically depressed rural towns, fearing that the city would stifle any chance for development and growth, banded together to fight the plan. The result was a stalemate.
Last week, after orchestrating seven months of confidential talks in venues as varied as an upstate beer garden and the Governor's offices on the 57th floor of the World Trade Center, Mr. Finnegan prevailed. Ending a century of hostility, New York City entered a 10-year, $1.2-billion partnership with 230,000 neighbors to the north to protect the water supply.
Experts in diplomacy and negotiation say the talks are a classic example of an increasingly popular approach to resolving long-festering disputes. Rather than using traditional hard-ball methods, in which each party stakes out an extreme position and battles to some mutually tolerable compromise, Mr. Finnegan created a politics-free climate in which a consensus could be quietly built.
The agreement was all the more significant because the two sides had been separated for decades by everything but bloodshed. More than once, a watershed farmer had threatened to sic his dogs on employees of New York City's Department of Environmental Protection, or D.E.P.
"The D.E.P. up here, with its little white trucks, is viewed like an occupying army," said Allen J. Zerkin, a lawyer from Woodstock who teaches mediation techniques at New York University and in 1992 participated in a failed attempt to end New York's water wars.
But the time was right for an agreement, Mr. Zerkin said, because a Federal deadline was fast approaching that would force the city to pay for filtration if no pollution-control plan was in place.
An important factor was Governor Pataki's background, he said. Besides formerly representing a large swath of the watersheds east of the Hudson in the State Senate, Mr. Pataki also had established a reputation as a conservationist, he said.
In a key move, negotiators were sworn to secrecy to keep both sides focused on goals instead of on how the talks would play in the press, Mr. Finnegan said. "The current disputes in Washington are being negotiated with all the finesse of a 30-second spot," he said. "That's exactly what I feared could happen here."
He added, "I think that's the most important part of this whole story. Not that we resolved the watershed issue, but that we were able to appeal to the best part of everybody who's involved in public service."
In the initial rounds of meetings in May, some representatives from New York City and watershed communities lit into each other, recounting the old war stories of land theft on the city's part or flagrant violations of water-protection rules upstate.
According to a variety of participants, three people -- Mr. Finnegan, Marilyn Gelber, New York City's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, and Daniel A. Ruzow, a lawyer representing a coalition of communities in the watersheds west of the Hudson River -- centered the talks on areas of agreement instead of areas of conflict.
Sometimes in a group of 50 and sometimes breaking into teams of 2 or 3 specialists, the delegations from upstate and downstate, along with Federal and state environmental and health experts, attacked "top 10 lists" of unresolved issues.
Ms. Gelber helped move discussions forward by frequently traveling -- usually alone -- to the watersheds to meet the people there. "I didn't understand until later that this was a stunning change for them," she said. "In the past, D.E.P. always came up with lots of lawyers and advisers, a whole entourage."
When the negotiations bogged down last summer, Ms. Gelber said, she drove out to Trout Creek, in one of the furthest corners of the Delaware River basin, to talk things over with Perry Shelton, the chairman of the Coalition of Watershed Towns.
"Perry's wife had made blueberry muffins that morning," Ms. Gelber said. "Person to person, over the kitchen table, we sat and shared ideas."
Following what Mr. Zerkin, at New York University, said is a classic negotiating rhythm, the participants made slow but steady progress -- "sausage-making," as one participant put it -- and then hit a wall.
"When you get toward the end, the most contentious issues, which have been simmering on a back burner all this time, now come back," he said. "You now have to confront the reality of signing on the dotted line, giving up what you didn't get. You start realizing that you have to sell this back home."
The negotiators were stuck on the size of New York City's payment to watershed towns to offset the economic burdens of pollution controls and the city's refusal to drop an appeal of an old court ruling that favored the upstaters.
In the end, simple civility helped iron things out. During a lunch break in the beer garden at Schneller's, a popular restaurant in Kingston, the New York City delegation bought a pitcher of beer for the upstaters at the next table.
Mr. Finnegan said he noticed at a subsequent lunch meeting at Schneller's that the factions were no longer at separate tables, but had intermingled. "It was at that point I realized we were starting to have some fundamental breakthroughs," he said.
But nothing was resolved easily. The talks almost fell apart four weeks ago, Mr. Ruzow said, when his clients, fearing that New York City was still planning to balk on the payment issue, told him to walk away from the table. Ms. Gelber, eager to prove that the city would meet its financial commitments, brought First Deputy Mayor Peter Powers into the talks. Mr. Powers and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have acknowledged that the small rise in water bills resulting from this deal, an average $7 a month per homeowner, is a bargain in comparison with the cost of building and running a filtration plant that had threatened to triple water rates.
In a final flurry of meetings that forced many participants to miss taking their children trick-or-treating on Halloween, the last details were hashed out. Each side made sacrifices. The city has agreed to spend $350 million to help upstate communities reduce pollution and to spur economic growth, while the watershed towns have dropped their longstanding lawsuits against the city and abide by the rules.
After crowding behind Governor Pataki and Mayor Giuliani at a 90-minute news conference high in the World Trade Center last Thursday, many of the negotiators prepared to head north to similar events in two watershed towns.
But they were delayed as rain fell all across the region. And in the valleys to the east and west of the Hudson River, the reservoirs, nearly half empty from a summer of drought, began to rise.

VIRTUAL EQUALITY
The Mainstreaming of Gay and Lesbian Liberation.
By Urvashi Vaid.
440 pp. New York:
Anchor Books/Doubleday. $24.95 
 Before Patrick J. Buchanan's anti-gay philippic at the 1992 Republican National Convention and the religious right's 1993 sabotaging of President Clinton's pledge to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military - which propelled countless infuriated gay Americans out of the closet, many into activism - the gay rights movement was essentially a creature of the political left. Between 1986 and 1992, Urvashi Vaid's successive roles as public information director and executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force put her, a young Vassar graduate and civil rights lawyer, at the center of the action. Noted for her belief that the movement should not only focus on equal rights for gay people but also seek "liberation" for women, people of color and the working class, Ms. Vaid responded to the influx of alarm, denouncing the "mainstreaming" of homosexuality as inimical to revolutionary change and calling for "a full-scale frontal assault" against "the coming of a racist, sexist gay and lesbian right." (There is, incidentally, no such right in sight.)
 "Virtual Equality: The Mainstreaming of Gay and Lesbian Liberation" is the work of a woman in an unusual position. While remaining an ideological extremist (who, for example, still defends the stipulation that half of each state's steering committe members at the 1993 march on Washington had to be people of color), Ms. Vaid manifestly wishes to win over a general audience and re-establish her authority in a movement whose center has moved rapidly toward the nation's political center - and away from her. To this end, she has moderated her formerly strident tone, cut down on the barn-burning rhetoric about the evils of religion, capitalism and the patriarchy, and embraced goals (like the acceptance of gay people by traditional religious institutions and the military) to which she was once at best indifferent. Instead of demanding "full-scale frontal assault" on dissident homosexuals, she speaks of working together.
 At times, indeed, Ms. Vaid sounds strikingly like the Johnny-come-lately liberal, moderate and libertarian activists and writers (this reviewer included) whom she labels "gay conservatives." In stating that gay men and lesbians must "be willing to expose the wildness of our subculture and be prepared to debate it honestly and question it thoroughly," that the gay ghetto can simply be "a more spacious closet" and that the movement should seek to educate straight people instead of ignoring or demonizing them, Ms. Vaid echoes core "gay conservative" concepts.
 Yet "Virtual Equlity" is, essentially, vintage Urvashi Vaid, proffering a vision of a "common, progressive movement" for social, economic and political revolution led by gay people, who, in her view (though not, it seems to me, in the view of most gay people themselves), embody a radical differentness that makes them the natural vanguard for revolution. And we need such revolution, she maintains, in order to transcend what she calls "virtual equlity,' the situation - "at once marginal and mainstream, at once assimilated and irreconcilably queer," and at once accepted and vilified - in which gay Americans now find themselves.
 "Gay conservatives" consider the present state of affairs a transitional stage on the way to full social acceptance, which will be achieved only if the gay movement grows beyond extremism and confrontation and if gay people continue to come out of the closet and to give their straight friends and relatives courses, as it were, in Gay 101 (helping them to understand, among much else, that being gay does not necessarily mean being a revolutionary). According to Ms. Vaid, however, virtual equality has resulted from an excessive focus on "mainstreaming," and can only be overcome through "radical social change." Virtual equality, she says, will give way to real equality only if gay people "develop amovement courageous enough to articulate gay liberation's approaches" to issues like "the deficit, crime, public schools, housing, the role of government, national defense, welfare reform and the shrinkage of the work force." In other words, there are correct gay positions on every issue from Nafta to health cae, and gay people need only to listen obediently when their leaders explain what those positions are.
 Ms. Vaid, then, who at the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force could not even work out a coherent challenge to propaganda from the religious right (and who, in one of many errors in her book, confuses the Bill of Rights with the later amendments to the Constitution, which she dates at 1776), proposes to formulate both the goals and the strategy of a movement for comprehensive and well-nigh utopian "cultural transformantion." She never gets very specific, however, about the nature of that transformation and the means by which she hopes to achive it; she appears to think that in churning out vacuous sentences full of words like "organization," "mobilization" and "empowerment" she is actually saying something. Yet she is clear about who stands in her way: in straight America, her enemy is the white heterosexual overclass oppressor) she ignores the fact that it is in overclass communities that gay people are safest and most accepted); in gay America, her enemy is middle-class white males who, by insisting on "single-issue politics" - that is, on a gay rights stand that for oppressed gay women, blacks and workers, sex, race nd class are also gay issues. Issues, yes - but gay issues?
 To be sure, Ms. Vaid is aware enough of the recent sea change in gy politics to recognize that most readers will not cotton to her radical approach. Hence she proposes compromise - a coordinated two-tiered movement that would enable single-issue types to focus on gay rights while others pursue a "common movement" agenda. All this activity, she suggests, might be subsumed under an "umbrella orgnization" like Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. This is, of course, basically what the gay movement had in the Age of Vaid: many grass-roots people who did important and effective work toward understanding and acceptance, and a few national leaders who sent out a message of opposition to capitalism, religion and bourgeois values. Ms. Vid is right to assert that "the gay movement needs a fundamental shift." But while more and more gay people realize that the required shift is one toware integration, education and conciliation, Ms. Vaid longs to return to the day of class struggle and liberation fronts. That her rhetoric has come to seem so old so fast is a measure of how gay political discourse outside the academy, anyway - has been profoundly altered in a relatively brief time.

COMPANY MAN
The Rise and Fall of Corporate Life.
By Anthony Sampson.
354 pp. New York:
Times Books/Random House. $27.50. 
 IN economic writing, the distinction of "unquestionably the worst" is a hard competition to win. But the elementary training in awfulness of businesspeople who themselves write about their enterprise has given business prose the edge. Some years back, a leading business school asked me to participate in an effort to see if anything could be done. For a semester I joined some young colleagues in trying to find ways to encourage and guide improvement. The effort was a ghastly failure. The last papers still spoke of "charisma tizing" the product; one budding executive, talking about worker participation, commented on the need for producing "an osmotic upward flow of intelligence." There was more, some of it worse. It is my recollection that the whole attempt was later shelved. In any case, I keep encountering the same kind of meaninglessness on my occasional excursions into business writing.
Most business prose suffers from another, substantive flaw: seeing some particular form of organizational structure as it comes along (strong leadership, team management, carefully cultivated worker loyalty and participation, vigorous downsizing) as the final stage of development. What seems good, or anyhow inevitable, today can in fact be hopelessly archaic tomorrow. Nothing is quite so unstable in structure and form as the modern business enterprise. It survives only with constant adaptation and change.
These are the controlling conditions for Anthony Sampson's new social history of the corporation and the company man. Mr. Sampson is, first of all, an accomplished writer; everything is in clear, unpretentious, jargon-free English. As his past readers know, he shows a wide-ranging knowledge of economic and political life in Britain, the United States and other major industrial countries. And he is committed to change; this principle he accepts.
In "Company Man," Mr. Sampson looks first, in a moderately approving way, at the Boeing and Microsoft corporations, both in the Pacific Northwest, both characterized by worker participation. He then proceeds backward to the East India Company in London and India, and traces the historical development of business management to the present. This takes him to the great capitalist enterprises in the United States in the latter part of the last century -- those of Rockefeller, Morgan, Harriman -- and their European counterparts. He goes on to the heavily bureaucratic enterprises in their varied national forms; to the separate Japanese model, with worker job security and company loyalty; to the corporate raiders; the multinationals and the fears they aroused; and the managerial cutbacks of recent times, with a detailed and compelling account of specifically what this "downsizing" meant in New York State for those who had considered themselves permanent, even beloved, members of the I.B.M. family.
Mr. Sampson deals also with the breakup of the large British combines, the arrival of women in the executive suites and much, much else. He doesn't spare me and my Harvard colleague, Alfred Chandler, for ascribing permanence to corporate structures that were excessive as to the levels of command, vulnerable as to competition and soon in decline. Currently he is impressed with the way the modern executive, free in substantial measure from stockholder control, responsible to a board of directors of his own selection, determines his own compensation in accordance with the established principles of profit maximization.
Few if any authors on this subject matter have so thoroughly covered both the experience and the literature. The last extends not only to the professional but to the literary comment: few if any novels dealing with business or businessmen, from "Dombey and Son" to today, have escaped his attention. He also rediscovers astute earlier comment on business development that many of us either missed or have forgotten. It is good to be reminded that as early as 1904 Thorstein Veblen said: "The heroic role of the captain of industry is that of a deliverer from an excess of business management. It is a casting out of businessmen by the chief of businessmen."
There is one problem. So strong is Mr. Sampson's flow of information and comment that one sometimes gets lost in the current. His stages in business development run together; one struggles a bit to distinguish one change from the next. But this is a detail. "Company Man" is the most luminous history of the business enterprise that we will have this year and, except as imitated, perhaps for a long time to come.

HEADLINE: School Districts Make Contract Gains

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
CONFRONTED with balky taxpayer groups and citizens reluctant to accept teacher salary increases greater than their own, many school districts have come to Spartan terms in agreements with teachers, support staff and other union members.
With the Yonkers Federation of Teachers, which has been working without a contract since June 1994 but voted not to strike last Wednesday night, the status of labor negotiations with teachers in other districts is compelling. 
 Although the current academic year is barely through the first semester, the agreements are having an effect on school budgets, which will be presented next spring.
A reality check, prompted in part by an economic climate in which corporate layoffs, downsizings and wage freezes are the norm rather than the exception, reflects salary increases of 2 to 3 percent. In some cases, there are even givebacks on health care coverage or increased contributions to welfare funds in the newly negotiated settlements.
"In terms of salary increases, these have been far lower than what has been traditional," said Dr. Ronald Valenti, Superintendent of the Harrison School District and president of the Lower Hudson Council of School Superintendents. "You're seeing 2 to 3 percent rather than 5 to 6 percent. In the collective bargaining that has been occurring, obviously it is a reflection of the economy being in such deplorable condition. And, unmistakably, there is a trend toward employees sharing health-care costs. More teacher associations are picking up some of the share."
Successful negotiations, in which both sides leave the bargaining table satisfied with the results, are critical in maintaining positive morale. "Unless you open the school year with a contract, there will be some diminution of employee morale," Dr. Valenti said. Recent negotiations in districts like Harrison, Dobbs Ferry and Chappaqua reveal these changes. "The new contract was at a lesser amount than previous contracts," said Henne Starace, business administrator in the Chappaqua Central School District. The new contract calls for increases of 2.8 percent, 2.9 percent and 3 percent, respectively, in the next three years.
For Dobbs Ferry, whose teachers had been working without a contract since June 30 last year, "We had had lots of discussion about how our salary schedule lines up with other districts," said Mary Cronin, assistant superintendent of the district. The increases, which were recommended by a fact finder for the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, called for 2 percent for the years 1994-95 and 1995-96, and 3 percent for each of the following two years of the contract, which will expire at the end of the academic year in 1998.
"As some board members would say, it is a compromise and a good contract," Mrs. Cronin said. "We think we have a good contract. Teachers understand that the district has been struggling with having higher tax rates. We want to be able to keep the program going without exorbitant increases."
Even districts like Rye, Rye Neck and Eastchester, which are still actively negotiating settlements with their staffs, expect to follow similar trends.
"The general climate is setting a direction for negotiation," said Peter J. Mustich, Superintendent of the Rye Neck School District. "I think that teachers are sensitive to the economic conditions and constraints as they exist. Our goal is to be fair and reasonable with our staff."

HEADLINE: New York Ballot Proposal Makes Debt Loopholes Even Bigger

 BODY:
To the Editor:
New Yorkers will go to the polls Nov. 7 and be asked to vote on constitutional changes to the way the state borrows money. Contrary to "Yes for New York Debt Reform" (editorial, Nov. 1), Ballot Proposal No. 3 offers no improvements to state debt practices. Indeed, it makes matters worse. 
 State debt practices reached scandalous levels during Nelson A. Rockefeller's gubernatorial reign. As required by the state's Constitution, long-term debt must be approved by the voters. However, as Rockefeller moved to expand the size of state government, he not only pushed taxes to destructive levels but sought to saddle taxpayers with added debt as well.
Rockefeller circumvented the voters by establishing state authorities to float debt and implementing state borrowing schemes through local governments. Similar shenanigans have been perpetrated ever since.
Of course, New York taxpayers pay the debt service on all government-related debt -- even public-authority debt -- whether through state taxes, local taxes, tolls or fees. Therefore, true debt reform should require that all long-term debt receive voter approval -- whether floated by the state, public authorities or local governments. True state debt reform should close loopholes.
When all state-related debt is accounted for (as done by the Department of Commerce), the state's total debt outstanding tops $50 billion. The Nov. 7 ballot initiative places no limits on outstanding debt.
Allowing additional borrowing -- free from the prying eyes of voters -- to aid "distressed" municipalities will only increase the number of distressed municipalities. State elected officials will have new means for boosting state debt and bringing home the bacon to their districts.
The natural disaster loophole offers similar temptations. Imagine what Long Island state representatives might offer those with beach homes tumbling into the ocean.
The proposal for debt reform allows for the incurrence of more debt without voter approval and, therefore, potentially higher taxes down the road.

NEW YORK CITY
 
HOMELESS PROGRAM IS REVAMPED
Battered by accusations of strong-arm tactics, the Grand Central Partnership has revamped its field program for the homeless and reduced its size after a major loss of financial support. The program's workers, ostensibly hired to guide the homeless to shelter and services, served instead as quasi-security guards at up to 80 locations, mostly cash machine lobbies in Manhattan. Scores of the field workers were themselves untrained homeless people paid $10 a day. Now the program has just 18 sites, and the field workers have been replaced by a core of a dozen full-time staff members. [B3.]
 
CITY HALL'S INFLUENCE OVER THE SCHOOLS
In the Blue Room of City Hall on Saturday, the Mayor of New York demonstrated how much control he really does exercise over the school system, despite his complaints to the contrary. He did so by producing a new five-year contract with the United Federation of Teachers, a generous pact that gives union members an 11 percent increase over five years and demands no major work-rule or productivity concessions in return. The agreement was worked out by the Mayor's labor commissioner, analyzed by the Mayor's budget director and concluded with virtually no contribution from the Board of Education's labor negotiators. No wonder the Mayor found it "historic." Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. [B3.]
 
BRONX GIRL IS SLAIN IN BASEMENT
A Bronx girl's trip to a dingy basement to fetch a load of freshly washed laundry for her mother cost her her life, the police said. Detectives said that the girl died of a single gunshot wound to the head. Police Inspector William Gardella said that detectives had no suspects and no motive in the killing. [B3.]

VOTERS TO GET DEBT QUESTION
Few things are more complicated than government borrowing practices, but on Tuesday voters will be asked to decide, on the basis of reading a 128-word question, whether to support a constitutional amendment that would significantly change how New York State pays its debts.
 
MOLINARI GIVEN POLICE PROTECTION
Two days before the election in which Staten Island Borough President, Guy V. Molinari, is trying to unseat District Attorney William L. Murphy, a spokesman for Mr. Molinari's campaign complained that a car thief who had threatened the Borough President's life had been sentenced to only weekends in jail. Ed Burke, a spokesman for Mr. Molinari, said that the Borough President had been given 24-hour protection from the New York Police Department after learning that there was "a hit" on his life.
 
YONKERS RACE REKINDLES AN OLD FEUD
When Terence M. Zaleski was elected Mayor in 1991, he took on broad governing powers that his predecessors had not possessed since World War II. But for all the authority a revision in the Yonkers charter gave him, critics in both major political parties say city government has often seemed mired in partisan conflict during his four years in office. The debate over where the fault lies has shaped the mayoral race in Yonkers. [B4.]
 
STRIFE-TORN PEQUOTS RE-ELECT CHAIRMAN
In two decades as tribal chairman, Richard Hayward has seen the Mashantucket Pequots rise from the edge of extinction to economic and political power as owners of the nation's most profitable casino, the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Conn. But with their new-found wealth has come new internal struggles and strife, as tribal elections have demonstrated. The tribe, which has more than 300 members, voted to re-elect Mr. Hayward, known to many as Skip. But he did not face much opposition: a leading challenger, Michael Goodwin, the tribe's assistant director of cultural resources, was disqualified from the race two days before the election. [B2.]
 
WALLACHS'S PARENT FILES BANKRUPTCY
Wallachs clothing stores, a New York institution for more than 100 years, is conducting a going-out-of-business sale at its 12 stores in New York, New Jersey and New Hampshire. Also joining in the sale are Roots, J. R. Tripler and other retail stores that, together with Wallachs, make up the 19-state chain of 50 stores owned and operated by the Hastings Group. [D10.]

HEADLINE: ASSASSINATION IN ISRAEL: PERES;
For New Leader Shouldering the Job, Huge Task and an Uneasy Mandate

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 5

 BODY:
After Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's historic handshake with Yasir Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization in September 1993, some Israelis suggested that next Mr. Rabin might actually shake hands with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
The point of the joke was the celebrated rivalry of the two men who took turns leading the Labor Party through the 1970's and 1980's and who finally joined forces to achieve the historic breakthrough in Israeli-Palestinian relations. 
 Now Mr. Peres, who took over somberly last night as the Acting Prime Minister, has the task of shouldering the peace forward while working to heal a nation in shock over Mr. Rabin's assassination and the divisions and passions it underscored.
It is too early to tell whether he will lead his party to the elections currently scheduled for next November -- but there is a consensus among politicians that at this point, at least, there is nobody in the Labor Party of his stature.
Yet he must meet the onslaught from the conservative Likud Party and quell nagging doubts about the wisdom of handing more lands and power to the Palestinians, without the broad public faith that Mr. Rabin enjoyed as a military man who personified the nation's ambivalence about the concessions it was making.
Though they belonged to the same political generation and followed roughly parallel political paths, Mr. Peres and Mr. Rabin were totally different in style and appeal. Mr. Rabin was the model of the sabra -- the tough, native-born Israeli; Mr. Peres is an immigrant from Eastern Europe. Mr. Rabin was a warrior and war hero; Mr. Peres, though the architect of the modern Israeli military industry, comes across to many as a dovish elitist.
Where the chain-smoking Mr. Rabin was gruff, candid and quick to anger, Mr. Peres is the smooth, eloquent cosmopolitan. If Mr. Rabin felt at home in America, Mr. Peres favors the intellectual salons of Paris. Mr. Rabin did not conceal his distaste at meeting with Mr. Arafat, while Mr. Peres spent long hours negotiating with him.
In the end, it was these complementary qualities that enabled the two men to reach the historic peace with the Palestinians, a fact recognized by the Nobel committee when it awarded the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize collectively to Mr. Rabin, Mr. Peres and Mr. Arafat.
It was Mr. Peres the visionary who initiated the secret contacts with the P.L.O. in Oslo and followed them through to agreement, and it was Mr. Rabin, the trusted leader, who gave the deal a political credibility. Despite decades of often-bitter rivalry, each acknowledged the critical contribution of the other.
In the end, Mr. Peres stood in the Cabinet's meeting room with tears in his eyes before the empty seat of his long-time rival, a seat he now had to fill, and paid him tribute: "He was a rare leader in Jewish history."
Referring to the three years he had served in Mr. Rabin's Cabinet, he continued: "These three years were for me also a revelation of friendship, the likes of which I had never seen -- just as there had been between us a rivalry on a level I had never known before."
Mr. Peres likes to present his own political vision in terms of a river. "Rivers are in constant flux, their steady flow forever creating a new reality," he wrote in his 1993 book, "The New Middle East" (Henry Holt, New York).
"A man might drown in their waters, but he cannot turn them back," he wrote. "The same holds true for history. We cannot build a future on the ruins of an old order."
From that basic premise, he developed his vision that Israel's future lay in reaching peace with the Palestinians and in building a strong economy. "Quality cannot be obtained through military conquest," he wrote in an article in 1989. "It is a matter for creative achievement," And he continued, "The major conflicts in the future will be waged more in R. & D. laboratories than on the battlefield."
That sort of thinking, however, often put Mr. Peres ahead of his countrymen, and he was perceived by the public as ready to strike deals behind his country's back. Where Mr. Rabin, the awkward old soldier, could inspire love, the elegant Mr. Peres never inspired more than respect.
Born Shimon Persky in 1923 in Vishneva, then a center of Jewish life in Poland (now in Belarus), Mr. Peres arrived in Palestine with his family in 1934. He studied in Tel Aviv, then in an agricultural school.
By age 20, Mr. Peres was secretary of the Labor Youth Movement, and soon after he went to work with David Ben-Gurion and Levi Eshkol, two of the founding fathers of the Jewish state.
In the first years after the establishment of the Israeli state, Mr. Peres led a military delegation to the United States, where he did advanced studies at New York University and Harvard. He returned to Israel in 1952 and, at age 29, was appointed by Prime Minister Ben-Gurion as Director General of the Defense Ministry. In that capacity, he built up the armaments industry, introducing electronics and aircraft industries and bringing Israel a nuclear reactor.
In subsequent years, Mr. Peres, who is married with two sons and a daughter, was elected to the Parliament and helped to unify the Labor movement into the Israel Labor Party. He held a progression of Government offices, including Deputy Defense Minister, Minister of Immigrant Absorption, Minister of Transport and Communications, Minister of Information, and, in 1974, Minister of Defense.
When Mr. Rabin resigned as Prime Minister in 1977 over a minor scandal, Mr. Peres replaced him as Acting Prime Minister and as chairman of the Labor Party.
After the 1984 elections, Mr. Peres served as Prime Minister for two years in a Government of national unity with the conservative Likud. He began Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon and was credited with taming runaway inflation. After the leadership passed through rotation to Likud's Yitzhak Shamir, Mr. Peres became Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and after the 1988 elections he served as Minister of Finance.
When Mr. Rabin was elected Prime Minister in 1992, he offered the position of Foreign Minister to Mr. Peres, and before long he initiated the secret contacts with the P.L.O. that led to the historic peace agreement. In recent months, Mr. Peres plunged into the second-stage negotiations on transferring control over major Palestinian-population areas of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
He personally met for many hours with Mr. Arafat and spent a tense final week with the P.L.O. leader in September ironing out the last obstacles. The agreement was signed in Washington on Sept. 28, launching a process of disengagement that Mr. Peres will now be charged with sustaining.

HEADLINE: In 128 Words, a Question on State Borrowing

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Few things are more complicated than government borrowing practices, but on Tuesday voters will be asked to decide, on the basis of reading a 128-word question, whether to support a constitutional amendment that would significantly change how New York State pays its debts.
To supporters of the amendment, the issue is simple enough. They say New York has had an egregious history of gimmicky borrowing that has resulted in the lowest bond rating of any state. The proposed amendment, which would restrict borrowing by quasi-governmental agencies and cap debt not approved by voters, will enforce fiscal discipline, they say. 
 Critics of the amendment agree that the state's borrowing practices have been unsound. But their analysis of the amendment couldn't be more different: They contend it will allow excessive borrowing without voter approval, which they believe is prohibited by the Constitution.
The issue has created some odd political alliances. Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, and State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, have joined in endorsing the amendment. Last week, the two men, who have frequently clashed and are seen as potential gubernatorial rivals in 1998, appeared together to call for the amendment's passage.
On the other side, the state Conservative Party, upstate Democrats, supporters of Ross Perot and anti-tax groups have united strongly against the amendment. The Conservatives have been running radio ads in communities outside New York City that warn that the amendment "means more welfare for New York City and higher taxes for us."
Because the opposition has been outspoken and well-organized, even supporters of the measure say it is in danger of failing. Moreover, the opposition is strongest upstate and in New York City's suburbs, where turnout is expected to be highest. The city itself, where support for the amendment is thought to be strongest, has few important races and turnout is likely to be very low.
"There's no question it's an uphill battle," said Mr. McCall, who has been by far the strongest voice among public officials in advocating the amendment.
Mr. McCall and other supporters of the measure, which was approved twice by the Legislature, say it does not go as far as they would like. But they insist that it will end the worst of the state's bad borrowing habits, improve its low credit rating and reduce its interest costs.
Under the State Constitution, the voters are supposed to authorize long-term borrowing by the state. In recent years, voters have been unwilling to approve bond acts. So the state has increasingly circumnavigated the ballot box by having public authorities -- quasi-governmental agencies -- borrow money to help pay state capital and operating expenses. As a result of that practice -- which has been upheld by the state's highest court -- only $5 billion of the state's $28 billion in long-term debt has been approved by voters.
The proposed amendment would ban such back-door borrowing. But its critics say it is chock full of loopholes that will invite abuse, such as a provision that would allow borrowing for jobs programs during severe economic downturns.
Because of that and other provisions, "the state would never have to come back to voters for approval if it wanted to borrow money,' said Robert L. Schulz, the leader of an anti-tax group, All-County Taxpayers Association. "This does not offer restrictions. It opens the back door wider, it opens the front door, it takes the roof off."

HEADLINE: Wallachs's Parent Files For Chapter 11 Protection

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Wallachs clothing stores, a New York institution for more than 100 years, is conducting a "going out of business" sale at its 12 stores in New York, New Jersey and New Hampshire. Also joining in the sale are Roots, F. R. Tripler and other retail stores that, with Wallachs, make up the 19-state chain of 50 stores owned and operated by the Hastings Group.
As recently as three years ago, before demand plummeted for the tailored suits and other clothing in which it specialized, the group owned almost 200 stores. 
 According to the Chapter 11 filing by Hastings, the company intends to liquidate the business or sell its "small core" of profitable locations. The papers were filed Oct. 23 in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., where the Hastings Group is incorporated.
Either way, it could spell the end for most of the group's stores -- including the venerable Wallachs chain, which in the mid-1970's offered classes in how to tie a scarf, and which at one time invited customers and passers-by alike to stop in and have loose buttons sewn on or missing buttons replaced at no cost.
With annual sales of about $100 million, the Hastings Group -- including Hastings (USA) Inc. and West Belt Distributors -- estimated its assets at the time of the filing at approximately $34.6 million and liabilities at about $38.3 million. The liquidation sales, which include store equipment, fixtures and furniture, are intended to stem what Hastings described as "losses that are occurring on a daily basis."
In recent weeks, vendors have stopped shipments of merchandise. But a hint of the group's financial difficulties appeared this spring when Wallachs, which carries men's suits priced at about $375 to more than $1,000, closed its 20,000-square-foot store in lower Manhattan and opened a 9,000-square-foot store four blocks away, at 52 Broadway, at Exchange Place. The other Wallachs store in Manhattan is at 555 Fifth Avenue, at 46th Street.
Specialty apparel stores have struggled for most of this decade, except for that relative handful of stores frequented by the carriage trade. Most of the suffering was caused by America's trend toward more casual attire, particularly in the workplace, by widespread layoffs among white-collar workers, and by customers who were skittish about the economy and switched to department stores or discount stores. Even when the economy improved, many former customers did not return to the specialty stores.
The Hastings Group, based in Chicago, acquired the stores in August 1994 from the HSSA investment group, which had been operating under Chapter 11 proceedings for nine months. After HSSA had bought the stores in October 1992 from the Hartmarx Corporation for a $43 million note due in two years, it closed about 100 of the 187 stores by year's end. These included the Raleighs stores in the Washington area, Hanny's in Phoenix, Arthur Frank in Salt Lake City, Peer Gordon in Cleveland and Kleinhans in Buffalo.
But those measures were not enough. Hastings said that before its purchase the business had suffered several years of contraction and a deeper erosion of its customer base than Hastings had anticipated.
Representatives of Hastings could not be reached for comment on closings or layoffs.

HEADLINE: I.B.M.'s Robotic Army of Computer-Chip Soldiers

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Most owners of personal computers know the type of microprocessor that acts as the electronic brain inside their desktop or notebook machines. But do they know what kind of chip is in their dishwashers or new telephone-answering machines?
Not likely. Yet as the semiconductor industry continues its explosive growth, a surge that the industry estimates will see worldwide sales jump 79 percent, to $261 billion in 1998 from $146 billion this year, these hidden chips have become robotic foot soldiers of the digital revolution. 
 And I.B.M. is eager to enlist. The company, sensing an opportunity to expand deeper into the world of commercial chip manufacturing, is expected to announce today that one of its new specialized chips has been chosen by Thomson Consumer Electronics for a new interactive television set-top box that Thomson will manufacture. It would be the biggest push yet by the International Business Machines Corporation into the market for so-called embedded controllers -- computer chips that make their way into non-computer devices.
Embedded controllers are specialized microprocessors that are responsible for most of the neat new functions found in everything from video-game players to microwave ovens. Most cars already contain about a dozen of the chips, and analysts predict that the wholesale value of electronics in all cars built in North America will increase to $15 billion by the year 2000, from $4.5 billion in 1987.
As sales of dedicated microprocessors soar, a more powerful generation of controllers promises to drive down the prices and make commonplace such items as color laser printers, digital cameras and personal digital assistants.
"The personal computer business is just one marketplace," said Tom Starnes of Dataquest in San Jose, Calif. "The nice thing about embedded controllers is that they appear in all aspects of your life."
In aiming for a bigger presence in the embedded-controller business, I.B.M. will find itself competing in a market long dominated by Motorola, Intel and Japanese semiconductor makers like Hitachi and NEC.
Today, I.B.M. is expected to announce that Thomson Consumer Electronics will place its chips in the set-top boxes Thomson is making for Tele-TV, a joint venture of Nynex, Pacific Telesis and Bell Atlantic.
Tele-TV plans to offer a multichannel television service using satellite and microwave distribution before its planned fiber optic network is completed. In the meantime, it will buy three million of the I.B.M.-equipped boxes from Thompson starting next year, said Elliott H. Newcombe 3d, marketing manager for I.B.M.'s new line of controllers.
Thomson is I.B.M.'s first major customer since the company announced its first commercial embedded controller in September 1994. Since then, the I.B.M. chips have begun to appear in a few pieces of hardware that direct data across computer networks, and Mr. Newcombe said they had been included in designs by other customers who have yet to bring their products to market. I.B.M. is also using the chips in developing half a dozen products.
I.B.M., which will report virtually no revenue from embedded controllers this year, expects to collect as much as $50 million next year from the sales of its three types of controller chips. That would still be minuscule compared with the $1.4 billion in sales that Motorola's controller-chip business had last year.
I.B.M.'s effort is part of a three-year-old strategy to realize a profit from its huge investment and expertise in semiconductor manufacturing. Until 1992, all of I.B.M.'s semiconductor production was used internally, making the microelectronics division, which pioneered much of the cutting-edge technology now used by its competitors, a multibillion-dollar expense.
The company, while still finding its way in embedded controllers, already supplies memory, logic and microprocessor chips to a number of outside customers, including competitors like Hewlett-Packard and Silicon Graphics. Outside revenue for the division jumped to $1.75 billion in 1994 from $325 million in 1992 and is expected to reach $2.5 billion this year, according to Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch & Company.
Like the overall industry, the bulk of I.B.M.'s semiconductor revenue comes from selling memory chips that store information used by microprocessors. The company recently announced plans to build a $1.2 billion memory-chip plant in Manassas, Va., with Toshiba of Japan. Last week, it said it would spend $1 billion more to expand memory-chip production at its plant in Corbeil-Essonnes, France.
But while it expects its overall memory sales to rise, I.B.M. is planning to make this area a smaller part of its overall semiconductor revenue, shielding itself against the ups and downs of the cyclical memory-chip market. As part of last week's announcement, another $400 million was earmarked to expand production of microprocessors at the company's plant in Burlington, Vt.
Included in those plans are the new controller chips, which are based on the PowerPC microprocessor developed by I.B.M., Motorola and Apple Computer. While the three companies jointly own the design for the PowerPC processor used in personal computers and work stations, I.B.M. and Motorola have each developed their own PowerPC-based controllers.
In addition to providing a new source of revenue for I.B.M.'s microelectronics division, the controllers would provide needed volume for the PowerPC design. Unlike Intel, which dominates the market for personal computer microprocessors and can therefore spread the high cost of production over tens of millions of units each year, I.B.M.produces only a few million Power PC units a year in Burlington, the bulk of which are sold to Apple for its PC's.
"It's great to have great technology but we have to have economies of scale," said Douglas A. Grose, I.B.M.'s Burlington manager.
Because controllers do not have to perform the same complex functions needed by a microprocessor designed for a personal computer, they are usually a generation or two behind the PC chips. Consequently, the prices of embedded controllers range from $1 to $80, compared with an Intel Pentium chip in a personal computer, which costs about $350.
But the PowerPC represents one of the most advanced controllers, based on the reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, design favored for many of today's most powerful computer work stations. These attributes suit the PowerPC for a growing number of advanced new products like set-top boxes, laser printers and video-game players.
As the newcomer to the game, I.B.M. has focused its efforts in this high-end arena, which also includes products like faxes, telephones and networking equipment. Though the number of such controllers now sold is small, this area is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years.
"I think they are targeting exactly the right customers," said Susan Mason, an analyst with Information Architects, a research firm that closely follows the embedded-controller market. The customers they focus on "may not be shipping a lot today but will be shipping a lot in the future," she said.
And by sharing the same basic PowerPC design with Motorola, I.B.M. is well positioned to take business away from the industry leader in the future, Ms. Mason added.
The question remaining is whether I.B.M., which is relatively new to the world of selling chips commercially, can market its technology and service its customers as effectively as its more established competitors.
Unsurprisingly, Mr. Newcombe thinks it can. He plans to insure that the Burlington plant is churning out PowerPC chips for years to come. "The embedded world is slow to migrate to these upper levels of performance," he said, "but the good news is that when they do, they stay there for a long time."

 One of the many uses for dedicated computer chips is controlling the increasingly complicated electrical systems in cars. According to Ford Motor, the current cost of electronics in a car is $1,500 to $1,750, more than twice the cost of the steel used to make the auto. Here: a look at the Lincoln Continental, Ford's most electronically complicated car, and its underlying electronic systems.
 
The chip set in the car comes primarily from off-the-shelf parts that have been re-engineered to perform different tasks.
 
A set of twisted-pair wires form a sort of local-area computer network in the car.
 
The car uses multiplexing technology so that sensors scattered throughout the car can send information to different control centers.
 
An optional satellite location system allows mororists to signal a rescue center when the car breaks down. The center uses catellite technology to direct the repair vehicle.
 
Ride control controls the car's air suspension system and -- shock absorbers and variably alters the power-steering system through altering sensors and controls at each wheel. The driver can select "plush" for a floating-on-air, no-handling type of drive, or "firm" for something more solid.
 
Cell phone control controls calls including whether or not comversation takes place on handset or through stereo system.

HEADLINE: Reinventing the Neon Jungle

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Times Square has long been a magnet for the good, the bad, the ugly, the zany and the downright weird. No, not the people, but the overhead signs -- a vast, chaotic tableau of visual media of every variety.
The roll-call of giant commercial displays over the years includes winking penguins, smoke-puffing billboards, ersatz waterfalls, even a Mona Lisa rendered at 250 times the size of the original. Often, Times Square has been a showcase for the cutting-edge technology of its day. So it seems fitting that the Internet, the media of the moment, has recently secured a beachhead of sorts amid the neon of Times Square. 
 The Joe Boxer Corporation, a San Francisco marketer of oddball underwear (gag prints and detachable tails), leased a sign on 42d Street two months ago with an electric-light strip on the bottom for displaying E-mail messages from around the world. Mostly, they are personal messages: a birthday greeting to a 92-year-old grandmother, a writer's pitch for her unpublished short stories, a marriage proposal -- "Lee, I love you and want to ask you to be my husband. Hey this is the 90's. Rachel."
The billboard is displaying the most private of media, E-mail, which is typically written or received alone by someone hunched in front of a personal computer, in the most public of places, Times Square. Nicholas Graham, the 37-year-old president of Joe Boxer, calls his innovation "E-mail broadcasting."
The E-mail billboard is the latest evidence that as a center of state-of-the-art outdoor media, Times Square is regaining a breadth and vitality not seen since the golden age of signage in the 1950's and early 1960's, when the district was alight with flashy neon animations.
The comeback of Times Square as an outdoor emporium of commerical display is the result of economic regeneration and shrewd public policy. Times Square's recent history also shows the evolution of curiously appropriate technology -- a pastiche of everything from art-deco neon to fiber optics and computer graphics.
Advertisers justify their multimillion-dollar signs and the spending of hundreds of thousands a year to lease space in Times Square by talking about the million people who trudge through the district each day, and all those few-second "impressions." But those passers-by may or may not gaze up. For the companies, it is mostly about the image-burnishing prestige of having a presence in Times Square, one of the world's great crossroads.
Scholars and civic groups, led by the Municipal Art
 
Society, a former pioneer of anti-billboard activism dating back to the turn of the century, pushed hard for a 1986 zoning ordinance that actually mandated big signs and bright lights on new buildings in Times Square. They prevailed over many in the state and local government, and elsewhere, who wanted to do away with the area's garish commercialism, and remake Times Square in the image of Wall Street or Rockefeller Center, a sober office distict.
"It now appears that Times Square, with its aesthetic chaos and its finger-snapping vitality, may well survive the best intentions of the misguided," said Kent Barwick, a trustee of the Municipal Art Society.
These days, the intelligentsia waxes absolutely poetic on the subject of the neon sign, once regarded as a symbol of low-brow commercialism. Kenneth T. Jackson, editor in chief of "The Encyclopedia of New York" and a history professor at Columbia University, recently led 200 students on a midnight bicycle tour of Times Square. "There's no experience like it -- that sea of neon," he said. "If you took away the neon, it wouldn't be Times Square."
The view that big, flashy signs are vital to Times Square's distinctive character was the basis for the 1986 law encouraging their construction. By all accounts, it was a crucial step toward creating the look of Times Square today.
"The zoning ordinance was the catalyst," said Jason Perline, who is the chairman of Van Wagner Communications Inc., a sign design and marketing agent. "Imagine a municipality passing a law requiring commercial signs."
This odd yet enlightened act of urban preservation has secured Times Square's stature. London may have Picadilly Circus, and Tokyo the Ginza, but "no other city has such a concentrated place, a great outdoor space filled with powerful signs, like Times Square," said Paul Marantz, an architectural lighting consultant in New York.
The sign population of Times Square is rising, and set to go higher. At the start of the 1980's, sign company executives say, there were fewer than two dozen of the jumbo sign faces, which can cover thousands of square feet each, above Broadway and Seventh Avenue, from 42d Street to 49th Street. Today, they say, there are some 60 such big signs. For advertisers, the leasing cost for big billboards ranges from $180,000 to $1.2 million a year, depending on the display space and its location.
The signs range from Morgan Stanley's new electronic tickers, made with three million light-emitting diodes, spitting out financial headlines and stock quotes in 10-foot-high lettering, to giant computer-printed likenesses of everyone from Rush Limbaugh, advertising himself, to a seemingly naked Claudia Schiffer, coyly covered with hay, advertising Kenar apparel.
The other notable trend in Times Square's commercial display recently is the increasing diversity of signs, both by nationality and by industries represented. The Japanese electronics companies, like Sony, Panasonic, JVC and Aiwa, began the return of big signs by major consumer-products makers. Sony led the march in 1979 and others followed, all wanting "electronic calling cards" in Times Square.
The big American companies followed, like Kodak, Hertz, Maxwell House, Bloomberg and others. The Coca-Cola Company, the doyen of Times Square advertisers with a 75-year presence, unveiled a new, $3.5-million sign at the end of 1991. The four-story Coke bottle, at 47th and Broadway, fills and refills thanks to a mile of neon tubing, 60 miles of optical fiber and 13,000 light bulbs, all controlled by computer.
A wider range of industries are represented on Times Square signs these days. In particular, companies accustomed to pictorial ads like fashion, apparel and cosmetics makers have billboards everywhere -- mostly blown-up versions of magazine ads for Calvin Klein, Kenar, Jantzen, Banana Republic, Hanes, Hugo Boss, Tommy Hilfiger and others. But even the billboard, a prehistoric technology, has a new computerized gloss.
In the late 1970's, when Brooke Shields was creating a stir in Times Square with ads for Calvin Klein jeans, her suggestive likeness was hand-painted on the billboard. Painters using four-inch brushes mounted scaffolding. Often, an art director stood on the street with a two-way radio, directing their efforts. It could take months to complete a sign, and its quality depended on the painters' skill.
Today, with digital technology, the production process can take just hours. An image can be scanned from a magazine page, for example, manipulated in a personal computer, and then printed on rolls of vinyl in a machine that resembles a giant version of a desktop printer. The process was developed by the Metromedia Corporation, and later emulated by others. In the last few years, sign painters have become an endangered species.
Yet has all the advanced technology, from computer-rendered portraits to Sony's high-resolution Jumbotron screen, really improved the medium of outdoor display? Tama Starr, president of Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation, which has made many of Times Square's signs since 1897, believes the most effective ingredients have not changed much over the years.
"The great signs are stunning, kinetic light sculptures," Ms. Starr said. "And through that artistic image, the company's message comes through."
Times Square historians tend to agree that the best signs were the mechanical ones dating back to the 1930's and 1940's. There was the Camel ad, which blew smoke rings of steam, and the Pepsi-Cola waterfall, which used a vacuum system to keep the falling water hugging the sign face. Most of these were built by Ms. Starr's grandfather, Jacob Starr, and designed by Douglas Leigh.
Today, at 88, Mr. Leigh confesses that he misses the old mechanical signs, which he believes were a unique medium. Of the Sony Jumbotron, he said, "It's great technology, but it's just a big version of what you can see in your living room."
Still, he says that the ascendancy of electronic technology over simpler forms of human inventiveness is only to be expected. "That's the electronic age, pal," Mr. Leigh said.

Chart/Map: "Bright Lights, Big City"
 Times Square has always been known for advertising, but recent and not-so-recent technological advances have made it a center for multimedia ads. And a center for ads about underwear, strangely enough.
 Map of Times Square shows locations of large billboards.
 
Financial News
 Owner -- Morgan Stanley
 Type -- Five screens and multitime zone clocks at a cost of several million dollars.
 Audience -- East side of the Square. The screens show information from stock markets and financial news from Reuters and others.
 Technology -- Light-emitting-diode screen. The ticker concept goes back to the 195h century. The 2d generation diodes have been around for the last year, and are brighter.
 Effective? -- Offers intelligent information, but any serious trader really should be on the floor. The multiple ticker screens, all moving at differnt speeds, can be dizzying.
 
8 O'Clock Coffee Mug
 Type -- Old-fashioned mechanical billboard with steaming cup.
 Audience -- West side of TImes Square and caffiene addicts.
 Technology -- Three-dimensional coffee cup with a slit at the top for steam release.
 Effective? -- Possibly the lowest-tech gimmick billboard, also one of the most appealing in its simplicity and lack of glitz.
 
Calvin Klein
 Type -- Vinyl billboard with surly urban youths.
 Audience -- West side of Times Square and commuters who use 43d Street.
 Technology -- Large sheets of computer-colored vinyl, a technique that became possible in 1986, has been refined in the last three years. The billboard cost more than $15,000.
 Effective? -- Mr. Klein's ads have always been a hot topic of discussion, and the recent campaign featuring teen-agers in provocative poses remined in Times Square long after similar ads were pulled eleswhere.
 
Coca-Cola Sign
 Type -- 55 tons of fiber optics (pliable strands that transmit light), neon, glass, aluminum, light bulbs and steel with strolling ticker at cost of $3.5 million.
 Audience -- The entire Square.
 Technology -- The fiber optics make it appeqar as if the bottle empties and refills.
 Effective? -- Sits high up but extremely complex in its activity. It gets lost in the column of signs above it.
 
Jumbotron TV
 Owner -- Sony
Type -- Outsized television set.
 Audience -- All of Times Square. The screen carries ads for Sony items, news and public service announcements.
 Technology -- Enormous (32 feet by 23.5 feet) TV screen based on sports stadium screen technology.
 Effective? -- One of thge most dynamic installations in Times Square.
 
Joe Boxer Ad
 Type -- Underwear billboard with a ticker wired to Internet.
 Audience -- New surfers and tourists who happen to look up from the north side of 42d Street.
 Technology -- Users can seen messages through http://www.joeboxer.com. and have them posted to ticker after the rigors of editing.
 Effective? -- The sign is not in the most visible spot in the square, and advertisements for the company run more frequently than E-mail. (pg. D1)
 
Graph/Photos: "The New Ad Technology"
 At King Graphics Technologies in New York, computers are used to generate outsized vinal sheets that are strung up to billboards. The printing cost can run from $2,000 to $25,000. Ads that are lit from the back are printed on both sides so they do not wash out -- making them more expensive.
 1. The ad is scanned into a Power Macintosh or created from scratch on the computer using photo editing programs such as Adobe's Photoshop.
 2. The printer outputs several 20-foot wide strips of vinyl.
 3. The vinyl is melted together and can be strung up on less than three hours. Ads that were painted by hand could take two months. (pg. D6)

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans Bill and Note Sales This Week

 BODY:
The Treasury's schedule of financings this week is confined to bills and notes, beginning with today's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills. The Government's quarterly refunding tentatively scheduled this week includes the auctions of 3- and 10-year notes, beginning tomorrow for the 3-year maturity and Wednesday for the 10-year maturity. On Thursday, a tentative auction of one-year bills is also scheduled.
The auctions of both the notes and the one-year bills may be postponed, because they are contingent on an agreement being reached on a Federal budget and a raising of the Federal debt ceiling. 
 By the close of the New York cash market on Friday, traders said, the rate on the outstanding three-month bill was 5.30 percent and on a six-month bill 5.24 percent. The current rate for a one-year bill is 5.12 percent, a three-year note is trading at a price to yield 5.55 percent and a 10-year note at a price to yield 5.92 percent.
Government financings expected this week include a $400 million Fannie Mae debenture issue due in 2005, which is to be priced tomorrow.
The following taxable and tax-exempt fixed-income issues are scheduled for pricing this week:

HEADLINE: In America;
Asleep At the Revolution

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Marian Wright Edelman was seething.
"I have been so frustrated trying to get the message out," she said. "It is immoral what is going on in Washington today. The country is sleeping through this revolution." 
 Ms. Edelman is president of the Children's Defense Fund and she is outraged by the Republican-led assault on the poor and the young and the sick and the disabled.
What we are witnessing, she said, "is an unbelievable budget massacre of the weakest. It is absolutely wrong."
Ms. Edelman seemed awed by the magnitude of the assault. "I have never seen anything like it. The budget cuts are many times the size of those in the Reagan years. I very seldom use the word evil, but what I am seeing . . ." She stopped and shook her head.
Ms. Edelman is convinced that most Americans are unaware of the amount of harm that will result from the G.O.P. budget policies. She emphasized that it is not just the fact that funding for social programs is being cut. What is more important is that the Federal Government is abandoning its responsibility to provide even the most minimal level of assistance to Americans left without any other resources.
That is a radical and deeply regrettable change at the core of the American value system.
"Until now," said Ms. Edelman, "our Government has said to a child or to a poor person or to the elderly or the disabled that, you know, if there is a recession or a disaster, and regardless of where you live, we are going to be there for you. The fundamental principle that our national Government is the protector of last resort is what is at stake as we give these block grants to the states and tell them to go ahead and do whatever they want.
Ms. Edelman denounced the politicians who have "succeeded in making 'entitlements' a dirty word." The entitlement issue is the safety net issue, she said, and it is essential that people who care about the country's most vulnerable individuals fight for it. Without the guarantee of help, many people in desperate need will not get help, and many of them will be children.
The existence of Federal entitlements means that "there is a floor," said Ms. Edelman. "There is a national guarantee of some decency. No 7-year-old will have to sit in class without eating all day, his attention wholly distracted from learning by his hungry belly. No 5-year-old will have to grow up on the streets or in an orphanage simply because her father left and our patience with her mother's inability to find and keep a job has run out."
Ms. Edelman addressed the entitlement issue directly in an open letter to President Clinton published in Friday's Washington Post. "We do not want to codify a policy of national child abandonment," she wrote. "Franklin Delano Roosevelt correctly stated: 'Better the occasional faults of a government that lives in a spirit of charity than the constant omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.'
"Every president since FDR -- Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush -- preserved the minimal national guarantee of income assistance for poor children. It is a precedent I hope and trust you will uphold."
Ms. Edelman argues that the welfare and Medicaid bills fashioned by Congress in the name of "reform" will in fact make more families poor and deprive many more Americans of desperately needed health care.
That is unquestionably true, but it has not slowed the rush to get the bills enacted into law. A study by the Department of Health and Human Services concluded that the Senate welfare bill, which is less harsh than the House bill, would push 1.1 million children into poverty and would worsen the condition of families already in poverty.
That did not stop President Clinton from announcing his strong support for the Senate bill.
Ms. Edelman said she was "disturbed" by the President's position and hoped he would change his mind. She said any legislation that weakens the health or income safety net should be vetoed.
"The President of the United States and everybody else ought to be saying: 'This is not who we are. This is wrong and we won't do it. We are not going to hurt children.' "

HEADLINE: Strife-Torn Pequots Re-elect Chairman

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
In two decades as tribal chairman, Richard Hayward has seen the Mashantucket Pequots rise from the edge of extinction to economic and political power as owners of the nation's most profitable casino, the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard, Conn. But with their new-found wealth has come new internal strife, as yesterday's tribal elections demonstrated.
The tribe, which has more than 300 members, voted to re-elect Mr. Hayward, known to many as Skip. But he did not face much opposition: a leading challenger, Michael Goodwin, the tribe's assistant director of cultural resources, was disqualified from the race two days before the election. 
 The Pequots -- who employ 10,000 people, took in $800 million last year at their Foxwoods casino and are planning to open another in Bridgeport -- are governed by a seven-member tribal council, headed by the chairman. Only members of the council can run for chairman, said Charles Duffy, a lobbyist for the Pequots. Since Mr. Goodwin was not on the council, he could not run for chairman, Mr. Duffy said.
But Mr. Goodwin charged that he had been barred from the election because of his controversial political viewpoints. He told The Day of New London that he had planned to question how the tribe distributed its vast new wealth.
"There are some folks out there so scared of an honest election they'd be willing to do anything to shut me out of the vote," he told the newspaper. "It doesn't look right, though, and I think the membership will smell a rat."
Neither Mr. Hayward nor Mr. Goodwin returned telephone calls last night.
The Pequots had nearly died out as a tribe in the 1970's, to the point that Connecticut considered turning their reservation into a state park. Then in 1983, the Pequots won Federal recognition, which qualified them to enter the gambling business, and in 1992 Foxwoods was opened.
The Pequots now offer their members jobs with an average salary of $50,000 to $60,000, housing and fully subsidized education from nursery school through graduate school.
And the small tribe suddenly finds itself with plenty of money to argue over. Tribal issues are discussed at monthly meetings in the community center and decided by the tribal council. Two council members are elected each year, and the chairman is elected every three years. Half of the tribe's members are old enough to vote.
In recent years, race has sometimes proved a point of contention. Some tribal members married into white families, others into black families. Mr. Goodwin, the disqualified challenger, charged that the tribe had been discriminatory in the way it distributed housing to its membership. And The Day of New London reported that seven other tribal members who were found ineligible to run for office were black.
Mr. Duffy, the lobbyist, said: "The tribe is wholly integrated and the council reflects that."
 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 8, 1995, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about tribal elections held by the Mashantucket Pequot Indians in Connecticut referred incorrectly to the status of some participants. Michael Goodwin, who criticized the tribe's leaders, ran unsuccessfully for the tribal council. He was not disqualified, nor were any tribal members ruled ineligible to run.
The article's headline characterized the elections incorrectly. The tribe's chairman, Richard Hayward, was re-elected by the tribal council without opposition. The annual election was not strife-torn.

HEADLINE: Competition and Cutbacks Hurt Foreign Doctors in U.S.

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
At Woodhull Hospital in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Dr. Yusuf Afacan takes care of poor patients sick with AIDS, drawing their blood, juggling their medications, finding them homes.
After graduating from medical school in his native Turkey, Dr. Afacan did a residency in New Jersey and a fellowship in infectious diseases at the University of Rochester. He landed his job in Brooklyn through a program that allows foreign-born and foreign-trained doctors to remain in the United States if they practice in underserved areas. Four of the five senior doctors at his clinic are also foreign graduates -- the others from Belgium, Haiti and Pakistan. 
 But if legislators have their way, Dr. Afacan and his colleagues, who work where many American doctors refuse to go, may be an endangered species. Facing an oversupply of doctors, the Clinton Administration and Congress, in separate measures, are scaling back the Government programs that have long allowed graduates of overseas medical schools to practice in the United States, providing crucial care in the sickest, poorest neighborhoods.
At the same time, medical groups, which have long officially embraced foreign doctors, are becoming less welcoming toward them as competition for medical jobs increases in an industry that has been thrown into turmoil by budget cuts and the growth of managed care.
Physicians like Dr. Afacan are at the center of a political maelstrom that threatens to topple the fragile infrastructure that provides care in America's AIDS clinics, city hospitals and rural emergency rooms.
Public hospital administrators are in a near panic at the prospect of losing a huge chunk of their work force.
"There is this myth that if we cut off the supply of international graduates, somehow there are going to be American doctors who are going to want these jobs," said Kalman Resnick, a Chicago lawyer who has helped Cook County Hospital find foreign-trained doctors. "And that is just not the case."
Of the 1,261 doctors in training who dispense care full time at New York's public hospitals, nearly 70 percent are foreign-born graduates of overseas medical schools, and the percentage is even higher at some private hospitals in poor neighborhoods. At Bronx Lebanon, it is 71 percent; at North General Hospital in Harlem, it is 91 percent.
The international medical graduates, many of whom were recruited by hospitals in need of their labor, feel betrayed.
"When this country needed a lot of physicians to help the health care system, international graduates were very welcome -- wined and dined," said Dr. Busharat Ahmad, a Pakastani-born ophthalmologist, who practices in Monroe, Mich. "And now when they don't need so many they are thrown by the wayside, and no one cares."
 
Purse Snapped Shut By Medicare Bill
 The House Medicare bill that passed last month will cut Federal subsidies for doctors in training who are international medical school graduates and neither citizens nor permanent residents. More than 50 percent of doctors in training fall into this category at many inner-city hospitals, where such doctors dispense the bulk of front-line care.
At the same time, the Department of Health and Human Services is seeking to curtail a visa program that has allowed foreign doctors who have finished training to remain in the United States if they practice in poor areas.
Within the profession, graduates of foreign medical schools say they are facing new levels of bias, with groups like the American Association of Medical Colleges lobbying to restrict opportunities for foreign physicians.
And as H.M.O.'s sweep across the nation, foreign-trained physicians say they are being shut out of plans by managed-care companies who promise customers American doctors.
It is the latest phase in this country's ambivalent relationship with foreign medical graduates, who are at once deemed inferior in training but critical to the delivery of health care to the poor. And some immigration critics say the proposals are racist as well since they do no affect U.S. citizens who are graduates of foreign medical schools.
"There is a color line and also an accent line in American medicine," Mr. Resnick said.
Central to the debate about the proper role of foreign-trained doctors are a couple of facts: First, that there are now too many doctors in the United States, particularly specialists, and health economists say this surplus breeds inefficiency and drives up costs. And second, there are 149,000 international medical graduates now practicing in the United States, which amounts to 20 percent of the nation's physicians -- a number that has been accelerating fast. Virtually all of these doctors enter the country for medical training but remain for years afterward.
To groups as diverse as the American Association of Medical Colleges, an industry group, and the Center for the Health Professions at the University of California at San Francisco, a research group, the proper course is a matter of simple math.
"We have just got to stop the pipeline of foreign medical graduates," Dr. Ed O'Neil, director of the center, said. "They are a big chunk of physician oversupply. This very quickly gets into racial issues, but I don't think that's it. We're just trying to be rational."
 
A Promise to Leave, A Reason to Stay
 Officially, most foreign doctors who obtain visas to train in this country do so with the explicit understanding that they will leave once that training is finished. But more than 75 percent, and perhaps as many as 90 percent, of these doctors end up practicing here, both because of poor job prospects in their native countries -- most are from poor nations -- and because the technology-based training they receive here is irrelevant at home. Although they come initially for primary-care training, in the end most specialize.
At the end of 1994, there were 23,499 international medical graduates pursuing medical training in the United States, a number that has doubled in the last five years. Forty-two percent of doctors in training in New York and 52 percent in New Jersey are international medical graduates. In Illinois, the percentage is 32; in Michigan, 29. Just over 8 percent nationwide are American-born citizens who traveled overseas to attend medical school.
"We take the brightest students in foreign medical schools and give them a set of skills that are not needed in their own country, and so they stay here and add to the physician glut," Dr. O'Neil said.
But a process that sounds so irrational has burgeoned because it makes sense from another perspective: As they travel the circuitous route that begins with medical school in Guadalajara or New Delhi, international graduates often spend more than a decade training and working in medically underserved areas, performing a crucial role in American health care.
Virtually all foreign doctors who enter the country on temporary training visas stay on indefinitely through Federal programs that grant them visa waivers in exchange for a commitment to practice for three years in a medically underserved neighborhood.
The Department of Veterans Affairs, the Appalachian Regional Commission and, more recently, the Department of Housing and Urban Development as well as the Department of Agriculture, issued visa waivers to help staff inner-city and rural hospitals.
In many cases, that three-year stopover, even if it is en route to specialties or fancier practices, has been invaluable. "The HUD waiver program has been a real boon for us, and let me tell you there are few boons when you're dealing with an inner-city population with AIDS," said Dr. Victoria Sharp, medical director of the Spellman Center of St. Clare's Hospital, a designated AIDS treatment center in New York City.
But if the Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services have their way, foreign-born graduates of foreign medical schools will be largely barred from this country in the future.
Although the House Medicare bill does not prohibit hospitals from admitting foreign graduates as medical residents, it largely eliminates subsidies to help pay for their training, which would discourage hospitals from hiring them.
 
Cheap Labor, Where Labor Is Needed
 Hospitals now receive about $150,000 a year for each doctor in training, regardless of nationality, to compensate for the costs of medical education. So for better and worse, inner-city hospitals have gotten both cheap labor and extra Federal dollars when they hire foreign graduates.
"This subsidy has fueled the expansion of training programs in the inner cities where the shortage of fully trained doctors is great," said Dr. Jordan Cohen, president of the American Association of Medical Colleges. "But we've ended up with an educational system that's been terribly distorted by service requirements of institutions."
While Congress moves to shut the pipeline for residents, the Department of Health and Human Services under the leadership of Secretary Donna E. Shalala is moving to curtail physician immigration programs. This summer, Ms. Shalala wrote to her counterparts at the Department of Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development to request that they no longer issue immigration waivers to foreign physicians, citing a national surplus of doctors. For the moment, the HUD program is on hold.
But health-care advocates fear that such proposals will leave poor people without doctors.
This week St. Michael's Medical Center in Newark had three waiver requests turned down for experienced foreign medical graduates who were to be full-time doctors for patients on Medicaid.
"What are we supposed to do?" said Dominick Calgi, an administrator at the hospital, "We are going to have to try to get other physicians, but there are not many who are willing to commit to the inner city, and never of this quality." In the meantime, the hospital pieces together a staff using residents and doctors who commit to a few hours here and there.
The issue of international graduates has been divisive for organized medicine.
Recently, the American Medical Association recommended that the number of training slots in the United States be limited to 110 percent of the number of graduates of American medical schools each year; it is now 145 percent. The restriction would largely affect foreign doctors, who get the slots that graduates of United States medical schools leave unfilled. The association's medical-student division went further, suggesting that graduates of the American schools be awarded preference over international medical graduates.
That proposal was ultimately rejected but set off a ferocious debate in which foreign graduates complained that they were being treated as second-class citizens and Americans fretted about jobs.
 
A Shoulder Cold And Shrugged
 Foreign-trained doctors say their employment prospects have already dimmed. Carlos Roldan, who went to medical school in Colombia and passed the test required of foreign-trained doctors on his first try, assumed he would have no trouble landing a residency slot in New York. He wrote to 90 hospitals and received 45 applications in response. He filled them all out, got only two interviews, and no job. Many hospitals wrote back that foreign-trained doctors need not apply.
Even senior doctors, who are now citizens, say they are being squeezed out of jobs, as H.M.O.'s sweep the country, favoring American-trained doctors in hiring.
When one hospital in suburban Detroit was taken over by a large H.M.O. this year, the new owners promptly dismissed the hospital's anesthesiologists -- six foreign-trained doctors and one American graduate, according to a physician who would not identify the H.M.O because he is seeking an affiliation with it. The H.M.O. invited the former doctors to apply for jobs, and all did, but only the United States-trained doctor was hired.
"These people are all in their 40's and 50's, their children were born in the U.S., so this is a big deal for them," he said. He said he knew of 16 experienced doctors from abroad who had been forced out of practice because they were not admitted to H.M.O.'s.
Inner-city and rural hospitals are busily devising contingency plans if the role of foreign doctors is restricted, hiring more nurse practitioners and physician's assistants.
In the long run, health-care planners hope that American-trained doctors will trickle down into today's inner cities as the job market gets tighter. But many have suggested that the Government needs to resurrect a National Health Service Corps, allowing doctors to practice in underserved areas in exchange for a reduction of medical school loans.
"If the problem is a shortage of primary-care doctors in poor neighborhoods why not face that directly," Dr. O'Neil said, "instead of subsidizing the training of someone we don't need, who is going to stay here, become a neurosurgeon and drive up costs?"

HEADLINE: Tokyo Journal;
Japanese Prefer Blondes (In Their Ads, That Is)

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Brian G. Banowetz, a 28-year-old former Army intelligence trainee in Oregon, flew here this year with empty pockets and big dreams.
With a smattering of Japanese, dark good looks and a bit of acting experience, Mr. Banowetz hopes he is on his way. He has already helped sell KitKat chocolate bars, Toyota cars and other products in five Japanese commercials. 
 "Japan was a 10-year dream," said Mr. Banowetz, confident as he began an audition with a Japanese company. "Here you can be in the thick of it all in a bigger way."
Japanese seem to tuck away their wallets when it comes to buying American cars and other products, but they still harbor a fascination with the West. As a result, the faces that beam from advertisements, billboards and commercials often have blue eyes and blond hair.
Tokyo streets and television screens have been sprinkled with the giant images of Madonna and Takara liquor, Harrison Ford and Kirin beer, Peter Falk and Suntory whisky, Eddie Murphy and Sapporo canned coffee, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Arinamin vitamins, and thousands of aspiring actors like Mr. Banowetz. Big stars come for the big money, and also because doing a commercial in Japan does not sully a reputation in America.
One in five commercials used to feature foreigners, and even unknown actors could earn a nice living by filming just commercials.
The recession here has dampened the business a bit. But foreign models are still paid 50 percent more than Japanese, and so Japan remains a fertile training ground for young Americans trying to make a name in the sparkling, dazzling world of modeling and television.
"This means a lot to me," Howard C. R. Franklin said as he walked out of an audition after his day job at an American securities company. "I like the exhibitionism. My modeling friends think I'm nuts. I'm straddling two worlds, the normal and the exhibitionist worlds."
In some cases, Japanese advertisers use foreigners to add cachet to their products. At other times, the foreigner is the focus of a certain comedy. Maureen L. Card is often on camera swathed in the 1950's look, her hair in curlers, cold cream covering her face.
A large woman, she appeared in one commercial vacuuming. Her on-stage scrawny husband was sitting in the way, so she picked him up with the tip of her vacuum and scooped him out of the room.
"I was very overweight and they wanted a fat woman to do a commercial," said Ms. Card, who with her husband and three children comes from San Diego. "They're getting a silly foreigner and I'm getting paid. I've never felt I've been used."
Sometimes Japanese companies seem to enjoy poking fun of foreigners, perhaps because it is even more amusing to see a humiliated American than a humiliated Japanese. When Akio Shizume, a creative director at Dentsu Inc., an advertising company, wanted to show a sleepy, slumping man fall flat into a mushy cake, he chose to use foreign actors, not Japanese.
If a Japanese actor appeared messy on screen, Japanese viewers might identify with him and feel awkward and so they would not want to buy the wet tissues the company sells, Mr. Shimuze said.
"Foreigners are neutral, like people from another world, so the audience does not identify with the dirtiness of the actions and instead feels only the humor in the commercial," Mr. Shizume said.
Last year a 3 1/2-year-old blond girl from an American military family pocketed about $6,000 for a session's work filming a car commercial in which she sipped a glass of milk and then spilled it.
The commercial ran for a year and won a top award and she became a poster child for the Mercedes-Benz car all over Japan. Spurred on by stories like this, parents shuffle their children to photo sessions, register their names with several different modeling agencies, and then drag their young hopefuls around the city from audition to audition.
"When Japanese look at an Asian kid, they look at the face first," said Masako Saito, president of K & M Promotions, a modeling agency. "But all foreign faces look the same, and so they don't look at the face of the model, but focus their eyes more on the clothes."
Even the Japanese directors often do not scrutinize the faces too closely. Once when a Japanese company wanted a certain style of young boy, Mrs. Saito brought in nearly 40 boys to an audition. All were turned down because they did not have the right aura.
Then Mrs. Saito spotted someone she liked -- a young short-haired model with a healthy look. She conferred with the American mother, and together they brought in the young child. The director smiled, a contract was drawn up and the commercial was filmed. It was not until two years later that Mrs. Saito told him the young model was a girl.
Not all Japanese are happy watching foreigners take the spotlight so often in their own commercials.
That came up recently when Jaacs, a credit card company, wanted a genuine American gas station with a bathroom, and the advertising managers approved a decision to fly to Hollywood to film.
In the commercial, an American man pulls into the station and gets out of his car, clearly in great need of a toilet, but when he looks over to the bathroom, he sees a line of five or six men, who are also waiting impatiently. He finds a Jaacs card and turns it over to the gas attendant, who calls out, "Whose Jaacs card?"
Checking their pockets and fiddling with their wallets, the men walk stiffly, uncomfortably, over to the gas attendant, while the lone man scurries into the empty bathroom.
"Most of the top executives like it now," said Toshiyasu Nakamura, who approved the commercial, which ultimately won an award. "But in the beginning, they kept asking, 'Why do we need foreigners in commercials?' "

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Talk of a Sumitomo Merger Lifts Price of Daiwa Stock

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Nov. 7

 BODY:
The shares of Daiwa Bank continued to rise today on expectations of a merger, but Japanese Finance Ministry officials were quiet about the progress of discussions.
Late last week, the ministry summoned officials of Sumitomo Bank to discuss a potential merger with Daiwa, a union that would create the world's largest bank. The discussions followed losses by Daiwa of $1.1 billion in unauthorized bond trading in New York, the expulsion of the bank from the United States, and its indictment on a variety of fraud and conspiracy charges. Daiwa is facing the threat of American fines as high as $1.3 billion. 
 Speculation about a merger sent Daiwa's shares soaring 100 yen, or 15.6 percent, on Monday. By early afternoon in Tokyo today, Daiwa's shares were up another 12 yen, at 751 yen, after trading up as much as 40 yen, or 5.4 percent, this morning.
Financial-industry executives here have been looking for clues on a possible merger from the Finance Ministry.
Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura, while not commenting specifically on the progress of talks, said Monday that Sumitomo's cooperation with Daiwa was necessary to avoid confusion in the financial markets, according to a report by the Kyodo news service.
Tatsuya Tamura, executive director of the Bank of Japan, echoed Mr. Takemura's remarks, saying that Sumitomo's support would have a "positive impact on maintaining stability in the financial system in Japan."
The central bank is considering extending loans to Daiwa to avert a possible cash shortage, Japan's leading economic daily, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, said. Japanese bankers said Daiwa has had some trouble raising funds recently.
In addition, the Bank of Japan said Monday that it would be watching Daiwa much more closely, making monthly inspections of the bank.
Some bankers remain skeptical that a merger of Daiwa and Sumitomo would take place at all, or at least soon. The chairmen of Sumitomo and Daiwa are reportedly close friends, and that friendship may have brought the two institutions together in the first place.
But Sumitomo and Daiwa need to work out the transfer of operations in the United States before they examine the broader dimensions of how a merger would take place, a Japanese banker familiar with the institutions said. The banker added: "Everyone is getting excited. But there are many obstacles."
The Nomura Securities Company, which owns 3.3 percent of Daiwa, has said that it will help Daiwa dispose of its United States operations.
For a merger, Sumitomo would need the blessing of Japanese tax authorities, as well as that of the Fair Trade Commission, the nation's weak anti-monopoly watchdog. It would also have to deal with various Daiwa executives, who might not favor having their bank disappear.
Deputy Finance Minister Kyosuke Shinozawa on Monday acknowledged some responsibility for the $1.1 billion fraud at Daiwa. He also said that the ministry would strengthen its inspection and supervisory systems for overseas branches of Japanese banks to prevent other scandals.

HEADLINE: Teacher Contract Faces Uphill Ratification Battle

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
Now that the leaders of the teachers' union have reached a tentative agreement with New York City on a new contract, they must begin their campaign to win the support of rank-and-file members like Paul Arcidiacono.
Mr. Arcidiacono, a guidance counselor at Lincoln Academy on West 60th Street in Manhattan, is disappointed that the five-year agreement provides for no raises until October 1997. As an employee for 29 years, he is also dismayed that the pact gives individual schools the option to overlook an applicant's seniority when filling a teaching vacancy. He is troubled that the contract authorizes the Board of Education to defer 5 percent of every new teacher's annual salary for four years, an incentive for new teachers to remain in the system. 
 "As it stands now, I'll vote against it," said Mr. Arcidiacono, who splits his time between Lincoln and another experimental middle school, New Direction in Harlem. "I'd have to see more of the details."
In its 35-year history, the membership of the United Federation of Teachers has never rejected a contract deal that its leaders have struck with the city. But as a vote looms later this month, the union president, Sandra Feldman, is taking nothing for granted, particularly since the early reactions she received yesterday was decidedly mixed.
"Of course, there is a great deal of disappointment, even anger, among some members about the level of the pay increase," Ms. Feldman's spokeswoman, Susan Amlung, said. "But the more we explain the other provisions in the contract, the more they like it. It is a question of information."
The dissemination of that information began last night, as Ms. Feldman met with the union's 80-member, elected executive board, to begin outlining the agreement's most attractive facets: a pledge that no member will be laid off before 1998; raises totaling 11 percent over the last three years; the elevation of the top salary in the system to $70,000 by 1999, and the abolition of administration periods, in which teachers in middle schools and high schools were tapped to patrol hallways and cafeterias.
"Considering these tough times for the city, the outcome of these talks is a positive one," Ms. Feldman said on Saturday. It is a message she is sure to repeat tomorrow, when the union's 3,000-member delegate assembly, with representatives from every school in the city, will meet in midtown Manhattan to vote on whether to recommend the contract to the rank and file.
Peter Hannon, a science teacher who is the union chapter chairman at Public School 199 on West 70th Street, said he intended to vote in favor of the contract at the meeting.
"It's a knowing trade-off," he said, adding that the two-year wage freeze was balanced by the three-year no-layoff pledge. He added that he viewed the contract's unusual length, 59 months, as an asset, "an insurance policy if the economy goes down the tubes."
That, however, is not what Bob Dehler heard as he walked the hallways yesterday at Seward Park High School on Grand Street in Manhattan.
"The money issue is the major issue teachers will have with the contract," said Mr. Dehler, an English teacher for nearly two decades who is the school's chapter chairman. "People are just saying overwhelmingly to me, 'I hope you vote against this.' "
Mr. Dehler said he planned to take their advice, in part because he was concerned that the Mayor might be unable to find the money to pay for the wage increases by the time they are scheduled to begin in 1997.
As she patrolled the cafeteria yesterday at Seward Park High, Daisy Besterman, a biology teacher, said she was eager to make better use of the one period she has spent roaming the lunchroom each day this term.
"I'm not in security," she said. "I'm a scientist."
Under the contract, Ms. Besterman would be relieved of cafeteria duty, making time for her to advise students preparing to enter projects in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search.
But as much as she said she relished such contact with budding scientists, she said was saddened that the new contract failed to raise her current annual salary, $39,600, to a level she considered equitable.
"I have two master's degrees," she said, "and there are people out there with just a B.A. making more than I am."

HEADLINE: Fred Hechinger, Education Editor and Advocate, Dies at 75

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Fred M. Hechinger, the former education editor of The New York Times whose articles, columns and books reflected his abiding concern for the impact of education on shaping individuals and the nation, died yesterday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 75.
The cause was cardiac arrest, said his wife, Grace, who often joined him in his writing, editing and research. 
 After retiring in 1990 from The Times, where he had been president of The New York Times Company Foundation and The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund since 1977, he was named a senior adviser to the Carnegie Corporation of New York. He worked at the philanthropic foundation until his death, focusing on education and youth programs.
In a career in journalism that began not long after World War II, the soft-spoken, good-humored Mr. Hechinger, who was often seen puffing on a pipe, was not only an education writer for The Times of London, The New York Herald Tribune, The Washington Post and Harper's Magazine but was also the associate publisher and executive editor of The Bridgeport (Conn.) Sunday Herald and education editor of Parents Magazine.
At The New York Times, which he joined in 1959, he originated the newspaper's special education sections, wrote on a vast spectrum of educational issues, served on the editorial board and became an assistant editor of the editorial page before heading The Times Foundation and the Neediest Cases Fund.
In one of his reports on the activities of the foundation, which supports education, journalism, the arts, community services and environmental concerns, he said the test of its success "is the impact on human lives of the dollars we are able selectively to allocate."
Summing up the foundation's mission at a time when government support was shrinking, he wrote:
"To teach children to read and the elderly to continue to learn; to provide interpreters for deaf students; to improve the condition of poor youngsters or to expand opportunities for those who have suffered discrimination; to fight against censorship; to help tiny or giant stages to let the show go on or to provide a forum for poets; to further the restoration of urban parks or the redevelopment of decaying city blocks."
Mr. Hechinger's writings covered a range of topics, from school integration and Federal school legislation to merit pay for teachers, after-school programs, teen-age delinquency, sex, free speech for students, college admissions standards, black studies programs, cram courses and overseas studies.
He was the author of "An Adventure in Education: Connecticut Points the Way" (Macmillan, 1956), "The Big Red Schoolhouse" (Doubleday, 1959) and, with his wife, "Teen-Age Tyranny" (Morrow, 1963), "The New York Times Guide to New York City Private Schools" (Simon & Schuster, 1968) and "Growing Up in America" (McGraw-Hill, 1975).
Mr. Hechinger was a founder of the Education Writers Association; twice a winner of the George Polk Memorial Award (1950 and 1951), a journalism award, and a recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal of Teachers College of Columbia University.
Fred Hechinger was born on July 7, 1920, in Nuremberg, Germany, and left the country in 1936. Arriving in the United States, he completed high school and studied nights at City College, from which he received a bachelor of arts degree. During World War II, he served in the Army in military intelligence, attached mainly to the British War Office in London.
After his discharge in 1946 as a master sergeant, he studied at the University of London before embarking on a career as a foreign correspondent, covering Europe and the Middle East for the Overseas News Agency. In 1948, he was a special consultant to the education and cultural relations division of the United States military government in Germany.
Explaining his interest in education reporting, he said, "I began to realize that a country's approach to education in general, and especially to its children, could tell more about its social, political and economic background than a whole battery of interviews with politicians."
Mr. Hechinger joined The Herald Tribune in 1950 as education editor, simultaneously serving as American correspondent for the Educational Supplement of The Times of London. In 1959, after spending three years in Bridgeport, he joined The Times.
Arthur Gelb, who worked closely with Mr. Hechinger for more than 20 years as metropolitan editor and managing editor of The Times and as Mr. Hechinger's successor as president of The Times Foundation and Neediest Cases Fund, said: "During his vigorous tenure at The Times, Fred Hechinger was the voice of wisdom, reason and conscience in the often-volatile world of education. His influence extended beyond his many articles and books, for he also served informally as a trusted adviser to public school chancellors, as well as deans and presidents of our leading universities."
In his farewell "About Education" column, written in December 1990 after three decades of assessing the good and bad in American education, Mr. Hechinger recalled his very first column in The Times, in 1959. Then he had called the nation's schoolchildren "earthbound," bemoaned the neglect of mathematics and science and called for national educational goals.
"My report of 31 years ago might suggest that little has changed," he wrote. "Americans have landed on the moon, but schools are still mired in earthbound problems, such as mastery of math and science. Junior high schools still await reform.
"Some things have grown worse, poverty, disintegrating families, drugs, violence."
He recalled, though, that he had visited many classrooms where great teachers infused their students with the joy of learning.
"But after leaving such good-news classrooms, I would think about hundreds of thousands of youngsters who are never allowed to taste such pleasures," Mr. Hechinger wrote. "Should I have ignored the bad news -- about a system that deprives the many of joy reserved for the few?
"I tried to celebrate the islands of excellence, but I could not overlook the sea of neglect and apathy that threatened to wash over them."
In addition to his wife, the former Grace Bernstein, Mr. Hechinger is survived by two sons, Paul D. Hechinger of Manhattan and John E. Hechinger of Charlotte, N.C.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
With No Data to Digest, Prices of Treasuries Slip

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Without any fresh economic data to give traders direction, Treasury prices slipped in light trading yesterday.
While some market participants sold yesterday to take profits on last week's gain, others declined to buy before knowing whether the Treasury would go ahead with a series of note auctions this week. 
 Late yesterday afternoon, the Treasury announced that it had postponed the sales of new three-year notes and 10-year notes for an indefinite period or until an agreement on the national debt limit was reached. The news of the postponement had little impact on the market. Many in the market said that Congress would have little opportunity to make progress on the debt ceiling with many Congressional leaders in Israel for the funeral of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
The uncertainty surrounding the debt limit bolstered demand at the Treasury's regular weekly auction of new three-month and six-month bills, traders said. The average rate at auction for a three-month bill was 5.36 percent, up from 5.29 percent last week, while a six-month bill was 5.29 percent, down from 5.31 percent.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 8/32 , to 10726/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its prices, rose to 6.29 percent, from 6.27 percent on Friday.
The turmoil in Washington is having little impact on the bond market over all, some traders and analysts said.
"The perception in the fixed-income market," said Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist at ASB Capital Management of Washington, "is that the fundamentals of sagging growth and waning inflation both domestically and internationally could not support for long any substantial increase in bond yields that might be linked with a budget-deficit impasse."
Mr. Carpenter also said that many in the market believed that the President and Congress were not that far apart and that there would be a budget before the end of the year.
In the futures market, trading was fairly lackluster yesterday, said Robin Mesch, a market analyst with Technical Data of Boston. "We probably will see range-trading for the early part of this week," she said.
In the municipal market, prices were slightly lower early in the session, with two of the week's largest deals priced at the outset.
Bear, Stearns & Company tentatively priced $251 million of New York State Urban Development bonds with a maximum yield of 6 percent for an issue due in 2020.
Michael S. Appelbaum, senior vice president of investment at Paine Webber, said confusion about changes in the tax laws had cheapened the municipal market to the point where tax-free bonds offered attractive yields.
"Many investors in the upper tax bracket," Mr. Appelbaum said, "may not be aware that some long-term triple-A-rated municipal issues are currently offering a 9 to 9.5 percent taxable equivalent yield."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.645	97.326	Discounted Rate	5.36%	5.29%	Coupon Yield	5.52%	5.53%	High Price	98.650	97.341	Discounted Rate	5.34%	5.26%	Coupon Yield	5.50%	5.49%	Low Price	98.643	97.326	Discounted Rate	5.37%	5.29%	Coupon Yield	5.53%	5.53%	Accepted at low price	16%	32%	Total applied for	$47,662,356	$53,730,497	Accepted	$14,639,716	$14,647,257	Noncompetitive	$1,534,868	$1,292,737	
 
Both issues are dated Nov. 9. The three-month bills mature on Feb. 8 and the six-month bills on May 9.

HEADLINE: Stocks Down in Quiet Trading, With Dow Off 11.56

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market fell yesterday in quiet trading, ending a three-session advance to record highs.
Technology stocks, which had surged recently, were in the forefront of the retreat, after Goldman, Sachs & Company removed Microsoft from its list of recommended stocks. 
 "Stocks didn't get a follow-through from last week," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist of Salomon Brothers. "Stocks have been running with bonds and bonds were weak." Last week, the stock market had its biggest weekly percentage gain in about four months.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 11.56 points, to 4,814.01, after setting a high of 4,825.57 on Friday. Among the broader indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 2.11 points, to 588.46, and the Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology issues, dropped 3.52 points, to 1,062.14.
Declines exceeded advances on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,162 t0 1,071. Big Board trading was thin, with 309.1 million shares changing hands, compared with 345.5 million shares Friday.
Unusually heavy daily merger and acquisition activity caught the market's attention yesterday. International Paper agreed to buy Federal Paper Board. Shares of Federal Paper jumped 6 1/2, to 52. International Paper shares dropped 1, to 36 1/8.
Sherwin-Williams said that it would buy Pratt & Lambert, sending Pratt & Lambert's stock up 67 percent, or, 13 7/8. to 34 3/4. Sherwin-Williams slipped 1/8, to 37 1/2.
And First Interstate spurned a bid from Wells Fargo to announce a merger with First Bank Systems. First Interstate slipped 1, to 126 7/8, after earlier rising as much as 2, to 129 3/4.
Technology stocks followed Microsoft lower. Microsoft dropped 2 1/8, to 97 3/8; Intel fell 111/16 , to 7013/16 ; I.B.M. declined 1, to 100 1/2; Micron gave up 3 3/4, to 64 1/2, and Texas In-struments plunged 3, to 62 1/2.
With the uncertainty over the Federal budget, utility issues were soft. Con Edison closed at 29 7/8, down 1/2; Pacific Gas and Electric closed at 29 1/2, down 1/8, and Unicom closed at 32 7/8, down 5/8.
The Dow Jones transportation averge rallied 19.50 points to a new high of 2,010.45, spurred by an announcement by Roadway Services that it plans to sell its money-losing air-freight unit. Roadway increased 4, to 50 1/4, while Delta Air Lines advanced 5/8, to 70 1/8, and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 1 1/4, to 72.
A number of retail stocks also gained amid reports that their shares were oversold. May Department Stores closed at 41 3/4, up 1 3/8; Toys "R" Us closed at 24 1/8, up 1 1/8, and Dillard closed at 29 1/4, up 5/8. However, Circuit City fell 2 1/4, to 30 1/2, and CompUSA dropped 2 1/4, to 36 7/8.
Two of the Big Three auto makers pushed higher on what some analysts said were expectations of stronger economic growth. General Motors advanced 1, to 44 7/8, and Ford Motor rose 1/8, to 28 3/4. But Chrysler dropped 1/2, to 50 1/4.
McAfee Associates, which introduced a virus protection program that stops users from downloading infected software from the Internet, jumped 3 3/4, to 46 3/4. And McDonnell Douglas, which received an $18 billion order for C-17 military transport planes, surged 1 3/8, to 86 1/8.

HEADLINE: Citing Debt Impasse, Treasury Drops Plan For Selling Securities

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
The Government today postponed the $31.5 billion in borrowing it had planned for this week because President Clinton and Congressional Republicans failed to agree on raising the $4.9 trillion debt limit.
The Treasury Department had announced tentative plans last week to sell $18 billion in three-year notes on Tuesday and $13.5 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday to pay off maturing securities and replenish Government coffers. 
 But the deputy assistant Treasury secretary, Darcy E. Bradbury, had warned that the schedule would have to be changed if there was no assurance of final action on the debt limit by today.
The Government must pay about $25 billion in interest to holders of securities by mid-November. If the debt ceiling impasse is not settled by then, the United States could default on its obligations for the first time in history.
But Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, said on Sunday that he believed that Congress would increase the ceiling. And the House Republican leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, predicted action by Congress by the end of the week.
Before raising the limit, Republicans want the President to accept their blueprint for balancing the budget in seven years. The Administration wants Congress to increase the limit to $5.5 trillion while negotiations over broader tax and spending issues continue.
Republicans contend that a default would pose no serious risk to the nation's finances. They dismiss warnings that interest rates on Treasury securities would soar.

HEADLINE: ASSASINATION IN ISRAEL;
Words of Grief and Resolve From Friends and World Leaders

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks by foreign leaders and friends at Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in Jerusalem yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times and the Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription service. The speeches by Acting Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Eitan Haber were translated from the Hebrew by The Times and by official translators.
 
PRESIDENT CLINTON
To all the people of Israel, the American people mourn with you in the loss of your leader. And I mourn with you, for he was my partner and friend. 
 Every moment we shared was a joy because he was a good man, and an inspiration because he was also a great man.
Leah, I know that too many times in the life of this country, you were called upon to comfort and console the mothers and the fathers, the husbands and the wives, the sons and the daughters who lost their loved ones to violence and vengeance. You gave them strength. Now, we here and millions of people all around the world, in all humility and honor, offer you our strength. May God comfort you among all the mourners of Zion and to Israel.
Yitzhak Rabin lived the history of Israel through every trial and triumph, the struggle for independence, the wars for survival, the pursuit of peace and all he served on the front lines. This son of David and of Solomon took up arms to defend Israel's freedom and laid down his life to secure Israel's future. He was a man completely without pretense, as all of his friends knew.
I read that in 1949, after the War of Independence, David Ben-Gurion sent him to represent Israel at the armistice talks at Rhodes, and he had never before worn a necktie and did not know how to tie the knot. So, the problem was solved by a friend who tied it for him before he left and showed him how to preserve the knot simply by loosening the tie and pullin it over his head.
Well, the last time we were together, not two weeks ago, he showed up for a black tie event on time, but without the black tie.
And so, he borrowed a tie. And I was privileged to straighten it for him. It is a moment I will cherish as long as I live.
To him, ceremonies and words were less important than actions and deeds. Six weeks ago, the King and President Mubarak will remember, we were at the White House for signing the Israel-Palestinian agreement and a lot of people spoke. I spoke. The King spoke. Chairman Arafat spoke. President Mubarak spoke. Our Foreign Ministers all spoke. And finally, Prime Minister Rabin gotup to speak and he said, "First, the good news. I am the last speaker."
But he also understood the power of words and symbolism. Take a look at the stage he set in Washington -- the King of Jordan, the President of Egypt, Chairman Arafat, and us, the Prime Minister, and Foreign Minister of Israel on one platform.
"Please take a good hard look. The sight you see before you was impossible, was unthinkable just three years ago. Only poets dreamt of it and to our great pain, soldier and civilian went to their deaths to make this moment possible" -- those were his words.
Today, my fellow citizens of the world, I ask all of you to take a good hard look at this picture. Look at the leaders from all over the Middle East and around the world who have journeyed here today for Yitzhak Rabin and for peace. Though we no longer hear his deep and booming voice, it is he who has brought us together again here, in word and deed, for peace.
Now it falls to all of us who love peace and all of us who loved him to carry on the struggle to which he gave life and for which he gave his life. He cleared the path. And his spirit continues to light the way. His spirit lives on in the growing peace between Israel and her neighbors. It lives in the eyes of the children, the Jewish and the Arab children, who are leaving behind a past of fear for a future of hope. It lives on in the promise of true security.
So, let me say to the people of Israel: Even in your hour of darkness, his spirit lives on, and so you must not lose your spirit. Look at what you have accomplished making a once barren desert bloom, building a thriving democracy in a hostile terrain, winning battles and wars and now winning the peace, which is the only enduring victory.
Your Prime Minister was a martyr for peace, but he was a victim of hate. Surely, we must learn from his martyrdom that if people cannot let go of the hatred of their enemies, they risk sowing the seeds of hatred among themselves.
I ask you, the people of Israel, on behalf of my nation that knows its own long litany of loss -- from Abraham Lincoln to President Kennedy to Martin Luther King -- do not let that happen to you. In the Knesset, in your homes, in your places of worship, stay the righteous course.
As Moses said to the children of Israel when he knew he would not cross over into the Promised Land: "Be strong and of good courage. Fear not, for God will go with you. He will not fail you. He will not forsake you."
President Weizman, Acting Prime Minister Peres, to all the people of Israel, as you stay the course of peace, I make this pledge: Neither will America forsake you.
Legend has it that in every generation of Jews from time immemorial, a just leader emerged to protect his people and show them the way to safety. Prime Minister Rabin was such a leader.
He knew, as he declared to the world on the White House lawn two years ago, that the time had come, in his words, "to begin a new reckoning in the relations between people, between parents tired of war, between children who will not know war."
Here in Jerusalem, I believe with perfect faith that he was leading his people to that Promised Land.
This week, Jews all around the world are studying the Torah portion in which God tests the faith of Abraham, Patriarch of the Jews and the Arabs. He commands Abraham to sacrifice Yitzhak, "Take your son, the one you love, Yitzhak."
As we all know, as Abraham in loyalty to God was about to kill his son, God spared Yitzhak. Now, God tests our faith even more terribly, for he has taken our Yitzhak.
But Israel's covenant with God -- for freedom, for tolerance, for security, for peace -- that covenant must hold. That covenant was Prime Minister Rabin's life's work, now we must make it his lasting legacy. His spirit must live on in us.
 
SHIMON PERES OF ISRAEL
 We have not come to seal this tomb, we have come to salute you, Yitzhak, for what you were. You were a courageous fighter who brought victories for your people, a great dreamer who forged a new reality in our region. Last Saturday night, we joined hands and sang the song of peace together and I could feel your uplifted spirits.
You told me that there were warnings of a planned attempt against your life during this large rally. We did not know who would attack. We did not anticipate that the damage would be so great. But we knew that we could not fear death and that we could not hesitate in our effort to achieve peace.
One day earlier we met, as was our custom, face to face. For the first time you pointed out to me that the work was exhausting, but that the peace was overriding.
I was aware of your tremendous restraint and therefore also of your refusal to be caught up in the fanfare, even in that of peace. I was also aware of your great wisdom and from that stemmed your cautiousness about not revealing things before their time. These are characteristics of a leader, and that is what you were from the time you reached adulthood, a daring leader in the forward command posts of Israel's battlefields, and a great leader in the struggle for peace in the Middle East. Being a leader is not amusing, and you weren't necessarily a person who was easily amused. Seriousness became your second nature and responsibility was your first nature. That combination made you into a rare leader, able to move mountains and to pave roads, able to set a goal and to achieve it.
I did not know that these were the last hours of the cooperation between us -- a cooperation that knew no limits. I felt as if some distant grace fell upon you and you were suddenly able to breathe easily at the sight of the sea of friends who came to support the path you had chosen and congratulate you for it. The summit to which you led us broadened, and from it we could view the new tomorrow, the vision of the future promised to the new generation of Israeli youth.
Yitzhak, the youngest among Israel's generals, Yitzhak the greatest of Israel's peacemakers, the suddenness of your departure shed light on your many deeds. You were unlike anyone else, nor did you want to imitate anyone. You were not a jolly sort. You demanded a lot, first of all from yourself and therefore also from your fellow men.
You did not accept failure, nor were you afraid of successes. You knew every detail, and you saw the big picture. And each of the details remained beside you throughout the entire process, and that led to great decisions and intense activity.
You promised to change the orders of priority, and indeed a new order emerged. Priorities encouraging development were adopted. Junctions were opened, roads were paved. Unemployment dropped, waves of immigration were absorbed. Production grew, investments increased. The education budget doubled and science was promoted.
 Above all, perhaps as the basis for it all, strong winds of peace began to blow. Two agreements with our Palestinian neighbors were achieved. I saw how much the Palestinian people and their leaders -- who are represented here -- were moved. These two agreements will enable them to hold democratic elections and they will enable us to free ourselves from the necessity of ruling another nation, just as you promised...
Leah is at this time without you, but the entire nation is with her and the family. I see our people very distressed, a nation with tears in their eyes. The nation also knows that the bullet that murdered you cannot and will not kill the ideas you advocated.
You did not leave us a will, but you left us a path which we will follow with determination and faith. The nation is crying. I hope these will be tears for unity, tears for peace among us, and peace with our neighbors.
I see our Arab neighbors, and I would like to say to them that the peace is irreversible for both of us. None of us can stop, postpone or hesitate about peace, which must be comprehensive and inclusive of old and young.
From here, Yitzhak, in Jerusalem where you were born, where the three greatest religions in history were founded, let us quote the words of our matriarch Rachel, whose death occurred on the same date on which you fell: Keep thy voice from weeping, and thy eyes from tears, for thy work shall be rewarded and there is hope for thy future, said the Lord.
 Goodbye, my eldest brother, the bringer of peace. We will add and continue to carry this peace, for near and far, that you wanted and expected in your life and death.
 
EITAN HABER, SPEECHWRITER
 Yitzhak, this is the final speech. There will not be another one. For a whole generation, more than 35 years, you were my teacher, counselor, and leader. You were my father. You were asked to sing a song of peace just five minutes before this inhuman person shot you; and you were given a piece of paper with the words of the song written down on it.
Once again, you sang off key. Afterward, you folded the paper carefully in four, and at the end of the rally inserted it, as always, into the pocket of your jacket.
Your blood oozed onto that piece of paper and covered the words of the song of peace on that lyric sheet.
Your blood cries out to us from that sheet. I ask to read the lyrics of a song that could have been written yesterday, after you sang there and after they shot you. This is that sheet of paper:
Let the sun rise, the morning shine,
 The most righteous prayer will not bring us back.
 Who is the one whose light has been extinguished,
 And buried in the earth;
 Bitter tears will not wake him, will not bring him back.
 No song of praise or victory will avail us.
 Therefore, sing only a song of peace.
 Don't whisper a prayer --
sing aloud a song of peace.
Yitzhak we miss you.
 
KING HUSSEIN OF JORDAN
 My friends, I had never thought that the moment would come, like this, when I would grieve the loss of a brother, a colleague and a friend, a man, a soldier, whom I trust on the opposite side of a divide, whom I respected as he respected us -- a man I came to know because I realized as he did, that we have to cross over the divide, establish a dialogue, get to know each other and strive to leave for those who follow us a legacy that is worthy of them. And so we did. And so we became brethren and friends.
I've never been used to standing, except with you next to me, speaking of peace, speaking of our dreams and the hopes of generations to come that must live in peace, enjoy human dignity, come together, work together to build a better future, which is our right.
Never in all my thoughts did it occur to me that my first visit to Jerusalem in response to your invitation, and the invitation of the Speaker of the Knesset, at the invitation of the President of Israel, would be on such an occasion.
You lived as a soldier, you died as a soldier for peace.
And I believe it is time for all of us to come out openly and to speak of peace. Not here today, but for all the times to come. We belong to the camp of peace. We believe in peace. We believe that our one God wishes us to live in peace, and wishes peace upon us, for these are his teachings to all the followers of the three great monotheistic religions, the children of Abraham.
Let's not keep silent. Let our voices rise high to speak of our commitment to peace for all times to come. And let us tell those who live in darkness, who are the enemies of life, and through faith and religion and the teachings of our one God, this is where we stand. This is our camp. Maybe God will bless you with the realization that you must join it, and we'll pray that He will. But otherwise, we are not ashamed, nor are we afraid, nor are we anything but determined to continue the legacy for which my friend fell, as did my grandfather in this very city when I was with him and but a boy.
He was man of courage ... and he was endowed with one of the greatest virtues that any man can have. He was endowed with humility. He felt, with those around him, an evolution of responsibility. He placed himself, as I do, and have done often, in the place of the other partner to achieve a worthy goal. And we achieved peace, an honorable peace and a lasting peace.
He had courage, he had vision and he had a commitment to peace. And standing here, I commit before you, before my people in Jordan, before the world, myself to continue to do my utmost to insure that we leave a similar legacy. And when my time comes, I hope it will be like my grandfather's and like Yitzhak Rabin's.
For his spirit -- and I try and make sense for the people of Jordan, my family, the people of Israel -- decent people throughout the world feel today. So many live and so many inevitably die. This is the will of God, this is the way of all, but those are fortunate and lucky in life, those who are great are those who leave something behind and you are such a man, my friend.
The places in my country, among the majority of our people, and our armed forces and people who once were your enemies are somber today and their hearts are heavy. Let's hope and pray that God will give us all guidance, each in his respective position, to do what he can for the better future that Yitzhak Rabin sought with determination and courage.
 
PRESIDENT MUBARAK OF EGYPT
 It is with deep regret that we assemble here today to pay our last respects to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a courageous leader and a recognized statesman. His earnest efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East are a testament to his vision -- which we share -- to end the suffering of all the peoples of our region.
He defied the prejudices of the past to tackle the most complicated of problems, namely, the Palestinian problem, in a forthright manner. The success he achieved in this regard has firmly laid the foundations of peaceful coexistence between Palestinians and the Israelis in a climate of trust and mutual respect. These achievements have undoubtedly established him as a true hero of peace.
The untimely loss of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin at this important juncture in the history of the Middle East has dealt a severe blow to our noble cause. We must, therefore, redouble our efforts and reaffirm our obligation to continue the sacred mission to achieve a just and lasting peace.
We must deprive those treacherous hands, hostile toward our goal, from reaping the rewards of their vile actions. Only through our unwavering commitment to this objective can we truly honor the memory of this fallen hero of peace.
And I could say that the best memorial for Yitzhak Rabin is to continue what he started, which is the peace process. For as we mentioned several times, peace is so precious for the whole people all over the world.
On this sad occasion, ladies and gentlemen, I extend the condolences of the people and the Government of Egypt and my personal condolences to the Government and the people of Israel and the family of Mr. Yitzhak Rabin.

HEADLINE: A U.S. Role In Bosnia May Hinder Recruiters

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: OTTUMWA, Iowa

 BODY:
Sgt. Charlie Pomykaj, burly in his khaki shirt and blue trousers with a red stripe down the legs, looks every ounce the Marine Corps recruiter as he works a crowd of high school students on lunch break outside class here, offering college tuition, technical skills and exotic foreign adventures to anyone who enlists.
But one adventure Sergeant Pomykaj is not mentioning is Bosnia. 
 Most people here are opposed to President Clinton's proposal to send 20,000 American troops to help keep peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and recruiters say they fear that their sales pitches may fall on deaf ears if teen-agers or their parents think a recruit will end up in the middle of ethnic bloodshed that seems to go on forever.
"If it's seen as senseless, like Somalia, and if it's not supported in the community, then, of course, it'll trickle down to the kids," said Sergeant Pomykaj, 28, who was a weather technician in the Persian Gulf war.
The prospect of American troops in Bosnia has not hurt recruiting so far, military officials say. But recruiting is a volatile business in the best of times. Success depends on elusive perceptions about the vitality of the armed forces as well as their missions.
In the gulf war, young men and women flocked to recruiting centers. But the debacle in Somalia, where 18 American soldiers were killed while fighting in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, on Oct. 3, 1993, had the opposite effect. And of late, recruiters have had a hard enough time persuading the public that the shrinking Pentagon budget does not translate into fewer new openings or opportunities for advancement in the armed forces.
It is not just Marine Corps recruiters who express concern over a potential mission in Bosnia.
"If we go over there and there are casualties, we'll be hurting in recruiting," said Capt. Harry Meyer, who heads the Army's recruiting efforts in south-central Iowa. "We'll have to overcome objections from parents who will ask, 'Will my son or daughter have to go to Bosnia?' "
Residents of this city of 25,000 people 75 miles southeast of Des Moines, once one of the biggest meat-packing centers in Iowa, say they favor the military and are very patriotic.
The military has not had a visible presence here since 1947, when the Navy closed an air station on the edge of town where a young lieutenant named Richard M. Nixon served briefly in World War II. But memories of yellow ribbons and prayers for sons and daughters in the gulf war remain vivid.
Bosnia, though, is different.
"The calls are 95 percent against our going into Bosnia," said Dave Michaels, the program director of radio station KLEE-AM. "Lots of people are comparing it to Vietnam."
To be sure, many people here have not focused on Bosnia. In the malls, high schools and community colleges where Sergeant Pomykaj scours every day for potential marines, other matters are more important.
"Right now, the fact that the girls' volleyball team is in the state tournament is a greater news item than Bosnia," said Cliff Vande Wall, a guidance counselor at Oskaloosa High School, just up the road from Ottumwa.
But recruiters fear that Bosnia lies just beneath the surface.
The last few years have been hard for military recruiters. Military surveys show that the percentage of 16- to 21-year-old men who are inclined to enlist is steadily dropping. The Air Force barely made its recruiting requirement this year, reaching the mark only on Sept. 30, the last day of the 1995 fiscal year. About 96 percent of the new recruits are high school graduates, but that is down from 99 percent in 1992.
And the armed forces are still fighting the perception that they are no longer hiring. While the Defense Department thins its middle and higher ranks, it still needs to sign up tens of thousands of new troops each year to maintain the proper proportion. This is even more important as the military's drawdown nears an end. The Army alone has to recruit 68,000 people for its enlisted ranks this year.
To help remedy these problems, the Pentagon has increased its advertising budget for recruiting this year to $207 million from $112.5 million in 1993, and is assigning more people to recruiting duty.
"A lot of people don't know that the drawdown is over," said Staff Sgt. Jim Bonynge, Sergeant Pomykaj's supervisor who oversees Marine recruiting in 20 counties in south-central Iowa from his office in Des Moines.
Even without Bosnia, the Midwest is a tough sell for the Marines. The 11-state Marine Corps district, based in Kansas City, ranked last out of six Marine recruiting districts nationwide, signing up only 74 percent of its goal in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
Marine officials say the district's location, landlocked and 850 miles from the nearest Marine base, at Quantico, Va., does not help. Low unemployment and the tendency for many high school graduates to sign up for college instead of the military also pose challenges.
Another hurdle lies in the rolling fields of corn and soybeans. Most farms have been in families for generations, and many fathers are not about to let their strapping young sons join what the Marines call "America's 911 force" when the annual harvest is at stake.
New American military missions in places like Haiti, Somalia and Rwanda also give pause to parents whose consent is required for recruits under 18 years of age.
"Parents ask, 'Will Johnny or Suzy go to war?' " said Sergeant Bonynge, who served in Beirut and was a helicopter mechanic in the gulf war. "They think the Marine Corps and the first to fight, but we have jobs in administration and accounting, too."
One angry parent or a hostile high school guidance counselor can ruin Sergeant Pomykaj's yearly goal to sign up at least 24 new marines.
At Indian Hills Community College, Sergeant Pomykaj strikes up a conversation with anyone who meets his recruiting standard: physically fit, decent grades and no problems with drugs or the law. And at Ottumwa High School, he sets his sights on the school's 180 male seniors. But he will talk to any of the school's 1,410 students -- by phone, at home or in his office at a nearby shopping mall.
Potential recruits have mixed feelings about Bosnia. "A lot of us think we should go in and help stop the killing," said David Gordy, 16, a member of Ottumwa High's Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, "but others are opposed to it altogether because Americans will die."
Older recruiters remember other unpopular missions -- like Beirut, where 241 marines, members of a multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon, were killed when their barracks were destroyed by a terrorist's bomb on Oct. 23, 1983.
"As Beirut dragged on, the parents just said, 'No,' " said Col. Pat Donahue, executive officer of the Midwest recruiting district that includes Iowa. "Those kind of political things started showing up on the evening news and pulled the parents away. That's what Bosnia would do."

Charlie Pomykaj, a Marine Corps recruiter, strolled outside Ottumwa High School in Iowa last month as he tried to fill his annual goal of signing up at least 24 new marines. But the prospect of the recruits' serving as peacekeepers in Bosnia may make his job more difficult. (Todd Buchanan for The New York Times)

Seeking to improve relations with Cuban exiles it once derided as "worms" and "counterrevolutionaries," the Cuban Government announced measures today that could make it easier for them to invest on the island.
Under the new regulations, announced by Roberto Robaina, Cuba's Foreign Minister, the 1.2 million Cubans living abroad will be able to apply for travel documents, renewable every two years, that will allow them to enter and leave the country as many times as they like. 
 While details remain to be worked out, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said that all persons of Cuban descent would presumably be eligible for the new system, including those traveling on foreign passports and those who left the country "illegally."
The measures were announced at the end of a Government-sponsored conference, "The Nation and Migration," with 357 invited members of the emigre community, increasingly being courted as a source of capital and investment.
Cuban-Americans returning to visit relatives have long criticized cumbersome and costly bureaucratic procedures that ignore their American citizenship and treat them as Cuban nationals. The issue had been raised repeatedly at an earlier meeting last year, and Cuban officials describe the changes as an effort to advance the "normalization" of their relationship with the emigre community.
Many participants also complained of efforts by the Clinton Administration to prevent them from attending the conference, scheduled to end tonight with a reception at the Palace of the Revolution. Washington, they said, has refused to authorize the special license that would have exempted them from the longstanding American embargo on trade and travel to Cuba.
The Clinton Administration in recent months has endorsed "people-to-people" contact between Americans and Cubans as a way of fomenting political changes here, and many of those attending the conference said they were here with just that intention. Though denied the license, they were still able to take advantage of new regulations that allow Cuban-Americans to visit the island once a year for emergency humanitarian reasons, such as a family illness.
No conferee has drawn more attention than Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, founder of the Miami-based exile group Cambio Cubano, or Cuban Change. A former guerrilla leader who helped overthrow the Batista dictatorship in 1959, Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo later broke with Mr. Castro, spent 22 years in prison here, and now argues that dialogue between exiles and the Cuban Government offers the only peaceful solution to the country's crisis.
Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo visited here in June and met with Mr. Castro, the two men talked again in New York last month. Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo identified himself openly here as an opponent of Mr. Castro, and has used the conference as a platform to press for political reforms and to criticize official Cuban Government positions on human rights.
Reacting, for example, to the emphasis that Mr. Robaina, the Foreign Minister, placed on the United States' economic embargo of Cuba in the opening speech of the conference, Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo told reporters that actually "there are two embargoes, one American and one Cuban." An important factor that "contributes to the distance" between Cubans in the United States and those on the island, he said, is "the lack of information and freedom of expression" here.
In a speech delivered in the presence of Cuban officials, but which has not yet been reported by the Government-run television or in the newspapers, Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo urged the Cuban Government not to fear "the possibility of a multiparty scenario." He also called for a national assembly to write a new constitution, noting that "under the pretext of defending the nation from external aggression, a citizen today can turn to no organism to denounce an abuse of which he has been the victim."

HEADLINE: SNAPSHOT;
On the Ballot Today

 BODY:
A roundup of the most important elections taking place today.
 
GOVERNOR
 
KENTUCKY: The Republican candidate for governor, Larry Forgy, is a conservative, wealthy lawyer. He has campaigned against abortion, for lower taxes and for a revision of the Kentucky Education Reform Law of 1990, which changed schools to put greater emphasis on writing and group work.
The Democrat, Lieut. Gov. Paul Patton, is a former operator of a coal mine. The issues on which he has based his campaign include a policy of fostering economic development and modest changes in taxes and education.
 
MISSISSIPPI: Gov. Kirk Fordice, a Republican, is seeking reelection, campaigning on the addition of 115,000 jobs in the state during his administration. He is also seeking a 10 percent cut in the state income tax over three years.
The Democrat, Dick Molpus, has been Secretary of State for 12 years. He has also raised tax cuts as an issue, pusch for a 50 percent cut in taxes on groceries. The other major campaign issue has a dispute with Mr. Fordice over his mockery of Mr. Molpus's wife.
 
STATE LEGISLATURES
 
MAINE: Two special elections to fill vacancies in the state House will determine whether Republicans gain control in the lower chamber for the first time in two decades. Because of the two House vacancies, they have a temporary majority. In the Senate, Republicans hold a slight majority, which they are expected to keep.
 
MISSISSIPPIANS: Mississippians, who have increasingly voted Republican in national and Congressional elections, continue to favor the Democratic Party for the state legislature. Republicans are hoping to narrow the 34-to-18 Democratic edge in the state Senate by winning four open seats and upsetting several longtime incumbents. But they are not expected to win control of the Senate and face even larger odds in the House, which is overwhelmingly Democratic.
 
NEW JERSEY: Residents will vote on candidates for all 80 seats in the General Assembly, and Republicans are hoping to expand on their current 53-to-27 majority. The race has attracted much interest in Washington, since national Republicans regard the state Republicans' sweep of the Assembly and Senate in 1991 - followed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's victory in 1993 - as forerunners of the Gingrich revolution of 1994.
 
VIRIGINA: After electing a Republican governor in 1993, Virginia could be the first state in the old South to elect a Republican Legislature since Reconstruction. While the Democrats still hold majorities in both the 40-seat Senate and the 100-member House of Delegates, Republicans need to gain only three seats in each house to have a majority.
 
STATE PROPOSALS
 
MAINE: An anti-gay-rights measure and a requirementing that adults wear seat belts.
 
MINNESOTA: A St. Paul requirement that companies getting government aid to favor city residents in hiring and pay them hourly "living wage" of $7.21.
 
MISSISSIPPI: A limit of two consecutive terms for most elected and appointed state and local offices.
 
OHIO: A requirement that the governor consult the parole board before cutting prison sentences.
 
PENNSYLVANIA: Whether children can testify by videotape or television at trials.
 
TEXAS: Abolition of the state treasurer's office and give duties to comptroller.
 
WASHINGTON: Allowing slot machines and video poker at American Indian-run casinos and share profits annually with registered voters.

HEADLINE: ASSASSINATION IN ISRAEL: THE POLITICS;
Israel's Leader Declines to Call Early Elections

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Israel's Acting Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, said today that he would not call national elections quickly, a step that would have taken advantage of the wave of sympathy aroused by the assassination of his predecessor Yitzhak Rabin.
In so doing he insured that the furious maneuvering and mutual recriminations that began as soon as Mr. Rabin's body was laid to rest would continue until the elections scheduled for next November. 
 Some Labor Party politicians had urged Mr. Peres to hold elections as early as possible -- while the conservative Likud bloc was under fire from a public repelled by the killing of Mr. Rabin by a right-wing militant and while the Government's policies benefited from the aura of Mr. Rabin's martyrdom.
Israeli law requires 100 days notice, so an election could be held in late February. But Mr. Peres said he would wait until the current term runs out next November, as Mr. Rabin had intended to do.
Although Mr. Peres gave no immediate explanation for his decision, members of his party said he wanted to use the next year to guide the already planned Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, to establish his own credentials as a worthy successor to Mr. Rabin and to broaden the Labor coalition's political base.
Colleagues also said that Mr. Peres did not want to win an election under the mantle of his old rival, Mr. Rabin.
For now, his main opponent, Binyamin Netanyahu, leader of the rightist Likud bloc, is on the defensive. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the sharpest accusations against the right, and especially against Mr. Netanyahu, came from no less than Mr. Rabin's widow, Leah. She demonstratively snubbed Mr. Netanyahu at the funeral and, in interview after interview, blamed the right for creating the climate of division and hate that inspired Mr. Rabin's killer.
"Yes, surely I blame, surely I blame them," she said on the ABC News program "Good Morning America." "If you ever heard their speeches at the Knesset, you would understand what I mean. They were very, very violent in their expressions -- 'We are selling the country down the drain, there will be no Israel after this peace agreement.' I mean this was wild."
Mrs. Rabin's charges, during the traditional weeklong period of mourning, were striking proof that the bitterness over the fundamental issue of Mr. Rabin's peace with the Palestinians had not been soothed by his death.
On the left, even those who did not go as far as Mrs. Rabin in accusing the right still said that the huge turnout of mourners was proof of wide national support for his policy of making peace with the Palestinians. "This was the real referendum," declared Shevach Weiss, the Speaker of Parliament, countering Likud demands for a national referendum on the agreements.
For the time being, Mr. Netanyahu could do little but issue statements rejecting what he called "cynical incitement," while his lieutenants countered that the left was no less responsible for the bitterness of the division than the right. Putting the blame on the Likud for the murder, Mr. Netanyahu said, "was like asking whether Lee Harvey Oswald was a Republican or a Democrat and then blaming that party."
There was no doubt that the accusations would pursue him throughout the campaign, and that Likud's main political weapon, its opposition to Mr. Rabin's policies, was badly blunted.
Still, politicians on both sides agreed that Mr. Netanyahu was down, but far from out. For one thing, the passions aroused by the assassination would fade over a year's time, or could be supplanted by others.
"How long can this defensiveness last?" asked a Western diplomat. "It sounds cynical, but it could be to the next suicide bombing."
Such terrorist attacks in the past have all been followed by calls for tough measures against the Palestinians and a suspension of peace talks.
There was also Mr. Netanyahu himself, a tough and savvy politician who gained global exposure as Israel's chief delegate to the United Nations during the Persian Gulf war and is regarded as a master of the television sound bite.
"A year is a very long time," said Zalman Shoval, former Ambassador to Washington and head of foreign relations in the Likud. "People will not go back to normal, but hopefully Israelis will get back to what decisions should be based on."
In Israel, that means the disposition of the West Bank and the Golan Heights, areas that Israel occupied in 1967 and that Mr. Rabin was prepared to cede, at least in part, in exchange for peace.
The dispute is at the heart of the rift in Israeli society, pitting those who believe that the West Bank is an inherent and indivisible part of the Land of Israel, the biblical provinces of Judea and Samaria, against those who believe that Israel can only become secure and whole when it ends the occupation.
It is this issue, above all others, that determines the political spectrum in Israel: to be against ceding the lands is to be on the right, to seek a rapid withdrawal from all the lands is to be on the left.
The 1993 agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization turned the national debate into a national conflict. Jewish settlers in the West Bank turned to increasingly violent protests, and their supporters in Israel intensified their invective.
Mr. Rabin was the military commander in the 1967 war when the West Bank was seized, and Prime Minister in 1993 when he shook hands with the P.L.O. leader, Yasir Arafat, and agreed to a phased lifting of Israeli control over the Palestinians.
His 1967 exploits gave him the credibility to launch a process that many Israelis opposed, and many more feared. That was what turned the extreme right against him so bitterly and, many now say, led to his death. And that was what brought so many world leaders to his funeral, and prompted so many, from President Clinton to King Hussein of Jordan, to urge the Israelis not to abandon the course that Mr. Rabin set.
There was no chance that the course would change quickly. The primary architect of the peace agreements on the Israeli side had been Mr. Peres, who immediately made clear he would keep the course.
The immediate political challenge was to Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud, damaged by the accusations of having incited the assassination. But the battle in the next election, as always here, would be for the wavering center and there Mr. Peres had his own problems. Many commentators say it would be Mr. Peres's success in reaching into that center that would determine the outcome.
The perceived martyrdom of Mr. Rabin in the cause of peace seemed certain to sway many undecided Israelis toward Labor.
"In his death, Rabin's purpose and vision have taken on a much greater meaning and significance for Israeli people than in his life," the diplomat said. "What he was doing was controversial in life, but in his death the response is that this was a peace worth pursuing."
The smoothness of the transition and the general acceptance that Mr. Peres, who shared much of Mr. Rabin's liberal ideology, was the undisputed successor to Mr. Rabin, gave the new Prime Minister a clear legitimacy to lead the left wing in the next election. The challenge for Mr. Peres was to harness those feelings while avoiding the perception that he was trying to cash in on tragedy.
Mr. Peres's greatest handicap was that although he was respected for his intellect and his achievements, he never enjoyed Mr. Rabin's popularity as a war hero and plainspoken politician, and he was generally seen to be far more conciliatory to the Arabs than the Prime Minister. So one challenge facing him over the next 12 months will be to solidify his standing with the center.
The first sign of Mr. Peres's intentions will be revealed when he chooses a new Cabinet. Under Israeli law, the current Government automatically resigned with Mr. Rabin's death, but all factions in the Parliament have agreed not to oppose Mr. Peres as successor.
The wild cards in the Labor lineup are three younger politicians widely regarded as the next generation. First among them is Ehud Barak, 53, the Interior Minister, who until 10 months ago was the Army Chief of Staff. Mr. Barak combines charisma and a military background, which is highly esteemed in Israel, and he is considered tougher on defense issues than Mr. Peres.
Mr. Peres is expected to appoint him Defense Minister, a post Mr. Rabin held. Such a choice would make the Government more acceptable to the center, but the disadvantage is that it would effectively proclaim Mr. Barak as the heir apparent to the Labor party leadership, a move that would antagonize many members of the generation between Mr. Peres and Mr. Barak, men in their late 50's and early 60's who believe their turn is next.
Also in the wings is Haim Ramon, 45, the leader of the Histadrut labor movement. Attractive and popular, Mr. Ramon broke with Labor last year, but he is widely thought to be awaiting an opening to return, albeit with his own conditions. One of them would be a visible post, which could be the Interior Ministry if Mr. Barak is moved to Defense.
Finally there is Yossi Beilin, the Economics Minister, a protege of Mr. Peres who is close to him in outlook. Mr. Peres may put Mr. Beilin in the Foreign Ministry, where he was once Mr. Peres's deputy. But Mr. Beilin is regarded as one of the most liberal of Cabinet members, and his promotion would not serve to broaden the Government's appeal.
Mr. Peres is also expected to try to broaden his government by bringing in two small religious parties that Mr. Rabin had kept out, Shas and Agudat Yisrael. Unlike Mr. Rabin, who had few contacts with religious politicians, Mr. Peres has maintained good ties with them. That would help free him from the handicap Mr. Rabin had in the Parliament, where his peace deal with the P.L.O. was approved by a single vote.

". . . And the Road Ahead for the Government"
 
1 -- Mandatory Cabinet resignations
Under Israeli law, immediately on Prime Minister Yizhak Rabin's death, his Cabinet was automatically deemed to have resigned, and stayed on as interim Government. As the senior Cabinet member, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres assumed the duties of Prime Minster until the Cabinet met to confirm him as Acting Prime Minster.
 
2 -- President asks a member to form a new government
To form the next government, President Ezer Weizman, after consulting with Parliament representatives, is to ask a member of Parliament to form a new government Labor Party and the opposition Likud in agreement, Mr. Weizman is expected to approach Mr. Peres soon after the seven-day period of official mourning.
 
3 -- Choosing the new government
Mr. Peres will then have 21 days to form a new Cabinet. If he needs it, he can ask for another 21 days. He then presents his slate of ministers to parliament, which is likely to approve them. If it does not, the process starts fro the beginning, with Mr. Weizman asking another member to try to form a government.
 
4 -- The option: a new election
Parliament also has the option of passing a law allowing for early elections, in which case the transitional government would continue in office until a new Prime Minster and a new Parliament were elected. Under new election procedures, in the next national elections Israeli's will elect the Prime Minister and Parliament separately, and it will be the elected Prime Minster's task to forge a majority in Parliament. The next scheduled election is in November 1996.

HEADLINE: One Pleads Guilty to Okinawa Rape; 2 Others Admit Role

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: NAHA, Okinawa, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Three American servicemen pleaded guilty today to conspiring to abduct and rape a 12-year-old Okinawa schoolgirl in a case that has caused an uproar throughout Japan. One admitted beating and raping the girl, but the others insisted that they did not actually go through with the rape.
The pleas came in a hushed Japanese courtroom on the opening day of the trial for the men accused of a crime that has galvanized opposition to the presence of American military bases in Okinawa and the rest of Japan and has threatened the security alliance between the Washington and Tokyo. 
 In a two-hour hearing today, prosecutors gave a detailed account of the crime. They said the suspects had planned the attack, going to a store to buy condoms and adhesive tape, which they used to cover the victim's eyes and mouth and bind her hands and feet.
In a show of contrition, the lawyers for the three defendants said their clients planned to compensate the victim monetarily. The lawyers said the amount has not yet been decided, but one of them estimated in an interview that the combined total from the three servicemen would be between $10,000 and $20,000.
The three men, who are being tried under Japanese law, are accused of snatching the sixth grader off the street on the evening of Sept. 4 and of raping her in the back seat of their rented car. They are also accused of beating her in the face and stomach to subdue her, causing injuries that required two weeks of medical treatment. If convicted, they face from three years to life in a Japanese prison.
Today, each defendant, in turn, stood before the three judges in a military-looking posture, feet spread apart and hands behind his back, to enter his plea.
Seaman Marcus D. Gill, 22, of Woodville, Texas, who has been portrayed by both the prosecutors and the other defendants as the ringleader, quickly admitted guilt on all counts.
But Pfc. Kendrick M. Ledet, 20, of Waycross, Ga., denied raping and beating the victim. "All three of us did not beat her," he said. "I did not rape her and beat her."
Pfc. Rodrico Harp, 21, from Griffin, Ga., said he did not rape the girl either and said he hit her only once in the process of abducting her off the street. "I did hit her, but I didn't hit her in the back seat of the car," he said.
The servicemen did not say anything beyond entering their pleas. But lawyers for Private Ledet and Private Harp said after today's hearing that after entering the back seat of the car for their turns with the girl, Private Ledet and Private Harp did not go through with sexual intercourse when they saw how young she was, something they had not realized when they abducted her.
Prosecutors seemed to agree that Private Ledet did not actually achieve penetration. But they said they had a statement from Private Harp admitting that he did. But Private Harp's lawyer, Mitsunobu Matsunaga, said the statement was made to United States military authorities under great pressure and he would challenge it.
Even if the two men did not rape the girl, they can still be convicted of rape if they are judged to have been part of a conspiracy, just as the driver of a getaway car can be convicted of robbery even if he does not physically take the money. And evidence presented today, including statements by the two marines, showed they played big roles in the abduction and preparation for rape.
In one of the most dramatic moments today, prosecutors read excerpts from the victim's statement in which she described how, while walking home, she was hit in the face and grabbed around the neck from behind. She said she is now scared whenever she sees a foreigner. "I hope that they will be kept in jail as long as they live," she was quoted as saying.
Her father, in his statement, went even further saying, "If the existing laws permit, I would like to kill those three American soldiers."
Regardless of its outcome, the trial has already had a major effect on relations between the United States and Japan. The focus of attention has moved beyond this incident to the issue of whether the United States military bases and 47,000 American troops should be in Japan at all, now that the cold war has ended.
President Clinton and Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan are scheduled to reaffirm the alliance when they meet in Japan later this month, and United States officials are scrambling to put the genie unleashed by the rape case back in the bottle.
For Okinawans, the rape aroused pent-up anger over the crime, noise and economic dislocation they are exposed to because their small island is home to three-fifths of the American troops in Japan.
The United States military, which is paying for the defense of the servicemen, sent an observer, Capt. William Ferrell, a marine whose job is to monitor trials.
The indictment was read and the defendants entered their pleas. Then the prosecutor outlined the case and announced a list of 79 separate documents that would be offered as evidence, including numerous statements by the defendants.
Today's description of the crime lacked any discussion of what led the men, who had no criminal records in Japan and apparently good military records, to commit the crime.
Mr. Matsunaga, Private Harp's lawyer, said in an interview that the three men had discussed hiring prostitutes but that Seaman Gill had said he had no money and proposed the rape instead. At first, the others thought he was joking, but then the discussion grew more serious. He said Private Harp "didn't do anything to stop it. He just let things go."
According to the case outlined by prosecutors, four servicemen rented a car. At some point, Seaman Gill, who was driving, began proposing a rape. The men went to a grocery store and Privates Harp and Ledet went in to buy tape and condoms. At that point, the fourth serviceman realized that his colleagues were serious about the rape and left. According to military officials, this fourth person later helped identify the three defendants.
The men then drove around looking for a victim, according to a statement by Seaman Gill that was read by the prosecutor. At about 8 P.M., they found the girl, stopped the car, and Private Ledet and Private Harp got out.
Private Harp acted as if he was going to ask directions. Private Ledet put his arm around the girl's neck from behind and Private Harp hit her in the face. Private Ledet shoved her into the car, the two marines taped her eyes and mouth and tied her hands and feet. Seaman Gill drove to a remote farm road surrounded by sugar cane fields.
Seaman Gill went into the back seat and hit the girl and raped her. Then Private Ledet went into the back seat to rape her but "was not able" to penetrate, according to part of his statement read by prosecutors. Then Private Harp went into the back seat and raped her, prosecutors said. The rape was over at about 8:20. The men drove away and left the girl, who went to a nearby home to call for help.
The next hearing is scheduled for Dec. 4. Trials in Japan generally take place a day here and day there rather than running continuously.

Tax Cuts Would Evade Majority of Americans
The Republican tax cuts now making their way through Congress would not affect what most Americans owe, a computer analysis shows. Under the big budget bill passed by the Senate last month, 68 million taxpayers, or 55 percent of all households, would see no change.
But middle-class families with several children and wealthy investors can expect a windfall. And about 13 million people would face tax increases or would get a smaller payment from the Government under the earned-income tax credit than they would otherwise receive. [Page A1.]
 
First Interstate Holders Restive
First Interstate Bancorp's agreement to be bought by First Bank System of Minneapolis could run into trouble. Several large shareholders said they would vote down the First Bank deal if Wells Fargo proceeded with its hostile bid. [D2.]
 
Funds Considered To Stabilize Peso
Mexican business leaders are negotiating with the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo on a proposal by export-oriented companies to create funds of perhaps $5 billion to shield the battered peso from abrupt drops on the currency markets.

HEADLINE: Goldman, Sachs Group Strikes Deal for Rockefeller Center

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
An investor group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company and including David Rockefeller struck a deal yesterday to buy Rockefeller Center from Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., the real estate investment trust that is preparing to take ownership of the trophy property.
The deal appears to have ended the pitched months-long battle for Rockefeller Center. Moreover, it means that Mr. Rockefeller has apparently succeeded in his fight to restore his family's interest in the Manhattan landmark that his father, John D. Rockefeller Jr., built in the middle of the Great Depression. 
The Goldman group will pay $8 a share, or $306.1 million, to buy out the shareholders of the real estate investment trust, or REIT. The group will also assume roughly $845 million in debt and other liabilities.
By raising its original offer of $7.75 a share, the Goldman group beat a proposal by Gotham Partners L.P., a large Rockefeller Center Properties shareholder, that would have kept the property in the hands of the REIT's shareholders.
And it scotched a previous deal the REIT had reached with an investor group led by Sam Zell, the Chicago financier, which would have allowed shareholders to retain an interest in Rockefeller Center.
Both Gotham and the Zell group declined to comment, saying they had not had time to evaluate the Goldman deal.
Mr. Rockefeller vowed that the Goldman investors would "assure that the center remains a treasured asset of our city and our nation."
That view was echoed by Jerry I. Speyer, president of Tishman Speyer Properties Inc., the large New York real estate company that is part of the Goldman group and will operate the property when the group takes control. "The property has been standing almost 65 years, and for almost that entire time, it has been a leader worldwide in terms of location and position in the office market," Mr. Speyer said. "When you say Rockefeller Center, it means something, whether you say it in the Ginza in Tokyo or in the Place Vendome."
The Goldman investors, Gotham and Mr. Zell's group have been competing for control of the property since its owners, two partnerships owned by Rockefeller Group Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May.
In September, the Mitsubishi Estate Company, which owned an 80 percent stake in the Rockefeller Group, stunned the real estate world when it decided to walk away from its almost $2 billion investment in the center and transfer ownership to the REIT, which held the $1.3 billion mortgage on the original 12-acre piece of midtown Manhattan known as Rockefeller Center. The Rockefeller family trusts own the other 20 percent of Rockefeller Group.
The REIT was then forced to recapitalize so that it would have the financing to operate the property.
Yesterday, the two bankrupt partnerships filed a reorganization plan for turning the property over to the REIT. The terms of that plan -- including who will assume liabilities like $68 million in slip-and-fall claims against the property's owners -- still have to be negotiated.
Mr. Speyer said the Goldman group would begin discussing those issues with Rockefeller Group and hoped for a quick settlement.
Assuming the Goldman group's deal goes through, the REIT will have to pay an $11 million breakup fee to Mr. Zell to end its agreement with his group, which includes the General Electric Company and the Walt Disney Company.
The other hurdle facing the Goldman group is the REIT's shareholders, who must approve the deal. Several shareholders have suggested that the REIT should seek new financing on its own. Gotham made a proposal that would have refinanced the REIT's debt at a lower interest rate and raised at least $150 million through a rights offering.
If shareholders do not approve the deal, the Goldman group has agreed to participate in a rights offering with the REIT that would raise $200 million.
But people familiar with the terms of that rights offering said it presented an unattractive alternative for shareholders. Goldman, which already has the right to buy up to a 19.9 percent stake in the REIT, would be protected from dilution of its stake and would get the right to buy $50 million of stock at $7 to $7.50 a share for three years.
"It's an interesting development, and we are currently evaluating it," said David K. Sherman, a vice president at the Leucadia National Corporation, a large real estate and insurance company that holds a 7.1 percent stake in the REIT and has supported the Gotham proposal.
Another shareholder, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "I think this means this fight is over."
Peter D. Linneman, chairman of the REIT's board, declined to comment on the precise terms of the rights offering because the REIT had not filed its deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But he described it as "reasonably straightforward" and emphasized that the offering was presented only as an option in the event that shareholders rejected the all-cash deal.
"I am confident that the agreement we have made will get complete shareholder support," he said. "We believe our shareholders should and will take a straightforward $8 in cash."
Mr. Linneman stressed that the $8-a-share figure was twice what the REIT's shares were trading for late last year. "It's pretty fully priced at $8," he said. "Beyond that, I think any additional value comes at a higher risk than the typical REIT shareholder would want to take."
But the Goldman group obviously believes it can increase the value of the property. It promised its fellow investors, which include affiliates of the Agnelli family of Italy and the Niarchos family of Greece, a 20-plus percent return on their investments. And Gotham estimated that the property would be worth as much as $12 a share in three to five years.
"This is a very sophisticated investor group, and I don't think we'd be making the investment if we didn't feel this was an economically feasible deal," Mr. Speyer said. "But there is going to be a three- to four-year haul in turning this property around, with enormous capital expenditures and huge operating and management challenges."

HEADLINE: Some Big Holders Hesitant About First Interstate Deal

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
First Interstate Bancorp's agreement to be bought by First Bank System Inc., announced on Monday, may run into problems with shareholders if Wells Fargo & Company chooses to proceed with its hostile bid.
Several large shareholders said yesterday that they would vote against the First Bank deal if given the alternative of a higher offer by Wells Fargo. 
 If Wells makes a new bid, "it would be hard to look at both offers and come out on the side of First Bank System," said Denis Laplaige, president of the MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation, an investment firm that owns about 1.9 percent of First Interstate's stock.
"We think that a combination of First Interstate and First Bank System will make a fine bank, but Wells Fargo has the best shot of combining operations and realizing the greatest synergies," he said.
On Monday, First Bank, based in Minneapolis, agreed to buy the much larger First Interstate, based in Los Angeles, for stock valued at $10 billion, at yesterday's stock price. The deal, which would preserve First Interstate's name and much of its management, is worth less than the surprise hostile bid made by Wells Fargo on Oct. 19.
Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, initially offered stock worth about $10.1 billion, but raised its bid on Monday to $10.7 billion, valued on yesterday's stock price. The increased offer from Wells is worth $136.66 a share, about $5 more a share than the First Bank bid.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, the shares of First Interstate rose 50 cents, to $127.375; First Bank was up 75 cents, to $50.625, and Wells Fargo was down 37.5 cents, to $210.25.
Executives at Wells Fargo were debating yesterday whether to go ahead with a hostile tender offer for First Interstate shares, people familiar with the bank said. While such a course would be expensive and could distract management for up to a year, analysts and investment bankers expect Wells Fargo to proceed because of the enormous financial returns the bank foresees from the acquisition.
First Interstate has agreed to pay penalties of up to $200 million to First Bank if the merger is not consummated, but analysts said this would not be enough of a deterrent to block a new offer by Wells Fargo.
Thomas K. Brown, an analyst of regional banks for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, predicted that Wells Fargo would proceed with a hostile bid valued at about $147 a share, increasing the total price to $11.7 billion. Such an offer, he said, would be attractive to shareholders who are dissatisfied by the First Bank bid.
"First Interstate shareholders are not at all happy," Mr. Brown said. "I have talked to four of the five largest holders and the reaction ranges from modestly negative to violently negative."
"Investors are most upset about the process," Mr. Brown said. "They feel that the management and the board decided they would sell the company to anybody except Wells Fargo." Mr. Brown said First Interstate executives also offended investors by saying that the decision was based in part on the effect of the deal on the California economy and other nonfinancial considerations.
"The shareholders are saying they have no obligation to the state of California and that should not be part of the process," he said.
First Interstate's chairman, William E. B. Siart, spent much of the day meeting with investors to win support for the deal.
"It's clear that in the beginning a lot of people will have questions about our deal," said Shirley T. Hosoi, First Interstate's spokeswoman. "Wells has a leg up because they have been out in the marketplace for three weeks to explain their deal. As people begin to understand us over the next few weeks, they will support us."
First Interstate's largest shareholder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, the investment fund, remained silent on the First Bank deal yesterday. "K.K.R. is supportive of the process that the First Interstate board has conducted, but they decline to comment on any specific merger plan or transaction," a spokeswoman said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Growth Rate Slows Sharply

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
In another sign of increasingly pinched household budgets, consumers sharply curtailed new installment debt in September, Federal Reserve figures showed today, adding to a number of recent indications that consumer spending may be running out of steam.
The amount of outstanding installment credit rose $5.4 billion during the month, barely half as much as the August increase. Credit-card balances increased by $2.8 billion, the slimmest rise of the year. At the same time, lenders have become more reluctant to make loans. 
 "This is telling us the windows are now open and the cold air's rushing in," said James H. Chessen, economist for the American Bankers Association, pointing to indications of distress among a still small, but growing, group of consumers. Credit-card delinquencies, he said, are as high as they were at the end of the latest recession, which ended in early 1991.
Although analysts generally minimize the importance of one month's installment report, which provides only a net change in the amount outstanding, not the underlying extensions and repayments from which that figure is derived, some saw the September figures as part of a pattern.
"The slowing has been under way since May," said Stuart Sclater-Booth, a researcher at Paine Webber. "Consumers are more financially strapped." In fact, at 18.83 percent of disposable income, installment debt edged to a record in September, Mr. Sclater-Booth said.
Analysts said that the Fed's monthly report did not include home-equity loans and could have been muddied by the increased use of credit cards for convenience rather than for borrowing or for obtaining such benefits as frequent-flier miles. Still, they said it was hard to avoid the conclusion that more household budgets were stretched thin.
"Consumer debt has been really piling up," said David Lereah, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, which reported a rise in mortgage delinquencies for the second quarter and said it expects another increase for the third period. "It's reaching a point where you just can't take on more."
Mr. Lereah added, however, that interest rates on many credit cards have tumbled in recent years, reducing the burden of a given volume of debt. He called this a largely unrecognized "refinancing revolution" in credit cards, similar to the 1993 scramble to replace high-rate home mortgages with cheaper ones when long-term rates fell sharply.
James E. Annable, chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, was skeptical about today's report even as he termed it "consistent with the notion that consumers, having overextended themselves, may be pulling back a bit."
Mr. Annable said that consumers may be spending significantly more than the installment figures showed. He said that sales of new and used homes surged at a 67 percent annual pace during the summer quarter, and that when a home changes hands, about 2 percent of its price is spent on repairs and furnishings. He said that little of this might show up as installment debt. Roof repairs or furniture may wind up being paid out of savings or be included in the mortgage.
So while some consumers "are falling over the cliff," he said that he would not worry about the economy as long as the unemployment rate, 5.5 percent in October, remained low.
Mr. Chessen noted, however, that banks were already taking protective action. "Lenders are being much more cautious," he said. "It is going to be more difficult to get credit" as banks impose what he called "extra layering" of credit evaluation and delay increasing credit lines to their customers.
The Fed's report found that outstanding debt rose more slowly for all three of its major categories of installment debt. Automobile loans increased $1.8 billion following a $2 billion rise in August; revolving loans climbed $2.8 billion, compared with $4.4 billion the previous month, and other loans increased $826 million compared with $3.9 billion.
The "other" category includes loans, secured or unsecured, for mobile homes, education, boats and vacations.
September's 6.6 percent annual rate of change for installment debt followed a 12.7 percent pace in August, which was the 16th month in the last 18 months in which the advance in outstanding debt increased at a double-digit pace.
For the 12 months through September, the outstanding credit debt rose 13.9 percent. That continued a slowdown that began after a peak of 15.3 percent for the 12 months ended in May, Mr. Sclater-Booth of Paine Webber said.
Separately, the Labor Department said that productivity grew at a slower pace than expected in the third quarter, though the manufacturing sector posted the largest gain in eight years.
 Nonfarm business productivity grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter, less than the 2.8 percent increase expected by economists.
 Second-quarter productivity was revised upward slightly, to a 4.9 percent gain from 4.8 percent.
 Productivity in manufacturing grew 6.2 percent in the third quarter, the largest gain since a 10.6 percent increase in the second quarter of 1987, the department said.
 Productivity gauges efficiency by measuring the amount of goods and services produced per hour by all workers, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
Had Lawrence Whitehurst been arrested three weeks earlier for the murder and kidnapping of a 7-year-old girl in Kingston, N.Y., he probably would have ended up with a single court-appointed lawyer.
But Mr. Whitehurst was arrested after New York State's death penalty law took effect on Sept. 1. As a result, Mr. Whitehurst, an unemployed 25-year-old grocery clerk, has four lawyers, a paralegal, an investigator and a social worker. And his legal team is not just made up of recent law school graduates making an idealistic detour on their way to lucrative legal careers. It includes lawyers who were seasoned in states that have the death penalty and who enlisted in New York out of either opposition to capital punishment or a feeling that capital defendants deserve vigorous representation. 
 "Death is different," said Mark B. Harris, Mr. Whitehurst's lead counsel and the deputy chief of the new Capital Defender Office created by the death-penalty statute. "The better attorneys we can get involved, the less possibility that innocent people will be executed."
The legal talent that has gravitated to the Whitehurst case -- the first in the state in which the prosecution has said it will seek the death penalty -- reflects the breadth of representation that capital defendants are getting as a result of a bill carefully drafted to win broad support in the State Legislature.
The Capital Defender Office has 17 lawyers in bureaus in Manhattan, Rochester and Albany, and roughly half come with experience handling death-penalty cases outside New York, according to the office's administrator. The office, with a budget this year of $3.2 million, can multiply its force by contracting with legal aid societies or private lawyers. It also sponsors seminars on the death penalty for criminal lawyers, and roughly 160 have enrolled.
As of Oct. 31, the Capital Defender Office was notified of 102 murder cases that could potentially qualify for the death penalty, 74 of them in New York City. The office has taken on only eight cases and it has assigned seven of them to outside lawyers because in the remainder, there were indications that capital charges would not be pursued. In the Bronx, for example, the District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson, appended notes to the 22 murder cases he referred, saying he would not seek execution because of his doctrinal opposition to capital punishment.
On Monday, a Manhattan grand jury handed up the state's first capital murder indictment in the case of two men accused of slaying three family members in Harlem last month. One of those slain, Arelis Batista, 18, was said by the police to have enlisted the suspects in a plot to kill her father but ended up a victim herself. The father has insisted the police are mistaken.
The two suspects, however, may not face the death penalty. In Manhattan, too, the District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, is an opponent of the death penalty. He has named a committee of prosecutors to help him decide whether to seek capital punishment in some cases.
If he does, he, like other district attorneys, will face a more spirited, adroit defense than in more routine murder cases because of the depth of talent these cases are attracting.
For example, Mr. Harris, 45, the lawyer in the Kingston case, said he gave up an 18-year private practice that earned him a lot more than the $80,000 his state job pays because he wanted the chance to create precedents on a frontier of state law. Death penalty cases will include procedures that have not been tested in New York State, like separate trial phases for guilt and punishment and the cloistered questioning of individual jury panelists about their attitudes toward the death penalty.
Passage of the law, which guarantees every capital defendant at least two lawyers, drew Mr. Harris's co-counsel, Barry Fisher, 32, back to his home state from Atlanta. A magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School, he had been representing capital defendants through the Southern Center for Human Rights.
As a result of this gathering tide, local prosecutors like E. Michael Kavanagh, the District Attorney for Ulster County, which includes Kingston, are bracing for tougher courtroom fights. Mr. Kavanagh said he is sometimes struck by the fact that "if you're charged with murdering someone you get a barrage of attorneys, but if you're charged with maiming or raping someone or doing something less serious you get a lesser defense."
But in the end, he said, even though the challenge will be tougher, "it should be, given what's at stake."
"If there's an adjudication of guilt, people need to be satisfied with the outcome," Mr. Kavanagh said.
The Whitehurst case was the state's first in which the local District Attorney announced he would seek the death penalty. Mr. Kavanagh's statement put the case under the provisions of the new law, which provides for execution by lethal injection for specific categories of murder, including those committed in the course of grave felonies like rape or kidnapping.
But in contrast to the defendants in the Manhattan case, Mr. Whitehurst was arraigned on the lesser charge of second-degree murder, with Mr. Kavanagh explaining that he would elevate the case to first-degree murder in the indictment he sought from a grand jury, which is still hearing the case.
Mr. Whitehurst is accused of beckoning 7-year-old Rickel Knox into his car and bludgeoning her in the woods outside Kingston. The girl's mother, Margaret Marable, told the police she believes Mr. Whitehurst took revenge on Rickel because the mother had resisted his advances.
A key element in Mr. Whitehurst's defense strategy is the ploy used by prosecutors to find the body. Mr. Whitehurst was questioned for two days after the girl disappeared, then charged only with kidnapping. Prosecutors, eager to locate Rickel, told him that if he led them to her they would arrange a relatively lenient sentence. Mr. Whitehurst, prosecutors say, then showed them where the body was hidden.
Defense lawyers contend that what the prosecutors did was renege on a plea bargain. As a result, the lawyers argue, prosecutors have so tainted the case that it should be shifted to another district attorney's office. Mr. Kavanagh has denied any misconduct. "I would have done anything the guy wanted us to do to get the girl alive," he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Wait for Debt Limit Deal Keeps Bond Traders Quiet

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices moved lower within a narrow range in light trading yesterday, as credit market participants continued to watch the talks in Congress about the Federal budget and the debt ceiling and showed scant reaction to economic data and comments made by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan.
Traders noted continuing consolidation within the market, as some participants locked in gains made last week, with only modest buying from those taking advantage of dips in prices to pick up bargains. 
 On Monday, the Treasury postponed indefinitely, or at least until Congress passed authorization for raising the Federal debt limit, the auction of new three-year notes that had been scheduled for yesterday and one of 10-year notes that had been scheduled for today.
Yesterday, the 30-year bond was down 6/32, to a price of 107 20/32 to yield 6.30 percent, up from 6.29 percent on Monday.
Debt futures also ended on a softer note, with investors buying at the lows. The December Treasury bond futures contract closed at 117 14/32. "My technicals are calling for about a half-point more decline," said Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst with Thomson Research of Boston, "which should be a good buying opportunity."
There was little response to the 2.3 percent increase in the Johnson Redbook report about weekly chain-store sales, a trader said, because the market had already priced in the increase. In another report yesterday, the Fed said that consumer credit expanded by $5.42 billion in September, well short of the $8.5 billion that economists had anticipated and indicating that consumers are less willing to take on more debt.
Even statements by Mr. Greenspan failed to stir the market. Addressing the Gerald R. Ford Foundation in Grand Rapids, Mich., he called financial stability in general and price stability in particular the keys to long-term economic success, and said that the central bank had had "considerable success" in the fight against inflation in recent years. Some traders interpreted this to mean that the Fed was not prepared to ease rates any time soon, though others dismissed the comments as not suggestive of any particular sentiment.
The House Ways and Means Committee said yesterday that a draft version of a House bill would raise the debt ceiling by $50 billion until mid-December. Republicans said that the added $50 billion would be enough to finance Government operations until they forward final legislation to the President for approval.
"Assuming there is a near-term agreement on the debt-ceiling limit," Eric Hamilton, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data of Boston, said, "traders will have to take on over $50 billion of three-year, ten-year and one-year auction paper all within a very short time span. This is on top of the expected $29.25 billion in two-year and five-year notes, along with a larger $29.2 billion weekly bill auction."
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said that the Treasury market "is currently in a state of suspended animation while waiting for passage of debt-ceiling legislation. As soon as the debt ceiling is lifted," he noted, there would be a spate of Treasury offerings.
"Another continuing resolution will be needed next week to keep the Government operational until a budget accord is reached," Mr. Fine continued. "While all of this is temporary, it is nonetheless distracting, and creates potential headaches for the Fed in its role of market stabilizer."
Meanwhile, Mr. Fine said, the October Producer Price Index on Thursday is the only major economic statistic the market will face this week, with forecasts for the index ranging from minus a half percent to plus two-tenths of 1 percent.
"Even the high end of the range still suggests a subdued, benign and nonthreatening pace of inflation," he said. "Indeed, not only does the inflation picture give the Fed latitude to ease further, but a number of recently released economic statistics suggest a possible further slowing of the economy over the near term, which could, if continued, give the Fed some inducement on the output side of the equation as well."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Moves in Paris Bolster Franc, Helping Dollar Rise vs. Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark yesterday after a Government reshuffling in France bolstered the French franc against the mark.
The Cabinet shake-up indicated to currency traders that the Government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe and President Jacques Chirac would make trimming the $58 billion budget deficit a priority over reducing the 11.5 percent unemployment rate. 
 "Juppe and Chirac have dropped the idea that they can create jobs at the same time they cut spending," said Ken Nixon, currency adviser at Bank of Montreal/Harris Bank in New York.
The Cabinet changes, which left Jean Arthuis as Finance Minister, bolstered expectations that the Government would remain committed to a strong franc and that it would move forward on European monetary union.
The news helped drive the mark down to 3.4461 francs, from 3.4625 francs on Monday, in New York.
When the mark falls against European currencies, it typically depreciates against the dollar as well , as speculators seek all opportunities to sell marks.
But the Japanese yen also rose strongly against the mark, which left the dollar slightly weaker against the yen.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar slipped to 103 yen from 103.33 yen on Monday. But the dollar rose to 1.4160 marks from 1.4128 marks and to 1.1389 Swiss francs from 1.1380 Swiss francs.
In other trading, the dollar fell to 4.8825 French francs from 4.8911 French francs. The British pound edged up to $1.5809 from $1.5799.
The dollar's gains were restrained by the battle between President Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress over efforts to cut the budget deficit and raise the debt limit, currency traders said.
"I don't think there'll be any major action on the dollar until we see some developments in the budget talks," said Frank Hanson, a trader at Unibank in Copenhagen. "It's difficult to know what will happen there, as we're talking about politicians, so people are staying on the sidelines for the moment."
Without an increase in the debt limit, the Treasury cannot sell more debt and will not be able to make interest payments due Nov. 15. A default would undermine confidence in American assets and weaken the dollar.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Biggest Stockholder in Daiwa Frowns on a Sumitomo Merger

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Daiwa Bank's largest shareholder has reportedly thrown cold water on the idea of a merger between the troubled bank and Sumitomo Bank.
The shareholder, Nomura Securities, which owns 3.3 percent of Daiwa, did not make its reasons clear. But in a meeting on Monday between Hideo Sakamaki, Nomura's president, and Takashi Kaiho, his counterpart at Daiwa, Nomura expressed reservations about a merger, according to a report in a Japanese daily, Mainichi Shimbun. 
 "As a leading shareholder, we cannot assent to the merger with Sumitomo Bank," Mainichi quoted Mr. Sakamaki as saying. "We cannot give support to Daiwa if it will merge with Sumitomo Bank."
Other reports agreed that Nomura might disapprove of a merger, although it was not clear whether Nomura could block a deal if the Japanese Finance Ministry insisted on one.
A Nomura spokesman would not say much about the matter. "We are not in the position to comment about the reported merger because neither bank has said the two will merge," the spokesman said on Tuesday. "It has just been media talk."
Newspaper reports did not offer explanations of why Nomura would not support a merger. Last week, Daiwa announced that Nomura had offered to help it dispose of its operations in the United States, and there was no suggestion that Nomura was withdrawing such an offer.
In Washington, the House planned hearings into the Daiwa case. Representative Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey, who heads the House Banking subcommittee on financial institutions, said on Tuesday that the hearings on Dec. 5 would review the case and overall American regulation of international financial institutions. Witnesses were expected to include officials from the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and New York State Banking Department.
Some analysts here sought to explain Nomura's stance by saying that the securities company wanted to negotiate a stronger tie-in with Daiwa to expand into the banking business. This would be hard if Sumitomo absorbed Daiwa.
"They've always wanted to be a bank," David Atkinson, a financial analyst at Goldman, Sachs Japan, said of Nomura. About a merger between Sumitomo and Daiwa, he added, "I'm not sure it's going to happen."
Another big Japanese daily, Asahi Shimbun, suggested that Nomura had not been consulted on the possibility of a merger and might have felt left out of the decision-making.
Several Japanese bankers said the merger could be unpopular with other banks here, which would have to compete with a mammoth new institution. A union of Sumitomo and Daiwa would create the world's largest bank, with assets of 87.7 trillion yen -- about $850 billion -- and would significantly broaden Sumitomo's business activities.
Sumitomo would gain access to Daiwa's trust operation, which is the nation's largest pension-fund manager. Moreover, Daiwa has a controlling interest in Cosmo Securities, a business in which Sumitomo is reportedly interested.
The uncertainty led Daiwa's stock to pull back sharply today after soaring Monday on hopes for a merger. The shares fell by 60 yen in trading today, to close at 670 yen, after edging down slightly on Tuesday. The stock had spurted on Monday, gaining 100 yen.
In another development affecting Daiwa, Japan's top economic planner expressed concern that the bank's expulsion from the United States could hamper broad economic recovery. Isamu Miyazaki, head of the Economic Planning Agency, said Daiwa's expulsion could have a "very bad psychological impact" on the economy, the Kyodo news service quoted Mr. Miyazaki as saying.

Trader Denied Bail in U.S.
 By Reuters
A Federal judge denied bail yesterday to a former Daiwa Bank trader in New York who has pleaded guilty to concealing $1.1 billion in losses. United States District Judge Lewis Kaplan refused to release Toshihide Iguchi, 44, former senior vice president at Daiwa's New York branch, citing a risk that Mr. Iguchi might flee. Judge Kaplan noted that Mr. Iguchi's property was subject to forfeiture and that he faced up to 90 years in prison, and added, "A person in his situation might well be be tempted to disappear." The judge also noted that others could be charged in the case.

HEADLINE: H.M.O. Quality Called Equal, at Less Cost

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE 

 BODY:
A broad new study asserts that patients treated by health maintenance organizations and those treated by doctors in traditional medical practices had similar results, even though the H.M.O.'s cost substantially less.
The study, by the New England Medical Center in Boston and the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., is the first comprehensive case-by-case comparison of the treatment and cost of the two kinds of health care systems. It was published yesterday in The Journal of the American Medical Association. 
 The researchers also reported that the studies patients, who were moderately sick with high blood pressure or adult diabetes, had similar results whether they were treated by primary-care doctors, like internists or family practitioners, or by specialists in cardiology and endocrinology.
The study comes as experts debate whether H.M.O.'s sacrifice quality of care for lower costs, and as a Congressional conference committee takes up House and Senate bills that, as part of a Medicare overhaul, encourage greater use of H.M.O.'s. More Americans are turning to H.M.O.'s for their medical care; about 50 million Americans now use these organizations.
The study also comes in the midst of Congressional efforts to cut projected spending on Medicare, the Federal health care program for the elderly, by $270 billion over the next seven years, and similar efforts to squeeze $170 billion from Medicaid, the health care program for the poor. Those cuts are being considered by the conference committee as well.
Some experts warned against drawing too sweeping a conclusion from the results of the new study, which was conducted in Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles from 1986 to 1993.
Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association, said that many H.M.O.'s paid far too much attention to the bottom line and that one study of two diseases in three cities was "not enough to disprove that."
He added that the cost data in the new study, analyzed in 1992, were already outdated in view of the recent increases in the use of H.M.O.'s.
But he said the A.M.A. had long taken the position that H.M.O.'s can provide high-quality medical care and said the group was concerned "not about managed care but managed profiteering."
The A.M.A. has, in fact, been a frequent opponent of H.M.O.'s, seeing them, among other things, as interfering with the doctor's ability to make appropriate medical decisions and maintain traditional doctor-patient relationships.
Others reacted to the study by cautioning that much more detailed work should be done.
"It's very well to have this good study started nearly 10 years ago, but we need more work now," said Dr. David Lansky, regional director of clinical information for Providence Health System, a group of doctors and hospitals in Portland, Ore.
But Dr. Lansky added: "It's important stuff they've done. They have shown that it is possible to look at the overall patterns of care provided by our major systems and evaluate quality of care systematically." He called the study a "milestone."
Others in the health profession called the research very important to assessing the quality of American health care. Earlier projects -- like a 1986 study by the University of California at San Francisco -- reached similar conclusions but studied fewer patients and did not analyze costs. The California research compared rheumatoid arthritis patients treated by Kaiser Permanente, an H.M.O., with those treated by traditional fee-for-service doctors.
H.M.O.'s have been successful in holding down health care costs by urging the doctors on their staffs to spend less money on treatments; by heavily using preset fees, under which doctors get paid a set amount per month per patient, regardless of how often they see the patient or whether they see the patient at all, and by their less frequent use of specialists.
But the study's authors emphasized that more research was needed to learn how much cost cutting can be done without endangering the quality of care and to determine how much the effectiveness of treatment varies among health plans, diseases and patients.
"The equivalent outcomes observed in this study do not necessarily mean that cutbacks in services currently being considered will lead to good outcomes for all patients," said Alan R. Tarlov, director of the Health Institute at the New England center, referring to the proposed cuts in Medicare and Medicaid.
He added, "There might be some aspects of care that affect outcomes adversely, particularly for vulnerable subgroups," like the elderly and poor.
The 1,720 patients in the study were treated by 354 doctors and 13 nurse practitioners, and were followed up and interviewed over the seven years of the project. The doctors and nurses practiced in H.M.O.'s, large multi-specialty group practices, solo practices or single-specialty groups.
The researchers found that the type of health care insurance system the patients had chosen -- prepaid in an H.M.O. or fee-for-service in a traditional plan -- had no bearing on whether their blood pressure or blood-sugar levels were under control, or whether other consequences of their illnesses developed after two years. The kind of plan selected also did not affect the patients' ability to function in everyday life after four years, or their mortality rate after seven years.
The researchers said the H.M.O. doctors hospitalized 40 percent fewer patients than the fee-for-service doctors, and ordered 12 percent fewer drugs.
The study also found that primary-care doctors spent less money than the specialists. For example, cardiologists hospitalized twice the number of patients and ordered 24 percent more drugs and 19 percent more laboratory tests. Endocrinologists sent one and a half times more patients to hospitals and ordered 48 percent more laboratory tests and 10 percent more drugs.
But Dr. Philip E. Cryer, president-elect of the American Diabetes Association, said the conclusions of the study were not always supported by the data, pointing out that endocrinologists did better, for example, in treating diabetics' foot problems.
The researchers acknowledged Dr. Cryer's point but said those problems did not show up in the four-year and seven-year follow-up observations.
Dr. Sheldon Greenfield of the New England Medical Center, the principal author of the study, said the researchers picked adult diabetes to study because of its prevalence; because its many complications make it one of the most expensive of chronic diseases, and because the right treatments often prevent such complications. Hypertension was chosen, in part, because it is treated by doctors in all specialties and systems of care, Dr. Greenfield said.

HEADLINE: A Report Criticizes Improvement Zones In New York City

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
In the first government review of the self-taxing business districts that have proliferated in New York City in the last decade, a City Council inquiry has concluded that some have abused their power and failed to deliver promised services.
The Council's inquiry, to be released today, found that a lack of oversight has allowed some of these business improvement districts to pay their executives excessive salaries and spend too much money on their operations. That contradicts the original notion that the districts would deliver better services at lower cost than the government precisely because they would be more efficient. 
 The inquiry also found managerial problems and abuses in several districts, ranging from the large Grand Central Partnership to the tiny East Brooklyn Business Improvement District: conflicts of interest, illegal loans, use of illegal immigrants at less than minimum wage. At least one district is close to bankruptcy, the report said.
At a time when the city is cutting back on services and increasingly relying on the districts to provide them instead, the City Council's report calls for greater regulation of these quasi-governmental groups in the interest of keeping them alive.
"Requiring the BID's to be accountable to the public is revolutionary -- right now BID's can do whatever they want," said Herbert Berman, chairman of the Council's Finance Committee. "BID's are a significant reality, especially at a time of fiscal restraint. I've always encouraged them. A majority do an effective job and in an honest way, but some have raised substantial questions."
By levying special taxes on property owners, the business improvement districts supplement the city's delivery of sanitation, security and social services and promote local businesses. An outgrowth of the special assessment districts created by the State Legislature in the 1970's, the BID's were authorized by the City Council in 1982. There are now 34, large and small, covering 550 blocks across the city from Harlem to Brighton Beach; business owners in 39 more areas are considering creating districts.
The districts' leaders, who have not seen the report, had little comment. Tom Cusick, president of the Fifth Avenue improvement district and chairman of the new New York City BID Managers Association, said it was unfair to release the report without giving the district's a chance to respond. Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, also reserved comment.
The districts were meant to be streamlined operations, but many spend considerable amounts of money in administrative overhead, according to the inquiry. The small Columbus/Amsterdam BID spends half its budget on administration. And the Church Avenue district in Brooklyn spends 29 percent of its budget to pay the $35,000 salary of its director -- but only $6,000 for the sanitation services that are one of its central obligations to property owners.
Six districts pay their managers at least $100,000 in salary. Daniel Biederman, who runs the Grand Central, 34th Street and Bryant Park BID's, makes $315,000. His security chief, at $144,999, and his sanitation chief, at $114,530, make more than the city's Police and Sanitation Commissioners, who earn $110,000 each.
At the same time, the inquiry found, several BID's hired illegal immigrants, paid less than minimum wage and paid salaries in cash. One company in particular that is said to use illegal immigrants had multiple contracts with business districts.
Several districts did not properly supervise their contractors, sometimes failing to execute written contracts, the inquiry found. The Church Avenue district, for instance, hired a company to sweep streets and sidewalks, but the workers swept only the streets and solicited additional payments from merchants to do the sidewalks.
The City Council inquiry, which was conducted by the Council's Office of Oversight and Investigation and the staff of its Finance Committee, was prompted partly by controversies involving Mr. Biederman's joint management of three of the city's most prominent BID's.
The report recommends that Mr. Biederman not be allowed to take on any more districts -- he has expressed interest in creating or running several others -- and that no one else be allowed to run more than one BID.
Some BID's are not performing proper audits of their finances, the report said. At the Jamaica Mall district in Queens, the budget committee did not meet for two years, and the board did not get minutes of executive committee meetings. The East Brooklyn BID is so mismanaged that it is near bankruptcy, the report said.
Many improvement districts have tangled relationships with local business groups that pose potential conflicts, the report said. Some district officials also work for other groups with different boundaries and goals, and it is not always clear how the officials' time and loyalties are divided. Some of those groups have contracts with the districts, raising questions about the equity of those arrangements, whose costs are borne by the districts' taxpayers.
The most extreme example of a potential for conflicts involved the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce, which ran both the Jamaica Mall and 165th Street districts. The chamber president was the manager of the mall district, and the organizations shared several board members.
Eventually, disaffected property owners at Jamaica Mall forced a court-supervised election that installed a new district board. It sued the chamber for $1 million, claiming fraud, misappropriation of funds and violation of fiduciary trust. The chamber countersued for $10 million, and both cases are still pending.
Among other issues, the 165th Street and Jamaica Mall districts gave or loaned nearly $20,000 to the Jamaica Economic Growth Corporation, transfers that the report said state law prohibits.
The report calls for new performance standards and stricter oversight by individual BID boards, by the city's Department of Business Services, by the State Legislature and by the Council itself. Mr. Berman, the Finance Committee chairman, said, "We're not going to blindly approve BID's and their assessment increase."
Dissatisfaction with the improvement districts emerged in a poll of 404 property owners and managers conducted by the council's staff. About a third could not name their BID and did not know what it did.
Although sanitation was widely rated as improved, other services got mixed reviews in the survey. Business promotions like flyers and directories are a major BID theme, but only 57 percent said they were aware of such efforts.
While the law creating the districts grants them only five-year contracts, no district with outstanding debt can be dissolved. And so the districts have the potential to survive forever regardless of the feelings of the owners who are taxed -- and the inquiry found that only 45 percent of owners surveyed feel that their investment is paying off.

The White House Conference on Travel and Tourism produces a series of recommendations.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
THE many business executives who attended last week's White House Conference on Travel and Tourism are back at their usual haunts, after having voted to carry out a series of recommendations.
The recommendations include include making it easier for foreign business and leisure travelers to enter the United States, and developing a reliable economic analysis of the travel and tourism industry, which is currently valued at $417 billion. 
 Unlike past White House conferences, private industry contributed most of the cost. Contributions ranged from less than $500, given by 20 contributors, to at least $500,000 from American Express. Many airlines, hotels, rental car concerns, tour operators and travel agencies also made donations, individually or as members of trade associations.
With America's share of foreign visitors headed for its fourth consecutive decline, delegates at the conference agonized over how to reverse that trend -- a trend that Greg Farmer, Under Secretary of Commerce, attributes to growing competition from other countries and to the United States spending less than 32 other countries to promote foreign tourism.
Delegates recommended that Congress enact legislation for a national tourism office chartered by the Federal Government but managed by the private sector. Representative Toby Roth, a Republican from Wisconsin, has since introduced a bill calling for a panel that would devise a strategy to attract foreign visitors, and calling for a private tourism agency to carry out the campaign.
With Congress in an anti-spending mood, it may not be easy raising the $100 million budget thought necessary by the year 2000 to run the tourism office. And the private sector has been unable to agree on how to raise its contribution. A suggested $3 departure tax did not sit well with the airline industry, whose passengers already pay as many as six different taxes and fees, while a suggested $3 surcharge on passports also ran into opposition.
But a totally unscientific survey by this column found delegates and travel industry executives optimistic that financing will be found. Not because of any laxity over public or private purse strings, but because both sides recognize that more tourists translate into more jobs, higher tax receipts and increased revenues.
 
Help in Latin America
The growing competition between United States and Latin American airlines may not be good for the balance sheet of individual carriers, but the lower fares generated by the competition have increased traffic along many of those routes. Many southbound passengers include business travelers looking to invest and sell in the region.
As it happens "Investing and Selling In Latin America" is the first title from Hemisphere Business Books in Shawnee Mission, Kan. (913 677-4116). Its 358 pages contain chapters on individual Latin American nations by financial writers who either live in the region or have lived there and still pay frequent visits.
The book covers economic policies, political stability, bureaucracy and corruption, sometimes in less-than-flattering terms. People who have established businesses in Latin America relate their experiences, including a businessman who spent a night in jail while trying to modernize Venezuela's telephone system. The book also tells what to expect from a nation's labor force and how to find sales reps and local partners.
"This is the first of several books we have planned for doing business in Latin America," said Shirley Christian, the publisher of Hemisphere Business Books. While "Investing and Selling in Latin America" contains a reading list, Ms. Christian, a former Latin American correspondent for The New York Times, The Miami Herald and The Associated Press, said that Hemisphere was also considering publishing important out-of-print books about Latin America.
 
Low Fares, and Leg Room
Dozens of low-fare airlines have come and gone since deregulation of the industry in 1978. No sooner did Alaska-based Mark Air suspend flights and file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection two weeks ago, than an airline with the incongruous name of Jet Train announced plans to begin service on Dec. 11, pending final Government approval.
Based in Aliquippa, Pa., Jet Train (800 359-4968) plans a daily nonstop flight between Newark and Pittsburgh and between Newark and Orlando, Fla., with one-stop flights between Pittsburgh and Orlando. Citing low fares -- $129 one way between Newark and Orlando, with an introductory rate of $69 from Dec. 11 through Dec. 17 -- with few restrictions, Jet Train also boasts that every seat on the two DC9-31's that make up its fleet have a 34-inch pitch -- that is, there are 34 inches between rows measured front-to-back.
Although 34-inch pitch was common in economy class not long ago, Jet Train may still be on to something in ballyhooing it as a luxury amenity -- especially when the intent of many airlines these days seems to be to see which passenger in economy class cries "uncle" first.

HEADLINE: In Wake of Disaster, Opportunity

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma sat by a sun-bathed window in the lobby of the luxurious St. Regis Hotel on the Upper East Side of Manhattan one recent morning, autographing photos of himself for constituents back home and recalling the party given the night before in his honor.
With the financier Henry R. Kravis as host at his Manhattan apartment, the affair was attended by corporate icons and celebrities who saluted the Republican Governor's leadership during the difficult days last spring after the Oklahoma City bombing, and discussed what could be done to create jobs and wealth for the people of his state. 
 "The question was," Mr. Keating said, "How do we make Oklahoma rich?"
To find an answer to that ambitious proposition, he is taking full advantage of the national platform that the bombing provided. In an all-out effort to advance the economic development agenda in his state -- which in per-capita income ranks as the seventh poorest in the United States -- Mr. Keating is crisscrossing the country, raising his profile through local media appearances, calling on corporations, and reaching out to people like Mr. Kravis.
The efforts appear to be paying off. Since the summer, several corporations, including the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, have announced plans to expand factories or locate offices in Oklahoma.
Mr. Kravis, the co-founder of the corporate buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and an Oklahoma native, said he spoke by telephone with the Governor right after the April 19 bombing.
"I said, 'Look, you've got a window of opportunity,' " Mr. Kravis recalled. "You should take advantage of this opportunity to get the word out of what Oklahoma is all about."
Mr. Keating has been following that advice.
"Since April 19, the height of interest in Oklahoma has increased," the Governor said. "I am doing just what I would have done with or without the tragedy. The tragedy just provided an excellent platform. I'm not embarrassed by that."
A former F.B.I. agent and Justice Department official in the Reagan and Bush Administrations, Mr. Keating was three months into his first term as Governor when the blast destroyed the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, killing 168 people. Projecting a sense of calm, the Governor coordinated the efforts of the many rescue and investigation teams. He appeared on the news practically around the clock, overshadowing everyone else.
Mr. Keating's steadiness and the spirit that the people of Oklahoma displayed helped to dispel the state's image in the business community as a backwater. Herb Kelleher, chief executive of Southwest Airlines, said he was impressed with the "can-do attitude" and "sense of community" that Oklahomans demonstrated. In June, Southwest opened a reservations center in Oklahoma City, employing 1,000 people, a deal that was struck before the bombing.
Mr. Keating, 51, has become Oklahoma's star salesman. An energetic man who jogs three miles every other day, he is suddenly finding himself on the A-list of rich and powerful people. He has traveled to Omaha to play golf with the billionaire Warren E. Buffett and vacationed with Mr. Kravis at the financier's Aspen hideaway. Last month, the Governor joined about 45 leaders of major corporations for a daylong outing aboard a yacht owned by the publishing company Forbes Inc.
The level of activity has led to speculation that the Governor might have his sights on national office. He denies this, and insists that his purpose is to thank people for their support after the bombing and to drum up interest in Oklahoma.
Making Oklahoma wealthy, as he intends, will not be easy. Since the 80's, when oil prices dropped and the farm economy receded, the state's fortunes have lagged.
While major corporations like AT&T and General Motors have large operations in Oklahoma, many other companies have decided against moving to the state, citing impediments like a shortage of direct airline flights from the coasts and the absence of a law banning labor contracts that require workers to belong to a union.
Although corporate relocation executives are attracted by the state's vocational and technical education system and the resulting high level of productivity of its work force, these factors have not been enough. The state has been a runner-up for several big economic development projects in recent years, like in 1991, when United Airlines decided to locate a maintenance facility, with 7,000 jobs, in Indiana.
"Being runner-up means you're the first-place loser," said Rick Moore, assistant to Mayor Ronald Norick of Oklahoma City.
The loss that scorched Mr. Keating came right before the bombing, when Micron Technology decided to build a $1.3 billion microchip processing plant, to employ 3,500 people, in Utah instead of Oklahoma. Mr. Keating decided to mount a full-scale offensive.
On April 4, two weeks before the bombing, the Governor's office hired Development Counselors International, a New York public relations firm that specializes in business development.
"The irony is they felt they weren't known for anything," said Robert E. DeRocker, a vice president at the firm. "They wanted us to look for speaking forums for the Governor, to help them with expansion."
The bombing made Mr. De Rocker's task easier. After April 19, he said, Mr. Keating's "placeability" soared, and it has remained high. "People from TV stations are calling us, saying they want him on," Mr. DeRocker said.
While calling on companies that might create jobs at home is not uncommon for any Governor, the volume of activity and the access provided Mr. Keating is striking. By December, he will have made 16 economic development trips in five months, visiting more than 35 companies around the nation.
"This Governor will run you ragged," said Bill Moss, who has served under five Governors as director of corporate site location for the Oklahoma Department of Commerce.
Normally, government officials who are trying to attract big businesses to their area are referred to corporate real estate managers, or site-selection consultants hired by the companies. But Mr. Keating and his economic development team receive red carpet treatment at most companies they visit.
In Chicago last summer, the Governor was scheduled to meet with the real estate manager of a Fortune 500 company that is considering opening a plant in Oklahoma. But when he walked into the lobby of the company's headquarters, the chairman of the board and the chief executive were there to greet him.
During the same trip, while the Oklahoma team was meeting in Chicago with executives at Viskase, a food processor that has operations in Oklahoma, indictments in the bombing were announced back home. Viskase officials turned their corporate boardroom over to the Governor and his staff to use as a satellite press office. And last summer in Toronto, when Oklahoma sponsored a hospitality suite at a convention of economic-development professionals, more than 1,200 people showed up.
"We were overwhelmed," said W. Andrew Burke, senior vice president for economic development in Oklahoma City.
It is too soon to tell what kind of long-term effect all of the attention will have on development in Oklahoma, but the early signs are promising. In addition to Goodyear, which announced a $25 million expansion of its plant in Lawton, First Data Resources, a consumer finance company in Omaha, recently announced plans to open an office in Tulsa, employing 3,000 people. And Viskase has agreed to expand its Pauls Valley plant, adding 250 jobs.
Development experts in the state believe they are on the verge of some other major deals that should put an end to Oklahoma's days as an economic development also-ran.
And Mr. Keating, despite his new-found fame, seems to be keeping things in perspective. He recently joked about an Omaha television interviewer who did not know who he was when he arrived at the station. "I'm Frank Keating, the Governor from Oklahoma," he said he told the interviewer, as he extended his hand. "Oh, hi Frank," he said she snapped back. "I'm from Florida, and I'm running for President."

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
George Wallace as a Founding Father

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

THE POLITICS OF RAGE
George Wallace, the Origins of the New Conservatism and the Transformation of American Politics
By Dan T. Carter
Illustrated. 572 pages. Simon & Schuster. $30.
Dan T. Carter ends this voyage through the heart of the American political darkness with an epigram: George C. Wallace, he writes, was "the most influential loser in 20th-century American politics." 
 Mr. Carter's point is that the race-baiting former Alabama Governor, though he failed in his four "whirlwind campaigns" for the Presidency, was the central and indispensable ingredient in the rise of a new American conservatism inaugurated with the successful "Southern strategy" of Richard M. Nixon and continuing with the anti-welfare state populism of Newt Gingrich. He was the "alchemist of the new social conservatism," Mr. Carter says, and hence of the transformation of American politics.
Biographers are not usually prone to minimize the historical importance of their subjects, and Mr. Carter, who is the Kenan Professor of History at Emory University in Atlanta and the author of prize-winning books on Southern history, certainly makes a large claim for his. In one respect it is too large. Mr. Carter builds a compelling, well-documented argument to the effect that Wallace's presence catalyzed the emergence in the late 1960's of a " 'New American Majority' on the solid foundation of the conservative South." His argument that conservatism today has succeeded because it has been able to encode Wallace's demagogic appeal is less persuasive.
That failing aside, however, "The Politics of Rage" is a stimulating political biography, solidly researched and vividly presented. One reads it with many thoughts: about, for example, the boundless cynicism of certain members of the American political class. Mr. Carter, though not absolutely certain about this, is doubtful that Wallace actually believed all those things he said about the civil rights movement and a Communist conspiracy or, for that matter, about the supposed dread danger to the white race that would ensue if black people registered for the vote. (One campaign aide summed up the Wallace electoral strategy in the 1970 gubernatorial race as, "Promise them the moon and holler, 'Nigger.' " ).
Most of all, however, "The Politics of Rage" makes one think about how different America was when Wallace made his famous, media-wise stand at the schoolhouse door as he battled in 1963 to prevent the integration of the University of Alabama. His single most famous statement, "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever," would simply not be heard today in Southern elections. Three decades ago, to express a cynical, overtly racist contempt for the civil rights of black people was often vital to winning public office in the South.
"The Politics of Rage" weaves together two complementary purposes. In part it is high quality, if conventional, biography. It covers all the stages of Wallace's life, from his humble origins, to the years of pugnacious oratory and demagogic agitation, to the 1972 assassination attempt that left him in a wheelchair. Mr. Carter covers Wallace's several wives, especially Lurleen Wallace, who stood in for him as Governor in 1966, when the Alabama Constitution prohibited any Governor from serving two consecutive terms. Mr. Carter's narration of the major episodes of the civil rights movement in Alabama is gripping and sobering, even when he traces events familiar to readers of other recent accounts, like Taylor Branch's "Parting the Waves."
Mr. Carter gets to his second purpose in his final three chapters, in which he spins a dark, complicated tale of win-at-all-costs political warfare that is decidedly not the most glorious moment in the history of the American democracy. The story here has as much to do with Richard M. Nixon as with George Wallace, especially in the years 1968 to 1972, when Wallace's strong showing in the Democratic primaries pushed Nixon to compete for the white-conservative Wallace constituency, and to inherit it after Wallace was shot. What emerged, in Mr. Carter's view, was not just Nixon's Southern strategy, but the whole current political majority, built on a symbolic politics of backlash among whites.
"The Alabama governor," Mr. Carter declares, "compounded racial fear, anti-communism, cultural nostalgia and traditional right-wing economics into a movement that laid the foundation for the conservative counterrevolution that reshaped American politics in the 1970's and 1980's."
Certainly, Wallace's ability to capture, in what Mr. Carter calls "earthy language," a traditionalist despair at post-60's American turmoil helped to galvanize the new Republican majority in the early 1970's. But Mr. Carter simply tosses out his further argument -- that Wallace created the framework for present-day conservatism -- almost as though nothing has happened since he won the Michigan and Maryland Democratic primaries in 1972, or as though nothing had happened before.
The social conservatism that Mr. Carter sees aborning in the late 1960's was always present in America, which suggests that Mr. Wallace effected less of a "transformation" than Mr. Carter suggests. Absent from his argument is the possibility that the Democrats lost the majority by veering too far from grass-roots values, which is very different from saying that a decisive majority was created on the basis of white racial fears. Most of all, Mr. Carter makes too little of the way in which the national rhetoric and even the beliefs about civil rights have changed, becoming more distant from the Wallace legacy rather than carrying it on in coded form.
Still, whether or not one agrees with all of Mr. Carter's thesis, this biography is a very good one, likely to stand for a long time as the definitive work on one of the country's most interesting and disturbing recent historical actors.

HEADLINE: Learning Accepts New Offer From Broderbund Software

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 8

 BODY:
The Learning Company accepted a sweetened merger offer from Broderbund Software Inc. today and rejected a competing offer from Softkey International Inc. But it was still not clear which bidder will prevail.
Under the revised terms, Broderbund's offer is valued at $555 million, representing a 13 percent increase from the previous offer. Broderbund would pay 0.92 of a share of its common for each share of the Learning Company, valuing the Learning shares at $59.685, based on Broderbund's closing price today. 
 Under the previous offer, Broderbund would have paid 0.8125 share for each Learning share.
The new offer remains below the cash and stock offer from Softkey. That is valued at about $64 a share.
Analysts said Broderbund's offer had the advantages of board approval from the Learning Company, and of being tax-free. But some said arbitragers and other short-term holders of Learning might opt for the higher cash value offer.
"We still have the superior economic offer and it's up to the market to decide what the future of the Learning Company will be," Kevin O'Leary, Softkey's president, said in a telephone interview. He said Learning's premium-priced products were out of step with trends in the market. "They're working on the economics of yesterday," he said. "Softkey says that's changing. I'm confident we're going to win this."
Pressing its campaign, Softkey said it delivered demands to Learning today from holders of more than 10 percent of its common stock for a special meeting of stockholders to vote for a new board of directors.
The Learning Company, based in Fremont, Calif., is best known for Reader Rabbit and other educational programs. Broderbund, based in Novato, Calif., is the producer of the Carmen San Diego series and other educational programs.
Softkey, based in Cambridge, Mass., produces primarily budget-priced software sold from racks, but has decided to move aggressively into educational software with this proposed deal as well as the recently planned acquisition of the Minnesota Educational Computing Corporation.
Learning's shares closed at $60 today, down $1 in Nasdaq trading. Broderbund closed at $64.875, down 62.5 cents, and Softkey shares closed at $34, up 6.25 cents.
Learning said its board believed the resources and business philosophies of Softkey would not enable Learning to realize its market potential. It said the board "views the Softkey business model as unlikely to achieve long-term business or financial success."
While Softkey's executives blasted Learning's board and management in statements today, under the terms of the Broderbund offer, Learning management would remain in place, and be given two seats on Broderbund's board.
"We believe that the management of the Learning Company is one of its key assets," said Broderbund's president, William McDonagh, in a telephone interview. "We're looking at a merger with a successful company that is doing a lot of things right. The last thing we want to do is alter that chemistry."
Mr. McDonagh said that the relative cash value of the two deals was open to interpretation, and in any case, changed every day with shifting prices of the stocks involved. But he said the combination of Broderbund and the Learning Company was a better fit. "The important consideration is what is the long-term value to the shareholders of the two companies together," he said. The Learning Company agreed.
"The merger with Broderbund represents a compelling opportunity for us to achieve our strategic objectives and enhance long-term stockholder value," said Bill Dinsmore, Learning's president and chief executive. "The odds are Broderbund will persevere if the situation remains about where it is," said Vince Turzo, an analyst with Jeffries & Company in San Francisco, noting that the difference between the offers was only about 7 percent. "As long as the spread is less than 10 percent, the outside directors can make the case that Broderbund's offer is a cleaner, simpler offer, non-taxable, and that Broderbund's shares are a higher quality piece of paper than Softkey's," he said.
But Keith Benjamin, an analyst with Robertson Stephens & Company, thought Broderbund's sweetened offer might still not be high enough, particularly if more than half of Learning's stockholders were arbitragers. "I don't think we've seen the end of it," he said.

Markets Skeptical, the Peso Falls Again

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 8

 BODY:
The peso slid again today to a record low against the dollar, signaling stubborn skepticism in the markets about the Mexican Government's economic management and recovery program.
At the close of trading, the peso stood at 7.80 to the dollar, down from 7.475 on Tuesday. It reached its previous lows in March, 7.4 at the close and 7.75 intraday in the midst of acute financial turmoil. 
 Today, the peso continued to slip in spite of a series of Government measures in the last two weeks intended to confront chronic weaknesses in the Mexican economy. The stock market declined as well, with the main stock index here falling 21.53 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 2,234.47.
Wall Street had clamored for some of the Government's steps, yet they did not appear sufficient to rebuild the confidence of investors who remember the burning they took in the botched devaluation of the peso last December.
The Government's growing credibility problem, largely based on doubts in the financial markets that it has a realistic outlook for the economy, puts Mexico in a bind. Any move to shore up the peso could only signal to speculators that the Government recognizes some underlying weakness in the economy and might further encourage a selloff in the currency.
Another problem is that volume on the peso market has been extremely low, with relatively few buyers seeking dollars, but virtually no one buying pesos. This lack of liquidity magnifies peso fluctuations against the dollar because the peso is vulnerable to nervous investors and speculators, analysts said.
In Washington, Treasury officials declined today to comment on Mexico's latest economic problems. But the peso's fall puts them in a difficult position, because the last rescue of the Mexican currency was deeply unpopular in Congress and provoked some Republicans to start investigating how Mexico's financial problems became so severe last year while the Clinton Administration was reassuring the public that the economy was sound.
Administration officials have consistently urged Mexico this year to follow the sort of free-market policies that it employed this week. In particular, Mexico raised interest rates to prop up the peso.
On Tuesday night the Mexican Government, in an indirect slap at speculators, increased short-term interest rates to 54 percent. American analysts had been calling for the rate rise to discipline the peso market. But the increase did not induce peso buying today, and might have raised fears of exacerbating this country's recession. Indeed, cries of pain rose from Mexican business leaders who have been crushed by the high cost of credit.
Perplexed officials said the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo had not been able to fight its way out of a hangover of market perceptions based on its handling of the financial crisis last December and early this year. But the Government has also failed, some analysts said, to forcefully rebuff challenges to the peso by traders.
"There is no reason or economic basis to explain what we are seeing. The only thing we can do is keep our blood cool," the spokesman for the economic recovery program, Alejandro Valenzuela, said today.
Since Oct. 31 the Government has announced a new pact with business and the unions to stimulate growth, an overhaul of the pension system to promote domestic savings -- a step considered crucial to build Mexico's currency reserves, and a program of incentives for agriculture. A budget to be unveiled by Nov. 15 is expected to include cuts in public spending.
"What's going on is different from what you would expect, judging from the economic plan. It all seems to be lost in the market turbulence," said Mauricio Gonzalez, director of Grupo Economistas Asociados, a consulting firm here.
Every week since the peso began to fall anew early last month, tugging Mexican stocks with it, a new explanation has emerged from the pits -- worries about third-quarter corporate earnings, political fretting about the Zaptista rebels, whacky rumors about official resignations and military unrest.
At least one common denominator has been widespread disbelief in the Government's projections of 3 percent growth in the gross domestic product and only 20 percent inflation in 1996, which Mr. Valenzuela reiterated today. Many private economists do not believe that Mexico will show sustained growth before the end of next year.
"It is not that the Government omitted the obvious; it's that there is no obvious," one economist, Jonathan Heath, said. "The markets have seen that there is no magic solution around to give us growth right away, and we're stuck with a muddling-through policy."
This week, conservative critics in the United States warned that the Mexican central bank was expanding the money supply too quickly and further undermining the peso. The bank was obliged to respond with a statement showing that the increase it initiated on Oct. 27 was a long-planned move to anticipate regular year-end increases in demand.
Official reserves dipped late in October, prompting market jitters, but recovered by last Friday, increasing $593 million in one week, to $14.1 billion -- more than enough to cover Government obligations.
Last spring, President Clinton arranged nearly $50 billion of international credit for Mexico to prop up the peso, of which $20 billion came from the United States. The Mexican Government has borrowed $12.5 billion of the American credit line, and repaid $700 million of it, meaning that it still has the right under the agreement to borrow up to $8.2 billion more. The Mexican authorities are widely believed to have borrowed relatively little of the remaining lines totaling nearly $30 billion.
Mexico and its foreign investors have become used to forceful leaders like former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a master at constructing an image of strength around his economic programs. But both President Zedillo and Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz have elected to deal with currency instability by ignoring it, at least in public. Neither has referred to it, and both have chosen instead to soldier on with political and economic reforms.
"Apparently, the market needs an even larger injection of general confidence-building measures," said Luis R. Luis, head of emerging-market debt research at Scudder, Stevens & Clark in Boston.

HEADLINE: Court Panel Says Foreigners Share Rights of Free Speech

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 8

 BODY:
In a case fraught with implications for international relations as well as constitutional law, a three-judge Federal panel ruled today that foreigners in this country have the same right to free speech as American citizens.
Civil liberties lawyers called the ruling perhaps the most significant challenge to date of the 43-year-old McCarran-Walter Immigration Act, which was nurtured by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and passed at a time of great public concern over communism. Over the years the law has been used to bar several prominent Marxist authors and intellectual dissidents from visiting the United States. 
 "It's a landmark decision," Mark Rosenbaum, legal director of the Los Angeles office of the American Civil Liberties Union, said of today's ruling by the panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. "It means that when the Constitution talks about rights for all people, it means what it says. There's not a visa check on the First Amendment."
David Cole, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center and a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, who argued the case on appeal, said: "This is a great day for all immigrants in this country. The court's decision means that immigrants can speak and associate as freely as citizens and that they need not fear deportation for their political views."
A spokesman for the Justice Department said tonight that the department had not yet been notified of the court's decision and could not comment on it.
Today's ruling arose from the case of seven Palestinians and a Kenyan who were arrested at gunpoint in 1987 in Southern California and ordered deported by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The defendants, who became known as the L.A. 8, were originally charged with subversion under a section of the McCarran-Walter act that prohibits foreigners in the United States from promoting world communism.
The immigration service based its decision on the grounds that the eight supported the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization that has claimed responsibility for airline hijackings in the 1970's. All eight are avowed Palestinian nationalists but deny being members of the Popular Front.
Most of the eight were admitted to the United States on student visas. After their arrest, they were taken into custody by the immigration service and held in maximum security for nearly three weeks.
Civil liberties groups protested the arrests and said the Reagan Administration was using the guise of national security and employing the McCarthy-era law to deport people with no personal history of violent acts. Among the organizations defending the eight immigrants' right to free speech were the civil liberties union and the American Jewish Committee.
In its original complaint, the Government argued that each defendant belonged to "an organization that causes to be written, circulated, distributed, published or displayed, written or printed matter advocating or teaching economic, international and governmental doctrines of world Communism."
The defendants argued that they were being selectively prosecuted. In court documents, they noted, that the Government did not seek to deport other similarly situated aliens aligned with organizations that the United States supported.
The ruling today rejected in the broadest terms the immigration services' efforts to deport the eight, saying "because we are a nation founded by immigrants," the First Amendment free speech provisions are "especially relevant to our attitude toward current immigrants who are a part of our community."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 10, 1995

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about an appeals court ruling on the free speech rights of foreigners in this country included a Jewish organization incorrectly among defenders of the rights of eight immigrants who were ordered deported because of their support for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. A detailed account of the immigrants' case was published in 1987 in Present Tense magazine, formerly published by the American Jewish Committee; the committee did not come to the defense of the eight.

Frugality that could backfire: cutting U.S. research subsidies.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
CONGRESSIONAL Republicans are putting Government on a diet. But how much of the weight to be lost will be fat?
Take the case of science and technology. Few areas of Federal spending can be as easily justified as basic research, where investments are too risky for most companies and the fruits of their efforts cannot be protected by patents. Yet according to President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, the Republican budget resolution would cut research financing by 30 percent over the next seven years. 
 Nothing would be lost, of course, if that 30 percent would otherwise have gone to what Roger Noll, an economist at Stanford University, dismisses as "pyramid building" -- Big Science projects with little social value. But that is not how the system seems to work. More likely, Mr. Noll suggests, the money will come from programs with the weakest political constituents -- typically the ones that generate the highest returns for the economy.
Of the $173 billion the National Science Foundation estimates was spent on research and development in 1994, $62 billion came from the Federal Government. And of the $62 billion, 58 percent went to what the foundation classified as basic research and 35 percent to applied research as opposed to development.
The categories are a bit arbitrary: research and development can range from the abstract (what is the weight of a neutrino?) to the practical (what lubricant will keep a machine gun from jamming in a sandstorm?). But the underlying logic seems quite sensible to most economists.
In general it pays Government to support research and development because, as a half-dozen studies have confirmed, the total return to the investment averages 50 percent annually. And since the economic spillovers are very large -- one's invention will almost inevitably produce windfalls for others -- private businesses lack adequate incentives to create productivity-enhancing technology unless they are subsidized.
More specifically, economists suggest, it pays to put a disproportionate amount of the Federal effort into basic research, where there is little chance of an appropriable commercial payoff and the difference between the social rate of return and the return to a private business is likely to be greatest. Expecting AT&T to invent the transistor was a stretch; asking it to spend stockholder money to investigate the origins of the universe would be a joke.
Despite the enthusiasm for research and development in the past, Zvi Griliches, an economist at Harvard, says that the consensus for spending huge sums on basic and applied research (in contrast to commercial development) is fragile.
With the end of an era in which every expenditure could be justified in the name of competition with the Soviet Union, the coalition of businesses, government labs and university-based scientists that had supported a big Federal research budget fell to squabbling over thinner slices from a shrinking pie. Meanwhile, Mr. Griliches says, companies have become less willing to pick up the slack in their own labs: competition has driven once-fat companies like AT&T and I.B.M. out of research unlikely to generate quick profits.
To bolster support for holding the line on Government R & D, the Clinton Administration has evoked the specter of Japanese competition. While America is cutting basic research, Japan is increasing it: nonmilitary research financed by the Japanese Government is expected to exceed American spending for the first time in 1997. And if the Republicans have their way, Japanese spending will be two-thirds greater in 2000.
That does not impress Mr. Griliches, who sees the potential for "free riding" on Japan's scientific endeavors in the next decade, just as Japan has ridden on America's efforts in the past. "We'd be better off if someone else did it," he said.
But America is going to keep spending money on research. And there is broad concern that politics will cut the quality of the research and development financed by Washington along with the dollars going into it. Mr. Noll offers the example of NASA's space station, which will apparently survive the budget cuts albeit with reduced financing. "All the money will end up in hardware," he predicted, with little or nothing left for the research that was the rationale for putting hundreds of tons of equipment into orbit.
Joseph E. Stiglitz, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, has yet another worry. The Administration is proud of its record in supporting pre-commercial development, as it did with the Internet. And Mr. Stiglitz fears that lessons in how to get a bang for a buck will be lost in the rush to shrink the research role. The better the Government is at allocating subsidies, he suggests, the harder it is to sustain support for them. "Nobody has a guarantee of subsidies in the new world of competition for subsidies," he said.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 8

 BODY:
The semiconductor industry displayed surprising strength in a report today, with its leading indicator rebounding beyond analyst expectations and easing Wall Street's fears that the technology boom might be crumbling.
The Semiconductor Industry Association reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18 in October, reversing a brief decline to 1.15 in September from August's 1.17 and from July's record of 1.23. 
 The book-to-bill ratio compares orders with shipments: a number more than one indicates positive growth, and a ratio of 1.18 indicates that for each $100 of chips shipped during the month, $118 of chips were ordered.
The carefully watched book-to-bill ratio was reported after the stock market closed, but it pleasantly surprised Wall Street, which had been unnerved on Tuesday by news that Cirrus Logic Inc., a maker of customized chips, had lost a big order from the Intel Corporation.
The news sent technology stocks reeling Tuesday. Though many technology issues rebounded today, adding fuel to a strong stock-market rally, semiconductor stocks continued to fall. [Page D12.]
"There's going to be a little bit of sunshine in technology markets tomorrow," said Charles Bouchet, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, a San Francisco investment bank. "We thought that this was a one-company perturbation, and this book-to-bill number vindicates us."
The one company appears to be Intel's client, Packard Bell Electronics, the nation's fourth-largest maker of personal computers. Packard Bell rushed to prominence last fall after it picked up a decisive edge over other computer makers by slicing its prices on PC's used in homes.
Now with PC makers like Compaq Computer and AST Research sharpening their emphasis on lower-priced products, it appears that Packard Bell may be in danger of giving up some market share from the last Christmas season. Such competition means that the demand for chips for the personal computer industry is at least likely to remain stable.
Most analysts said today that the stock market had overreacted to the Cirrus Logic news, but they also said they were impressed by the breadth of the strength in the semiconductor industry that the latest month's book-to-bill number represents.
The latest report also revised upward the September ratio, to 1.15 from an earlier estimate of 1.11.
The association, a trade group based in San Jose, Calif., forecast that the North American market would grow 40.2 percent, to $47.1 billion, by the end of the year. Moreover, the group's forecast indicates that seasonally adjusted bookings for chips had surged 55.7 percent, to $4.90 billion, from October 1994 bookings of $3.15 billion.
"We were looking to high the 40's and we got 55.7 percent," said Thomas Thornhill 3d, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "It was a little more strength than we had been expecting."
Not only does there seem to be continued strength in PC markets going into the Christmas selling season, but there also seems to be resilience beyond the sector, he said.
"A lot of the electronics companies we talk to that are not tightly tied to the PC market are doing very well in areas as diverse as data communications, telecommunications, consumer electronics and automotive," Mr. Thornhill said. He noted that there are also indications that the PC business is poised to have a solid Christmas season.
The semiconductor industry has been among the most sharply cyclical. In recent years, however, as new markets for microelectronic consumer products have opened, the industry has been sheltered from downturns. The semiconductor industry has recorded book-to-bill ratios exceeding 1.10 every month this year.
Mr. Bouchet of Hambrecht & Quist said that a rich variety of consumer markets were emerging which could create fresh demand for chips.
"The Internet is going to create a tremendous demand for higher-speed communications in the home," he said. "We're looking forward to I.S.D.N. digital telephone communications and cable modems going into the home. There's a lot of pent-up demand that has yet to surface." I.S.D.N. refers to integrated services digital network technology, which allows voice and computer data to be transmitted over the same phone line simultaneously.
A wild card affecting forecasts of future demand for personal computers has been the different assessments of how quickly Windows 95, the Microsoft Corporation's new PC operating system, will be adopted and whether it will lead to a wave of purchases of the new hardware needed to provide more horsepower to run the program.
Analysts said the inventory of computers pre-loaded with Windows 95 was relatively lean going into the Christmas season.

HEADLINE: W. M. Rountree, 78, A U.S. Ambassador From 1959 to 1973

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
William M. Rountree, who served as a United States ambassador in Asia, Africa and Latin America from 1959 to 1973, died on Friday in Shands Hospital in Gainesville, Fla. He was 78 and lived in Gainesville.
He had been under treatment for cancer, family members said. 
 Mr. Rountree came to diplomacy by way of the Treasury Department, which lent him as a budget specialist in 1941 to the Lend-Lease Administration, a vital component of President Roosevelt's efforts to sustain Britain, and later the Soviet Union, against Hitler's onslaught.
He was then chosen by Ambassador Loy Henderson as his principal assistant in Cairo directing United States economic operations in the Middle East. Ambassador Henderson sponsored Mr. Rountree's entry into the Foreign Service, where he soon was given responsibilities for economic and political affairs in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa.
Mr. Rountree became a close aide of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. As an Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Rountree was deeply involved in the 1956 Suez crisis and in the 1958 unrest in Lebanon.
He was appointed Ambassador to Pakistan in 1959, to the Sudan in 1962, to South Africa in 1965 and to Brazil in 1970. He retired in 1973.
Mr. Rountree was born in Swainsboro, Ga. He earned a bachelor's degree and then a law degree by attending night classes at Columbus University in Washington. Columbus later became the Catholic University Law School.
He is survived by his wife of 49 years, the former Suzanne McDowall; a daughter, Susan Hanes of Chicago; two sisters, Mary Roberts of Decatur, Ga., and Sara Thomason of New Orleans, and two grandsons.

HEADLINE: A Voyage to Bedlam and Part Way Back;
Yale law Graduate, a Schizophrenic, Is Encumbered by an Invisible Wheelchair

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
The most interesting feature of Michael B. Laudor's resume can only be glimpsed between the lines. Sprinkled among the stellar nuggets of his life, from graduating summa cum laude from Yale University in three years to being awarded a coveted postdoctoral associateship at Yale Law School, are references to his work as a mental-health advocate and a consultant on ethics in psychiatric research.
Mr. Laudor, 32 and by all accounts a genius, is a schizophrenic who emerged from eight months in a psychiatric unit at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center to go to Yale Law School. His success is about many things: the efficacy of new drugs in treating mental illness, the support of family, friends and colleagues and the steely refusal of a young man who became very sick at age 24 to be capsized by his disease. 
 But shadowing his progress is always the question whether to reveal himself as a person with schizophrenia, the most common major mental illness -- afflicting 1 in 100 people -- and the most disabling.
"Some people at Yale Law School told me not to tell anyone because mental illness is a career killer," he said. "They won't let you work in law firms, they won't let you work as a professor."
Mr. Laudor is now looking for a job as a law professor in the New York area. After finishing his postdoctoral work last year, he avoided saying why he never clerked for a judge or worked in a big law firm. The truth was that he could not handle the pressure and long hours. But he told interviewers such work would not offer him enough intellectual stimulation, an answer he concedes was "incredibly arrogant-sounding." He got no offers.
This year, he is telling schools about his illness, even highlighting his involvement in mental health. The reaction is mixed. One interviewer asked if he was violent, which Mr. Laudor said reflected a common and painful stereotype. Another said, only half-jokingly, that Mr. Laudor's self-awareness would be refreshing, since a half dozen faculty members should probably be treated for a mental disorder.
On the outside, Mr. Laudor, who divides his time between his apartment in Riverdale in the Bronx and his mother's house in New Rochelle, N.Y., seems composed. Tall, with fine features and big round glasses, he is charming and well dressed and makes the right amount of eye contact. As he quotes from Virgil's "Aeneid" and talks about synapses and dendrites with the ease of a neurologist, the pyrotechnics of his intellect are on full display.
Yet underneath, the schizophrenia and the side effects from the risperidone, the medication he takes to keep the psychosis in check, are percolating. "I feel that I'm pawing through walls of cotton and gauze when I talk to you now," he said. "I'm using 60 or 70 percent of my effort just to maintain the proper reality contact with the world."
Dubbing himself a "flaming schizophrenic," Mr. Laudor said that his decision to make his illness public and work closely with others with mental disabilities was a political and religious one. He is chairman of the Westchester Consumer Empowerment Center, part of the nonprofit Westchester Independent Living Center in White Plains, and a consultant to the New York State Psychiatric Institute in Manhattan.
 
'I Can Be A Role Model'
"I am a religious person, and there is a notion in Judaism of tikkun olam, or to heal the world, and we are all, as a nation of priests, called upon to do our part to heal the world," he said. "People with schizophrenia are negated constantly, and I can be a role model. I can stand up and say I am a person with schizophrenia who has been a senior editor of The Yale Law Review, who is a reasonable candidate to be a law professor.
"And if I am not doing that, I will be doing something else of value to society."
Schizophrenia is often marked by a break with reality, paranoia, hallucinations, agitation, withdrawal, blunted emotions and diminished functioning. Some people do not respond to medication, and many do not have the constancy of support that Mr. Laudor has had from friends, relatives and a talented psychiatrist.
Yet others do recover, or struggle through their symptoms to live independently and hold jobs.
"If somebody in a white coat tells you you have a terrible disorder and you're never going to get better, chances are a whole group of people are going to buy off on that and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy," said Dr. Courtenay M. Harding, a psychologist who is associate director of programs for public psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.
Dr. Harding has studied 269 severely ill patients discharged from the back wards of a Vermont mental hospital in the late 1950's. In the community, the patients, half of them schizophrenic, were given therapy, social support and job opportunities. Two-thirds of the patients "improved considerably or had fully recovered" 25 years after discharge, according to the study, published in 1987 in The American Journal of Psychiatry.
Growing up in New Rochelle, Mr. Laudor was a standout from an early age. He often cut classes to play jazz guitar but got A's anyway. He read "Ulysses" and "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich." He scored so high on the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test that he was chosen to take part in the prestigious summer program of the Telluride Association in Ithaca, N.Y.
Mr. Laudor breezed through Yale in three years, using the credits the university gave him for the advanced placement courses he took in high school. He had never been happier. The creativity and intelligence that made him different in high school let him fit right in at Yale.
His first job after college was with Bain & Company, a management consulting firm in Boston. His dream was to make enough money in 10 years so he could support himself writing fiction. But after several months, he experienced what he now thinks was his first brush with illness. He thought his phone lines at work were tapped.
He left abruptly and moved to an apartment in his hometown overlooking Long Island Sound to begin writing. For a while, things seemed to get better. But in 1987, his first psychotic break occurred after a confluence of traumas: his grandfather's death, a breakup with a woman and rejections of his short stories.
He began to imagine that some musicians he jammed with once a week were part of a cult. Then he began to hear bells in the night, and embellishing a line from Psalm 130 about "watchmen for the morning," thought his neighbors were ringing bells to keep watch for the dawn outside his bedroom window.
Schizophrenia usually hits in late adolescence or early adulthood and can retard social development. In Mr. Laudor's case, onset of the disease in his mid-20's probably worked to his advantage, since he had already acquired knowledge and skills and reached emotional maturity. Mental illness runs deep on his father's side of the family.
After seeing a series of psychiatrists, he was hospitalized at Columbia-Presbyterian in upper Manhattan, where he received a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, a type of schizophrenia that also involves depression. It was a harrowing eight months filled with torturous hallucinations, but it was also the beginning of his recovery, thanks in part to antipsychotic medication.
 
A 26th Birthday 'Crying on My Bed'
"Everyone around me was screaming lunacy, and at first I got worse and worse," he said. "My reality was that at any moment they would surgically cut me to death without any anesthesia. I spent my 26th birthday there crying on my bed."
But he had visitors: friends, cousins, parents, rabbis. "I was afraid of them because I was so paranoid," he said, "but it was still a link with reality that filtered through to the subconscious mind."
The next stop was Futura House, a halfway house for the mentally ill in White Plains, where Mr. Laudor went to a day program at St. Vincent's Hospital in Harrison. He received one-on-one, family, group and art therapy. His hallucinations and paranoia became manageable.
The people at St. Vincent's said he was well enough to handle a job and suggested Macy's.
"They saw me as a very high-functioning schizophrenic but not a very high-functioning person, and what high-functioning schizophrenics can do is limited," he said bitterly. "I could aspire to working a register at Macy's."
His father, Charles, accompanied him to Macy's at Herald Square to observe a cashier in action. She was besieged by snippy customers, and Mr. Laudor's father predicted that he would be back in the hospital in six months if he took the job. Instead, his father urged Michael to go to Yale Law School, where he had applied just before becoming ill.
Guido Calabresi, dean of the law school, set the tone for the next three years. The dean told him that he was in a sort of invisible wheelchair and that he would place ramps wherever needed.
 
Few Classmates Knew of His Illness
He told only a small number of classmates that he had schizophrenia. When his fingers stiffened from the medication, they typed for him, and when his vision blurred, another side effect, they read to him. "I went to the most supportive mental health care facility that exists in America: the Yale Law School," he said.
Far from knowing that Mr. Laudor had a severe mental illness, the other students were somewhat in awe. "There were two people in our class who were far and away much more brilliant than everyone else, and Michael was one of them," said Diana Jarvis, a corporate lawyer in Manhattan who went to law school with Mr. Laudor.
By the end of law school, Mr. Laudor had so impressed his professors that they asked him to join the school as an associate. For two years, he did research, published articles and attended faculty workshops. When it was over, in spring 1994, he applied for teaching jobs at law schools in the New York area, wanting to stay close to his family and doctor.
But lacking experience, he got no nibbles. He sank into a depression, which coincided with his father's entering the hospital with prostate cancer. The depression was treated, and Mr. Laudor devoted the next year to his father, an economics professor at Adelphi University who died six weeks ago.
Now, he is once again sending out resumes. Those who know him well are guardedly optimistic.
"I think somebody who has the abilities Michael does should have an easier time than many because he is so talented," said Mr. Calabresi, now a United States circuit judge in New Haven. "He is a brilliant young person who has conquered what is always difficult -- an illness -- but has conquered it extraordinarily well."

HEADLINE: Both Sides Stiffen Lines In Showdown On U.S. Debt

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration and Congress danced toward the deadline for national default, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin always knew he had a few tricks up his sleeve to keep the finances of the United States afloat.
Even if the Republicans in Congress failed to act, he could tinker with the way the Government invests in two huge trust funds, and play other accounting games that could keep the Government from defaulting for the first time in 200 years. 
 Now, Republicans have come up with a plan Mr. Rubin finds even more unthinkable than default: the House is on the verge of passing a bill that would briefly raise the debt limit, but only if President Clinton agrees to strip away the Treasury department's ability to maneuver after that extension expires in mid-December. The political motive is clear: the Republicans want to force Mr. Clinton to sign their budget, or eventually be the man who pulls the trigger on sending the country into default.
It is a game that Mr. Clinton's aides insist he will not play. Mr. Rubin, who has been at the center of the arguments with Speaker Newt Gingrich over the issue, has said repeatedly in recent days that he will advise Mr. Clinton to veto a debt extension now -- before the Republican budget is ready -- rather than tie his hands in a fight over a veto next month.
A senior Treasury official, told reporters today that the Republicans were "greasing the skids toward default" by denying the Treasury the ability to maneuver.
The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said: "There is no backdoor way for them to write a budget that's unacceptable for the President."
But the Republicans, too, are holding firm."Our members believe they came here as a majority to balance the budget and quit borrowing from our children and grandchildren," Mr. Gingrich said. "And they are seeing a White House which refuses to negotiate."
Sorting out the bluster from the reality over this issue has never been easy, and even now Republicans seem divided over how far to push their effort to tie Mr. Clinton's hands. On the one hand, they want every negotiating advantage they can get; on the other, they do not want to be blamed for a default, which many experts believe could send interest rates up and roil the financial markets.
The markets themselves have, so far at least, viewed all this as a familiar game of chicken. There is a widespread assumption that the issue will be resolved before Nov. 15, when nearly $25 billion in interest payments must be made to holders of United States securities. The next day, more than $40 billion more in interest and principal comes due.
But the market's assumption is based on past experience, before a Republican majority took control of Congress for the first time in 40 years, and before the debt limit became a symbolic issue for Republican freshmen determined to diminish Government.
There are hints that the game has changed considerably. The question is whether both sides will refuse to blink and send the United States into what would presumably be a brief default on its obligations. Some Republican supporters on Wall Street have said that such a default might be acceptable, particularly if it forced the White House to agree to greater deficit reduction.
The main impetus for the restrictions on the debt has come from the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bill Archer. Under a debt-limit extension he pushed through on Tuesday night, the Government could borrow an extra $67 billion, enough to take it through early December. But the bill, in its current form, would require the Treasury to lower the debt limit to $4.8 trillion, or $100 billion less than the current level, in mid-December.
The bill goes to the House floor tomorrow, and other conservatives are hoping to put additional items on it there, perhaps including the elimination of the Commerce Department. President Clinton has already vowed to veto any bill that eliminates the department.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Is Selling Vista Hotel

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Stepping up efforts to turn over some assets to private companies, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has reached a deal to sell the New York Vista Hotel in the World Trade Center to the Host Marriott Corporation, people involved in the negotiations said yesterday.
The agreement, which the authority's board is to vote on today, is the latest and biggest move in recent years by the authority to shed businesses that are not related to its core areas: transportation and commerce. The authority is overseen by two Republican Governors, George E. Pataki and Christine Todd Whitman, who have cut its budget, causing large-scale layoffs. 
 Senior officials at the authority declined to comment yesterday on the sale of the Vista, but one person familiar with the deal said the price was about $140 million. Nick Hill, a spokesman for Host Marriott, which owns 88 hotels, mostly in the United States, also declined to comment.
Governor Pataki's office yesterday released a copy of a letter he had sent to the authority's board, urging it to approve the sale of the Vista at its meeting today. "It is my belief that the people of New Jersey and New York will benefit from the port divesting itself of ancillary activities," Mr. Pataki wrote.
The sale comes at a favorable time for the authority. The hotel industry in New York City is recovering from a prolonged slump and hotels are being snapped up at the highest prices in years.
The authority began exploring whether to put the 820-room Vista on the market last year after it had spent $65 million on renovations and repairs to the hotel from the terrorist bombing at the World Trade Center in February 1993. The attack closed the hotel for more than 20 months.
The Port Authority bought the Vista from the Kuo Corporation for $78 million in 1989, when it was also expanding into such economic-development ventures as industrial parks. But in recent years, authority officials have begun to question such projects, arguing that government should not be dabbling in real estate or hotels.
That includes the World Trade Center itself, which the authority built in the early 1970's. The authority will soon receive a report from an investment bank on whether it should sell all or part of the trade center. And it recently sold parts of its industrial parks in Yonkers and Elizabeth, N.J.
The authority's new executive director, George J. Marlin, has repeatedly vowed to concentrate on improving service at its core holdings, including the region's three major airports, the PATH commuter railway, six bridges and tunnels and marine terminals on New York Harbor.
Kathleen A. Donovan, the chairwoman of the authority, would not discuss the pending sale of the Vista specifically, but she emphasized that the authority no longer had any interest in operating hotels.
"The Port Authority has some wonderful opportunities, but running a hotel doesn't have to be one of them," she said.
Anthony E. Shorris, who resigned earlier this year as first deputy executive director of the authority, said that even before the bombing at the trade center, the authority considered selling the hotel.
"The port took over the hotel when there was a business dispute going on between the then-current owner and the management company," he said. "The port stepped into the breach at that time, whether wisely or unwisely in retrospect, but certainly it became clear over time that the right thing to do was fix it up and make it ready for sale."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Repeating his warnings against lax lending practices, the Clinton Administration's top bank regulator issued a new study today that suggested that the offers of credit cards and home equity loans pouring into the nation's mailboxes may indicate a worrisome willingness to ignore risks.
The figures show that banks have relaxed their credit standards for some consumer lending, said the regulator, Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency. 
 While there have been a few signs in recent days of a slowing in consumer borrowing, heavy spending financed with loans has underpinned much of the current economic expansion. Economists have been divided over whether to worry about how many of these loans will be repaid or about what happens if the lending stops.
Bank regulators have been more worried about the effect on bank balance sheets if many risky loans are not repaid the next time the economy goes into a slump. Banks are allowing borrowers to post less collateral, pay smaller initial fees and spread their repayments over more years, particularly for home equity loans, according to a survey of the Federal examiners for the nation's 40 largest federally chartered banks.
"I continue to be concerned that in their efforts to be competitive banks should not lose sight of the effect of new lending on the risk in their portfolios," Mr. Ludwig said in his warning to the chief executives of the nation's 3,000 federally chartered banks, which was dated Nov. 7 and released today with the survey.
Mr. Ludwig ordered the study of bank lending practices last April, when he issued his first strong warning to bankers against making loans to risky applicants. Today's review covered lending during the 12-month period ended last May; aides to Mr. Ludwig said they did not have more recent information.
But private analysts said that there was considerable evidence that banks continued to pursue low credit risks with zeal as they strive to make as many loans as possible.
"More banks are making it easier for the less creditworthy to borrow," said Robert K. Heady, the publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, a weekly newsletter based in North Palm Beach, Fla. "There is internal pressure within institutions to drive up their loans and increase their revenues."
Mr. Heady said that Mr. Ludwig's warning to bankers last April had showed little effect. "If anything, we've seen a loosening of lending standards thus far this year," he said.
But today's survey and comments by other regulators suggested that banks had avoided lowering their standards for large loans to companies and other big borrowers. "Credit quality has been holding up very well, and in fact is somewhat improving," said William McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a telephone interview this afternoon.
Analysts and politicians alike played down the possibility that risky loans would cause bank failures in the next economic downturn, in turn draining the industry's deposit insurance fund and forcing another bailout by taxpayers. The concerns that Mr. Ludwig expressed today "must be understood in the context of the positive news that American banks are in an unprecedentedly strong position to provide capital to American business, and the Bank Insurance Fund has never been better capitalized," said Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who heads the House Banking Committee.
Today's survey found that Federal examiners believed 19 of the 40 big banks had "eased somewhat" their lending standards for home equity loans.
By contrast, only nine banks appeared to have eased their credit standards for commercial and industrial loans, while 15 banks were exposed to less risk in that category.

Dollar Rises Against the Mark, But Slips Back in Yen Trading

 BODY:
Despite another tumble in the Mexican peso, the dollar advanced against the German mark yesterday, which weakened because of a stronger French franc and hints of lower interest rates in Germany.
But the dollar fell against the Japanese yen. Currency traders sold dollars after a report from Japan showed that investors there were not sending as much money overseas as was thought, thus indicating less of a demand for dollars. 
 In New York late yesterday, the dollar fell to 102.58 yen from 103 on Tuesday. It rose to 1.4216 marks from 1.4160 marks and to 1.1465 Swiss francs from 1.1389 francs. The British pound slipped to $1.5794 from $1.5801.
The Mexican peso fell as low as 7.82 to the dollar yesterday, surpassing a previous intraday low of 7.750 to the dollar on March 9. It settled at 7.80 pesos to the dollar, compared with 7.475 late Tuesday.
Indications of further cuts in German interest rates hurt the mark. A key short-term rate on two-week repurchase agreements dropped yesterday, and Hans-Jurgen Krupp, a Bundesbank policy maker, said further rate cuts were possible.
Also yesterday, the French franc continued to strengthen against the mark after a shake-up in the French Cabinet.
The currency markets received more details yesterday about the United States' purchases of dollars last summer. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that American monetary authorities had bought a total of $1.53 billion, paying in Japanese yen and German marks.
At its quarterly press briefing yesterday and in a separate report on the period to Congress, the New York Fed said the interventions took place on July 7, Aug. 2 and Aug. 15.
On July 7, the New York Fed's foreign-exchange trading desk bought $333.3 million with yen, in coordination with the Japanese central bank. On Aug. 2, again in concert with Japan's monetary authorities, the United States bought $500 million with yen.
On Aug. 15, the New York Fed said its trading desk bought $300 million with yen and $400 million with marks in an operation in the London, Frankfurt and New York markets. This operation was coordinated with both the Japanese and German monetary authorities, the New York Fed said.
All three operations were confirmed at the time by the Treasury Department.
"At the start of the period, the mood of the market seemed to be that the dollar was undervalued," Peter R. Fisher, executive vice president of the New York Fed, said at the press briefing.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Rise On Optimism Over Budget

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices moved sharply higher yesterday, bolstered by optimism that an agreement on the Federal budget and debt limit could soon be reached.
The rally was also fueled by technical factors, including short-covering. 
 Yesterday was the first time in four sessions that prices rose. Buying was prompted in part after the House Ways and Means Committee late Tuesday adopted a plan to raise the debt limit from $4.9 trillion to $4.967 trillion, but only until Dec. 12.
While the Republican-controlled Congress and the Clinton Administration are still far apart on a debt limit agreement, the fact that Congress was taking some action on the issue raised expectations in the market that an accord would soon be reached, which could set the stage for another cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 25/32 to 10813/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.25 percent, from 6.30 percent on Tuesday.
Prices were also bolstered by purchases by the Federal Reserve, which was in the market to buy bills of all maturities. The operation, known as a bill pass, injects reserves permanently into the banking system, but does not signal any change in interest rate policy. The last pass was on May 31, when the central bank bought about $4.5 billion of bills.
Shorter-maturity bills, particularly the six-month and one-year bills, were up substantially because of the Fed's activity.
Traders noted other factors supporting Treasury prices, including a steady dollar and demand from European buyers amid speculation about a cut in German interest rates, which would make American securities more attractive in comparison.
James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International of San Francisco, a market research and analysis firm, said market participants were reluctant to take large positions yesterday ahead of the Government's report on producer prices, which is due out today.
Expectations that the Producer Price Index would show encouraging news on inflation also forced some investors to cover their short positions, which are in essence bets that prices will fall.
While concerns eased over the budget battle in Washington, the lack of an agreement continued to affect Treasury auctions. The Treasury announced yesterday that it was postponing the one-year bill auction that had tentatively been scheduled for today. The Treasury has already postponed sales of new 3-year notes and 10-year notes.
Few investors expect a default by the Treasury, traders said, which is why the market has shown so much resiliency amid the political fracas.
In other trading, the futures market remained bullish yesterday, said Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst at Thomson Research of Boston. She said the market could support a rally pushing the price of the December bond contract to118 15/32 . "If the market pulls back before reaching this target, it would be a buying opportunity," she said. The December contract closed yesterday at 1187/32 .

HEADLINE: Few to Pursue Claims Against New York Life

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
The New York Life Insurance Company said yesterday that the vast majority of its three million policyholders who were offered a settlement arising from claims of improper sales practices had decided not to fight the company. An agreement was reached in August by the company and lawyers who had filed class-action lawsuits contending that New York Life had used improper sales activities. Customers who bought life insurance policies with investment features between 1984 and 1992 were offered a choice: They could do nothing, which meant accepting the company's offer, or they could tell the company that they wanted to pursue their grievances before arbitrators hired by the company, or, if they wanted, in court.
Under the settlement, customers who accepted the company's offer can choose between receiving loans with low interest rates or buying additional amounts of life insurance or annuities at prices the company said were lower than its ordinary offerings. Customers who wanted an arbitration hearing or a day in court were required to tell the company by Oct. 31 that they did not want to participate in the agreement. 
 Only about 6,000 customers told the company they wanted to pursue their grievances, while about 450 wrote to object to the terms of the settlement. But many of the objections will be disallowed, said Walter Shur, a consultant to the company, because they were filed by people who did not accept the settlement.
Although the settlement was praised by some regulators and consumer advocates as a reasonable alternative to class-action lawsuits, it was criticized by others, including some customers who said they did not understand their policies and had an equally hard time understanding the company's offer.
Joseph Belth, a professor emeritus of insurance at Indiana University and the author of "Life Insurance: A Consumer's Handbook," was critical of the agreement because the Oct. 31 deadline was not disclosed in the three-page letter announcing the offer and did not appear in the 14-page description of the offer until page 11. He added that it was unfortunate that the court hearing to approve the settlement was set for next Wednesday, or more than two weeks after the deadline for deciding whether to participate.
New York Life officials said the value of their offer to consumers who did not choose to seek arbitration could be as little as $50, and they estimated the total cost of the settlement, including arbitration awards, at $65 million. Law firms handling the class-action lawsuits, led by Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach in New York and Arnzen, Parry & Wentz in Covington, Ky., may collect another $22 million if the plan is approved by a judge in New York next week.
"For people who think they were improperly sold a policy, that is what the A.D.R. process is for," Mr. Shur said, referring to alternative dispute resolution, or arbitration, hearings.
For others, who did not feel misled but were upset because the investment returns on the policies fell from double digits in the mid-1980's to 7 percent or lower now, he said the company was making the offer to maintain good will.
The settlement also covers customers who contend that they were improperly sold life insurance as an investment product or that they were persuaded to replace an existing policy with a new one when that was not in their best interest.

HEADLINE: Unwitting in California

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a Californian, I read with interest in your Nov. 7 front-page article that my state is leading the nation in building prisons, and paying prison guards more than schoolteachers. The irony here is obvious. Not only are prison guards now making more than many University of California professors, they will eventually put those professors out of work. 
 Rand Corporation studies show that over the next 25 years, implementing the state's three-strikes law -- heavily supported by the prison guards' union -- will cost the state an outrageous $5.5 billion a year. The money must come from somewhere, and because much of California's budget is tied up in entitlements or other mandated spending, higher education is going to suffer the most.
Californians may have unwittingly replaced the university system with the prison system when they voted for the three-strikes law last year.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Dow Chemical Gets Go-Ahead In East Germany

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Giving the green light to one of the largest state subsidies in Europe for a collapsing enterprise, the European Commission approved a plan today to allow the German Government to give the Dow Chemical Company $6.77 billion to rejuvenate a giant eastern German petrochemical complex.
The subsidy, approved earlier in the year by Bonn, is by far the largest bailout engineered under the vast privatization program for the former East Germany. 
 But the ultimate fate of the deal to revive the Buna plant in the eastern German city of Schkopau is uncertain, since the commission reduced the amount of the bailout that the German Government could give the American chemical company by $1.08 billion. Dow and the German Government agreed in April to a $7.8 billion bailout package.
The news produced a chilly response from Dow's European headquarters in Zurich, where officials said they had not seen any documents on the decision from the European Commission in Brussels.
The deal is the second biggest ever approved by Brussels, after the $9.3 billion French Government bailout earlier this year of Europe's largest bank, Credit Lyonnais. Substantial aid packages to private industry are subject to commission approval to insure that no government gives undue competitive advantages to any one company.
Dow, based in Midland, Mich., has a big operation in Europe and wants to expand eastward. "This is a very important investment for Dow, since it gives them assets at below replacement cost in the area they are working very hard to build up -- Eastern European commodity chemicals," said Paul Raman, chemicals analyst for S. G. Warburg & Company in New York.
Mr. Raman calculated that the acquisition could add up to 11 percent to Dow's profits, lifting the company's earnings by $1 a share. He also said that Dow was acquiring assets at about $550 million less than it would have cost to build a new plant.
"We are not in a position yet to comment on the specifics or what impact this would have on the privatization plan," said Marina Ashanin, a Dow spokeswoman. "Until we see the details and see the specific conditions that have been included in the approval, it is difficult to know whether it is on balance a positive or a negative."
However, Mr. Raman said he did not think that the changes imposed by the European Commission would kill the transaction, especially factoring in the lucrative market that could open up for Dow.
"It will make it not as attractive, but I still think they will do the deal," he said.
In many ways the Buna privatization is a landmark, since it represents not only the last huge privatization that the German Government will undertake in what was the German Democratic Republic, but also one of the costliest efforts by Bonn to preserve jobs and a viable industry in the area that previously had the largest chemical center of the Communist bloc.
Although the plant is commonly referred to as Buna, its official name is BSL Polyolefinverbund G.m.b.H., and includes the giant Buna chemical complex at Schkopau, a steam cracker at Bohlen some 30 miles south, and the Leune polyethylene plant in Merseburg, 20 miles to the west.
The Buna plant was originally a key factory of the I. G. Farben chemical complex, an industrial and research pillar of Hitler's Third Reich. The German Government's plan to spend billions on the bailout has not been without controversy. For example, Dow has agreed to maintain 2,200 jobs at the three sites and will pay heavy penalties if employment falls below 1,800. But that is below current employment levels, and only a tiny fraction of employment during Communist times, when it reached as high as 30,000.
The plan has upset tens of thousands of former workers who have lost jobs in an area where unemployment approaches 30 percent. Given the bleak outlook for new jobs, workers often say they long for the old days when all were guaranteed work despite punishing levels of pollution and grim working conditions. Indeed, the poor condition of the eastern German plants and their environmental problems have deterred many chemical companies from acquiring them.
Another contentious issue is the generous terms of the deal, which were kept secret during the negotiations with the German privatization officials. The magnitude of the bailout -- and thus the ultimate cost to the German taxpayer -- was not known until earlier this year when it was made public by the European Commission.
Under the the agreement, Dow will buy an 80 percent stake in the Buna complex, with the promised investment of $700 million in plant expansion by 2000, and an additional $880 million after that.
The German Government will keep a 20 percent stake, but Dow has the option to buy that stake by 2000.
Dow officials say they see the investment as opening a huge potential market. It gives the chemical giant a large plant close to the Eastern European markets as well as close to the Russian market, which they predict will expand in their demand for petrochemical products, particularly chlorine and ethylene products.
In taking over Buna, Dow also gets employees who are familiar with the business ways of the former Communist countries and who have a wide network of business associates there, as well as the ability to speak Russian and other Eastern European languages.
"They know the people who we want to have as our customers tomorrow," Ms. Ashanin said.

HEADLINE: MARATHON;
Briton, 34, Is Running For Money, Not Love

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
If he wins the New York City Marathon on Sunday, Paul Evans of Britain will have made an astounding progression from the unemployment line to the finish line. Seven years ago, he was working in a shoe factory outside of Norwich, England. His running career began, not out of an obsession, but out of economic necessity. He got laid off.
"What am I good at?" he asked himself when the Bally shoe factory closed in 1988. 
 Evans had played soccer in a semi-professional league, and while he said he could run effortlessly for 90 minutes, "My problem began when someone gave me the ball."
So soccer was out of the question. But running was an intriguing idea. He was 27 at the time and had jogged to get in shape for soccer. There was money to be made in road races. Why not give it a shot?
Two years after he began training seriously, Evans entered the 1990 New York City Marathon but suffered from dehydration and dropped out after 18 miles. In 1993, he finished seventh in 2 hours 13 minutes 36 seconds. Last April, he placed fifth in the London Marathon, lowering his personal best by five seconds to 2:10.31 -- among the 20 fastest times in the world this year.
On Sunday, Evans will attempt to become the first Briton -- and non-African or Mexican -- to win New York since Steve Jones in 1988. And if the rest of his body is 34, Evans feels his legs are younger in racing years.
"The registration on the car is quite old, but the engine doesn't have many miles," he said yesterday.
Something else Evans feels may be in his favor is the weather. Race organizers are preparing for what could be the coldest New York City Marathon in the race's 26-year history, with the possibility that temperatures will descend into the 40's with a northwest wind of 15 to 20 miles an hour. A cool day, Evans said, may insulate him from dehydration and the warm-weather-thriving Mexicans and Kenyans.
"The colder the better," Evans said. "Just as long as it's not hot."
Until a month ago, he had not planned to run a fall marathon. But he won a 30-kilometer (18.6-mile) cross-country race in Sweden, breaking the course record set by Douglas Wakiihuri of Kenya. After the race, Evans learned that Wakiihuri had set the course record only a month before winning the 1990 New York City Marathon. A seed was planted.
"It got my mind to thinking, if he can do it . . . ," Evans said.
His coach, John Bicourt, contacted New York race officials, and Evans joined the field that includes the 1994 champion, German Silva of Mexico. Already this year, Evans has set personal records from 3,000 meters to the half-marathon. In January, he shaved 50 seconds off Jones's British record for the half-marathon by running 60.09 in Marrakesh, Morocco. He said he would like to run under 2:10 on Sunday.
Thin and blond, Evans spoke with reporters yesterday while wearing sensible penny loafers instead of the standard running shoes. Once a cobbler, always a cobbler.
"It's funny how life works," Evans said. "Losing my job was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. If the factory was still open, I'd probably still be there, making shoes."
He had been an average runner in high school, Evans said, but at 16 or 17, he left to get a job in the shoe factory. Running required two things he didn't possess -- willpower and discipline.
"I had a little money in my pocket, and running looked too much like hard work," Evans said. "Like any youngster, hard work was something I didn't want to know."
After 10 years in the factory, however, Evans was laid off. Or in classic British understatement, his job was made "redundant" when the factory closed. He had a wife and two young sons to support, so Evans took to running.
But training 100 miles a week or more on pavement eventually left him with back pain. Now, he runs through the countryside of rural eastern England and avoids the roads except for racing. He has learned to train the way the Kenyans train, he said, where "your body is your coach and you run according to how you feel."
"It was the best apprenticeship I ever served," Evans said of his days in the shoe factory. "It made me realize how lucky I am. I've seen virtually all the world. I'm making a living doing something I love to do. Ten years in the factory was hard work. The pay wasn't great. I've seen the other side of the coin. When it's raining out and I don't want to run, I think of the factory, and I'm right out the front door."

HEADLINE: Cuba's Problem Is Castro, Not U.S. Embargo;
A Week in Havana

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Carl Rosenstein's Nov. 1 letter is a good example of how United States propaganda about Cuba can distort thinking. After a one-week trip to Havana, Mr. Rosenstein concludes there is prostitution everywhere, there is nothing to buy, there is a food shortage and the architecture "is returning to its original state -- sand -- from years of neglect." What's more, he knows about "the state of the society." 
 In coming up with these conclusions after one week, and in saying that the 35-year United States embargo has nothing to do with Cuba's economic crisis, Mr. Rosenstein is mouthing the distortions of the Torricelli-Helms-Mas Canosa troika. He could have written the letter before going to Cuba.

Intervening, Mexico Halts Slide in Peso

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Mexico's central bank stepped in today to stop the plunge of the peso, signaling that it would not allow a speculative frenzy to erode the currency further.
Officials confirmed that the bank had made a peso purchase in the final hour of trading, but did not specify the amount. Traders estimated its value at $200 million, large enough to halt the peso's downward momentum and to turn it around, amid very low volume on the market. The central bank intervened after the peso plunged early in the session below 8 to the dollar, another record low and a psychological threshold. 
 Its move strengthened the peso, pushing it back up to a rate of 7.55 to the dollar at the close of trading here, from 7.80 late Wednesday. The peso has lost more than 15 percent of its value against the dollar since the end of September.
[The rebound bolstered hopes in Washington that the peso's difficulties would not intensify into another international financial crisis. Page D2.]
The Mexican bank's decision to intervene today in the currency market followed its move on Tuesday night to raise interest rates more than 10 percent to make investments in pesos more attractive to buyers. But that did not quell a surge of speculative selling, nor did it attract new buyers, officials said.
"We have to send a message that the exchange rate should not be that high," a Government finance official said. "A desirable byproduct is to punish some speculators. The rate is totally unjustified."
And President Ernesto Zedillo, referring to the peso's current weakness, said, "Sooner or later, those markets will have to give in to the evidence that our economy is on solid ground."
The intervention marked the first time the central bank had entered the market since February. The bank had stayed away to show its determination to let the peso float freely, honoring free-market forces. In recent days, though, the bank has been criticized by economists and investors, who said it had raised interest rates too late to counteract increases in the money supply and a sinking currency.
The Mexican stock market also rebounded today, with the leading index climbing steadily throughout the day to close at 2,311.09, up 3.43 percent.
The currency market was jarred somewhat in the morning by an announcement from a group of private exporting companies that a plan they put forward for a $5 billion joint fund with the Government to stabilize the peso would not be carried out. Both executives and finance officials said the Government was eager to take advantage of the good will and the funds offered by private industry to steady the currency, but needed more time to work out a viable plan.
Mexican business's proposal had been received with dismay by some bankers here and from the United States, who feared that it might lead to veiled Government control of the currency market.
Separately, the Government introduced its bill in Congress today to reform the pension system and promote development by increasing savings. The bill would allow private managers to invest pension savings funds that, for the first time, would be controlled by individual workers.
But officials acknowledged that in the midst of a paralyzing recession, the peso's losses were derailing their statistical calculations for economic recovery programs and for the 1996 budget, which Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz is preparing for announcement by next Wednesday.
Mr. Ortiz gave a preview of the budget at a closed breakfast today with legislators from the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party. The Finance Minister insisted that Mexico could expect as much as 6 percent growth by the second half of 1996. Based on that report, the majority leader of the lower house of Congress, Humberto Roque Villanueva, said the proposed budget was balanced and "absolutely austere," equivalent to 17 percent of the gross domestic product and with a spending cut of about 1 percent.
No new taxes were proposed, and increases were for modernization of the state oil company Pemex, important public projects like highways, worker training and other programs to rekindle economic growth.

HEADLINE: Drug Makers' Managed-Care Ties Questioned

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Congressional investigators focusing on competition in the drug industry said yesterday that Merck & Company had profited from the relationship with its Medco drug distribution and managed-care unit in ways that merited close attention from the Federal Trade Commission.
Merck, as well as SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. and Eli Lilly & Company, paid billions of dollars over the last two years to acquire managed-care businesses, and securities analysts said the drug makers would have to increase sales of their own products to justify their investments. 
 The F.T.C., prodded by other drug companies, consumer advocates, pharmacists and the National Association of Chain Drugstores, has warned against using the managed-care companies, called pharmaceutical benefits managers, to gain unfair advantages in the market.
The General Accounting Office, in its report released yesterday, said that Medco Containment Services, and in one instance SmithKline's Diversified Pharmaceutical Services unit, had dropped some products that compete with top drugs of the parent companies from the lists of preferred drugs that health plans push their members to use.
G.A.O. officials said they were unable to obtain pricing and marketing information from Medco that would enable the agency to determine whether antitrust violations had occurred.
But the G.A.O., the investigative arm of Congress, said that "the extent to which Medco gave preference to Merck products" was good reason for the Federal Trade Commission to continue to monitor the Merck-Medco merger and similar relationships between manufacturers and the managed care units.
Consumer groups said they hoped that the report would strengthen the resolve of the F.T.C. to examine links such as the Merck-Medco relationship and SmithKline's ties to Diversified. As a condition of approving the merger of Lilly and PCS Health Systems, another big managed-care drug unit, in November 1994, the commission had said it would maintain close scrutiny over that relationship.
The G.A.O. report followed a consent agreement that Merck made last month with 17 state attorneys general, which requires Medco pharmacists to disclose their affiliation with Merck when they telephone physicians to urge them to switch patients to Merck drugs. PCS and Diversified said they would make the same kinds of disclosures.
Kevin Colgan, a Medco spokesman, said, "Our customers understand that we will give preferential status to drugs, including Merck drugs, when it is medically appropriate and when those drugs help our customers reduce their overall costs."
Drug makers whose products were dropped were guarded in their comments, noting that they had other drugs they wanted to sell to the powerful managed-care drug units.
The G.A.O. said 100 million people in the United States were in health plans served by at least 40 pharmaceutical benefits manager companies in 1993. Five big pharmaceutical benefit managers -- Medco, Diversified, PCS, Value Rx and the Prescription Service unit of Caremark International -- had an estimated 80 percent of the business.
While Congress is considered unlikely to act on the G.A.O. report, the Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to make new rules to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers, known as P.B.M.'s. At a Food and Drug Administration hearing last month, Stephen Stefano, a senior executive of Glaxo Wellcome P.L.C., the world's biggest drug maker, testified that "manufacturer-owned P.B.M. companies" had issued letters to doctors containing "unsupportable claims" that disparaged Glaxo products.
He said the drug companies, which he did not name, could not make such statements themselves under F.D.A. rules. Mr. Stefano added that Glaxo did not, however, want the F.D.A. to issue new regulations for P.B.M.'s.
In the enormous United States market for cholesterol-lowering drugs, Medco added two Merck products, Mevacor and Zocor, to its list in May 1993, two months before the Merck-Medco merger was announced. This year, Merck-Medco dropped Pravachol -- a competing Bristol-Myers Squibb drug -- which is in the same class of drugs as Mevacor and Zocor.
A fourth entry in that class, Lescol, made by Sandoz Ltd., was never allowed on the Medco list, a Sandoz spokeswoman said. Analysts said Sandoz had introduced Lescol last year at a price that was 49 percent below the prices of the Merck and Bristol-Myers drugs.
Helped by the publication of Merck-sponsored research that showed that Zocor helped reduce mortality rates, Zocor's sales rose 80 percent, to $460 million, in the first nine months of this year, Neil B. Sweig, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman, said. He said combined sales of the four drugs would be $1.94 billion in 1995.
Mr. Colgan said Medco's independent advisory committee determined that Lescol did not offer a "clinical advantage" over Mevacor and Zocor, and that rebates that rewarded customers who used a "bundle" of Medco drugs would eliminate the Lescol price advantage.
He said Pravachol had been dropped from the preferred list because Medco could no longer buy it at a price that offered "economic advantage to Medco's clients" who, he said, could still get Pravachol from Medco if they insisted on doing so.
Last year, Medco also dropped Zestril, a cardiovascular drug that Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, a company based in Britain, sells under license from Merck. Mr. Colgan said that because Zestril was identical to Merck's Prinivil, there was no reason to offer both drugs.
Joel H. Tau, a spokesman for Zeneca, said: "We are well aware that P.B.M.'s have the ability to move market share, either through the exclusion or inclusion of products. And those P.B.M.'s that are owned by drug companies, especially those that operate mail-order divisions, usually have preferred drug programs, which inevitably include the owners' drugs."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Mexico: Absent From the White House Crisis List

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Peso? What peso? 
 Last winter, a plunge in Mexico's currency threw the Treasury Department into weeks of emergency meetings and crisis planning. This week, the peso has seen its most serious slump since then, but Clinton Administration officials are saying little and doing nothing.
"I haven't been in a room where it has been discussed at all," a senior Administration political operative said.
The inactivity contrasts with the dire warnings issued by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin as President Clinton was pushing a bailout package early this year. But there are good reasons for this autumn's policy -- political and practical.
Listen to any number of Republicans, particularly Patrick J. Buchanan, and it is clear that they think the Mexican bailout is an issue on which the Administration is vulnerable. Mr. Buchanan has based a good bit of his Presidential campaign on attacking the bailout, and is running radio ads in New Hampshire contending that the billions in assistance to Mexico should have been used to offset cuts in Medicare instead.
And in practical terms, there is not much more American officials can do for Mexico. They have already set up lines of credit. Mexico does not appear to be in the same danger of default on its foreign debts that it was last year. Beyond that, there is a domestic budget battle that has lights burning late at the Treasury.
The result has been a policy of benign neglect, and a hope that the problem will go away without becoming any more serious. There was a small sign this afternoon that Mexico might be in control of its latest peso problem, when intervention by the Mexican central bank halted a 4.8 percent drop in the peso and turned it into a 3.4 percent increase by the end of trading.
In several important ways, Mexico's plight is not as dire as it was a year ago. Its reserves of foreign currency, which are needed to prop up the peso's value in international markets, are nearly three times as high as they were when the country was forced to devalue last December. Mexico did not have big lines of credit in place last year and had cut itself off from the International Monetary Fund. And Mexico was faced then with imminent default on nearly $30 billion worth of short-term bonds payable in foreign currencies within a few months.
With international help, Mexico has now paid off all but $2 billion of the short-term bonds. It has replaced them with debts to the United States, the International Monetary Fund and European bond buyers that will not mature for several years. So Mexico can make ends meet with a lot less foreign currency than it needed last year.
There is still some help in reserve. Mexico still has $8.2 billion it can borrow at any time from a Treasury line of credit set up last winter, and an additional $7 billion that it can borrow from a line of credit set up by the International Monetary Fund.
Mexico has also sharply reduced its trade deficit, which was bleeding the country of dollars at a rapid pace last year. As a share of the economy, the Mexican deficit, broadly measured to include investment royalties, was three times as large last year as the United States trade deficit. The peso's steep plunge since then has made foreign goods so expensive in Mexico that imports have slowed to a trickle and the Mexican trade deficit has largely disappeared.
But there are a couple of reasons why the latest drop in the peso could prove more serious than last winter's drop.
The Mexican Government has been forced again to push interest rates above 50 percent to attract investors. That was a heavy blow last winter, when the economy had been growing for several years. It is a heavier burden this year, when the economy is deep in a recession thatsome analysts fear could eventually lead to social unrest.
Mexico has also disappointed investors with its inability to maintain a steady value for the peso. Each sudden plunge makes it all the more difficult to restore foreign investors' faith in the currency.
A senior Treasury official said in an interview tonight that the best hope for Mexico was to keep to its current policies. "In the face of volatility, Mexican officials have re-emphasized the importance of sticking with their monetary and fiscal policies," said the official, who insisted on anonymity. "They have an excellent record maintaining tough economic policies. This is what they need to do."
But even if the peso does not collapse, there could be bad political news for the Clinton Administration. By making American goods more expensive in Mexico, the falling peso widens the American trade deficit there. That will make it still harder for the Administration to cite the North American Free Trade Agreement as a success during next year's election campaign.
Most Congressional Republicans have been reluctant to take advantage of the Administration's predicament, for fear of making Mexico's problems worse and being blamed for them. The exception is Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, who said tonight that both countries should stop trying to keep the peso from falling.
"The social fabric of the country is coming apart under the austere conditions," he said of Mexico, adding, "You have the seeds of social turmoil and revolution in place -- now you want to invest money in that system?"

HEADLINE: Weakness Shows in Producer Prices and the Job Market

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The fifth straight decline in energy costs helped push producer prices lower in October, and another report released today suggested weakness in the job market. Some analysts said the combination would give the Federal Reserve the latitude to cut interest rates, if needed, to stimulate the economy.
The Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index fell one-tenth of 1 percent in October, the third drop in five months. The decline was led by energy prices, but even excluding the volatile food and energy categories, the core index showed no increase in prices. 
 In the second report, the department said the number of new claims for unemployment benefits shot up by 9,000 last week, to the highest level since the summer. New applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 375,000, the highest level since they totaled 416,000 in the week ended July 15.
Some analysts said the Fed could act at its meeting next week, although others believe it will wait for the resolution of the Federal budget impasse and more economic data later this year.
Many believe that the central bank has achieved its objective of a "soft landing" for the economy -- slow growth without inflation.
"One day soon, the Fed might have to stand back and declare victory," said Eugene Sherman, an economist at M. A. Schapiro & Company in New York.
Prices of finished goods fell in October, and those that contribute to so-called pipeline inflation -- price increases in earlier stages of production -- remained muted.
"At least at the producer level, there are no price pressures in place or materializing," Mr. Sherman said. "Inflation is just not a concern at this time."
Analysts predicted that the Government's report on prices at the consumer level, to be released Wednesday, would show that they also remained under control last month.
"Consumers are still value conscious and selective," said Richard Berner, an economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "They are always shopping for bargains, meaning the retailer has to lure them with incentives."
Consumer prices rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in September, and for the first nine months of 1995, they were rising at a modest annual rate of 2.8 percent.
For the year so far, producer prices have risen even less. They have increased at an annual rate of just 1.4 percent, compared with a 1.7 percent advance in 1994.
Although producer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in September, the increase was driven by a 1 percent jump in food prices, the result of a summer drought that wilted vegetable harvests. Producer prices fell one-tenth of 1 percent in August.
The Labor Department said food prices held steady in October as vegetable costs fell 19.1 percent, retreating from their 38.6 percent increase a month earlier.
Energy prices dropped nine-tenths of 1 percent, even more than the decline of five-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier. Energy costs have fallen each month since rising six-tenths of 1 percent in May.
Heating oil costs fell 11.1 percent, the steepest drop since a 12.1 percent decline in January. Gasoline prices were down 2.7 percent and natural gas prices were down six-tenths of 1 percent. Electricity costs, however, rose five-tenths of 1 percent.
Prices for finished consumer goods other than food and energy increased one-tenth of 1 percent after an advance of three-tenths of 1 percent in September. Household appliances rose four-tenths of 1 percent, and the cost of furniture was up one-tenth of 1 percent.
Automobile prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent, the department said, reflecting 1996 "quality changes" that added an average of $167.06 to the cost of a car.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Early Peso Loss and Budget Fear Drag Down Dollar Against Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply yesterday against the Japanese yen and other currencies, dragged down by early losses of the Mexican peso.
The dollar began to slide against the yen in Tokyo trading overnight, and the resumption this morning of the peso's recent losses hastened the fall. 
 "Anyone with an interest in marks or yen versus the dollar either accelerated their dollar sales or postponed their dollar purchases," said Hubert Pedroli, a foreign-exchange manager at Credit Suisse.
The persistent weakness of Mexico's currency has been slow to affect the dollar, in contrast to last winter when the peso's plunge sideswiped the dollar. A weak peso affects the dollar because of the close economic ties between the two nations.
Yesterday, however, "the peso began having an effect on the dollar in general," Mr. Pedroli said. "The dollar had been weak versus the yen, but not the mark, and this morning it was weaker versus both."
The peso fell as low as 8.2 to the dollar in New York yesterday before the Mexican central bank started buying pesos to push its currency higher. By the end of the day, the peso had rebounded to 7.55 to the dollar, up from 7.80 late Wednesday.
Currency traders in the United States reported that the central bank had spent $200 million to buy pesos at a rate of 7.60 to the dollar. The bank confirmed that it was supporting the currency, but gave few details.
In other trading, the dollar settled at 100.40 yen in New York late yesterday, down from 102.58 yen on Wednesday. It fell to 1.4104 German marks from 1.4216 marks and to 1.1361 Swiss francs from 1.1465 francs. The British pound was unchanged at $1.5794.
The continued battle in Washington over the Federal budget also weighed on the dollar yesterday. Warnings of a debt default by the United States have rattled nerves, mostly among foreign dollar holders, and many are dumping dollars.
One result has been a swing back into yen, which had been shunned by many investors because of Japan's banking crisis and economic slump.
In Asian trading, the yen began to rally against the mark, the Australian dollar and the American dollar.
"It started as unwinding of yen trades put on a few weeks ago," said Paul Farrell, a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank. "There's been a change in perception about where the yen should be trading." That was underscored by a quick plunge in the Australian dollar, which had recently soared against the yen.

HEADLINE: Price Data Help to Push Stocks Higher

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stock indexes set record highs for a second consecutive session yesterday, as stocks were spurred by a slip in the Producer Price Index and a resurgence in technology shares.
"The combination was a real bright spot for stocks," said Barbara G. Marcin, vice president of Citibank Global Asset Management. "The weakness in producer prices confirmed the scenario of low inflation. And since technology has been leading the stock market, the strength in the group was good for stocks." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 11.56 points, to close at 4,864.23, surpassing the record set on Wednesday. Among broader market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 1.55 points, to 593.26 -- its 66th record high of the year.
And the Nasdaq composite index, which did not participate significantly in Wednesday's surge, soared 17.65 points, to 1,065.59, bolstered by the surge in technology stocks.
Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange, though, narrowly topped declines, 1,173 to 1,066. Big Board volume totaled 380.8 million shares, up from 366 million shares Wednesday and the recent average daily trading of 347 million shares.
Traders were encouraged at the start of the session by the Government's report on October producer prices, which indicated that inflation remained in check. Prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers eased one-tenth of 1 percent for the third time in five months. That report, and another showing a rise in new claims for unemployment benefits, reinforced the hope of some investors that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates again this year.
But such optimism was overshadowed in the bond market by growing worries about the fight in Washington concerning the Federal debt ceiling and the risk of a default. The 30-year Treasury bond dropped 15/32 in price; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.28 percent from 6.25 percent.
Technology stocks posted sharp gains, led by semiconductor issues bouncing back from their recent retreat. Fueling the rally was a semiconductor industry report, released late Wednesday, that showed orders for computer chips were stronger than expected. Shares of Micron Technology Inc. soared 3, to 65; those of the Intel Corporation rose 3 1/16, to 69; Applied Materials Inc. gained 4 1/4, to 52, and the Oracle Corporation advanced 2 3/8, to 47 1/8.
Financial-industry issues also moved higher as the prospects for lower interest rates brightened. Shares of Merrill Lynch & Company rose 3, to 60 1/2; those of Morgan Stanley Group closed at 89 5/8, up 2 1/4; J. P. Morgan closed at 77 7/8, up 3/8, and the Nationsbank Corporation closed at 69 3/8, up 1 1/2.
In contrast, oil stocks were weak, reflecting the fall in the price of crude oil shown in the producer price report. Shares of Texaco Inc. declined 3/4, to 68 3/4; the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company eased 3/8, to 123 1/2; ARCO dropped 1 3/8, to 108 5/8, and the Chevron Corporation fell 3/8 a share, to 47 3/4.
The Kmart Corporation, which said that it would delay the release of its third-quarter earnings by three days to Thursday, sunk to its lowest level in nearly 13 years. The stock of the discount retailer fell 3/8, to 7 7/8; it was the day's most active issue, withtrading of more than 15 million shares.
Shares of Hamburger Hamlet Restaurants Inc. plunged 1 3/4, to 1 3/16, after the company said it might file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Kulicke & Soffa Industries advanced 3 1/4, to 32, after the company resumed normal production of its semiconductor assembly equipment.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Concern Over U.S. Default Trims Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell yesterday after a White House statement on a possible default by the Government unnerved the market.
The selloff came even after a report on producer prices showed moderate inflation growth, which ordinarily would have heartened the market. 
 Prices declined early in the session after the White House spokesman, Mike McCurry, said he saw no chance that the Government would avoid a shutdown next week. Mr. McCurry's comments came as Republicans put the final touches on a stopgap spending measure that the President has promised to veto. And while the spokesman stopped short of saying a default was inevitable, he called it increasingly likely.
Few traders and analysts say they believe the Government will shut down because of the impasse over the Federal budget. But the talk of default from the White House yesterday was enough to deflate the market's optimism that an agreement between President Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress on the budget and debt limit could soon be reached. On Wednesday, that optimism lifted the price of the 30-year bond by 25/32.
Yesterday, it appeared that "both sides in Washington will attempt to use the capital markets as a battering ram as either an indicator or validator of their respective positions on the issue," said Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and manging director at ASB Capital Management, a Washington firm with about $6 billion of bonds under management.
After Mr. McCurry's comments, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell a half-point and remained near that level throughout the session. The 30-year bond settled at 107 30/32, down 15/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.28 percent from 6.25 percent.
Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said the market's reaction yesterday was fairly restrained given the pessimistic signals from Washington. "It looked more like tech correction than a deep-rooted concern that the debt ceiling will not be lifted," he said.
Mr. Dwyer and other analysts said yesterday's report on producer prices showed that inflation remained contained. The Labor Department said that the Producer Price Index fell one-tenth of 1 percent in October, in line with economists' expectations and the third drop in five months.
But the bullish data failed to move the market.
"While the market certainly feels heavy, and the rejection of today's friendly data is a red flag, the fact is key levels have not been violated and retail has not been selling," said David Ader, managing analyst at Technical Data. "It looks like we're going to experience contained sideways volatility, with a downward bias, until Washington gets something together."
Still, some economists saw hints of inflation in the producer prices report. Robert Brusca, chief economist at the Nikko Securities Company International, said the index's components showed that the weakness in prices was easing and called the Producer Price Index data "a report with a forked tongue."
In futures trading, the December bond contract settled at 117 19/32. "I like the way bonds withstood the test of fire at 117 13/32 for the December bond futures contract today," said Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst for Thomson Research of Boston. "I now think they are headed back up."

HEADLINE: Greater Poverty Tolls Is Seen in Wefare Bill

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration acknowledged in a new report to Congress today that a Senate bill to restructure the nation's welfare system could push as many as 1.2 million more children into poverty.
But White House officials still held out the possibility that President Clinton could sign the Senate bill if it were somehow to emerge intact from a House and Senate conference committee. 
 "He may have to accept that bill," said the White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry. Despite the findings on the bill's effect on children, Mr. McCurry said, the legislation is "within striking distance of something that's going to be acceptable to the President."
The report, which was requested by Congressional Democrats opposed to the welfare legislation, was done by the President's Office of Management and Budget. It comes close to duplicating earlier draft findings that the President received in September from his Health and Human Services Secretary but declined to release.
The Administration's position underscores the dilemma in which Mr. Clinton finds himself as he tries to make good on his 1992 pledge to "end welfare as we know it" but also tries to appease important elements of his base of support going into the election year.
In September, Mr. Clinton virtually endorsed the Senate version of a welfare overhaul. But since then, he has been under growing pressure from liberal Democrats in Congress and officials inside his Administration, as well as from women's groups and advocacy groups for children, to reconsider his position.
Initially today, some liberals said they were pleased that the Administration had documented the poverty that could result from the Senate legislation.
But their praise for the President faded when they heard that the White House was holding out the possibility that Mr. Clinton could still approve the Senate measure despite the findings.
"I don't think it took a genius to tell us the Senate bill would make more children poor," said Marian Wright Edelman, the president of the Children's Defense Fund and a longtime friend and supporter of the Clintons. "But now that you document it, how in the world could you support it? It's just unconscionable, and it's a failure of moral leadership on the part of the President."
But Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, said he thought House and Senate negotiators might be able to accommodate some of the Administration's recommendations. "We're going to have a good welfare reform bill, one that has and maintains the strong bipartisan support it had in the Senate," Mr. Dole said, "and one I believe President Clinton will sign."
But Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, was far less accommodating. "This new report by the Administration is a road map to another Clinton Administration flip-flop," he said. "He wants to hold on to the failed methods of our current welfare system and throw even more money at it."
The budget office study was released as House and Senate Republicans were pushing to complete a compromise welfare bill. Both the House and Senate measures would replace an array of Federal antipoverty programs with limited lump-sum payments that states could use as they wished to help the poor.
The House measure is more stringent and includes several provisions that are favored by conservatives to fight illegitimacy but have been rejected in the Senate and opposed by the President. Those proposals include one to deny additional benefits to women who had children while on the welfare rolls and one to deny cash benefits to teen-agers who had children out of wedlock.
In its study, the budget office analyzed the Senate measure, the House measure and a Senate Democratic alternative that fell by the wayside. It found that the House welfare proposal could move 2.1 million children into poverty, that the Senate bill could move 1.2 million more children into poverty and that the Senate Democrats' alternative would move 100,000 to 500,000 children into poverty.
The budget analysts said they had used an expansive definition of what counts as a poor person's income to reach their findings, including grants, like food stamps and housing programs, and the effects of taxes in calculating family income. The report noted that if the analysts had used the Census Bureau's definition of poverty, 300,000 children would be pushed into poverty by the Senate plan and 500,000 children into poverty under the House plan.
The budget report recommended some changes that could be made in the Senate welfare legislation to make it less onerous to poor children, including the following:
*Financing for child care for poor mothers could be permanently increased. The House version of the bill cuts child care financing, and the Senate's includes a $3 billion increase for child care, but only for a period of five years.
*States could be required to maintain their spending on welfare at a certain level and to maintain an adequate contingency fund so they could meet the growing need for welfare during recessions.
*More money could be provided to give bonuses to states that successfully moved people from welfare to work.
*States could be required to give parents vouchers for their children's portion of welfare benefits if the parents are cut off from benefits because they hit the five-year time limit without finding work.
The budget office also renewed calls for Congress to raise the minimum wage and to modify a number of its planned deficit-reduction measures that strike at the poor.
"What it adds up to in our view is that there's a great deal of room for improving the welfare bill as it moves through the conference process," said Alice M. Rivlin, the President's budget director. But she also would not say that Mr. Clinton would veto a measure that resembled the original Senate plan without such changes.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who was one of the Senators who requested the study of the welfare bill, said the Administration was unlikely to be able to moderate the Senate bill now because the conference committee would seek a compromise between the House and Senate bills, producing a more stringent measure than the Senate bill.
"Through 11 Presidents and 31 Congresses, we have tried to help dependent children and never, until now, have we undertaken to do them harm," Mr. Moynihan said.

HEADLINE: Energy Secretary Used Fund to Monitor Reporters

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary faced a storm of criticism today and the possibility she could lose her job after it was disclosed that she had spent thousands of dollars in Government money for a consulting firm to monitor the reporters who cover her department and to rank them as to how favorable they were.
Senior Clinton Administration officials said they were appalled by what they called her lack of judgment in paying $43,500 to Carma International, a Washington firm, to identify unfriendly press outlets. 
 Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said that Mrs. O'Leary's action, reported today in The Wall Street Journal, was "unacceptable." One senior White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mrs. O'Leary might be asked to resign.
Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, told reporters that he was greatly concerned by The Journal's disclosures and had asked Mrs. O'Leary to give him a full report by the end of the day. He turned away questions as to whether she might lose her job.
Another senior official said that Mrs. O'Leary was in deep trouble but that the White House would wait to see if she could ride out the storm. She was providing the White House a written explanation tonight and was expected on Friday to make her case in person to remain on the job.
Mrs. O'Leary, a former utility company executive, was traveling today in Louisiana, where she told The Associated Press that she had not asked for an evaluation of reporters but for an analysis of news coverage. She said it would have cost the department $170,000 to do the same job itself.
"There's no enemies list, no gumshoes, no investigators," she said.
Her Washington office had earlier arranged a conference call with dozens of reporters to answer questions. But she abruptly postponed the call after White House officials leveled their public criticisms.
But she was quoted later today by The Associated Press as saying the contract had been mischaracterized. "This was a simple effort to analyze the way the department disseminated its messages. Nothing more," she said.
Asked whether she considered resigning, the Secretary replied, "Of course not."
Mrs. O'Leary said the decision to conduct the media study was made in the department's public affairs office without her direct knowledge.
Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Democrat from Nevada, a state with extensive and sometimes contentious dealings with the Energy Department, demanded on the Senate floor today that Mrs. O'Leary herself reimburse the Treasury for the full amount of the consulting contract.
"I have very serious reservations about the judgment of Secretary O'Leary," he said. "Spending tax dollars to investigate and evaluate reporters and media coverage, complete with charts, is completely inappropriate. As Energy Secretary, she should be concerned with energy policy and not her image."
According to documents released with no hesitation today by chagrined department officials eager to show their openness with the press, Carma provided an evaluation of articles and news broadcasts about the department from December through July.
The study also ranked the top 25 favorable and top 25 unfavorable sources quoted in news articles about the department.
The documents showed that Carma had evaluated articles about the department and assigned scores -- on a scale of 1 to 100, with 50 being neutral -- to the reporters who wrote them. The research assistants at Carma tallied the number of references they deemed to be either favorable or unfavorable to assign a score to that reporter's work.
In the July report, H. Joseph Hebert of The Associated Press scored lowest with a 30.8 rating. "As far as I'm concerned, if you have too good a rating, you aren't doing your job," Mr. Hebert said today.
Scoring next-lowest was Matthew L. Wald of The New York Times, with a rating of 46.7.
Adding to the notion that the study was to be used to identify and work to change reporters who wrote unfavorably, Barbara Semedo, the department's press secretary, was quoted by The Journal as saying that the lower ratings "meant we weren't getting our message across, that we needed to work on this person a little."
The Carma analysis evaluated reporting on subjects as diverse as cleaning up nuclear waste, as well as perceptions of Mrs. O'Leary.
Joe Gaither, a senior vice president for research at Carma, said in an interview that under its approach, if a journalist scored an unfavorable rating, it did not necessarily mean the journalist was unfavorably disposed to a client. It might mean that the event was unfavorable. But he said Carma's research could tell a client how that reporter portrayed that event, compared with other reporters.
"All we're trying to do is analyze the news coverage and let our client know what's said being said about them and then to put it into a context for them with regard to other reporters," Mr. Gaither said.
He said the company, which was founded in 1984 and has offices in London, Toronto and in Sydney, Australia, in addition to Washington, does $3.5 million to $4 million in business a year. Most clients, he said, are large corporations.
Carma has also worked as a news-clipping service for Government agencies like the United States Postal Service.
In one sense, the work Carma did for Mrs. O'Leary is similar to what a Government press office does regularly, albeit in an informal manner -- evaluate how its agency is being covered. It is unusual, if not unprecedented, to have an outside consultant charged with that task and to have specific rankings for media outlets.
Mrs. O'Leary won praise early in her tenure for her willingness to disclose information on how the Atomic Energy Commission had conducted radiation experiments on unwitting human subjects. She said such secrecy was no longer needed, and moreover it was improper for a government to withhold such information from its citizens.

 BODY:
A United Nations tribunal indicted three senior officers in Serbia's Army today, bringing its investigations into war crimes in the former Yugoslavia closer than ever before to the Serbian political leadership and President Slobodan Milosevic.
The indictments, the first handed down for officials in Serbia rather than Bosnian Serbs, were announced by the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague as the Clinton Administration said a trade embargo on Serbia would be slightly eased. 
 The easing -- officially described by the State Department as a "humanitarian" gesture -- will allow natural gas into Serbia for an initial period of two months to heat homes and help offset the effects of a winter that has come early to the Balkans.
Since Bosnian peace talks began in Dayton, Ohio, eight days ago, Mr. Milosevic has insistently argued for some relaxation of the three-year-old sanctions on Serbia, officials close to the negotiations said. This preoccupation has tended to make progress on other issues difficult.
The fact that the indictments of Serbian officers came on the same day as a gesture was made to Mr. Milosevic that may improve the atmosphere at the peace talks illustrates the growing tension between the international tribunal's quest for justice and the West's determination to secure a peace deal to end the 42-month-old Bosnian war.
The tribunal indicted Gen. Mile Mrksic, Maj. Veselin Sljivancanin and Capt. Miroslav Radic on charges related to the killing of 260 men from the Croatian town of Vukovar after a brutal three-month siege of the town ended with its surrender on Nov. 19, 1991. They were then officers in the old Yugoslav Federal Army. They are now believed to be in Serbia.
On the day the town surrendered, soldiers and officers from the Serbian-dominated force entered Vukovar hospital, where at least 1,000 people had taken shelter in the hope of being rescued by international relief organizations. Men of fighting age were led away, never to be seen again. Most of them are now believed to be buried in a mass grave at Ovcara, near Vukovar.
At the time, the old state of Yugoslavia was still formally in existence, although Croatia and Slovenia had seceded in June 1991. Thus supreme command of the army attacking Vukovar lay constitutionally with the Federal Presidency, where Serbia's influence -- and thus Mr. Milosevic's -- had become completely dominant.
"These indictments will automatically take us further up the line," Graham Blewitt, the tribunal's deputy prosecutor, said in a telephone interview.
"We do assume in an army that a chain of command exists," he said. "Either we will find that specific direct orders did come down the line for what happened in Vukovar. Or, if these officers were acting independently, then those further up had a responsibility to stop or punish the illegal activity."
Over the last year, 43 people, most of them Bosnian Serbs but also a few Bosnian Croats, have been indicted by the court. But only one suspect, Dusan Tadic, a Serb from the northwestern Bosnian town of Prijedor accused of crimes against Muslims at the Omarska camp, is in custody in The Hague.
The most prominent among the accused are the Bosnian Serb political and military leaders, Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic. Dr. Karadzic did not come to the peace talks in Ohio because he would face arrest.
The tribunal's powers to bring those indicted to trial have proved limited up to now. But it appears that countries in the area that refuse to cooperate with the court may suffer economic and political sanction under any peace agreement. Moreover, any international forces policing a peace -- including American troops -- would be under an obligation to arrest indicted suspects if they encounter them.
Mr. Milosevic has consistently denied any responsibility for any war crimes committed during the Croatian war of 1991 or the Bosnian war that began in April 1992. The siege of Vukovar set the tone for the Bosnian war both in the brutality of the attack there on civilians and in the summary execution of many non-Serbs that followed its fall.
Both conflicts have centered on the Serbian minorities in Croatia and Bosnia who rejected inclusion in the two new states and wanted to retain their ties to Belgrade.
The Serbian President initially armed and backed these minorities, using the Yugoslav Army overtly in Croatia and acting in a more disguised way in Bosnia through the widespread use of Serbian militia groups and the creation of a Bosnian Serb army.
As early as March 1991, as Yugoslavia headed toward disintegration, Mr. Milosevic announced that he had "ordered the mobilization of special reservists and the formation of additional Serbian militia units."
The indictments today were the first handed down for officials in Serbia. Other indictments have involved Bosnian Serbs and have thus allowed Mr. Milosevic to say he could do little to secure the arrest of those concerned because Bosnia is another country.
The Serbian President will thus be faced with a delicate decision. Refusal to hand over the three men could mean that any economic aid promised under the terms of an eventual peace accord would not go to Serbia pending the arrest of the officers. Moreover, the lifting of all sanctions on Serbia could be delayed.
General Mrksic, who was a colonel at the time of the Vukovar siege, was sent from Belgrade last May to command the Serb-held area of Croatia known as Krajina. In August, when Croatia attacked, he led a hasty evacuation that left close to 200,000 Serbs as refugees.
By that time, it was clear to Western officials that Mr. Milosevic's desire to support Serbs outside Serbia had given way to an overriding desire for a peace that would secure his power. General Mrksic's actions in Krajina appeared to reflect this quest.
"The indictments today put direct pressure on Mr. Milosevic," Mr. Blewitt, the deputy prosecutor, said. "In the past Belgrade has been able to say that Bosnian Serbs were separate units and inquiries should be made in Pale. That's not possible now. Noncompliance will ultimately result in our informing the Security Council and could bring further consequences for Serbia."
Administration officials said that if Mr. Milosevic were ultimately indicted by the tribunal, he would be treated in the same way as Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic, who were indicted earlier this year. Since the peace talks in Ohio began, it has become clear that the Administration is determined to oust these two men as soon as possible.
But the Administration is now so deeply engaged with Mr. Milosevic as the most effective single vehicle in the Balkans for securing a peace that any eventual indictment would clearly be a very delicate political issue.
Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, said the decision to allow gas supplies into Serbia for two months was made on "humanitarian" grounds given the extreme cold in Serbia. Because it is such a measure, the United Nations sanctions committee can make the decision without a meeting of the Security Council. The formal decision is expected on Friday or Saturday.
It is clear, however, that Mr. Milosevic's deep preoccupation with sanctions relief has hindered progress in the peace talks. Up to now, little real headway on the most difficult issues of territory and governance in Bosnia has been made. "They only really got stuck into the thick of it in the past 24 hours," a senior official said.
To try to push the talks along, Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to visit Dayton on Friday. An announcement is expected on reinforcing the Muslim-Croatian federation, which has been under extreme strain. American officials hope that the consolidation of the federation will insure that a united front is presented to the Serbs in the more difficult phase of negotiations that will now begin.
The announcement will center on the formation of a federation customs union, the reunification of the divided city of Mostar, the return of refugees and other issues. Similar commitments have been made in the past and announced with some fanfare, only to make little or no difference on the ground where suspicions between Croats and Muslims are still virulent.

HEADLINE: Senate Joins House in Voting to Raise Medicare Premiums

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The Senate followed the House tonight in voting, largely along party lines, to increase Medicare premiums. In doing so, both chambers forged ahead without waiting for an overall agreement on how to redesign the Medicare program, which provides health insurance for 37 million people who are elderly or disabled.
It appears likely, but not certain, that Medicare premiums will actually increase in January. The issue is one of many tangled up in a huge confrontation between President Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress. 
 By a vote of 52 to 44, the Senate rejected efforts by Democrats to block the proposed increase in Medicare premiums. On Wednesday, the House, by a vote of 230 to 197, approved the increase in premiums as part of a stopgap spending bill.
The proposed increase in the monthly premium, to $53.50 from $46.10, is one of the most contentious parts of the Republican plan to cut projected spending on Medicare by $270 billion in the next seven years. Republicans said the change must be approved soon to take effect on Jan. 1, when the premium would otherwise drop to $42.50 a month.
The timing is important for several reasons. If the premium increases in January, it will be covered by a cost-of-living increase in Social Security benefits, which takes effect at the same time. Medicare premiums are deducted from monthly Social Security checks.
But if the premium increased later in 1996, the change would be more noticeable, and it might become a political issue in the Presidential election and in Congressional elections.
Republicans met today behind closed doors to iron out differences in the overall Medicare legislation passed last month by the House and the Senate. Social Security officials said they must have a decision on the level of Medicare premiums by Wednesday so they can write computer programs for the Social Security checks to be sent to millions of people in January. The premium will then be locked in place through April 1996, they said.
Republicans want to raise the premiums for all of 1996 as part of a stopgap spending bill that will finance Government operations through the remainder of this month. The bill is known as a continuing resolution because it provides "continuing appropriations."
Republicans said it was absurd to let premiums decline at a time when Medicare costs were growing more than 10 percent a year. Democrats said the Republicans were trying to sneak the higher premiums through Congress on the stopgap spending bill with inadequate debate.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said: "Cuts in payments to doctors are not included in the continuing resolution. Cuts in payments to hospitals are not included. The only Medicare cut in this bill is a proposal to impose a new tax on the elderly and disabled," in the form of higher premiums.
President Clinton cited the increased premiums as one reason he would probably veto the stopgap spending bill.
Republicans said that their proposal did not represent a radical change in Medicare because beneficiaries, overall, would still pay 31.5 percent of the cost of Part B of the program, which covers doctors' services and laboratory tests. For several years, Congress specified the dollar amount of the premiums. If there is no change in the current law the premium will be set to equal 25 percent of Part B and beneficiaries will pay $42.50 a month.
Representative Bill Thomas, a California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said that Democrats were "pandering to seniors" in demanding that the premium be allowed to decline.
Under current law, states must pay the premiums and certain other health care costs for Medicare beneficiaries with incomes below the official poverty level ($8,967 a year for an elderly couple). Martin A. Corry, director of Federal affairs at the American Association of Retired Persons, said there was no guarantee of such protection for elderly people in the stopgap spending bill.
"Any increase in premiums should be coupled with protections for low-income Medicare beneficiaries, just as in current law," Mr. Corry said.
Democrats said the proposed increase in the Medicare premium would reduce or wipe out the annual inflation adjustment in Social Security checks for many people.
Representative Bill Archer, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said that Republicans from the House and the Senate were close to agreement on many provisions of the overall Medicare bill. But they have not even begun negotiations with the White House.
The conferees said they were likely to drop a Senate proposal to increase the $100 deductible that beneficiaries must pay each year before Medicare will help pay doctors' bills.
The negotiators said they had also agreed to create a new trust fund to help pay the costs of training doctors, though many teaching hospitals would still face substantial cuts in Federal aid.
Mr. Archer said the House and Senate negotiators had agreed to make it easier for doctors and hospitals to establish their own health plans, which could then sell coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. These "provider-sponsored organizations" would compete with commercial insurance companies and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
The conferees are also expected to create incentives for elderly people to establish special savings accounts that would be used to pay medical expenses. But lawmakers said they had not agreed on whether to accept provisions of the House bill that would limit payments to victims of medical malpractice. Doctors have sought such limits, but consumer advocates oppose them.

Casino Plan May Not Be a Pipe Dream

BYLINE: By Evelyn Nieves 

DATELINE: WILDWOOD, N.J.

 BODY:
IT looks like a regular parking lot. Two and a half acres of blacktop, a few weeds and the remnants of a beer bottle or two behind Phil & Eddie's Bar and the Rusty Rudder Restaurant off the boardwalk.
But to many people here, the lot could be, should be, sacred territory.
They said so on Election Day. By more than 2 to 1 -- 1,081 to 491 -- Wildwood residents want the city to deed the unused municipal parking lot to the Delaware tribe of western Oklahoma for a casino. And although the referendum was nonbinding, city officials said they consider it binding. 
 "We put in an application for a binding referendum," said William Mitchell, the city's public works commissioner. But the Cape May County Clerk's office made a mistake, he said, and labeled it nonbinding. "It doesn't really matter. The voters are serious. We can now go ahead and try to get this to work."
Try being the operative word, of course. Of all the casino proposals floating around the country (Idea of the Week: gaming cruises off Staten Island's Navy home port), Wildwood's plan for an Indian casino at the parking lot sounds like one of the most farfetched.
Ever since Chief Larry Snake of the Delaware tribe came to town in August and declared the parking lot ancestral Indian land, state officials have practically laughed off the notion as a pipe dream.
Mr. Mitchell said the city has remained undeterred, despite Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's "serious concerns" about gambling outside Atlantic City. Even despite Congressman Robert G. Torricelli's bill to ban Indian casinos outside of reservations. And especially despite the 12 casinos gloating on the landscape just 30 miles away.
MANY people here consider Atlantic City the root of Wildwood's evils. They say Atlantic City stole Wildwood's tourists, and now they want them back.
"The gradual decline started after three or four casinos opened up," said John Nickels, who owns Nickels' Midway Pier, an array of arcades, shops and food stands. "Wildwood was the most successful resort on the East Coast. Now, you can shoot a cannon down the middle of the city and not hit anyone."
He was not kidding. After Labor Day, the city's street lights start blinking and the boardwalk that so many teen-agers have considered the reason for summer stands unamused, empty. The eight-block business district looks like a set for a Rod Serling fantasy. It's one boarded-up building after another, with hardly a place open to get breakfast.
Ten years ago, if you were a teen-ager from Pennsylvania, Delaware or New Jersey looking for a beach, Wildwood was it. Next to this blue-collar Riviera, the famous Victorian inns of Cape May seemed so prissy. But there aren't as many teen-agers as there used to be; even at the height of summer, the motels are only 80 percent full.
And Wildwood is tired of hibernating nine months a year. It hurts in obvious ways. Unemployment hovers at about 30 percent. The city, with about 5,000 year-round residents, is saddled with foreclosed properties. It plans to auction 40 lots and buildings next weekend.
Wildwood has the same rationale as other towns betting on a casino for revival: it is worth a try. The city began scouting for an Indian tribe to call its very own three years ago. It found it in the Delawares of Anadarko, Okla., which Chief Snake said had been driven from New Jersey more than a century ago.
ON paper, the pact the city signed with the tribe sounds as exciting as any. The tribe would guarantee $8 million a year to Wildwood. The gaming hall would be alcohol-free, which would keep the 100 or so pubs in town happy; no casino hotel would be built to compete with the city's 10,000 hotel and motel rooms. First choice of jobs would go to Indians, but backers estimate that the casino would provide 2,000 jobs on the grounds and 8,000 in related services.
With all the hurdles, Mr. Mitchell sounds optimistic. (The state cannot prevent the building of a casino on a reservation, but whether it can stop one on land deeded to a tribe is a central question in a case in Federal court in Oregon.) "If we had one big thing -- a casino -- it could turn everything around," he said. "Determination often pays off."
The way he describes it, a casino does not seem so farfetched after all. He and others like to believe the rest of New Jersey is jealous of the plan. After all, when Wildwood first announced the idea, a councilman from Phillipsburg, clear on the opposite end of the state, announced that the Delaware Indians and their casino did not belong in Wildwood. With Phillipsburg right on the Delaware River, he said, the Delawares of Anadarko, Okla., have a much closer tie to ancestral land in his town.

HEADLINE: Home Values Are Higher in All Regions

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Helped by lower mortgage rates that spurred demand, the value of most homes rose sharply in the third quarter in all regions of the country, the National Association of Realtors said today.
The median price of existing single-family homes rose 4.6 percent in the third quarter to $116,200, from $111,100 in the second quarter. The third-quarter price was 4.3 percent higher than the third quarter of 1994, when the median price was $111,400. The median is the midpoint; half the homes sell for more and half for less than that price. 
 Regionally, the median price rose 1.4 percent in the Northeast over the third quarter a year ago, 2.7 percent in the Midwest, 6.3 percent in the South and 4.2 percent in the West.

HEADLINE: Vestiges of Dictatorship

 BODY:
The Latin American delegation at the recent United Nations anniversary consisted of Fidel Castro and the representatives of 16 freely elected governments. That Latin America is home to only one clear dictatorship is a real success story. But as in former Communist Europe, elections in Latin America do not mean that true democracy is here to stay or even, in many places, here at all.
The democratization of Latin America is a sad song, and an old one. The end of the dictators was first heralded in the 1940's with elections in three nations. By the next decade, two of those had fallen to military dictatorship. In 1960 Paraguay was South America's only dictatorship. By 1976, in all of Latin America, there were only four democracies. Today military officials have made coup threats in Honduras, Guatemala, Chile, Peru and Venezuela. 
 A less visible but more common problem is that elected government has not brought an end to the abuses associated with dictatorship. Civilian government is no guarantee of respect for human rights. In four years in the mid-1980's, 6,000 people were killed or abducted by security forces in democratic Peru, the vast majority unarmed civilians. That is twice the number of murders and disappearances during the 17-year dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in neighboring Chile.
In many countries, military leaders tolerate civilian rule only as long as they retain the power they held as dictators. Many armed forces still own networks of banks and businesses, and control civilian agencies, such as the customs service, that provide opportunity for corruption. In most nations, officers are still tried for human rights abuse in military courts, where they are routinely acquitted.
Civilian governments violate human rights as well. One egregious example is the so-called "faceless" courts of Colombia and Peru, where the identity of judges is disguised. Defendants face Draconian sentences, including life imprisonment, in trials where they are often not confronted with the evidence against them. Although the United States Agency for International Development encouraged the creation of these courts in Colombia to protect judicial authorities in cases involving terrorists and drug traffickers, they have also been used to prosecute peaceful leftists.
The Clinton emphasis on trade is a vast improvement over the policies of past Administrations, which often openly backed dictatorship and military rule. But America still has an important role beyond that of buyer and seller. Washington remains the most important outside influence on the Latin sectors most likely to block democracy: military, business and agricultural leaders.
America should use its influence to support civilian leaders seeking to control their militaries. It should push governments to respect human rights, and encourage the growth of an already impressive array of independent organizations, such as human rights groups and peasant associations, that hold their governments accountable.
With the end of the cold war and reflexive American support of Latin military rule, prospects for lasting democracy in Latin America have never been better. But democracy in Latin America is a work in progress, and its courageous advocates still need American and worldwide support.
