HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Fed Vice Chairwoman's Comments Calm Wary Investors

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rate increases by several European central banks, led by the Germans, sent Treasury securities tumbling early yesterday before they rebounded on remarks by Alice M. Rivlin, vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve.
After a big drop in the market on Wednesday, when the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, warned that inflation might be on the horizon, Ms. Rivlin managed to soothe the bears. Mr. Greenspan's comments had raised concern that there might be an interest-rate increase in the United States, too, but Ms. Rivlin provided a calmer, gentler outlook on Fed policy in a CNBC interview, according to Timothy Rogers, managing economist at Technical Data of Boston. She indicated that the Fed did not want to slow the economy unnecessarily but that price pressures needed watching, given the strong pace of the economy. 
 The 30-year bond was up 6/32, to a price of 100 10/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.35 percent, from 6.36 percent.
The dollar fell against the German mark after the Bundesbank raised the rate it charges banks to borrow money to 3.30 percent from 3 percent. The repo rate, as it is called, is comparable to the Federal funds rate in the United States.
Traders and investors were concerned that foreign investors, whose purchases of American Government securities over the last year have helped support bond prices, might start reducing those purchases with more competitive interest rates now available elsewhere.
The German rate increase was surprising because of the sluggishness of European economies, and some analysts said it made it more likely that the Fed would now follow suit.
"With many European central banks raising short-term rates, it has become clear to investors that if they can do it, with softer economic growth rates, then it's quite clear that the Fed chairman's comments cannot simply be dismissed as a crying wolf attempt to moderate the gains in the financial market," said Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. "If the U.S. doesn't follow in the same direction, the risk is that the dollar will weaken, thereby adversely impacting the very same factors that have helped keep inflation at bay." With a weaker dollar, imported goods cost more in the United States, contributing to price pressures.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said that with inflation clearly the focus of attention, market participants are now eagerly awaiting today's Producer Price Index report for September. Most forecasts look for an increase of two-tenths of a percent or three-tenths of a percent, but the range is rather wide.
"However, while the P.P.I. is an extremely important inflation indicator, it does not include the service sector, and the bond market's direction and behavior will likely be more heavily influenced by both the retail sales and Consumer Price Index statistics being released next week," Mr. Fine said.
"After Chairman Greenspan's statement Wednesday," Mr. Fine said, "it is clear the Federal Open Market Committee would not hesitate to lift the Federal funds rate a notch and tighten monetary policy at the slightest hint of inflationary pressures."
On Monday, the Government securities markets will be closed in observance of Columbus Day. The Bond Market Association has recommended a 2 P.M. close for the Government securities market today, while the Chicago Board of Trade said it planned to close trading in its financial and insurance contracts at 1:10 P.M., though other contracts will observe the normal schedule.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 52-week bills:

HEADLINE: Markets Shake Off Turmoil But Finish the Day Mixed

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market shrugged off early worries about rising interest rates yesterday and helped push some broad indexes to record highs, but overall results ended mixed.
The losses came at the opening as traders began selling on news that all the major European markets had tumbled after the German central bank raised interest rates for the first time in five years. 
 But losses in the stock and bond markets were trimmed later in the day, another indication of how resilient the United States financial markets remain.
In early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 92 points, then quickly bounced back. At the close, the Dow was down 33.64 points, to 8,061.42. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 3.22 points, to 970.62.
Broader indexes fared much better. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 4.08 points, to 1,745.85, its sixth straight record high. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks gained 0.89 point, to 464.55, also a record.
"The will to believe and the desire to believe still remain stubbornly powerful," said Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in San Francisco. "The demand for stocks is simply greater than Wall Street can throw at investors."
A day earlier, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, rattled the markets by saying inflation might be looming. But even though investors have softened their bullish stance in the last two sessions, the selling has not been widespread.
"The market gave a good account of itself today," said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of technical analysis at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. "We certainly didn't see any emotional or panic-driven selling."
Indeed, Mr. Peroni said the market was only temporarily disrupted by Mr. Greenspan's remarks. Short of a policy move such as a change in interest rates, Mr. Peroni said, he does not expect the market to suffer any great losses.
The reason, he said, is that interest rates have been steadily lower this year, making stocks relatively more attractive, and early indications are that third-quarter earnings will be robust. As a result, Mr. Peroni said, few investors were overly troubled by Mr. Greenspan's remarks.
In fact, Alice M. Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the Fed, suggested yesterday that the central bank was not preparing to raise interest rates. "Nobody wants to slow down the economy unnecessarily," she said on CNBC.
Investors may have also cheered a strong earnings report from General Electric, a Dow component stock. Shares of G.E. rose 1/8, to 70 5/8, after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings.
Within the Nasdaq, shares of Cisco Systems rose 11/16, to 81 7/8. Novell Inc. rose 1, to 10, and Worldcom gained 5/16, to 37 1/8. Shares of oilfield service companies were also buoyant. The S.& P. Midcap Energy index rose 3 percent yesterday on optimism about third-quarter earnings. This year, the index is up 51.2 percent, easily outperforming the broader market. Analysts said that coming earnings reports could further bolster the market. The S.& P. 500 is up 31 percent this year, and the Dow is up 25 percent.
 But Ralph J. Acampora, director of technical analysis at Prudential Securities, said he was already wondering what to do when the stock market reached his bullish target.
At a luncheon meeting yesterday, Mr. Acampora -- who had earlier predicted the Dow would reach 10,000 by June 1998 -- said he was starting to think about when he is going to advise investors to start scaling back, even though his target date is still nine months away.
One reason he is concerned about getting out before the top is that he expects an ensuing drop to take the major indexes down by as much as 25 percent, which means some stocks could fall much more.
"I think it's foolhardy to catch the absolute top," he said. "So we will have to scale out of this."

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN FINANCE: THE VOTERS;
The Buzz in the Capital Brings a Yawn in Peoria

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., Oct. 9

 BODY:
As Washington was buzzing this week with talk of campaign finance scandal at the White House, Butch Long was pushing a heavy wheelbarrow on a dusty construction site here along the Illinois River.
Not once, he swore, did thoughts of campaign finance cross his mind. 
 "I'm bored with it," said Mr. Long, a 40-year-old concrete worker and Reagan Democrat who voted twice for Bill Clinton. "Can't they find something else to talk about out there?"
To put it mildly, people in this small Midwestern city are something short of alarmed about the tempest in the capital over money-begging phone calls, the curious generosity of foreign zillionaires and White House kaffeeklatsch videos that surface, by accident or design, with distinct tardiness.
"This does not top my list of national concerns," said Jan Pippin, 51, a secretary for the Salvation Army. "I'm less worried about how politicians raise their money than how they spend ours."
If the scandal off in Washington is not playing here, as dozens of interviews with Democrats and Republicans in this quintessential Middle American city seem to indicate, it is not because ordinary Joes and Janes simply cannot solve the arcana of a complicated case. Most people have a good grasp of the basics (although it is the rare bird, to be sure, who can distinguish "hard money" from "soft").
Nor does the absence of indignation mean that people have lost their appetite for a good partisan scrap or a juicy political scandal.
They just do not seem to think that this one measures up.
"The Republicans ought to just lighten up and let Clinton and Gore do their jobs," said Dave Dubicki, a 46-year-old lawyer who said he usually sided with the Republicans.
Mr. Dubicki said "some of these guys in Congress" reminded him of the police official in "Casablanca" who was "shocked, shocked," to find gambling going on in Rick's Cafe.
"I've noticed that George Bush isn't speaking out about how awful all of this is," he said. "Makes you think this has been a common way of doing things for a long time.
"Besides that, people really like Clinton. He seems like a good guy with a friendly smile. Nothing sticks to him. He's the Democrats' answer to Reagan."
Mr. Dubicki, in shirt sleeves on a glorious autumn afternoon, also noted that economic sunshine tended to put people in a more forgiving mood.
"If we had high unemployment and Jimmy Carter interest rates," he said, "we'd all be saying, 'Clinton's a bum, and we can see right through that shallow smile of his.' "
Even as it is, the Democrats in the White House are not without critics when it comes to fund-raising.
"I don't care if the law seems silly or nit-picky," said Chris Hamilton, a 35-year-old legal assistant. "In my business we're expected to do things exactly by the book, or we're in big trouble. Why shouldn't the same standards apply to the President and Vice President?"
But the concerns voiced by Mrs. Hamilton sound a bit faint in a time of so much exulting here about plentiful jobs and a stock market that has been headed for Pluto. One Republican, Dan Son, a 36-year-old deliveryman for the United Parcel Service, succinctly summarized many Peorians' view about any budding campaign finance scandal: "Big whoop."
Indeed, in these days of peace and prosperity, President Clinton's job approval rating nationally has remained strikingly healthy, rivaling that of Ronald Reagan at the corresponding point of Mr. Reagan's second term.
Peoria, hometown of Betty Friedan and Richard Pryor, is a Democratic-leaning city in a Republican-leaning Congressional district. The area is conservative on social issues, with a streak of populism and a solid core of unionized workers. The Congressional district was represented until 1995 by Robert H. Michel, a House Republican leader known for his genial bipartisanship and centrist instincts.
The city is still haunted by memories of economic disaster in the early 1980's, when the double wallop of a Rust Belt recession and a Farm Belt crisis left 1 in every 5 Peorians jobless. Big factories like those of Pabst and Hiram Walker shut down, and Caterpillar, the farm machinery giant based here, endured plummeting demand for its products.
In those days, some bumper stickers declared the sense of defeat: "Would the last person leaving Peoria please turn out the lights?"
But good times have returned to Peoria, where a vibrant Midwest economy has produced new businesses and cut the unemployment rate to about 4 percent.
Representative Ray LaHood, the Republican who succeeded Mr. Michel in Congress, acknowledges that the economic boom has wrapped Mr. Clinton in a stainless-steel suit of political armor.
"I have never, at any town meeting, had anybody come and say, 'Congressman, I want you to do something about campaign finance,' " Mr. LaHood said. "If people are earning a good wage and can afford to take the kids on vacation once a year, they're happy. And that's why Clinton is so popular in Peoria County."
Indeed, people like Mr. Long, the riverside construction worker, who went without a job for six months one year during the downturn of the 80's, can put in overtime these days. He is now working on a part of the huge Peoria riverfront redevelopment, a project worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
"This is as good as it's been," said Mr. Long, a tall man with a wide smile, happy to have sweat on his brow. "Don't change a thing."
Contrary to Mr. Clinton's popularity here, Vice President Al Gore seems to get a much cooler reaction. And the possibility of fund-raising violations by Mr. Gore, a matter still under the scrutiny of Attorney General Janet Reno, does not seem to be his biggest problem.
Even loyal Democrats like Carol Thomas, a 34-year-old secretary who would sooner chew nails than bolt to the Republicans, confess that it is awfully hard to get excited about a Gore candidacy for President in 2000. Daniel Buchanan, 27, a sculptor who supports himself by working as a waiter at Steak-n-Shake, could summon nothing at all, good or ill, to say about Mr. Gore, who, he said, simply does not stir the blood.
The Vice President does have the support of Patricia Shernak, 57, a retired secretary who volunteers for the Salvation Army. She sees in him "a nice, well-meaning young man."
Like most other people on the sidewalks of Peoria, Ms. Shernak did not seem to give a hoot about this campaign finance business.
Mr. Dubicki, the lawyer, said Republicans should stick to economic issues, giving up the fund-raising scandal, as a way to slay Democrats.
"There isn't any hay to be made on this thing," Mr. Dubicki said resolutely. Then he added, with a smile, "Course, I said the same thing about Watergate."

Butch Long, top, a construction worker, and Dave Dubicki, a lawyer, say they are bored with all the talk of campaign finance scandal. Looking ahead to the next Presidential race, Carol Thomas, a secretary, says she is no big fan of Al Gore, but her reaction has nothing to do with fund-raising practices.

HEADLINE: Industry Disputes U.S. Study On Profits in Tobacco Accord

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Tobacco companies today challenged a Government study that projected soaring industry profits from the proposed settlement of tobacco litigation.
Four of the nation's major cigarette makers said in a report issued today that the Federal Trade Commission used faulty economic analysis as the basis for its assertion that the industry would reap windfall profits of as much as $123 billion from the 25-year settlement as proposed. 
 The companies said cigarette consumption was falling much more rapidly than the commission assumed. In addition, they said, the Government's calculations of the profits the companies make on each package of cigarettes were "simplistic at best."
The result, the companies said, was a "seriously flawed" picture of the industry's financial future.
The report was prepared by economists for Philip Morris Inc.; the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a subsidiary of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation; the Lorillard Tobacco Company, a subsidiary of the Loews Corporation, and United States Tobacco, a subsidiary of UST Inc. The other major United States tobacco maker, the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, a subsidiary of B.A.T. Industries is preparing a separate study.
The companies were responding to a request from a Senate Democratic panel on tobacco. But the study was designed as well to counter the trade commission study, which received wide publicity when it was released late last month.
The reports by the industry and the commission are both attempts to analyze the $368.5 billion proposal announced in June by cigarette makers and state attorneys general to settle dozens of liability suits against the industry. President Clinton has since rejected major elements of the plan, but it remains the basis for debate on how to resolve tobacco-related legal, regulatory and health issues.
Cigarette makers said market forces and the terms of the proposed settlement would drive cigarette prices up by $1.50 a pack over the next 10 years. That figure is, coincidentally, the same number the Clinton Administration advocates as the price increase necessary to meet the public health goal of reducing smoking by teen-agers by 60 percent over 10 years.
But the companies said that very little of the $1.50 would go to industry profits, as the commission assumed. Rather, the industry said, the money would pay the legal settlement's cost of $15 billion a year, as well as distribution expenses and local, state and Federal taxes.
The cigarette companies said that price increases of that size would reduce overall American tobacco consumption by as much as 43 percent over the next decade, roughly four times as great a reduction as the commission estimated.
But neither Mr. Williams nor the study provided an estimate of the industry's future profits if the current settlement were adopted.
Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the trade commission, acknowledged in an interview that it was difficult to predict prices and profits 25 years in the future.
"They can quarrel with lots of things," Mr. Pitofsky said, "but the important thing is that the debate is now out in the open. It is clear that there is a lot of money left on the table if prices go up $1.50 a pack."

HEADLINE: From Science to Fiction;
Military and Entertainment Industries Swap Expertise

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 9

 BODY:
From the time he was a boy, Mike O'Neal wanted to "put something on another planet." He earned degrees in aerospace engineering and then worked for eight years at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, helping design the Mars Pathfinder.
But by the time the spacecraft touched down on the Red Planet in July, Mr. O'Neal, 31, had quit NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and joined a movie special effects company where his skill in computer-aided design has been applied to tasks like simulated lava flows in "Dante's Peak" and a shipwreck for "Titanic." 
 Call it the military-entertainment complex. The aerospace and entertainment industries, which in the past inhabited parallel universes even as they sat side by side in Southern California, are starting to cross-pollinate, bringing a new level of technology to entertainment and perhaps returning dividends to the Pentagon as well.
With the sharp cutback in military spending since the end of the cold war, some aerospace companies and individual aerospace engineers are seeking their fortunes in the entertainment business. They are applying their expertise to areas like movie special effects and rides for theme parks, casinos and shopping centers.
The flow of engineers, while small, reflects a much larger shift in the Southern California economy. Since 1988, the aerospace and electronics equipment industry -- once the region's largest -- has lost 135,000 jobs in Los Angeles County alone. In the same period, the county's entertainment industry has added 144,000 jobs and become the area's biggest employer. Abandoned aircraft hangars throughout the region are being converted into sound stages.
Another lure is that entertainment technology has become, in some respects, as sophisticated as that in the aerospace industry. Mr. O'Neal noted that a few movies now cost almost as much to make as spacecraft like the $250 million Pathfinder.
A flow in the other direction, though still a comparative trickle, is under way, too, as the Pentagon looks to the entertainment industry for low-cost technology.
The Marine Corps, for example, is beginning to use shoot-'em-up computer games like Doom to help in training. The Metavision Corporation of Burbank, Calif., which sells giant-screen video projection systems to theme parks and theaters, spun off a company to sell the products for military simulators and war rooms.
"Off my desk suddenly went Rolling Stone and Variety and onto my desk came Defense News Weekly," said Theo Mayer, who heads the spinoff, Panoram Technologies Inc. "It was a real culture shock. I'm an ex-hippie."
The National Research Council issued a report late last month saying that the entertainment and defense industries share many technologies related to computer models and simulation and could benefit from greater cooperation.
"You have two different communities that almost never talk to each other," said Anita Jones, a professor at the University of Virginia and a former director of research and engineering for the Department of Defense. "I think it's an exciting juncture."
The trend, however, has its down side for the Pentagon. There is a concern that the nation's brightest minds will be lured away from military work by the excitement of Hollywood.
"If you are a young computer programmer interested in doing state-of-the-art image-processing work, you would probably go to a Disney or a Pixar or a Microsoft rather than a Boeing or Lockheed or General Dynamics," said Bran Ferren, a top research and development official at the Walt Disney Company.
Mr. O'Neal, for instance, is one of four engineers from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who have joined Digital Domain in Los Angeles in the last two years, frustrated by the shrinking budget and the slow bureaucracy at NASA.
Entertainment work also does not involve making tools of destruction and can offer more glory. Daryll Strauss, a Digital Domain computer programmer, said that at his previous job with a military contractor some projects were so secret he could not breathe a word about them. "It's very different now to have friends say, 'I saw your name in the credits on a film,' " he said.
Much of the technology being exploited by the entertainment industry -- from the Internet to the computer graphics used to make "Toy Story" -- began as university research sponsored by the Pentagon and trickled down over a long time. And there have long been some industry crossovers like the billionaire Howard Hughes, who made movies and started an aerospace company. But such cases were rare.
Now the flow of people and technology is becoming more direct, though it is still far from a mass migration. "I think there is a limited number of people, but the aerospace infrastructure is beginning to serve the entertainment people," said Joel Kotkin, an expert on the Southern California economy at Pepperdine University.
Making the transition is difficult, and some aerospace companies and engineers have found the grass is not always greener in entertainment. For instance, the Hughes Electronics unit of General Motors and Lucasfilm Ltd. abandoned a venture to make theme park attractions based on military simulators when costs became too high.
Some of the areas to which aerospace people are flocking, like virtual reality entertainment and special effects, are not growing as fast as expected and are experiencing business failures. Indeed, two of the four people from the Jet Propulsion Lab who joined Digital Domain lost their jobs Wednesday in a big layoff.
But a larger problem than economics is culture. Military contractors have had a hard enough time moving from making widgets for tanks to making widgets for trucks, let alone to making movies. It is hard to imagine two industries more different in culture and business practice, though both do have a tendency for projects that are late and over budget.
"Even though the technology may be the same, the way the technology is used is so different," said Eric Haseltine, who worked at Hughes Electronics and is now at Disney heading projects developing virtual reality attractions. "One is about storytelling and emotion, and the other is about killing people."
Even though he came from a military contractor, Mr. Haseltine said he was "kind of skeptical when I see an aerospace resume because I know what happens in aerospace companies."
Military contracting has always emphasized capability over affordability. Its detailed specifications and procedures also do not fit well with the more informal Hollywood.
"We needed to teach these folks how to communicate other than by writing mega-documents," said Eddie Ackerman, president of Absolute Post, a post-production company, who trained a dozen laid-off aerospace workers to be television technicians. Mr. Ackerman's solution was ingenious: He took his students to comedy improvisation clubs.
Hollywood workers can have as much trouble going into military contracting. "You can't take a military guy out for a hamburger without breaking the law," said Matt Walton, vice president of Illusion Inc., a company with ties to both both sectors.
Not surprisingly, most of the successful transitions so far are in developing technology, not producing programs. Hughes Electronics established DirecTV, the satellite broadcasting service. Gemstar International, whose VCR Plus system makes video recorders easy to program, was started by engineers who left TRW. Image circuitry developed by Lockheed Martin is used in the Sega Saturn video game machine.
McFadden Systems of Santa Fe Springs, Calif., which makes hydraulic systems that provide motion to simulators, has quadrupled its annual sales to about $10 million by selling to theme parks in addition to the military, said its president, Larry Hayashigawa.
The clash of cultures can be seen at Illusion, a company in Westlake Village, Calif., that was started by former military contractors to pursue entertainment work. On Friday, a simulated Grand Prix racing game designed by the company, in which 24 drivers will race against one another on a computer-simulated virtual track, will open at the Sahara Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nev.
Bob Jacobs, the president, worked at Hughes and then at Perceptronics, another military contractor. In the 1980's, he was a key developer of Simnet, a network that ties together hundreds of military simulators around the world over a network so that all participants can take part in the same virtual battle.
It was not long before Dr. Jacobs realized that what he had was good fun as well as good training. At Fort Knox, Ky., servicemen would come back when they were off duty to play some more.
So Dr. Jacobs and Jim McDonough, a colleague at Perceptronics, started Illusion in Mr. McDonough's house in 1989.
At first, Illusion tried to team up with a big aerospace company to build rides. "The chairman of the board listened and asked: 'Where is the system specification for this? Where is the request for proposal?' " Dr. Jacobs recalled.
So Illusion decided to go it alone. But to get more entertainment industry experience, it merged with another start-up company founded by by Peter Beale, a longtime movie executive, and Mr. Walton, a former management consultant. Illusion employees nearly revolted, summoning Dr. Jacobs and Mr. McDonough to a heated meeting after work to question why such Hollywood types were needed.
Executives now say they have merged the two cultures. Borrowing from aerospace, the company uses detailed charts to show the project's timetable. But to assemble the racing cars, it hired movie production assistants, who know how to put together temporary teams to get a job done quickly.
The Sahara attraction is derived from Simnet technology. In front of each car is a huge screen presenting a unique view to each driver. If the blue car passes the yellow car, the yellow car driver will see the blue car pulling away. The cars have hydraulic systems made by a military contractor to provide a realistic feeling of acceleration.
And guess what? The Pentagon has already come calling, wondering whether military simulators could be based on the casino attraction.

These job changes are part of a broader trend that has reshaped the area's economy over the last decade. Jobs in the aerospace industry have dried up, largely because of cuts in military spending, while the entertainment industry has become the region's biggest employer.

HEADLINE: In Answer to Whisper Campaign, Castro Talks for 7 Hours

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Oct. 9

 BODY:
It wasn't so much what Fidel Castro had to say. It was how long he took to say it that has turned out to be the biggest surprise so far of the Cuban Communist Party's first congress in six years.
Since the spring, Cuban exile groups in Miami and diplomats here have been speculating about the supposedly precarious state of Mr. Castro's health. His infrequent public appearances and apparent loss of weight merely added to those rumors, which culminated, to the irritation of the Cuban authorities, in reports in late August that he had died. 
 But on Wednesday morning, afternoon and evening, as if to answer his enemies, Mr. Castro answered the international whispering campaign by delivering a 6-hour, 43-minute extemporaneous opening speech to the party congress.
Then, after a short break that enabled more than 1,500 delegates to catch their second wind, he and they came back and talked some more, well into the night.
In his younger days, Mr. Castro, who turned 71 in August, was famed for making long and dramatic speeches on occasions like May Day or the July 26 anniversary of the founding of his guerrilla movement. His performance on Wednesday harkened back to that period and left many Cubans searching their memories to recall the last time their "maximo jefe" had been so loquacious.
"It was vintage Fidel," a Latin American diplomat here said today, chuckling at the unspoken message Mr. Castro sent about his stamina and concentration. "The dramatic pauses for effect, the pensive look and turn of the head, the way his voice rose and fell to emphasize the points he wanted to make, all the hallmarks of his oratory style were there."
The substance of the speech offered little that was new. Mr. Castro gave few indications of where the party will head, preferring instead to review the tribulations Cuba has experienced since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged the country into economic crisis. He blamed the United States for most of Cuba's problems.
Since foreign reporters were excluded from the opening speech, exactly what else Mr. Castro had to say is thus far known to few people other than Communist Party delegates. State television has been showing edited excerpts from his speech in delayed broadcasts, and the official Communist Party newspaper Granma today published a three-page, paraphrased version of his remarks.
The party congress, the first since 1991, was scheduled to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the death of Che Guevara, the Argentine-born guerrilla who was executed by Bolivian soldiers on Oct. 9, 1967.
Speaking beneath a banner adorned with portraits of Marx, Lenin, Jose Marti and Guevara, Mr. Castro invoked the example and memory of his former comrade without really referring to his ideas, which are largely in eclipse here.
Guevara and the Cuban Revolution are "the same thing," Mr. Castro said. "I am sure that Che would feel proud of the merits and virtues of the Revolution and feel proud of the bravery and heroism of this, his people," Mr. Castro was quoted as saying in Granma.
At its session today, the congress moved on to consider pressing economic issues, again behind closed doors. Some young technocrats within the party are said to have been urging Mr. Castro to formally embrace and extend some forms of private employment, property and enterprise, but their proposals are reported to have met resistance from so-called historicos, old-line revolutionaries who fought with Mr. Castro.
In one sign of the difficulties with which the party is grappling, Vice President Carlos Lage Davila, the country's top economic official, acknowledged in his presentation to the congress today that economic growth will barely reach 2 percent this year.

HEADLINE: H.M.O. Switches to Flat Fee For Treatment by Specialists

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
One of the country's biggest health maintenance organizations has signed up hundreds of medical specialists to diagnose and treat expensive medical conditions for set fees, rather than piecemeal payments. The move is a sharp departure from industry practice.
Until now, most H.M.O.'s have been billed for each visit and procedure required in the treatment of everything from hip replacement surgery to heart bypass operations, plus additional amounts for diagnostic tests, hospital services and blood-laboratory reports, as well as follow-up care like physical therapy. 
 H.M.O.'s have tried to hold down costs by requiring the specialist to get prior approval at several stages in the treatment and to follow strict guidelines or risk denial of payment. Some H.M.O.'s pay a set monthly fee for each insured member, whether sick or healthy, to California specialty groups and national cancer-center chains.
But now, in a move that industry experts across the country said was a first, Oxford Health Plans, the Norwalk, Conn., giant of managed health care, said it had contracted with more than 700 specialists to take full charge of cases from start to finish. They will be paid a set fee for each case, with added payments as the treatment continues according to an agreed-upon schedule. Oxford will also pick up the costs of extra care if complications develop, the company said. Oxford counts nearly 1.9 million members, mostly in the New York City metropolitan region.
Economists and health care experts said the new approach was the latest development in a trend to give more authority to doctors and replace managed-care restraints that have enraged many doctors, frustrated patients and spurred lawmakers to scrutinize the industry's billing practices.
Critics, however, say the change is a potential threat to the quality of care and could push physicians into a bidding war.
Paying flat fees is supposed to save money without compromising the quality of care, because the specialists will have a reason to be efficient, for example, to eliminate duplicative tests. And indeed, while Oxford is apparently the first to embrace the practice on a large scale, other health care players have been experimenting with it.
The Federal Government, meantime, is exploring the approach. "They hope to do this in a big way with Medicare," said Peter Kongstvedt, a health care expert with Ernst & Young, a consulting firm. Already, Medicare announced last month that it would try out flat fees with six hospital-physician coalitions in New York, New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania, including St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J., and Newark Beth Israel Medical Center.
Oxford expects to reduce its costs and it predicts that the system will prod doctors to become more efficient in providing high-quality care. The H.M.O., which enjoys a reputation for health care innovations that have attracted both publicity and new members, plans to use the program as a selling point with customers as well as hospitals and doctors.
Stephen F. Wiggins, chairman of Oxford, said that under the first contracts, the overall payments to specialists would average 15 percent less than the H.M.O. had been paying for similar cases on a fee-for-service basis.
"We designed this new model in response to our physicians' clear desire for more clinical autonomy and less intrustion of the health plan," Mr. Wiggins said.
Later, when the H.M.O. has contracts with more of its 25,000 specialists, the specialty groups will be bidding against each other for Oxford's patronage. "This is a gesture toward managed competition," said an approving Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economics professor at Princeton University. "It's an ingenious alternative."
Some doctors are delighted with the change. "I don't have to get pre-approval if the patient needs additional views or additional study," said Dr. Gillian M. Newstead, director of breast imaging at New York University Medical Center and head of a medical group that has signed up with Oxford. "I can do whatever I think is necessary. It speeds up the patient's treatment and decreases her anxiety."
But others in the medical establishment were sharply critical of the idea, saying it posed a potential threat to the quality of care. "They'll say to doctors in those specialty areas, 'This is all we're going to spend, and you guys have to stay within that fixed sum,' " warned Dr. Charles N. Aswad, executive vice president of the New York State Medical Society.
Moreover, he predicted, going to flat fees was likely to push physicians into a bidding war. "That's a huge issue," he said. "Is this a bottom-line decision by insurance companies with a group of physicians or hospitals, with the care going to the lowest bidder?"
Oxford said its members would still have primary-care doctors, who are paid on the traditional fee-for-service basis, as their advocates. The members can still go to any doctor, including those outside the Oxford network, if they are willing to pay extra. Eventually, Oxford said, employers may offer incentives that would push their people toward the new program.
Many patients might be attracted to the notion that the specialists they are seeing will call all the shots. Under current practices, they are often kept in the dark about who is making decisions, and might not realize that the specialist is repeatedly second-guessed by the health plan on decisions about their care. A breast-cancer patient, for example, may not suspect that her oncologist typically has to request permissions and follow strict guidelines for standard cancer procedures like CT scans, sonograms, surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.
Mr. Wiggins, who recently resigned as chief executive to work on the new payment system, said Oxford had been working on the project for two years. The H.M.O. paid experts like the N.Y.U. Medical Center's Dr. Newstead to define the components and length of each type of case, which it calls an "episode of care."
With the help of computer software programs and outside consultants, Oxford determined the combined dollar amounts it had been paying for each such episode. Todd S. Farha, who is chief executive of the Oxford Specialty Management unit, said the company helped prospective bidders to streamline their organizations and come up with a bid.
For example, he said, Oxford advised breast cancer specialists on the relative cost implications of various types of biopsies. "We don't tell them what the mix should be," Mr. Farha said.
If a patient has several serious medical problems, he or she might choose to go to more than one specialty group. The patient's primary- care doctor would be expected to keep all the doctors informed and to continue to provide care for routine matters and chronic conditions, Mr. Wiggins said.
Oxford controls a bit more than 20 percent of the managed-care market in the metropolitan area, but the specialists it has signed up represent only a fraction of tens of thousands in the region. Doctors are considered specialists if they have advanced training in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions like stroke, hip-and-knee problems, prostate cancer, mental disease, alcohol and drug addiction, blocked heart arteries, kidney disease, and maternity care.
Oxford, which was criticized by a number of hospitals and medical groups earlier this year when it delayed payment on millions of dollars of charges, has since kept competing H.M.O.'s off-balance with a barrage of new types of coverage. For example, it offers coverage of acupuncture and yoga lessons, for groups willing to pay for it.
Many managed-care companies already pay an all-inclusive price for a few types of cases. Aetna U.S. Healthcare, for example, has long had single-price deals with a number of transplant centers across the country, including a year or more of follow-up care. Dr. Arthur Leibowitz, chief medical officer, said Aetna also had two "significant" single-price contracts for hip and knee replacement surgery and was considering "other types of procedures."

Germany Raises Rate, Rattling Financial Markets
Germany's central bank raised a key interest rate for the first time in five years, deflating stocks in Germany, France and other European nations and hurting the dollar.
 
 Though worries about inflation were a factor, economists said Germany had been driven largely by the need to align its relatively low rates with the higher ones in most other European countries as currency union nears. The increase led to similar moves by some of Germany's partners in the currency plan. Page A1.
 
Stocks fell early in American markets, too, but recovered to end mixed as concerns about rising rates in the United States eased. The Dow industrials were down 33.64 points, to 8,061.42, but the Nasdaq composite rose 4.08 points, to 1,745.85. D6.

HEADLINE: Top Aides Urge Clinton to Ease Global Warming Emission Goal

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
To the dismay of environmentalists seeking swift action to toughen the international treaty on climate change, President Clinton's senior economic and environmental advisers are urging him to delay until the year 2010 and beyond the time when the United States and other industrial nations must achieve deep new reductions in the pollution that may cause global warming.
Assuming that international negotiations produce such a treaty this year to help control climate change, Mr. Clinton's advisers are warning him not to present it for the Senate's approval unless developing countries first agree, in a separate pact negotiated within the next few years, to control their own emission of greenhouse gases. 
 The advisers' recommendations were described by leaders of several environmental organizations who said they had been briefed on the proposals. White House officials involved in the discussions today refused to discuss their recommendations, which are in an options paper that they expect to give the President as early as Friday.
The options were pieced together after strenuous debate between environmental advisers and economic advisers, who expressed reservations about the potential cost of controlling emissions too quickly.
Among the staff who put together the policy options are Gene Sperling, the President's economic policy assistant; Kathleen McGinty, the head of the Council on Environmental Quality; Todd Stern, a senior aide who is coordinating the policy discussions; and Lawrence Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary.
Outside environmental advocates, including leaders of the Environmental Defense Fund, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Sierra Club, and the Environmental Information Center, responded to what they heard by warning the White House that they would actively oppose any agreement along the lines that were being recommended.
"It's clear that the President's men have blinked," said Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club. "It remains to be seen if the President will blink."
Phil Clapp, executive director of the Environmental Information Center, said that for President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to accept long delays after campaigning against global warming for years would "create severe credibility problems for them on almost any environmental issue."
On the other hand, powerful industry groups have long urged the Clinton Administration to defer action, saying that not enough is yet known about how the climate might change to justify the potential costs in money and jobs that they contend an all out commitment to reduce emissions would require.
For their part, the President's advisers say they are determined to offer a plan that is realistic politically and economically, not just attractive on the environmental merits.
The most aggressive option before the President would call on industrial nations to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases by 2010, without requiring further reductions. Other options would take even longer to stabilize emissions.
In a treaty signed five years ago in Rio de Janeiro, the United States and other industrial nations said they would try to get emissions reduced, back to the level that existed in 1990, by the year 2000. Most now acknowledge they will not meet that deadline. The United States' emissions are now projected to be 13 percent above 1990 levels by 2000.
Recognizing that the Rio goals were not sufficient to end the rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases that many scientists say threatens to significantly change the earth's climate in the coming century, the nations that signed that treaty have been trying for two years to negotiate a tougher pact that would set new, binding targets and timetables. The negotiations resume in Bonn on Oct. 20 and are supposed to be completed in Kyoto, Japan, in December.
The recommendations to President Clinton come a few days after Japan proposed a schedule that would cut emissions 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. The European nations have called for reductions of 15 percent below 1990 levels by that time, and some nations have sought even deeper emissions.
The White House has said it wanted to pursue reductions that would be binding, politically realistic and technically achievable. But so far it has not spelled out specific goals.
One global warming expert who is close to the Administration said there are three main options on the table: one to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels by 2010, one to do so by 2015 or 2020, and one to gradually reduce the growth rate of emissions and to freeze them some day.
But the environmental groups said these options do not represent a binding commitment, because they include an escape mechanism that would limit the amount of money American companies would have to spend to meet any emission targets.
The Administration favors allowing companies to buy and sell emission permits for carbon dioxide, an approach that advocates say would effectively create a marketplace for pollution control ideas and help keep compliance costs down. Companies that come up with cheap controls could sell their permits for a profit.
But out of fear that emissions controls would be prohibitively expensive, the Administration now is considering putting a cap on the price of the permits and guaranteeing to sell additional permits at that price.
"This would spoil the market mechanism and remove the incentives to produce innovations," said Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund, who favors trading in emissions permits but joined other environmentalists in denouncing the White House's latest options.
"That's absolutely bananas," retorted Raymond Kopp, an analyst at Resources for the Future, an environmental policy center that supports capping the prices of the permits. "It is a way of capping the upper limit on the cost of any policy you might come up with."
Environmental groups who have been calling for steeper reductions on a faster timetable said that they were "increasingly concerned" by reports that the President's aides were recommending further delays.
"Such policies would be totally inconsistent with the gravity and urgency of the global warming threat," said the leaders of 17 environmental organizations in a letter to Mr. Clinton written Wednesday, after White House aides informed them of the options under consideration.
They said they would be "compelled to oppose" a policy that "simply seeks to freeze emissions at 1990 levels by 2010 or later, or that includes a treaty-busting escape clause."

HEADLINE: Two Views of New York

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his Democratic opponent, Ruth Messinger, defined their basic disagreement last night with perfect clarity. Ms. Messinger sees the glass as half-empty. Mr. Giuliani sees it as pretty much full already. Their debate was a useful portrait of two contrasting analyses of the state of New York City. But it was not the kind of debate likely to drive voters from one candidate to another, and since Mr. Giuliani began in the stronger position, he had more reason to smile at the end.
In this campaign's first mayoral debate, Ms. Messinger repeatedly described a city in which the schools were terrible, the homeless were being ignored, unemployment was endemic and city services were deteriorating. Mr. Giuliani saw a city where crime was plummeting, where services were being delivered more efficiently and where the welfare rolls were shrinking. By listening carefully, voters could actually glean sharp distinctions in the way the two candidates would approach the challenges of the future. 
 On the tactical level, Ms. Messinger's strongest moments came very early. She opened with an attack pointed at the incumbent's greatest vulnerability, his reputation as a mean-tempered autocrat. Later she followed up with a pithy summary: "You do not need to be mean to be tough."
Mr. Giuliani, his famous temper well in check, counterattacked with surprising smoothness, saying that in repeatedly labeling him a "bully" Ms. Messinger was practicing the "name-calling" she condemned in others.
If Mr. Giuliani's prickly personality is his greatest weakness, his record on crime is his armor, and Ms. Messinger had less success there. Challenged about her share of the blame in past Democratic administrations, she wavered. Mr. Giuliani accused her of trying to bury her record while he embraced his. "I believed the city was heading in the wrong direction," he said. "I turned it around."
Mr. Giuliani's weakest response came on the matter of ethics, in which he defended collecting huge amounts of money for his campaign from people doing business with the city and the lobbying activities of key advisers. He blamed his problems with the Campaign Finance Board on legalisms. His argument that in his administration no one needs lobbyists to get the ear of City Hall was disingenuous at best.
For her part, Ms. Messinger struggled to make headway on her key issue of educational quality. She repeated her calls for far more spending on education. Mr. Giuliani said there was already enough money being spent on the schools, and that with his help, it was being redirected from administration to the classroom. He got Ms. Messinger in a box by challenging her to promise to retain the popular Schools Chancellor, Rudy Crew.
Ms. Messinger may have made up some of that ground by highlighting Mr. Giuliani's stubborn refusal to endorse the Mollen commission's recommendations for an independent monitor to look at police corruption. Mr. Giuliani indicated he thought the police should police themselves.
It was, on balance, a solid evening of earnest civic work by a worthy challenger facing a strongly positioned incumbent. Ms. Messinger certainly did herself no harm, but as a self-described underdog, she still faces the formidable task defined by an interviewer who asked if life in her neighborhood had improved under Mr. Giuliani. She demurred, but the moment was awkward for her.

HEADLINE: New York Punishes Swiss Bank Over Nazi Gold

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
New York City quietly administered a major sanction against the Union Bank of Switzerland last week by barring it from participating in a billion-dollar bond offering, a move meant to underline disapproval of the way the bank has responded to the investigations into dealings with Nazi Germany, city officials said yesterday.
The action by New York City's Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, was immediately criticized by the State Department, which is attempting to coax Swiss banks to make larger contributions to humanitarian funds for Holocaust survivors and their heirs. 
 Stuart Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State for economic affairs, said in an interview from Egypt yesterday that New York's action could "further inflame passions in Switzerland" and insisted that "confrontation with the banks will achieve far less than cooperation."
Nonetheless, Mr. Hevesi, who is running for re-election with only token opposition next month, said he would not let Union Bank profit from expanded dealings with the city while its top Swiss officers remain unapologetic for the bank's response to the widening Nazi gold investigations.
New York's action was prompted by a routine request by the city for bids from global banks to handle a $1.075 billion revenue anticipation note, money that the city borrows in anticipation of receiving state and Federal aid for education and welfare expenditures.
The winning bidder was a syndicate of banks led by UBS, which Wall Street experts said would have garnered nearly half of the $1 million fee New York ordinarily pays for "letters of credit" from the banks.
"We were faced with the decision of whether to go ahead and do business as usual, or send a message to Union Bank of Switzerland," said Mr. Hevesi, who protested led the protests earlier this year when the bank dismissed a guard who revealed that the bank's archivist was shredding World War II-era documents, but refused to dismiss its honorary president, who said he thought a Jewish conspiracy lay behind American-led revelations about the banks.
"We decided it would be sending the wrong message to accept the bid," said Mr. Hevesi, who added that the Giuliani administration "had no objection" to excluding UBS.
So before the winning bid was announced, Mr. Hevesi's office approached the second bank in UBS's syndicate, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, and asked it, Mr. Hevesi said, to "reconfigure the team of banks to exclude UBS." It immediately complied, city officials said, replacing UBS with National Westminster Bank of Britain and Societe Generale of France.
The chief operating officer of UBS Americas Region, Richard C. Capone, who met with Mr. Hevesi late last month in an effort to avoid the sanction, was traveling yesterday, and the company said he was not available to discuss the issue.
But in a statement, Mr. Capone said: "We respect the position of the Comptroller even though we do not agree with it. We are proud of the fact that the Swiss banks are working extremely hard and providing leadership in resolving the World War II dormant account issue fairly, and with sensitivity. We understand it is an emotional and complex issue, and we are committed to understanding the truth and doing what is right."
Mr. Capone also noted that his bank aided the city "in its darkest hour" during the 1975 fiscal crisis.
For months now, New York City and the State Department have been sparring over sharply differing approaches in dealing with the Swiss.
Mr. Hevesi, whose family included a number of Holocaust victims, has repeatedly pressed Swiss firms to declare how much they are contributing to the Holocaust funds and has criticized UBS in particular for its continuing refusal to release copies of the documents rescued by the guard.
Those documents apparently include records of "forced sales" of properties held by Jews in Germany. Swiss prosecutors last week ended the investigation into the actions of the dismissed guard, Christof Meili, who was recently granted permanent residency in the United States to escape what he said were death threats in Switzerland. The prosecutors also ended their investigation into the archivist who ordered the shredding.
The State Department, however, has tried to calm the furor caused by the blistering report it issued in April. That historical study, led by Mr. Eizenstat, documented how Swiss financial cooperation with the Nazis prolonged World War II, and charged that Switzerland knowingly violated a 1946 agreement to turn over billions of dollars in assets that Nazi Germany looted during the war.
Since issuing the report, Mr. Eizenstat has been accentuating the positive, arguing that "sanctions are not justified by the objective steps that Switzerland has taken." In yesterday's interview from Cairo, Mr. Eizenstat said, "I don't question the motives of New York City, but I am concerned that its approach will be counterproductive."
He was referring to the effort by the Swiss Government to get a majority of the public to vote in a national referendum to create a multibillion-dollar humanitarian fund. Polls indicate that the more the Swiss bridle at the criticism focused on their country, the more likely they will defeat the referendum.
While the New York financing deal represents an extremely small percentage of the Union Bank of Switzerland's overall business, the precedent of punishing one of the banks for its response to the Nazi gold investigations is bound to provoke a reaction among the Swiss banks. Mr. Hevesi has been urging financial officers around the country to also focus on Switzerland's actions.
All three major banks have contributed to a "Special fund for Needy Victims of the Holocaust." But they have resisted calls for restitution and particularly objected to suggestions that a 1946 accord requiring the banks to turn over Nazi assets now worth billions, should be enforced a half-century later.
The Union Bank has been targeted because its honorary president, Robert Holzach, told The New Yorker magazine this spring that Jews have long been excluded from top posts in most Swiss banks, and that he suspected that a Jewish conspiracy lay at the heart of the relentless revelations about how the banks dealt with the Nazis. The bank later told Mr. Hevesi it was "distancing itself" from Mr. Holzach's remarks, but the bank took no public action against him.

HEADLINE: Meredith F. Burrill, 94, Expert On World Geographic Names

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Meredith F. Burrill, a toponymist's toponymist who made a name for himself as the world's foremost authority on what people variously -- and sometimes perversely -- call the earth's lakes, rivers, mountains, seas, cities, towns and other physical features and political subdivisions, died on Sunday at a hospital in Washington. He was 94 and had spent 30 years as executive secretary of the United States Board on Geographic Names.
If it seems appropriate that a man named Meredith but called Pete (from the French petit) would master the often confusing world of geographic nomenclature, it was not his idea. 
 Indeed, until he was in his 40's, Dr. Burrill's major claim to fame was that he had been in all 254 Texas counties, a feat he accomplished while assisting Federal efforts to resettle Dust Bowl refugees in a decade he spent teaching geography at Oklahoma A & M University.
The resettlement work led to a job in Washington in 1940 as an economic geographer for the old General Land Office in the Department of Interior, which is where the Secretary of the Interior, Harold L. Ickes, found him happily at work in 1943.
With the war against Japan raising the prospects of large-scale Asian operations, it had fallen to Mr. Ickes to solve a daunting problem: converting thousands of place names listed only in Japanese, Chinese or other unfamiliar scripts into the Roman alphabet for military maps.
Mr. Ickes got the job because his department supervised the Board of Geographic Names, a sleepy little office that had virtually withered away since it was founded in 1890 to standardize American place names.
Dr. Burrill got the job as the beefed-up board's executive secretary because he was the only qualified geographer in the Interior Department.
Not that Dr. Burrill was especially qualified in the study of place names, or toponymy, a field, to be sure, that barely existed before he came along.
A peripatetic school superintendent's son, he was born in Houlton, Me., and grew up in a series of Maine towns, without any particular interest in geography.
Indeed, he set out to study history and government, but at Bates College an inspiring teacher who took his students on field trips discoursing on the origin of various rocks and mineral deposits, left Dr. Burrill with such a passion for knowing everything there was to know about the earth that he switched to geography.
At Clark University in Worcester, Mass., he got a master's and doctorate, studying at the feet of the master, Wallace Atwood, who had transformed Clark into a world renowned center of geographic studies.
If Dr. Burrill had not paid much attention to place names before 1943, he did not waste much time in becoming the world's leading expert.
Under his direction a staff of 175 experts in geography, linguistics, languages and map-making identified and translated some two million Asian place names. After the war, Dr. Burrill supervised a board of experts from nine Federal agencies charged with establishing standard names for all Federal maps and publications.
Seeing the importance of common international standards, Dr. Burrill helped persuade the United Nations to establish a series of international conferences to prod countries to standardize their own place names, a task whose complications were underscored when the first conference was held on Lake Geneva, a body of water with four official names.
Even after he retired in 1973, Dr. Burrill represented the United States at the United Nations and continued one of his cherished projects, analyzing the distribution of 2,000 generic names applied to a handful of geographic features on American maps. In a world where one man's brook is another woman's creek, Dr. Burrill traced entire ethnic migrations simply by plotting which terms were used where, finding, for example, Louisiana-style bayous in Indiana.
Although much of his work focused on established names, Dr. Burrill got a chance to do a little naming himself in Antarctica. He was thwarted when he tried to name a sea after President Roosevelt and a mountain range after Secretary Ickes, but he managed to leave his mark, anyway. There is a Mount Burrill in Antarctica, though his friends can be forgiven if they call it Pete.
Dr. Burrill, whose first wife died in 1978, is survived by his wife, Betty Didcoct Burrill of Bethesda, Md.; a son, Robert, of Pensacola, Fla.; a daughter, Elizabeth Allard of Newburyport, Mass.; two grandsons and five great grandchildren.

Lighter Side Of the Mayor: Can It Last?

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
DURING the summer, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sent over a photo after this column had suggested that he give himself and everyone else a break by taking a few days off, for a change. To show that he does know how to enjoy himself, he had a messenger (not to be confused with a Messinger) deliver a photo of him with his Parks Commissioner at the newly restored Astoria Pool in Queens.
There they were, grinning widely, leis around their necks, and hands gripping a large drink with a little umbrella. "Having a great time," the Mayor wrote in bold ink. "Wish you were here with us." 
 It was a nice touch, and it showed that he does have a sense of humor, as people who have spent private time with him say. But it also raised a question, and not for the first time: Why does this puckish side rarely surface in public?
That might not seem like the most pressing issue as Election Day nears. But it touches on an aspect of this Mayor that has long unsettled New Yorkers, including many who plan to vote for him. It came up right away in the first mayoral debate last night, when his Democratic challenger, Ruth W. Messinger, wasted no time calling him a bully and someone who "tears people apart."
SHE knew that this was one of his weak spots. New Yorkers may respect the Mayor and may feel that on the whole he has done a good job. But an awful lot of them also do not like him one bit.
The highly regarded Quinnipiac College Polling Institute surveyed New Yorkers in the last days of September and reported that this race is in the bag for him. Voters pronounced themselves satisfied with the way the city is going, and by a vast majority they described him as someone who can get things done.
But when asked whether they thought that the Mayor had "a likable personality," more than half said no, a result consistent with the findings of a poll in The New York Times earlier this year. More often than not, voters also faulted Mr. Giuliani for not working well with other political leaders, a matter of significance for someone whose success may depend on the kindness of strangers in Washington and Albany.
The personality issue hovered relentlessly in the air in the debate last night.
Sure, the dominant matters were crime, public schools, economic development and the like. But the Mayor clearly felt that he had to show he can be an ordinary Joe and not just a verbal abuser. He has hardly softened his image with campaign commercials and pronouncements that all but call Ms. Messinger a porno queen and a coddler of killers. Just the other day, he stopped a step short of blaming her for the Dodgers' having skipped town in 1957, when she was a teen-ager.
Instead, the Mr. Giuliani that New York 1 viewers got to see last night was gentler, if not always kinder. He did not put down questions as hopelessly silly. His usual tendency in news conferences is to wave off almost any challenge as something that could be spawned only by a person who is corrupt, politically backward or plain dumb.
LAST night, though, he was a study in calm, refusing to rise to Ms. Messinger's bait as she described the difference between them this way: "I listen. He bullies."
He managed to tell a joke or two, and even kidded with an El Diario reporter whom he had wanted bounced from a panel of journalist questioners.
Bully? That, he said, is something that his opponent "consistently calls me and then claims that I call names."
It is hard to imagine that Mr. Giuliani can keep his abrasive side in check forever. It is also arguable how much should be made of it. But it is hard not to wonder how long voter good will toward him will last if the crime rate starts nudging back up or if Wall Street's boom goes bust, proving that New York's economy is every bit as fragile as Ms. Messinger has warned all along.
Because term limits will force Mr. Giuliani out by 2002, no matter what, unlikability may not catch up with him right away. But he is presumed to be interested in higher office. And character has a way of becoming destiny. He might consider what can happen to a politician when things suddenly go wrong and people remember that they never cared much for him to begin with. Richard M. Nixon comes to mind.
"Likability matters to politicians," said Maurice Carroll, the Quinnipiac polling director. "They all like to be liked."
By the way, about that photo at the Astoria Pool? It probably should have been mentioned that the Mayor went there in a dark business suit.
Guess he has a way to go before he entirely loosens up.

HEADLINE: Muslims Win Vote in Town That Serbs 'Cleansed'

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
In a result from municipal elections last month that could complicate Western peacekeeping efforts, Bosnian Muslims won political control of Srebrenica, the town in eastern Bosnia where thousands of Muslims had been expelled and massacred in one of the darkest episodes of the Balkan war, election monitors announced yesterday.
Voting nearly exclusively by absentee ballots, the Bosnian Muslims elected candidates from the governing coalition led by the Bosnian Muslim Party for Democratic Action, outvoting Bosnian Serbs who moved into the area over the last two years. The party's candidates won control of 24 of the 46 seats on the ruling town council in Srebrenica, the election monitors said. 
 Under the terms of the 1995 Dayton peace accord, the Bosnian Muslim party should now be able to choose a new town mayor and to assume full control of the municipal government.
Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which oversaw the elections, have said in the past that local authorities who refused to put into effect the result of the elections would be denied economic aid.
But Western observers said that enforcing the election victory -- which would mean the Bosnian Serbs giving up control of a town they took by force -- would be close to impossible, barring a strong show of force by NATO troops responsible for overseeing the peace accords. The area around Srebrenica is patrolled by American forces.
Before the outbreak of the 3 1/2-year war in Bosnia, Srebrenica's population was 70 percent Muslim and 30 percent Serbian. As many as 7,000 Muslim men are believed to have died in ambushes and mass executions carried out by Bosnian Serb soldiers in July 1995.
Srebrenica is now inhabited by only Serbs and local Serbian leaders who have vowed to violently block efforts by Bosnian Muslims to return to their homes.
Srebrenica was the only municipality in Serb-controlled territory where Muslim parties managed to gain a majority, according to the election results.
Muslim parties won a plurality of the vote in the northwest town of Prijedor, the wartime site of Serb-run detention camps where Muslim prisoners were systematically tortured and executed. Serbian parties could yet control the Prejidor council if they agree to form a coalition, Reuters reported.
Momcilo Cvjetinovic, leader of the nationalist Serbian Democratic Party in Srebrenica, pledged before the election not to allow Bosnian Muslims to regain control of the town, Agence France-Presse reported yesterday.
"If they come back," Mr. Cvjetinovic said, "the first night we'll fight."
Mr. Cvjetinovic's party won 12 city council seats in the municipal elections, according to press reports. The Serbian Radical Party won eight.
Srebrenica itself has become a symbol of the failure of the United States and its Western allies to carry out the Dayton peace accords. Two years after the town fell to Bosnian Serbs, Western officials have yet to exhume about two-thirds of the mass graves that surround the town and that are believed to hold the bodies of thousands of Muslim men.
The delays in the exhumations have been attributed to the slow pace of donations from Western countries to finance them, and to bureaucratic snagsat the International War Crimes Tribunal.
The former Bosnian Serb President, Radovan Karadzic, and the former Bosnian Serb Army commander Ratko Mladic, who were indicted by the War Crimes Tribunal for carrying out the Srebrenica executions, remain at large. Srebrenica's local Serbian leaders are believed to be tightly controlled by Dr. Karadzic.

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL: THE OVERVIEW;
Sharp Exchanges Pepper Debate Between Giuliani and Messinger

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Ruth W. Messinger battled last night about where New York City has been during the last decade, its current condition, and where the next Mayor should lead it. The 90 minutes of often harsh exchanges gave voters the first opportunity to measure the two candidates on the same stage.
The Republican Mayor and his Democratic challenger -- in the first of two debates before the Nov. 4 election -- used the televised forum on New York 1 to sum up for voters the cases they have been making against each other for nearly a year. In the process, they offered a sharp contrast in both style and ideas.
Ms. Messinger turned nearly every question into an assault, repeatedly criticizing Mr. Giuliani as she tried to focus the debate on what she described as the failings of his first four years, while also describing some of her proposals. Excerpts, page B4.
"Rudy and I are different in more ways than you can count," she said. "I will fix our schools; he cut them. I will build our health care system; he tried to sell it off. I worked to write this city's campaign finance laws; he breaks them. I will give our teachers a fair wage first; he gave pay raises to himself and his staff first."
Mr. Giuliani was studious and good humored, for the most part following the advice of his staff as he laughed off harsh questions and compared the current state of the city to its condition four years ago, linking Ms. Messinger at every opportunity to the man he replaced, David N. Dinkins.
"Ruth Messinger prefers the policies of the Dinkins administration, of the four years before I came into office: wants to go back to most of them," he said. "I prefer the progress that we've made together as a city, that now is having us written about as a national model rather than the rotting apple."
Even with such exchanges -- and there were many -- the candidates covered a fairly large amount of policy ground, laying out dramatically different visions of the condition of New York City today.
Ms. Messinger painted a picture of a city in disrepair, pointing to schools that are overcrowded, children who are not learning, poor people who are not being fed, and homeless people who are still living in the street.
Mr. Giuliani portrayed a city that had, under his stewardship, recovered from a Democratic era in which its streets were plagued with crime, and when jobs and the middle class were fleeing. Mr. Giuliani said that his emphasis on crime prevention and restoring the city's fiscal health had led to the recovery, and warned that bad times could return if Democrats retook City Hall.
Both Ms. Messinger and Mr. Giuliani gave even, measured performances. But the debate was peppered with often sharp exchanges, and there was no warmth apparent between the two main contestants in what has been one of the less suspenseful New York mayoral contests in a decade. The candidates did not even shake hands at the end.
As a matter of history, debates tend not to affect the outcome of elections, and there was apparently nothing about last night's event to suggest that this one would break that pattern.
The debate at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem was arranged by the Campaign Finance Board. The candidates are required to participate in two debates as a condition of receiving public funds from the board. A third candidate, Olga Rodriguez of the Socialist Workers Party, who is also participating in the public financing program, took part as well.
Throughout the debate, Ms. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, turned frequently to the Mayor, who was seated at her left, to try to engage him in discussion. She even tried to ease the obvious tension with a joke at her own and his expense: "One thing is for sure: When you look at the two of us, you know this election isn't a beauty contest."
It did not work. Mr. Giuliani for the most part avoided Ms. Messinger's gaze, playing to the panelists and the camera more than to his opponent, thumbing through papers, writing notes to himself and smiling frequently, again taking his counselors' advice. While Ms. Messinger called her opponent "Rudy," he referred to her formally as "Ms. Messinger."
Ms. Messinger went on the attack from her opening statement, describing Mr. Giuliani's tenure as flawed and his programs as damaging to the city's homeless, its poor and its schoolchildren. She called him a bully, a Republican -- she meant it as an insult -- and, at one point, paranoid.
"I listen, he bullies," Ms. Messinger said. "I bring people together. He tears people apart. I care about people. He cares a lot more about himself."
She added: "You don't have to be mean to be tough. A lot of times, Rudy, I don't think you know the difference. I do care. And he doesn't."
That was perhaps the only time that Mr. Giuliani turned to his opponent. "This is an important discussion of the future of New York City," Mr. Giuliani said. "And I'm going to try to keep it on issues and I'm going to try to keep it on the things that are really important to people -- rather than personal, negative attacks."
The Mayor rattled off statistics about the decrease in crime as he tried to warn that Ms. Messinger "represents really a kind of way-out fringe of the Democratic Party."
"The fact is that she does prefer the policies and programs of the prior administration -- the Dinkins administration -- over the policies and programs of this administration," he said. "If you want to turn back, fine. But don't pretend you want to move to the future."
Ms. Messinger called the attacks on her past irrelevant. "He talks about the past; I'll talk about the future," she said.
The extent of their different views of the world came when Ms. Messinger, who lives in an apartment on Central Park West, said in response to a question that her quality of life today had gotten no better in the last four years.
Mr. Giuliani's eyebrows shot up. "Well, it has for most other people in New York," the Mayor said.
The two candidates introduced a few new issues in this forum. Mr. Giuliani spoke of Ms. Messinger's opposition to the death penalty, asking if she would -- as he had -- urge judges to impose executions in cases of the murder of a police officer.
Ms. Messinger replied: "I support life in prison without parole for criminal offenses of that nature. I am morally opposed to the death penalty. I believe it is wrong for the state to take another person's life."
Mr. Giuliani seemed to acknowledge one of Ms. Messinger's main complaints about the city, saying that the unemployment rate was too high. "Do I think that 9 1/2 percent is healthy?" he asked. "Do I look crazy? No, of course I don't think it's healthy."
But as he did repeatedly throughout the night, he said the blame lay not with him, but with his Democratic predecessor: "The fact is that unemployment was higher, however, before I came into office."
The two candidates disagreed about Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew as they questioned each other during the debate. "I would ask Ms. Messinger whether she would make the commitment to keep on Rudy Crew and support him," the Mayor said.
Ms. Messinger said: "My beef is not with Rudy Crew's performance. It is with Rudy Giuliani's performance in education." Ms. Messinger said she needed to know whether Dr. Crew would support her educational proposals, including measures to reduce school overcrowding and set performance standards for teachers, principals and students.
"And because you do not allow anyone who works for you to say anything to anybody without your permission," Ms. Messinger said to snickering from the audience, "I need to wait until I can have a conversation with Rudy Crew to know where he stands on that."
Mr. Giuliani turned to the camera: "One of the reasons why people in this country distrust politicians is because they don't answer questions. And that isn't an answer to the question. Rudy Crew has been the Chancellor for two years. We know what he is doing."

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL;
Candidates in Mayoral Race Touch on Education, Gangs and Unemployment

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks made in a debate last night by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his Democratic challenger, Ruth W. Messinger, as transcribed by The New York Times.
 
Opening Statements
 
 MESSINGER When you look at the two of us, you know this election isn't a beauty contest. It is seriously a contest between two candidates with different styles and different priorities. You'll see a lot of evidence of that tonight. I listen, he bullies. I bring people together. He tears people apart. I care about people. He cares a lot more about himself. 
 Rudy Giuliani is actually a man who fired his Police Commissioner because he was getting too much credit for the city's drop in crime. I'd have given Bill Bratton a medal. Rudy gave him the boot. You don't have to be mean to be tough. A lot of times, Rudy, I don't think you know the difference.
 
 GIULIANI This is an important discussion of the future of New York City, and I am going to try to keep it on issues, and I am going to try to keep it on the things that are really important to people, rather than personal negative attacks. Four years ago, I ran for mayor of New York City because I thought this city was in a crisis. We had gone through a period of time in which we had more murder each year than at any other prior year in the history of this city. We were averaging 2,000 murders a year. We had lost 320,000 private sector jobs; jobs were hemorrhaging out of the city. And our school system was in a crisis. . . .
I believe that we have made a turnaround. I believe that New York City in a number of areas is now showing remarkable success. That doesn't mean that we have solved all problems. That doesn't mean that we still don't have horrendous and very difficult problems to face. But I think that we face it from success, not trying to destroy the city, or to destroy the success that it has, for partisan political reasons.
 
On the Past
 Mr. Giuliani said that you share the blame for the city's problems under past Democratic administrations. Do you?
 
 MESSINGER This election is about the future and not the past. It's not which issues I took what position on in the time that I was privileged to be in the City Council or serve as Borough President. It's what I will do to address the problems that are not yet getting nearly sufficient attention in this city.
We have a million schoolchildren in this city, reading -- more than half of them -- not at grade level. We have schools that have become grossly overcrowded because of this Mayor's $6 billion cut. What we need to worry about is what positions each of us will take to solve those problems that plague us for the future. . . .
 
 GIULIANI Well, it seems to me that Ms. Messinger didn't answer the question. And the fact is that she does prefer the policies and programs of the prior administration, the Dinkins administration, over the policies and programs of this administration. You have a right to have that view, people do. She's running away from it. And to say that your record is not up for examination on what you have done in the past when you run for mayor is really entirely unrealistic. . . .
 
On School Crowding
 
 MESSINGER I have indicated very clearly that I believe my top priority is education. My first priority will be to go school by school and district by district to reduce school overcrowding. And I have identified where there is a $1 billion saving in operating the government of this city to fund the additional teachers, the additional lease space, the additional construction space that we need to give our children a fair start in developing the skills they need, which I promise you they are not getting today in many -- too many -- schools in this city.
 
 GIULIANI What we will do to lower class size is to continue, as we move to school-based budgeting, to get the money to the classrooms and the schools. There's enough money in the school system. There always has been. Nine billion dollars is a lot of money. The problem with the school system was the need to restructure it. The money wasn't going to the students. The money wasn't going to the teachers. The money was going to the out-of-control bureaucracy. Part of my frustration with the first Schools Chancellor when I was in office was that he wasn't doing enough to change it.
 
On the Schools Chancellor
 
 GIULIANI I would ask Ms. Messinger whether she would make the commitment to keep on Rudy Crew and support him. I think that Rudy Crew is doing an excellent job as the Chancellor of the City of New York. I think that the school system needs continuity. And when I listen to her answer this question, I hear her talk about interviewing him and trying to figure out what his policies and programs are. They are pretty apparent. So I would like to see her support Rudy Crew as the Chancellor, to keep him on, to keep him for the next three to four years, whatever the term is that he has, at least so that there can be continuity in the school system.
 
 MESSINGER My beef is not with Rudy Crew's performance. It is with Rudy Giuliani's performance in education. In fact, it is the case that reading scores are unfortunately more than a percentage point lower now than when you came into office. In fact, it is true that we have a severe overcrowding problem. . . . What I want is a Chancellor who will implement the plan that I've laid out, point by point: the plan to reduce overcrowding, the plan to do a pilot project in year-round schooling, the plan to set standards for kids and principals and teachers, and hold them accountable to those standards, the plan to invest real dollars in the professional development of our teachers.
And because you do not allow anyone who works for you to say anything to anybody without your permission, I need to wait until I can have a conversation with Rudy Crew to know where he stands on that.
 
On Crime and Street Gangs
 
GIULIANI The fact is there is a very big difference between my opponent and me on dealing with crime. It was illustrated just yesterday when I described a massive program to deal with the youth gangs, criminal youth gangs in the city. She criticized me because she said that we should have more youth programs. Well, maybe she really doesn't understand who these youth gangs are. I don't think that youth programs will help the Bloods, the Crips, the Latin Kings, the Zulu Nation, MS13. These are gangs that begin in jail and in prison. These are violent repeat career criminals and I don't think that giving them sewing lessons is going to help.
So we have a major disagreement about how you approach crime. I believe that social programs are important: they are valuable, they can help. But when you are dealing with hardened criminals like the members of the Bloods, the Crips, the Latin Kings and the Zulu Nation, it is almost an inappropriate thing to start talking about youth programs for them.
 
 MESSINGER The Mayor's comments are trivial and deliberately designed to misrepresent my position. His police initiative against gangs make sense. But the gangs are preying on our young people, they are recruiting among 300,000 kids who have been pushed out of after-school programs. If you travel the whole city and listen and talk to parents as I do, that's what they tell you. "What are we going to do about these gangs that are showing up in my playground, in my kid's school and telling my kid, 'here's something you can do after school'?"
Last week the Mayor went to Boston to talk about his fight against drugs. Last week, for kids who might be moved into the drug life, additional after-school programs made sense. Apparently it makes sense when he proposes it but not when I propose it.
 
On Unemployment
 Ms. Messinger said that you thought 9.5 percent unemployment was a sign of the city's economic health. Do you? And why is the city's rate twice the national average?
 
 GIULIANI Do I think that 9 1/2 percent is healthy? Do I look crazy? No, of course I don't think it's healthy. The fact is that unemployment was higher, however, before I came into office. It was 10.5 percent, 11 percent, 11 1/2 percent and there are things that are happening that are rectifying that. We went through a disaster between 1989 and 1993: we lost 320,000 private sector jobs. We hadn't had a job loss like that since the Depression. We have made up 170,000 of those jobs. Just to get back to where we were, there's 150,000 more jobs to go. And we lost those jobs because of policies and programs that were antibusiness, that were antijobs, that drove jobs out of this city.
We turned that around. This year we have gained more jobs than at any time in the last 13 years. We have gained more jobs in the last four years in the private sector than at any time in the history of this city, but we are coming out of a big hole. And I want to be mayor for the next four years because I am not going to rest until we get every single job back that we lost during the Dinkins administration.
 
 MESSINGER Let's be clear. The Mayor and his First Deputy Mayor both said rising unemployment is a sign of economic optimism. But in New York State and in the United States, where employment numbers are going up, unemployment is not, so the problem is specific to the City of New York. We have another specific unemployment problem -- two-thirds of the private sector jobs that have been created have gone to people from the suburbs, because New Yorkers turn out not to have the skills that are needed because they are being mis-educated in our schools and in our colleges. This city needs a mayor now, in 1997, with an economic development program that is more than just corporate welfare, a program, like the one I laid out yesterday, that will target small businesses, that will build job linkages for those businesses that are receiving city contracts, that will cut some business taxes, that will supply some easier access to credit.

HEADLINE: Israelis, Arafat and Jordanian King Feuding

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 9

 BODY:
The aftermath of a bungled assassination attempt in Jordan continued to send shockwaves through Israeli politics today, with Foreign Minister David Levy saying he had considered resigning, and Yasir Arafat complaining that King Hussein was meddling in Israeli-Palestinian affairs.
But there were also signs that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's early morning meeting with Mr. Arafat on Wednesday, their first since February, had injected some new life into the moribund negotiating process. 
 A joint Israeli-Palestinian committee on economic cooperation held its first meeting today in seven months; the committee is one of several that were revived in the wake of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's intervention last month.
There were also reports, unconfirmed by Israel, that Mr. Netanyahu was prepared to release the remaining $50 million in withheld taxes owed the Palestinian Authority. Israel froze the funds, which account for the bulk of the Authority's income, after a suicide bombing in Jerusalem on July 30. Responsibility for the bombing was taken by the militant Islamic group Hamas, which Mr. Netanyahu said the Palestinian authority had not done enough to restrain. The release of the money was one of the gestures Mrs. Albright pressed for during her visit.
The actual content of the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting was not made public. Dennis Ross, the American mediator who arranged it and also sat in on part of the session, said before leaving Israel that the Israeli and Palestinian leaders saw their meeting as a "new beginning for the process."
Israeli attention, however, remained riveted on the fallout of the botched attempt by a Mossad hit squad to kill a Hamas leader in Amman. The operation compelled Israel to release the most senior figure in the militant Islamic movement, Sheik Ahmad Yassin, and a host of other Palestinian prisoners, to secure the release of two Mossad agents captured by Jordan.
Foreign Minister Levy, who was briefly hospitalized with chest pains on Tuesday, publicly assailed the operation in a radio interview, and declared that he had seriously considered resigning over this and a growing list of other complaints against Mr. Netanyahu.
"If I had been consulted, I would not have let it happen," he said. Already before the fiasco, Mr. Levy was infuriated when Mr. Netanyahu released news of a pending agreement with the Palestinians to reopen the talks while Mr. Levy was still in New York negotiating the deal.
Mr. Levy has repeatedly expressed frustration over Mr. Netanyahu's forays into foreign policy behind the Foreign Ministry's back, and he has hinted at resignation more than once before. As head of the small Gesher party, he controls seven seats in the ruling coalition.
Mr. Netanyahu maintained the aggressive stance he has taken since the latest crisis broke, displaying no remorse over the bungled operation and insisting such methods will continue. "The war against terrorism is not a war of arguments while sitting at home," he told followers in the Likud party in Tel Aviv. "It is a very difficult war with risks and casualties."
In Amman, King Hussein just as forcefully insisted, "We won't accept this form of behavior ever." In a speech before leaders of his Government on Wednesday, the King challenged Mr. Netanyahu's statement that he would not apologize for the operation, revealing that the Prime Minister himself had come to Amman on the night of Sept. 28, three days after the assassination attempt, with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon.
King Hussein refused to meet with Mr. Netanyahu, and sent Crown Prince Hassan instead. "They arrived full of regret and upset that Jordan had been treated this way, and promised that such a thing would never happen again," the King said. Mr. Sharon subsequently returned to seal the exchange of Sheik Yassin for the captured Mossad agents.
King Hussein also said that two days before the Israeli operation, he had forwarded what he described as a cease-fire proposal from Hamas to the Israelis. Officials in Mr. Netanyahu's Government said they received the message only the day after the attack.
There were reports that King Hussein's role in the entire affair had angered Mr. Arafat, who has always viewed the Jordanian monarch as a rival for authority over the Palestinians. Addressing a closed meeting of the Palestinian Legislative Council in Ramallah, Mr. Arafat was reported to have alleged that King Hussein was seeking to forge an alliance with Hamas, and to "interfere" in Palestinian negotiations with Israel.

HEADLINE: Greenspan's Jawing Gets The Job Done For the Fed

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
The economy would seem to be right where Alan Greenspan wants it. Growth, while still robust, shows signs of moderating. Unemployment is low. Inflation is almost nonexistent.
Yet Mr. Greenspan, who as chairman of the Federal Reserve helped create those conditions, felt compelled on Wednesday to peddle some gloom. In testimony to the House Budget Committee, he warned that a resurgence in inflation might be lurking just around the corner if strong growth drives unemployment lower and pushes wages up. And he gave Wall Street a kick in the teeth, proclaiming that the bull market of the last few years cannot last forever. 
 He got support for his warning on inflation today from a Government report that new claims for unemployment insurance were lower than expected, fueling concerns that the pool of available workers had gotten so small that companies could soon have trouble filling positions, causing wages to rise. And the decisions today by central banks in Germany, France and other European nations to raise interest rates despite having economies far weaker than the United States showed that policy makers worldwide are deeply worried about inflation.
Still, Mr. Greenspan seemed intent on accomplishing goals far more specific than just giving voice to a central banker's ingrained pessimism. His comments, analysts said, were designed to talk down stock prices, talk up interest rates and reassure his colleagues on the Federal Reserve that he remained the nation's most vigilant inflation fighter.
Mr. Greenspan's primary goal, analysts said, was to let some air out of the stock market, which by some measures had been hitting new highs in the days before his testimony and seemed poised to shoot up higher. After sliding on Wednesday after his remarks, stocks were mixed today.
Although stock prices do not directly affect the economy, most economists believe that a bull market makes people feel wealthier and encourages them to spend more. With unemployment already low at 4.9 percent, economists said that any further pickup in demand caused by a booming market could tilt the economy into an inflationary danger zone.
"This unfettered financial market optimism began to worry him," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey Lanston & Company, a securities firm. "If you get too much optimism in the financial markets it puts additional wind at the back of the real economy, and that's dangerous when it happens at a time of full employment."
But in raising the specter of inflation, Mr. Greenspan may have been speaking as much to the bond market as to the stock market. The Fed chairman is a proven master at convincing the bond market to do some of the Fed's work by pushing up market-based interest rates even when the Fed is not raising the official rates it controls.
After a series of economic reports last week showed that the economy was cooling off slightly from its torrid 4 percent growth rate of the first half of the year, investors had concluded that there was little possibility of any rate increase by the Fed at least until next year -- and that there was even some possibility that the Fed's next move might be to lower rates.
As a result, bond prices jumped, pushing market-determined interest rates -- which move inversely with bond prices -- down to their lowest levels since early last year. Mr. Greenspan, economists said, wanted to halt the slide in interest rates, or better, to push rates higher at a time when the Fed is concerned about inflation but has no political cover or strong economic case for tightening monetary policy on its own.
"He's trying to get the market to do the Fed's work because the Fed doesn't have the provocation or the latitude to tighten on their own," said Roseanne M. Cahn, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
The bond market responded to Mr. Greenspan by sending rates up sharply on Wednesday, although rates declined a bit today on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond after the Fed's vice chairwoman, Alice M. Rivlin, said the central bank did not yet know whether it would need to raise rates.
Within the Fed, Mr. Greenspan remains by far the dominant voice on monetary policy. The central bank's policy-making committee has backed Mr. Greenspan's unwillingness to be bound by the longstanding assumption that unemployment below about 5.5 percent combined with growth in excess of about 2.2 percent is a sure-fire recipe for inflation.
Mr. Greenspan has been proved right so far, since inflation is nowhere to be found. And his willingness to take the risk has underscored the belief that Mr. Greenspan believes the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth is being improved, albeit haltingly, by huge investments in technology and an attendant improvement in productivity, or the output of a worker for a period of time worked.
But Mr. Greenspan's flirtation with the idea of a "new era" economy has put him in a different camp from the economic traditionalists within the Fed, led by Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor. The traditionalists continue to believe that unemployment below 5.5 percent or so, combined with strong growth, will lead to an upturn in inflation.
In his testimony Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan made clear that while he might not agree with the traditionalists in every detail, he continued to accept the core of their argument: that the current combination of low unemployment and strong growth would ultimately send wages and prices higher, and that it remained unclear whether the economy was slowing sufficiently on its own to avoid such an outcome.
Some analysts said it was possible that Mr. Greenspan had decided to show his more hawkish side on inflation to avoid finding himself out of step with the traditionalists if signs of rising prices do begin appearing in coming weeks and months. The next test will be Friday when some economists expect the Producer Price Index for September to show some evidence of inflationary pressures.

Jobless Claims Fall
 (By The Associated Press) -- The number of new claims for jobless benefits remained below 310,000 last week for a fourth straight week, the longest such string in nearly nine years, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Claims unexpectedly fell by 5,000 -- analysts had expected an increase of 2,000 -- to a seasonally adjusted 304,000, the lowest in more than two months. The four-week average of claims fell by 2,000, to 306,750.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Chrysler Profit Down 35%, A Little Better Than Feared

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 10

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation's earnings fell 35 percent in the third quarter, to $441 million, as the company prepared for the introduction of several new models while running out of the old ones.
The earnings were slightly better than analysts had feared. Chrysler further cheered Wall Street by announcing today that it would buy back an additional $2 billion of its stock by the end of next year. 
 The No. 3 auto maker's earnings of $441 million, or 65 cents a share, came on $13.2 billion in sales in the third quarter, down from $680 million, or 93 cents a share, on $14.4 billion in sales in the quarter a year earlier. Wall Street had expected Chrysler to earn 58 cents a share in the third quarter, according to a survey of analysts by First Call Inc. The earnings were dampened by a $41 million pretax charge for discontinuing the Eagle line at the end of the 1998 model year.
Just this week, Chrysler began selling its new sport utility vehicle, the Dodge Durango, which is expected to prove popular because of its aggressive design and size -- it is larger than the Ford Explorer and the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Two redesigned sedans, the Dodge Intrepid and the Chrysler Concorde, go on sale this fall. Dealers have been running short of the 1997 Intrepid and Concorde in the meantime. Chrysler is also selling a new four-door Dodge Ram pickup truck, and a new luxury version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee.
Analysts are counting on Chrysler's new cars and trucks to increase profit. "The new products will add $1 a share" to Chrysler's earnings next year, said Scott F. Merlis, president of Merlis Automotive International, an independent automotive research firm in Westport, Conn. Each Durango the company sells should bring in thousands of dollars in profit.
Third-quarter earnings were also hurt by the costly rebates and subsidized lease offers that Chrysler and most other auto makers have been using to keep sales strong. Chrysler's incentives reached $1,140 for each vehicle in the third quarter, up from $685 in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Gary C. Valade, the chief financial officer, said he expected incentives to remain in the $900-to-$1,100 range for some time, and noted that the increase in incentive spending accounted for about 40 percent of the third-quarter earnings decline.
Even today, Chrysler announced additional rebates intended to spur slow sales of its 1998-model mini-vans and small cars. The Dodge and Plymouth Neon now carry $1,500 rebates, and the mini-vans, rebates of $750 to $1,000.
Some auto analysts were cautious about the company's prospects in the fourth quarter. "They do have some very strong new products coming, but the market is getting more competitive," said Wendy Beale Needham of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Chrysler said its new share-repurchase plans signaled its confidence in the future. "We expect the industry, the economy and consumer confidence to remain strong through 1998," said Robert J. Eaton, the company's chairman and chief executive. "We believe we are well positioned to meet the competitive challenges of the market, and we remain committed to returning solid value to our shareholders." Since 1995, Chrysler has bought back nearly $5 billion of its stock.
Chrysler's shares rose on the earnings and buyback news, ending the day up 93.75 cents at $35.375.
Also today, the company's finance arm, the Chrysler Financial Corporation, reported net earnings of $111 million for the quarter, up from $94 million in the quarter last year.

HEADLINE: Autocratic Kazak Leader Ousts His Reformist Premier

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 10

 BODY:
The autocratic leader of Kazakstan removed his reformist Prime Minister today, prompting worry about investment in the Central Asian republic, which is rich in oil deposits.
The collapse of the Government of Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin had been a subject of rumor for about two years. 
 But some Western business people were surprised by the choice to replace him, a comparatively conservative technocrat who is a close ally of President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
The nation of 17 million people on the Caspian Sea has staked its future on billions of dollars in American and other foreign investment in its huge untapped oil fields.
In three years as Prime Minister, Mr. Kazhegeldin, 45, was responsible for much of the investment, conducting what was widely regarded as the swiftest industrial privatization in the former Soviet Union. In addition, last month he signed a $9.5 billion oil deal with China.
But Mr. Kazhegeldin, while popular with Western diplomats and business people, irritated many of the Soviet-era officials who administered the enterprises he worked to privatize. He also developed a high political profile, which Western diplomats and business people had predicted Mr. Nazarbayev would not tolerate for long.
Mr. Kazhegeldin left Kazakstan last month for Switzerland for treatment of a blood clot in his lungs, and it was not clear when he would return.
Most experts saw his removal as a power grab by the President, who has gradually reclaimed most of the sweeping powers he enjoyed as Kazakstan's Communist leader before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Mr. Nazarbayev sought to allay fears about his new Prime Minister, Nurlan Balgimbayev, 49, a former oilman who once worked for the San Francisco-based Chevron Oil Company. "I should pay tribute to the current Government, which worked energetically in difficult conditions," Mr. Nazarbayev said in a speech. "But at the same time the strategy of the President in the economy has not been implemented in full. Reforms have been insufficient and in some aspects have not yielded expected results."
Mr. Balgimbayev had been head of the state-run energy company, Kazakoil, and an intimate of Mr. Nazarbayev. Western experts said that the new Prime Minister's broad economic views were not known but that, as head of Kazakoil, he had displayed a preference for state control of energy enterprises -- the source of much of the skittishness generated by today's announcement.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
'The Bell Curve,' Revisited by Scholars

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
"The Bell Curve" inflamed readers when it was published three years ago by arguing that economic and social success in America had become largely a matter of genes, not education, environment or other factors over which society might exert control. The chilling genes-are-destiny thesis, laced with racial overtones, was greeted with furious criticism. But much of the initial criticism was ill informed and driven by ideology.
It could hardly have been otherwise. The book's authors, Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, did not release their statistical findings -- the only important original contributions in the book -- for formal review by scholars before publication. Their runaround obstructed response by other social scientists, who needed time to appraise hundreds of pages of statistical analysis. Now, three years later, scholars have caught up, shattering the book's core claims. 
 Messrs. Herrnstein and Murray use statistical tools to determine whether differences in intelligence or environment better explain, for example, which individuals commit crimes, drop out of high school or wind up poor. The authors find that, in their all-white sample, low intelligence leads to social pathology. High intelligence leads to success. Family background plays a secondary role. That suggests that compensatory education and training are almost certain to fail.
That core finding would be devastating if true. But other scholars have now decisively shown that the book's evidence is riddled with mistakes. Two stand out.
The first error flows from biased statistics. The book tries to determine whether I.Q. or family background is a better predictor of success. I.Q. is easily measured. But family background is not. The authors' simplistic index incorporates parental income, education and job prestige, but leaves out numerous components of a child's upbringing.
That creates a statistical mirage, or bias, because statistical tests inevitably underestimate the impact of factors that are hard to measure. Mistakes in measuring family background obliterate the ability of statisticians to detect its impact on future success. Thus, as James Heckman of the University of Chicago has convincingly argued, the book's finding that family background is a weak precursor of success reflects its biased methods rather than the workings of American society.
Also compelling is evidence about the second notable error -- that the authors' measure of intelligence is by no means immutable, as their thesis requires. Prof. Derek Neal of the University of Chicago and Prof. William Johnson of the University of Virginia have shown that scores on the measurement used by Mr. Herrnstein and Mr. Murray, the Armed Forces Qualification Test, depend on how much schooling individuals have completed. Put simply, the more students study in school, the better they do on the test. So what the authors call immutable intelligence turns out to be what others call skills -- indeed, teachable skills.
This mistake turns the message of the book on its head. Instead of its sighing surrender to supposed genetic destiny for poor children, there's a corrected message: Teach them. MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Exceed Forecast With 0.5% Rise

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
The Government reported today that producer prices rose at an unexpectedly steep rate in September, but analysts said the increase was mostly a result of temporary factors and did not necessarily portend a resurgence in inflation.
The Producer Price Index, which measures the prices paid to manufacturers and other producers of goods, increased five-tenths of 1 percent last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. That was the biggest jump since December and more than twice the increase that most economists had predicted. 
 Much of the rise came from a 1.5 percent increase in energy costs, which climbed after crude oil prices rebounded over the summer.
Excluding food and energy, both of which tend to jump around for reasons having little to do with the strength of the economy, the so-called core index rose four-tenths of 1 percent, its highest rate since November 1995.
But the increase last month in the core index was misleading, analysts said. Much of the rise was driven by higher costs for new cars and for tobacco, and neither of those categories is likely to show any substantial increases in prices this month, they said.
Still, the figures amounted to enough of an inflation scare to send shudders through the financial markets, which were already jittery after statements on Wednesday by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Greenspan said then that the combination of strong growth and low unemployment had put the economy on an "unsustainable track."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 60 points before recovering to close at 8,045.21, down 16.21 points for the day. Bond prices also fell, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond up to 6.42 percent, from 6.35 percent on Thursday.
Analysts said that because of all the quirks in today's price report, the figures would not be viewed by the Fed as evidence of a broad-based pickup in inflation. Financial markets have been increasingly concerned that the Fed might raise interest rates as soon as its next meeting, on Nov. 12, if the economy shows any signs of incipient inflation.
"It's obviously had an impact because Greenspan has put the markets on heightened alert," said Bill Dudley, an economist with Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York. "But in terms of this telling us inflation has now arrived, the evidence just isn't there."
September was the second consecutive month in which the index rose, following seven straight months of declines in producer prices. As a result, producer prices so far this year have fallen at a 1.4 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate.
Economists said that a look into measures of inflation farther back on the production chain also showed no evidence of mounting price pressures. The index for intermediate materials, supplies and components rose three-tenths of 1 percent in September, but was flat after factoring out food and energy. The index for crude materials rose six-tenths of 1 percent in September, but actually fell 1 percent after factoring out food and energy.
"This is not the smoking gun," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist with Paine Webber. "There is nothing in here that should be upsetting to people at the Fed. Greenspan certainly knows how to distinguish a blip from a trend, and this is just a blip."
Mr. Harris said the rise in car prices was a statistical fluke caused by seasonal adjustments.
Before seasonal adjustment, the index for passenger cars fell 1.8 percent last month to a level 2.1 percent below where it stood a year earlier. But after seasonal adjustment, the index showed a 1.4 percent rise in car prices -- a finding that might make statistical sense but does not fully reflect what is happening in the real world.
Analysts said the surge in the Producer Price Index, however misleading about inflation trends, suggested that the Consumer Price Index for September, which will be released on Thursday, would also probably show a spike.
Economists had been forecasting that the September consumer index would show a rise of about three-tenths of 1 percent, but they said the index could be pushed even higher by the surge in tobacco prices, as well as rising air fares, gasoline prices and clothing prices.

Outside Theodore Roosevelt High School in the Bronx, referring to Thursday night's debate:
 
"There was a small piece of good news last night. For the first time, the Mayor actually sounded like he didn't think every problem in the city had been solved. He said he knew that there were substantial problems in the school system that still need to be addressed. He denied that he had ever said that rising unemployment was a sign of economic health. And he seemed to acknowledge that there was a problem with police brutality. That was the good news. The striking thing was that he then said those were issues that needed to be worked on. But he didn't tell you how, he didn't tell you who. He didn't have any direct answers to the points that I made." 

RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI
At Central Park for the reopening of the Great Lawn, referring to Thursday night's debate:
 
"I was somewhat surprised at the harshness and the personal invective from my opponent. I didn't think it would be at that level. But, you know, everybody makes the choice as to how they're going to present themselves and people can decide if that was the right or wrong choice, to be quite as personal, quite as harsh in the rhetoric and the approach. Debates always change. People change their styles and I would imagine in the next debate that my opponent will not be as personal, won't call names as often. Because I think what people find is if you do that, it hurts you."

HEADLINE: Messinger Fights to Stir Women;
Tepid Support by Her Base Is Seen as an Ominous Sign

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
When Ruth W. Messinger rose to speak about domestic violence at the Y.W.C.A. in midtown Manhattan the other morning, it marked the fourth time in 24 hours that the Democratic mayoral candidate had campaigned before an audience of women. The room was half-filled, and as Ms. Messinger methodically laid out her program, several women dozed off while a few others slipped out the door.
Ms. Messinger's intense and increasing focus on women in recent weeks reflects the belief of many political analysts that female voters will be crucial to her prospects of defeating Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani next month. Even when speaking to a mostly male audience at a fund-raiser with Vice President Al Gore on Thursday, Ms. Messinger referred to herself as "a daughter, a mother, a grandmother and a wife." 
 But the fact that the Democratic mayoral candidate needs to tend these political vines less than a month before Election Day -- and that she has encountered the kind of desultory reaction she found at the forum organized by women at the Y.W.C.A. on Tuesday -- suggests that female voters have not emerged as the powerful source of support Ms. Messinger had expected in her effort become the first woman to run the nation's largest city.
For all the potential significance of her challenge to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, women have yet to embrace Ms. Messinger as a symbol of political advancement, in the view of academics, pollsters and even some of Ms. Messinger's supporters. Ms. Messinger's candidacy has not become for women the sort of rallying point that David N. Dinkins's campaign was for many black voters in 1989, when he was elected the city's first black Mayor. And that is a matter of growing concern among some of her female supporters.
"One would expect Ruth to have been able to develop in this campaign strong support among women," City Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, one of Ms. Messinger's supporters, said. She added, "I think there's still time for that to happen."
Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan of Queens, another Messinger supporter, said, "I think her candidacy is symbolic -- it could be symbolic, and it can be symbolic.
"Up until now, the campaign has perhaps not done as well as they should. Because she's a women, sometimes in a campaign there's a tendency to say, 'That speaks for itself.' "
From a national perspective, some experts say, the election is emerging not as a milestone for women, but as the latest sign that female candidates are no longer the novelty they once were. The excitement that was once stirred by the prospect of a woman running for prominent office is no longer automatic.
"Voters are kind of going ho-hum," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has studied women's campaigns across the nation. Debbie Walsh, the acting director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said the Messinger campaign is the latest indication that women, both as candidates and as officeholders, "are becoming more familiar to voters."
This could be an ominous development for Ms. Messinger, whose sex had been viewed by Democrats and Republicans as one of her most potent political advantages. The view among many New Yorkers that Mr. Giuliani has done a good job -- especially on the issue of crime, which some pollsters argue is more important to women than to men -- may trump whatever advantage Ms. Messinger sought in the potential symbolism of her candidacy.
Women made up 57 percent of the turnout in the 1993 New York mayoral contest, exit polls at the time found. They are also more likely than men to be Democrats and more likely than men to vote, and they voted against Mr. Giuliani in both 1989 and 1993 -- all of which should be encouraging news for Ms. Messinger.
What is more, there has been repeated evidence over the last 20 years of what is called a gender gap, a measurable difference in the way men and women vote. Since women vote more heavily than men, that has tended to make the female vote especially sought after. President Clinton, for example, enjoyed a strong lead among women during last year's presidential election, but he trailed Bob Dole among male voters.
Ms. Messinger argued that the same phenomenon would be evident in the weeks ahead because she has addressed issues -- in particular, education and domestic violence -- of concern to women voters. "Because I am raising those issues, there is likely to be a gender gap in this election -- that is, a different pattern of voting between women and men," Ms. Messinger said, sitting next to Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, who had come to to New York to appear at what Ms. Messinger had billed as a National Women's Power Breakfast. And moments earlier, before a boisterous crowd of about 300 women, Ms. Messinger declared, "This campaign will be decided by women."
But so far, private and public polls suggest, the gap only means that Ms. Messinger is doing less poorly among women than among men. "There clearly is, in the public polls, a gender gap," Jim Andrews, Ms. Messinger's chief campaign consultant, said. "It's basically a tie among women, when it's not with men."
Mr. Andrews argued that this would change in the remaining weeks of the campaign, particularly as Ms. Messinger emphasizes issues that they believe help her among female voters. But Mr. Giuliani's political advisers, and some independent pollsters, said they believed that women would if anything turn even more toward Mr. Giuliani as Election Day approaches. "For some reason, her message -- or more accurately, her candidacy -- does not seem to be resonating with women," said Frank Luntz, who is Mr. Giuliani's pollster.
There are some analysts who suggested that Ms. Messinger's candidacy had not yet become a rallying cry for women because she had not really tried to make it one. She entered politics in 1974, at a time when the profession was overwhelmingly male, but has never defined herself primarily in terms of a feminist agenda.
Now she is tending this part of her political base that some political analysts suggested she might have taken for granted. "It has not been as large an issue as it could be," Ms. Nolan said. She said the fund-raiser with Ms. Landrieu signaled a new phase for the campaign.
But Mr. Giuliani's supporters say Ms. Messinger's position among women is a reflection of her overall position in the race, as well as Mr. Giuliani's political strength. The Mayor's campaign, which has always been concerned about Ms. Messinger's potential appeal to women, has made an aggressive effort among those voters, including running advertisements attacking Ms. Messinger for opposing his proposal to ban pornography stores in certain city neighborhoods.
"The average female voter in New York is more concerned about safe streets, clean neighborhoods, and economic security than they are about electing a female Mayor," Fran Reiter, Mr. Giuliani's campaign manager, said. "I give Ruth credit for trying. But the Mayor's job approval is just too high."
Mr. Luntz, the campaign pollster, said: "I know that women were even more down on the city in 1993 then men. So for them to say that the city is heading in the right direction required a massive turnaround in perception."
Ms. Messinger said she would continue to try to make inroads among these voters by talking about issues of particular concern to women where, she argued, Mr. Giuliani has done a poor job. But Ms. Messinger received a reminder of how difficult this was the other night after finishing a 45-minute talk to a professional women's group at Julie's, a bar on East 52d Street, in which she talked about these issues, such as domestic violence, education and health care.
"Are there any other questions?" Ms. Messinger asked.
"Crime!" responded Catherine Anello, an office manager in Brooklyn, to a murmur of approval. It was the one issue Ms. Messinger had not discussed, and the one issue, pollsters find, that men and women consistently say male elected officials handle better.
Ms. Messinger gave her standard answer on the subject, which is that she shared Ms. Anello's concern and thought there was still room for additional improvement. But after she left, Ms. Anello, a Democrat who had applauded warmly as Ms. Messinger spoke, was not persuaded.
"I'm probably going to vote for Giuliani," Ms. Anello said. "I guess I feel safer than I did four years ago."

HEADLINE: At the Heels of Bull Elephants;
Nimble, Small Stocks Chase Big Blue Chips And Lately That Means Bigger Gains

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
Glenn Fogle could feel his investors' pain early this year. Through several mutual funds that he manages, the investors had loaded up on the shares of smaller companies, only to watch in dismay as their prices sank while those of blue-chip stocks like Coca-Cola and Gillette kept soaring.
Many of his clients bolted, cashing out at the punishing rate of $2 million a day and giving him some black and blue marks of his own. 
 "It was like being beaten up by a schoolyard bully," Mr. Fogle said in a telephone interview from his office at American Century Investments in Kansas City, Mo.
That was then, when the elephant-size blue chips were leading the stock market higher in a narrow advance that gave some analysts the jitters. But instead of diving into an abyss or at least slowing down, as so many pundits have long been predicting, the market has been broadening out in recent months, pushing up the prices of a herd of nimbler small and midsize companies, too. "We haven't been paid back yet for all the pain we endured, but there's been a real bounce," Mr. Fogle said.
The market expansion reflects a growing confidence by investors in the economy as a whole, analysts say. Smaller companies have more potential for growth than big, mature businesses do, but they also present more risks, drawing those who are willing to give up the relative safety of bigger stocks. That vote of confidence, in turn, is a strong signal that the market's remarkable run of the last three years may have plenty of life left in it, the analysts add.
"It's generally presumed that if the market broadens out like this, it's not going to roll over and die," said William E. Rhodes, an investment strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company. "This is a real sign that the market can go higher."
It is also the reason why analysts are less worried now by a comparison of this year's stock market with the ill-fated market of 1987, which did not broaden out before crashing almost exactly 10 years ago. The current market, many experts say, looks a lot more like the one in 1995, which was marked by such a broad advance that it kicked the bull market into high gear.
"There's a very high correlation between 1995 and 1997," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn. "You could run a railroad over them -- they're very parallel."
To be sure, anything can happen in a stock market like this one, which has also become markedly volatile in recent months. Just this week, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, rattled the market -- though not many smaller stocks -- with a warning that it was unrealistic to expect the huge stock gains of recent years to continue. American investors also watched nervously this week as Europe was jolted by Germany's decision to raise interest rates and Southeast Asia coped with a spreading financial crisis.
Making things even more problematic is the fact that a broadening of the market is sometimes a bad thing: as when it gains because of a speculative buying frenzy that bids up the prices of even the most marginal companies, which can turn into a selling panic at the first sign of trouble. Yet few experts see this happening now.
Instead, the new rush to smaller companies has the bulls feeling more bullish and the bears entertaining a lot of second thoughts.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the strategist at Goldman, Sachs, who has been one of the market's biggest boosters, has just raised her forecast for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, in part because of the broadening of the market.
"When investors have confidence that inflation is under control and economic and profit growth will continue, that's when they're willing to broaden out their portfolios," Ms. Cohen said. "When you don't have that confidence, you focus on the bigger companies because they tend to have more consistent results."
And Steven Leuthold, an analyst at the Leuthold Group, who had predicted a 30 percent fall this year for the Dow Jones industrial average, now says that the appetite for small-company stocks has changed his mind. While still contending that this is the "most overvalued market in history," Mr. Leuthold says it could take until next year before it "peaks out."
What the bulls, of long standing or not, are focused on is the tale of the tape. While the Dow -- the most widely followed index -- is up 24.8 percent this year, broader measures are up even more. For instance, the Wilshire 5000 -- an index of all United States equities -- has risen 30.7 percent.
For the last three years, the market had been dominated by big-name stocks with strong earnings gains, like Travelers Group Inc. and General Electric. These stocks helped spark a buying frenzy for index funds, mutual funds that mimic indexes like the S.& P. 500, which tracks the largest companies.
But in recent months, after several blue-chip companies warned of slowing earnings prospects, investors began bidding up shares of smaller companies, many of which had strong second-quarter profits and relatively low price-to-earnings ratios. As a result, the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company issues gained 14.5 percent in the third quarter, while the Dow rose just 3.6 percent, and the S.& P. 500 gained 7 percent.
Usually, analysts say, smaller companies outperform bigger ones coming out of a recession, when growth is expected to be strongest. And so this year's broad gains this late in a bull cycle seem odd. "It's almost like the bull market started all over again," said Melissa Brown, director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities.
If the smaller issues continue to outperform the large ones, they will regain their historical position as market leaders, for in the long run, smaller stocks tend to do better. One reason, according to Mr. Rhodes at Merrill Lynch, is that smaller issues are primarily growth stories, part of the American dream. Everyone is trying to find the next big growth stock.
"This is what money managers get paid to do, to find companies that have good prospects," Mr. Rhodes said. "And there have been some classic American tales. There was the one about the little typewriter company that became I.B.M. And one about this clodhopper who rode around in a pickup truck in Arkansas. He had a great idea for retailing, and that became Wal-Mart. And then there were these three refugees from the Fairchild Company, and they started this little five-letter company named Intel. These are all stories about visionary managers, being in the right place at the right time."
If investors really are broadening their basket of stocks by searching for good buys, and not simply speculating, then the worries about parallels with 1987 should diminish, analysts say, particularly with regard to a late-year selloff. In 1987, a 44 percent rise in the Dow through August was whittled down to a year-end gain of just 2.3 percent, in large part because of the crash on Oct. 19.
Unlike 1987, when the market depended on a blue-chip advance, this year's gains recall those of 1995, when the Dow, S.& P. 500 and Nasdaq composite index of generally smaller stocks all gained better than 30 percent -- a sign that bullish sentiment was widespread. And this year, Mr. Birinyi said, investors have been similarly optimistic.
Even during downturns this year, investors have quietly snapped up equities, ignoring the dire predictions of a coming collapse, he said. And of the late summer selloff that saw the Dow lose 7.7 percent from its Aug. 6 high, Mr. Birinyi was simply dismissive. "The bulls were ahead 9 to 1 and the bears outscored them in the sixth inning," he said. "It wasn't that big a deal."
That kind of optimism has catapulted the market ahead, again and again. Success has bred more success. While there are no guarantees about where the market is headed, one thing is clear: almost every time the market has broadened out in recent years, there have been gains in the following months.
For instance, when the Russell 2000 index, which dates back to 1979, has gained better than 20 percent in a given year, the average rise in the following year is 14.9 percent. Only once, in 1984, did the index lose ground after a 20 percent gain.
Of course, much of the market's rise can be attributed to the continued enthusiasm for stocks in general, the belief that equities remain the best single investment. This is particularly the case for the 76 million baby boomers, who are worrying about retirement and have been flooding stock mutual funds with billions of dollars each month.
That sentiment has been buttressed by a healthy economic environment, marked by low inflation and plentiful profits. American technological might is creating new markets, and fostering greater efficiencies. The cold war is over, and capitalism is on the march.
"We have unprecedented international conditions, and that's one reason people are bidding up stocks to these prices," said Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "We don't have the same instability we had years ago, and so stocks are worth more because what you're doing is taking a lot of the old-fashioned risk out of them."
Even micro-cap funds, which track the tiniest of public companies, are up 41.6 percent this year. And when the market broadens, the average mutual fund (which tends to be diversified) also gains, as does the average investor.
Take Gerald Garry, a retired marketing executive who lives in Chappaqua, N.Y. Mr. Garry once had to count on blue-chip issues for all his gains. But recently, his diversified portfolio has begun to show signs of life. A fund dedicated to small-company stocks surged in the third quarter, rewarding Mr. Garry with a 22.8 percent gain -- the best small-cap gain he has seen in his four years of investing.
"It all came together in the third quarter -- I did very well," Mr. Garry said in a telephone interview from his home. "This is a real plus for the small investor, who can go with any sector and not be worried about picking the wrong segment."
Analysts and academics alike, not to mention Mr. Greenspan, worry that small investors like Mr. Garry are being lulled into a false sense of security by the bull market's persistence.
This has been a period of truly outsized gains. Since 1982, the point at which many analysts say the bull market began, the compounded annual return on stocks has been about 16.8 percent -- twice the historical average.
"Success has fed on itself and that's a worrisome prospect," Professor Siegel said, "because people's expectations are not grounded in long-term history. Fifteen years may seem like a long time, but it's not long in financial history."
But Peter J. Canelo, a market strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company, said investors have had few alternatives that would cause them to turn their backs on such a splendid bull run.
"Why in the world," he asked, "would anyone want to buy a bond?"

HEADLINE: First Thing We Do, Let's Pay All the Lawyers

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
The $49 million in legal fees and costs resulting from a tobacco litigation settlement today in which the plaintiffs received no money was criticized by some legal scholars.
Others, though, said large fees allowed lawyers to take difficult cases. 
 "It appears that what you have here is an awful lot of money -- $49 million -- for the lawyers, which is probably many times more than what their legal work on the case was worth," Prof. George Priest of Yale University Law School said. "It has all the earmarks of a settlement motivated by attorneys' fees rather than the members of the class bringing the suit."
The agreement, in which four of the largest tobacco companies agreed to spend $300 million on research into smoking-related illnesses, came in a class-action lawsuit by flight attendants who said smoking by others on their airplanes made them ill.
Individual plaintiffs in the case settled today are to receive no money but the tobacco companies will pay $49 million in fees and costs to the flight attendants' lawyers, Stanley and Susan Rosenblatt, who filed the lawsuit in 1991. The pact also involves agreements on possible future lawsuits by individual flight attendants or their survivors.
Mr. Priest, the John M. Olin Professor of Law and Economics, is regarded as a leading conservative scholar, but Prof. Susan Koniak of Boston University Law School, a noted liberal, expressed almost identical concerns.
"The only ones who got rich here are the lawyers," said Professor Koniak, who has written extensively about jury awards.
Ms. Koniak said that if she were a plaintiff and her lawyer told her that at the end of the effort the lawyer would get a handsome fee while a larger amount of money would go to benefit society, and she would get nothing herself, she would say, "Are you insane? Why would I possibly agree to that?"
The legal fees collected by the Rosenblatts are about 16 percent of the $300 million donation to research, which Prof. Lester Brickman of the Cardozo Law School of Yeshiva University said was an acceptable range in a class-action suit. Professor Brickman is generally critical of large fees but said they were sometimes necessary to provide an incentive for lawyers to take such a case in the first place.
In a contingency fee arrangement, a lawyer agrees to undertake a case without charge but to take a percentage of the award if the suit is successful.
"The traditional phrase is that a contingency fee is the key to the courthouse for most Americans and that is true," Mr. Brickman said. "Given the extremely high cost of litigation today, very few Americans can get to court without this."

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Take Steep Fall On Rise in Producer Costs

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday as a surprisingly strong report on producer prices stoked worries over inflation that had been raised by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
Bonds sold off immediately after the Labor Department's report showing a jump of five-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index for September. Analysts had been expecting a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent. While bonds bounced back, they never fully recovered in the pre-holiday shortened session. 
 The 30-year Treasury bond fell 30/32, to a price of 99 12/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.42 percent, from 6.35 percent on Thursday and back to where it was nearly a month ago. Trading ended yesterday at 2 P.M. The Treasury market is closed on Monday in observance of Columbus Day.
The sharp rise in producer prices, however, came largely on a 1.5 percent increase in energy costs, an often volatile category. And even when food and energy costs had been excluded, the four-tenths of 1 percent rise in the so-called core rate of producer prices was driven largely by higher costs for new cars and tobacco, price gains that are unlikely to be sustained.
Still, the report shook investors already jittery about inflation. On Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan warned that a resurgence in inflation might be lurking just around the corner if strong growth drove unemployment lower and pushed wages higher. And interest rate increases by a number of European central banks on Thursday showed that policy makers worldwide were also concerned about inflation.
"The market is taking a knee-jerk reaction to the data," said Jack Ablin, executive vice president and head of the fixed-income department at Barnett Capital Advisers Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla. "By combining Greenspan's statement this week with today's large number, the market has conluded that the Fed will tighten at the November Federal Open Market Committee meeting."
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, an economic consulting and forecasting firm, said: "After Fed Chairman Greenspan's warning on Wednesday, this data could be viewed as the beginning of an argument for the need to raise interest rates in the next few months. But we think that this would be reading too much into both the Fed's chairman's remarks and the September P.P.I."
Mr. McCarthy said he thought Mr. Greenspan was telling the financial markets that the Fed was not going to ease rates any time in the forseeable future, not that he was about to raise rates.

HEADLINE: Judge Rules City Hall Must Surrender Records to State Comptroller in an Audit Fight

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
A State Supreme Court Justice ruled yesterday that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani must turn over city records that State Comptroller H. Carl McCall had requested in his effort to audit city agencies.
City officials immediately vowed to fight the decision and said they would not comply with the judge's order until an appeals court had reviewed the case. 
 Mayor Giuliani and Mr. McCall have been fighting for months over the Comptroller's right to investigate certain city agencies. Last spring the Mayor ordered city officials to evict state auditors who were trying to review documents at two city agencies. The Mayor accused Mr. McCall of ordering audits that were politically motivated and were intended to embarrass him during his re-election campaign.
Mr. McCall countered that the Mayor was acting illegally and said that his refusal to cooperate raised questions about whether the Mayor was trying to hide something.
The Republican Mayor and the Democratic Comptroller had negotiated a short-lived truce, but Mr. McCall ultimately issued 17 subpoenas to try to obtain records from six city agencies.
Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob of State Supreme Court ruled yesterday that Mr. McCall had the authority to request the information from the agencies, and ordered the city to comply with Mr. McCall's subpoenas. "The audits at issue are within the powers granted to the Comptroller," she wrote in her opinion.
Mr. McCall applauded the decision and said it would enable him to do his job as the state's chief fiscal monitor "without unnecessary interference from those who would seek to hide from proper oversight." He also criticized the Mayor's attempt to stop his auditors from doing their work, calling the dispute "a sideshow from the proper activities of an effective, responsible government."
Paul A. Crotty, the city's Corporation Counsel, said the city would not allow the audits to take place, saying that the judge had failed to distinguish between a financial audit and a performance audit. The city had argued that while Mr. McCall has the authority to look at the books and accounts of city agencies, he does not have the right to review the way city agencies actually perform.
As an example, Mr. Crotty said the Comptroller could review overtime costs at the Police Department, but did not have the right to review how many police officers are on the streets and how they are deployed.
"The judge's decision misses the whole distinction that we were trying to draw," Mr. Crotty said.
The subpoenas were directed at the city's Finance Department, Police Department, Human Resources Administration, Taxi and Limousine Commission, Department of Health and Administration for Children's Services. The Comptroller had hoped to review issues like the training of caseworkers at the Administration for Children's Services, the adequacy of the Police Department's system for reporting arrests, and the effectiveness of economic development and tax incentive programs.
When told that the city would continue to fight the audit attempt, Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for Mr. McCall said, "It really is outrageous that the city continues to believe that the city is above the law."

HEADLINE: 3 Weak Days Trim Week's Gain in Dow

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING

 BODY:
Stocks slipped yesterday, their third consecutive decline, leaving the Dow Jones industrial average with little to show for the week.
Stocks started the week on track toward new highs, and on Tuesday the Dow reached 8,178.31, just 81 points away from its peak, touched on Aug. 6. 
 But remarks on Wednesday by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, interest rate increases in Europe on Thursday and an unexpected rise in September producer prices reported yesterday caused stocks to swoon.
Yesterday, stocks were initially jarred by a stronger-than-expected gain of five-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index, but they later recovered. The Dow, after falling nearly 60 points, at one point, closed at 8,045.21, off 16.21 points. For the week, the Dow was up 6.63.
Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks lost 3.64 yesterday, closing at 966.98, up 1.95 for the week.
But the Nasdaq composite, which lost 6.82 yesterday, ended the week nearly 1.4 percent higher, at 1,739.03.
And the Russell index of 2,000 smaller companies posted a 1.2 percent gain for the week, adding 0.48 point yesterday, to 465.03, another high, as investors continued to plow cash into the sector.
"Greenspan and the P.P.I. basically took a lot of momentum out of the market," said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Smith Barney. "A week ago, the Dow was on a tear, then Greenspan threw cold water on the bonds and ultimately the stock market."
The stock market eventually shrugged off the sharp rise in producer prices because it was fueled largely by a 1.5 percent rise in energy costs, an often volatile category.
And excluding food and energy costs, the four-tenths of 1 percent rise in the so-called core rate of producer prices was driven largely by higher costs for new cars and tobacco, price gains that are unlikely to be sustained, noted Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at Westfalia Investments. In addition, the P.P.I. fell in seven of the eight previous months this year, he added.
"I think people are saying after seven months of declines and you get one fairly high number, it's a one-time situation," Mr. Cardillo added.
Stocks climbed back from their lows because equity investors seem to have a more sanguine view of inflation and are waiting for visible signs of an increase, analysts said.
In addition, investors are optimistic that most third-quarter earnings reports will be positive, Mr. Acuff said.
Still, that optimism has not translated into blind euphoria, analysts said, as investors penalized companies that had missed earnings forecasts or could be hurt by a rise in inflation.
As a result, interest-rate-sensitive banking and financial services stocks like Chase Manhattan, BankAmerica, J. P. Morgan and American Express finished lower yesterday.
Regional and money center banks also accounted for more than 36 percent of the declines in the S.& P. 500 yesterday.
Waste Management fell 3 1/8, to 30 5/8, after the company said third-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts' forecasts.
In the currency market, the dollar fell against the yen after some tough comments from United States officials on Japanese auto trade practices. But the dollar gained against the mark.
In New York, the dollar settled at 119.78 yen, down from 121.10 yen on Thursday, and at 1.7486 marks, up from 1.7439 marks. The pound fell to $1.6223 from $1.6244.

HEADLINE: Giuliani and Messinger Keep Slugging on Day After Debate

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Ruth W. Messinger each took time out yesterday to disparage the other's performance in Thursday night's mayoral debate in Harlem.
Ms. Messinger said the Mayor had been "demeaning" and "insulting" in his response to her suggestion during the debate that after-school programs reduce gang activity. Mr. Giuliani, in his own post-mortem, expressed shock at what he called Ms. Messinger's "harshness" and "personal invective." 
 The two candidates are not scheduled to appear together again until the second and final debate on Oct. 29. As they maneuvered for advantage yesterday, Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Messinger both said that each had presented the clearest vision of how the city should be governed during next four years.
"I tried to outline our plans for the future," Mr. Giuliani said. "What that's going to be, what it's going to be based on. Increasing the crime reductions, improving the quality of life for the future, for the next two, three, four years, reinvesting more and more in the growth of the city."
The Mayor accused his Democratic rival of resorting to personal attacks. "I was somewhat surprised at the harshness and the personal invective from my opponent," he said after the ceremony that marked the opening of the replanted Great Lawn in Central Park. "I didn't think it would be at that level. But you know everybody makes the choice as to how they're going to present themselves."
And in a twist, Mr. Giuliani, whose aggressive style has prompted Ms. Messinger to refer repeatedly to him as a bully, said Ms. Messinger ought to change her style. "People change their styles and I would imagine in the next debate that my opponent will not be as personal, won't call names as often," he said. "Because I think what people find is if you do that, it hurts you."
For her part, Ms. Messinger said that Mr. Giuliani had failed to defend his record during the debate. "For the first time, the Mayor actually sounded like he didn't think every problem in the city had been solved," she said while campaigning yesterday in the Bronx. "He said he knew that there were substantial problems in the school system that still need to be addressed. He denied that he had ever said that rising unemployment was a sign of economic health."
Ms. Messinger, who has accused the Mayor of using sexist language during the campaign, said she was insulted by his response to her proposals for after-school programs, which she suggested would reduce gang activity and which the Mayor said would not be of interest to hardened gang members.
"I thought it was a demeaning comment on the extraordinary programs that are run around the city of which there were many, many more before Rudy Giuliani cut $15 million from the budget of the Department of Youth Services," Ms. Messinger said. "I think it's insulting to dramatize for the television audience that the lead organizer of the Bloods or Crips who has probably spent some time in jail won't be helped by a sewing circle," she said, adding that she saw "the combined insults in those remarks."
Carrying out a promise he made during the debate, Mr. Giuliani yesterday released a letter he wrote to a Federal judge on behalf of William D. Fugazy, the businessman and lobbyist, who was convicted of perjury during a bankruptcy proceeding and sentenced to two years probation in late September.
Ms. Messinger demanded to know why the Mayor, who she said is known for his law-and-order toughness, would come to the aid of Mr. Fugazy, who she noted was a contributor to the Giuliani campaign.
Mr. Giuliani said he wrote the letter seeking leniency for Mr. Fugazy because of Mr. Fugazy's long history of community service in New York City. Mr. Giuliani accused Ms. Messinger of politicizing a rare negative incident in the life of a generous community volunteer.

HEADLINE: THE FINE PRINT: Of Arms and Cruise Ships;
In a Bill's Shipbuilding Provision, Some See a Floating Pork Barrel

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Tucked inside a military appropriations bill signed by President Clinton this week was a provision that would give a billionaire investor a 30-year monopoly on the cruise business in the Hawaiian islands.
In return, the company controlled by the investor, Sam Zell, must commit to buying two American-built cruise ships for about $400 million apiece. 
 Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, the ranking Democrat on the Defense appropriations subcommittee, said the monopoly -- although he prefers the term "preference" -- was necessary to get Mr. Zell's company, American Classic Voyages, to shoulder the financial risk of buying the vessels. It was a small concession, he added, for a measure that would bolster Hawaiian tourism, jump-start an industry that has not built a large cruise ship in this country in more than 40 years, and reduce those shipyards' dependence on Federal funds.
"This project is a milestone for our U.S.-flag cruise ship industry," Senator Inouye said.
Others, however, describe the provision as little more than a stealth deal to protect a key business in the Senator's state from competition. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, a vocal critic of the provision, said there was "no compelling reason" to give American Classic a monopoly.
"I'm sure that many businesses would like to reduce their cost of capital to replace their infrastructure by convincing their lenders that their company is protected from any competition in its market," Mr. McCain said.
He also objected to a provision allocating $250,000 from a Defense Department program for initial design, but not construction, of the ships. The program is intended to develop technology for maritime uses.
"It is purely and simply an example of pork-barrel spending that has nothing to do with defense," Senator McCain said.
Although the provision has been passed by Congress, and President Clinton signed the Defense appropriations bill Wednesday, he has until Tuesday to exercise his line-item veto power. Mr. Clinton has used his line-item-veto power twice this year to cut projects from spending bills. On Monday, he struck 38 spending provisions worth $287 million from the military construction budget.
The President can use his line-item veto power to reject individual items of spending or tax legislation within one week of signing the legislation. The line-item veto was unsuccessfully sought by Presidents for more than a century before the Republicans included it in their 1994 Contract With America and enacted it in 1996.
A White House spokesman said the President had not yet received a memorandum from his staff regarding the possible use of the line item veto on the Defense appropriations bill. A spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget said yesterday that its staff had not yet completed scrutiny of the bill.
The cruise-ship provision, however, is about more than pork-barrel politics. Its mere proposal illustrates the constraints placed on companies like Mr. Zell's by the Jones Act -- a 77-year-old law that requires companies to use United States-built ships to transport passengers or goods between two United States ports. Most companies in the rapidly growing cruise industry buy ships built in foreign countries that have long subsidized their shipyards. Although cruise ships operated by these companies often stop at United States ports to board American passengers, they must visit a foreign port in between those stops to bypass the Jones Act.
There is support from many quarters for Senator Inouye's provision. Executives at American Classic Voyages, which is based in Chicago and operates ships on the Mississippi River and in Hawaii, said they wanted to expand in Hawaii but were uneasy about purchasing the first new United States cruise ships in decades.
Specifically, they said they were concerned about paying higher costs typically associated with a first-time venture. If they bought the first two ships, they said, a potential competitor might buy a third and fourth ship more cheaply and enter the Hawaiian market.
American Classic has never had direct competition since it started offering cruises in Hawaii in 1982. But the company said that barring rivals for the life of a new ship -- a minimum of 25 years -- would lower the risk of such an investment and create jobs in Hawaii and the United States shipbuilding industry.
If the provision were vetoed, American Classic would not buy the ships, said Philip C. Calian, the company's president.
"We're not asking for any government money," Mr. Calian said. "This is an exciting piece of public policy."
Navy officials and United States shipbuilders that proposed the provision said if the United States wanted to maintain dominance on the seas, shipbuilders needed more customers than the Navy.
"It is in our nation's interest for us to build commercial ships," said Cynthia Brown, president of the American Shipbuilding Association, which represents the country's six largest shipyards.
Shareholders in American Classic also appear hopeful the provision will pass. Analysts who follow American Classic's stock said its 70 percent rise since August was due in large part to Congressional passage of Senator Inouye's proposal.
But Mr. McCain is not alone in criticizing the prospect of granting a lengthy monopoly to a company. Lawrence J. White, professor of economics at the New York University Stern School of Business and former chief economist in the antitrust division of the Justice Department, said Mr. Inouye's provision was symptomatic of the protectionist nature of the Jones Act, which he called outdated in a global and deregulated economy.
"This is a terribly inefficient way for a dynamic U.S. economy to be behaving in world markets," Mr. White said.
Senator Inouye has said his provision will offer a preference, not a monopoly, to American Classic because the company will face competition from other forms of tourism in Hawaii, including cruises on foreign-built vessels that stop only once in Hawaii en route to a foreign port.
Mr. Zell and his company have donated $3,500 to Mr. Inouye's campaign in recent years, and Federal records show Mr. Zell tends to give relatively small amounts to candidates of both parties.
Although Mr. Inouye's provision does not name American Classic, it clearly states the company need not worry about a direct competitor for decades.
The proposal states that a company operating cruises among the Hawaiian islands on the date of enactment will commit to buying two United States-built cruise ships. It adds that the first ship will be delivered before 2005, and the second before 2008. It also states that another company may not operate any cruise ship accommodating at least 275 passengers among or between the Hawaiian Islands for the life of the ships, which is at least 25 years.
It further provides for a waiver from the Jones Act to allow the company to operate a foreign-built ship until 24 months after the second American-built ship is delivered. For that two-year period, American Classic could be operating as many as four ships in Hawaii.
Ms. Brown of the American Shipbuilding Association said that four of its members would be most likely to bid for the contract to build the two ships: Avondale Industries in New Orleans; the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company in San Diego; Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Va., and the Ingalls Shipbuilding division of Litton Industries, based in Pascagoula, Miss. Ingalls would certainly have the political edge, given that Mississippi is the home state of Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader.
If the provision is not vetoed by Mr. Clinton, Mr. McCain would introduce legislation next year to overturn Mr. Inouye's provision, according to an aide in Mr. McCain's office.

HEADLINE: U.S. Has Training Shortage, Not Labor Shortage

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Norbert Walter argues that because the United States has a shortage of skilled labor, and Western Europe has a surplus, greater immigration is the solution (Op-Ed, Oct. 4). 
 But there is a huge underutilized capacity in the millions of untrained Americans struggling to make an honest living or relegated to a life of crime and drugs. More than seven million are officially counted as unemployed. Twice that number are in dead-end temporary or part-time jobs, or, after being out of work more than 26 weeks, are no longer counted.
Europeans long ago realized government must play a creative role in developing citizens' skills. In Germany and France, per capita government spending on education and training has far outpaced spending in the United States. Instead of further undermining the security of workers, we should question the wisdom of letting the Federal Reserve raise interest rates at the first signs that real living standards may finally be rising.

Missing Money

To the Editor:
Norbert Walter's suggestion that the United States become an employer of last resort for Europe's unemployed (Op-Ed, Oct. 4) rests on a questionable presumption. If there is a major shortage of high-skilled workers in the United States, one could expect significant increases in their salaries. Such is not the case. 
 Mr. Walter cites a shortage in computer workers, but according to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, salaries for computer analysts and programmers, adjusted for inflation, have been level for five years.
If shortages do arise, they can be addressed best by employers who fully utilize available human resources, more appropriately reward workers who are responsible for their current prosperity, and invest in training to the high level of European competitors.

Help Workers Succeed

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The suggestion that the United States import skilled labor from Europe is appalling (Op-Ed, Oct. 4). We must take advantage of our prosperity to help those with low skills move into jobs with good pay and benefits. 
 The Education Department's National Adult Literacy Study found, in 1992, that almost 40 million adults had extremely low literacy and math skills. The way to increase productivity, and contain inflation, is to give workers a chance to improve skills, enter vocational training or community college, and then succeed at high-skilled jobs.

HEADLINE: When Bad Economic Theory Threatens Good Times

BYLINE: By Robert Eisner; Robert Eisner, professor emeritus at Northwestern University, is the author of the forthcoming "The Great Deficit Scares: the Federal Budget, Trade and Social Security."

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
Just when we thought Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, had settled into a wise laissez-faire approach to our surging economy, he warned this week that we may soon be tasting some foul medicine.
Why? Because we are doing too well. Unemployment has been at or below 5 percent for six months and below 6 percent for three full years. And the growth in our gross domestic product has been running at 3 percent for the last four years, instead of the roughly 2 percent that many thought was the best we could do. 
 The conventional wisdom has long been that such figures could not be achieved without accelerating inflation. Yet inflation and even prices themselves have been falling, and Mr. Greenspan seemed to have abandoned this conventional view.
Until this week, that is, when he unexpectedly declared that wages may rise unless the recent two-million-plus annual rate of job creation is cut to the million a year that would be consistent with population growth.
When we're shrinking unemployment, why stop now? We even have a legislated target, in the old Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, of 4 percent unemployment. In fact, Mr. Greenspan is required to testify regularly before Congress about policies to meet that target.
Might 4 percent unemployment bring some increase in wages? It might, after years of decline in real wages. When few people are unemployed, employers have to bid higher to find workers.
But with profits at record highs, productivity rising, the dollar strong and international competition brisk, companies have little reason to increase prices, even if they give employees modest wage increases. And there is certainly no excuse for the peremptory strike of raising interest rates to slow the economy, a move that -- thanks to Mr. Greenspan's remarks -- Wall Street now fears when the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meets Nov. 12.
More fundamentally, there is no reason to hold employment growth to the long-term rate of population growth, as Mr. Greenspan suggested. There are millions of black Americans and Hispanic Americans, as well as women, youths and elderly people of all races and ethnic groups, who would take jobs if they could get them.
In some cases putting these people to work would require more and better education and training, but in all cases it would require a brisk, growing economy. This employment growth will not occur if Mr. Greenspan follows through on his implicit threat to hold the economy down.
The underlying culprit in all this, openly espoused within the Federal Reserve Board, is the dogma that there is an unemployment rate below which inflation goes crazy (a "non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment," or Nairu, in the economist's jargon). Until recently the idea that there is such a magic number was widely accepted by liberal and conservative economists alike, liberals putting it at 6 percent and conservatives at 6.5 or 7 percent.
Whatever the figure -- and recent work has indicated increasing doubt as to just what it is, if it exists at all -- unemployment below these rates would do more than simply generate higher inflation, the believers say. It would give us continuously accelerating inflation -- that is, inflation that would get higher and higher: 2 percent, 5 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent and so on. Who would dare risk letting this genie out of the bottle?
I have been pointing out for years that the theory simply does not hold up to evidence, and other economists have increasingly been agreeing. Really high unemployment, as might be expected, has reduced inflation. In the Depression, inflation turned negative. And in the recession of 1982-83, with unemployment approaching 11 percent, inflation slowed markedly.
But the critical fact is that unemployment and inflation are not linked so tightly. Relatively low unemployment for whatever reason -- increasing productivity may be one -- has simply not been associated with either higher or rising inflation.
So Mr. Greenspan should resist the Nairu dogma. And he certainly shouldn't follow his counterparts in the German Bundesbank, who have just announced an increase in an interest rate even though unemployment there is more than 11 percent.
Mr. Greenspan should aim for maximum employment, maximum growth and real wages that befit our mighty economy. He shouldn't even threaten to shoot at inflation until he sees the whites of its eyes.

HEADLINE: Word & Image; Why So Foreign?

BYLINE: By Max Frankel

 BODY:
Here is the world around Us, as Brokaw, Jennings, Rather and less mobile anchors have portrayed it for Americans in the autumn of 1997:
 England: A fairy-tale kingdom whose streets are strewn with flowers and whose venerable cathedrals reverberate with the croonings of Elton John. The brave English people have once again earned our gratitude, this time for wresting the image of a beautiful princess from the clutches of the degenerate Royals and electing a handsome new Prime Minister, who taught the Queen to curtsy to the crowds.
 With only dozens of camera crews at their disposal in London and just hundreds of hours on the air, America's newscasters obviously lacked the resources and the time needed to explain the function of royalty in England or examine the new Prime Minister's other policies and politics. They also had no time for the Irish troubles, the Scottish and Welsh disaffections and the Tories' torments about belonging to Europe. 
 France: A sunny Mediterranean playground for the rich governed by grim Parisian bureaucrats who seem unable to enforce the speed limits and seat-belt regulations in their capital's dangerous streets and tunnels.
 With all their Paris cameras trained on a single auto accident, the newscasters obviously lacked the means and the time needed to inquire into other Franco-British affairs or the storms kicked up by the Franco-German campaign to create a new Euro currency. 
 (Germany, like Russia, Italy and other relics of various hot and cold wars, seems to offer nothing of interest in these tepid times. There are, presumably, plans to mention the Germans again at the millennium, in pictorial reviews of the 20th century.) 
 Latin America: A dark, unexplored landmass situated south of the Caribbean, one of whose playgrounds for the middle classes has been smothered by the ashes of an unrelenting volcano. Also bordering the Caribbean is Mexico, a country awaiting a United States ambassador while it sends us drugs and immigrants in exchange for job-creating factories.
 The telegenic eruptions of Montserrat's mountain and North Carolina's Senator Jesse Helms were so absorbing that no anchor dared to interrupt to explain why the public should give a hoot about former Gov. William Weld's next job or the United States' next embassy chief in Mexico City. No newscast ever mentioned James Jones, our most recent ambassador there, or, come to think of it, the deeds of any ambassador anywhere. 
 China: An Asian sweatshop that manufactures highly attractive and desirable sportswear and launders contributions to America's politicians. The Chinese gifts, bundling the nouveau riches of Hong Kong with old wealth from Taiwan, were traded for photographs that certify the donors as most-favored visitors at the White House coffee bar.
 Television coverage of the Senate's pursuit of the Beijing connection left no time for covering Beijing itself, where Government leaders revealed a daring plan to privatize 300,000 state enterprises, to flush out their inefficiencies and rid them of tens of millions of surplus workers. The party congress at which this mother of all Initial Public Offerings was announced must have been mistaken at the networks for a Communist gathering or a dismal economics seminar best left to C-Span. 
 India: The burial site of the future Saint Teresa, who ministered here to the world's greatest concentration of poor and was worshiped in the United States for greeting a tardy princess in the Bronx. Also known as the world's largest democracy, India boasts a Government that can count 350 million ballots faster than New York City's can count 200,000.
 The cameras and casts covering Mother Teresa's funeral were deployed far from anyone who could explain why Calcutta needed so much saintly charity or how hundreds of millions of other once-poor Indians came to eat so well in off-camera locations. Strangers in Asia, the American television teams understandably flew clear past unremarkable places like Indonesia. 
 To be sure, and fair, last month's network newscasts did include a few reports about land mines in Africa and Bosnia that were more than illustrations of the humanitarian impulses of the Princess of Wales. But the pathetic films of the injured that she inspired dominated the tube and made short shrift of President Clinton's case for refusing to give up his mines immediately. In any event, the broadcasters' interest in military affairs soon drifted from underground weapons to a series of aerial mishaps, which produced new scenes of distraught mourners. 
 No network bothered, of course, to let its coverage of military mines and planes blossom into meaningful scrutiny of the still-growing arsenal of American weaponry or the foreign perils it is designed to defeat. Although every television anchor is deemed qualified to cover a funeral, television news seems unwilling to afford the expertise needed to tackle the instruments of death and their procurement or the deadly competitions of foreign nations. 
 It is perfectly true, as our most famous anchors argue in their programs' defense, that when they feature the Princess of Wales or Mother Teresa, the crowds will come, whereas coverage of Presidents Jiang, Yeltsin, Chirac and even Arafat chase their viewers to ''Seinfeld'' reruns. But even the best sitcoms need to be expensively plotted, cultivated and promoted before they find a sustainable audience. To dismiss the affairs of the world as either too boring or complicated for most Americans is to insult not only the audience but also the talents so regularly on display in most television commercials. 
 Surely an industry that dares each night to explore some new pharmacological achievement can learn to discover news of interest in alien cultures. Surely a medium that can find drama in a speech by Queen Elizabeth can find excitement in the Great Hall proclamations of Jiang Zemin. The people who make bankable international stars of Brokaw, Jennings and Rather should know how to get us to watch anything.

India
 From Midnight to the Millennium.
 By Shashi Tharoor.
 362 pp. New York:
 Arcade Publishing. $25.95. 
 At the core of the debate stirred by India's 50th anniversary of independence is a paradox: How is it that this vast country, accounting for a sixth of humanity, has done so much less than many other developing nations to relieve the poverty, illiteracy and disease that afflict so large a portion of its population, when its celebrated system of parliamentary democracy places political power in the hands of the people?
In a decade that has seen a striking expansion of democracy in Eastern Europe, as well as in previously unpromising regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America, something like a consensus has emerged, at least in the Western world, about democracy being the surest foundation for prosperity. But if democracy is the way forward, there is a need to understand why India, endowed with a political system that makes its rulers accountable, has not better served the needs of its people.
A 1993 survey cited by Shashi Tharoor, the Indian-born author of "India: From Midnight to the Millennium," an affectionate but unsparing chronicle of India's woes, found that 58 percent of the respondents in the country's leading cities thought their problems could best be tackled by dictatorship. Anybody with experience of India will recognize a sentiment commonly voiced in certain quarters of India's elite, whose faith in democracy seems, paradoxically, less firm than among the poor, who have so little to show for their votes.
Tharoor recounts in his introduction how he endured his own crisis of confidence as he left India for postgraduate study in the United States in 1976, the year after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared an emergency, suspended civil liberties and arrested thousands of opponents. For 21 months, until she called a general election and lost it, it was a dark hour for India's democracy, and for Tharoor, who wrote an article at the time condemning the political apathy -- he warned his readers about "Indians who are not involved in India" -- which he believed had made the dictatorship possible.
After graduating from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Boston, Tharoor himself chose not to return to what he calls "my beloved and impossible homeland," except for vacations and a journey in 1996 in his capacity as an official of the United Nations in New York, where he is the executive assistant to the Secretary General. In the book, he acknowledges that this has caused some people to accuse him of the lack of commitment for which he excoriated other Indians 20 years ago. "I am, indeed, often asked," he says, "how I can reconcile my passionate faith in India with my internationalist work for the United Nations."
With a touch of self-righteousness, he tells us that there is "no contradiction" since, he says, India shares so much with the United Nations, both being places that bring together "human beings of different ethnicities and religions, customs and costumes, cuisines and colors, languages and accents." True as this is, it would not be the first explanation of most of the Indians of Tharoor's generation -- a million now living in the United States alone -- who left India mainly to pursue living standards that became virtually impossible to achieve in the stagnant, socialized economy at home.
Still, Tharoor uses his book, the third he has written during his United Nations career, to show an encyclopedic command of what has gone wrong with Indian democracy over the past half-century. Few books in recent years, if any, offer such a comprehensive overview of what ails India, its politicians and its people; and few writers, apart from Nirad Chaudhury and V. S. Naipaul, benefit so obviously from the perspective Tharoor offers, that of an Indian with a profound empathy for his native culture, combined with the insight made possible by following India's progress from afar.
Even though he has kept in touch with matters at home, supplementing his visits by exhaustive reading, especially of Indian, American and British newspapers, his book is deprived of the firsthand authenticity that infuses home-grown writings. This, in fact, is its main weakness, an absence of the scene and color and feel that make India, with all its problems, such a compelling place. Lacking that, Mr. Tharoor's writing too often assumes the tone of an academic treatise.
The Olympian style can be jarring. As he showed in a previous work, "The Great Indian Novel," Tharoor is a fluid and powerful writer, one of the best in a generation of Indian authors (including Vikram Seth and Arundhati Roy, among others) who have seized the attention of the literary world. But too often Tharoor gets carried away with his evident mastery of his topic, to the point that he can appear less intent on illuminating India's problems than on demonstrating his formidable intellectual prowess.
Readers are led through a parade of references to the intellectual and pop-culture icons of the age, from Octavio Paz to Steven Spielberg, from George Steiner to Patrick Swayze. In the realm of language, too, Tharoor sometimes appears to be reaching for effect. When he writes of Indians having a collective dream about the Nehrus and the Gandhis, the political dynasty that ruled for more than 40 of the 50 years since 1947, shouldering much of the responsibility for the country's failures, he tells us that Indians have a habit of lapsing into "oneirodynia."
I, for one, was stumped. A Concise Oxford Dictionary did not help, since the word does not appear in its pages. Tharoor's point, that Indians have a habit of slipping into a state of willful forgetfulness about the failures of their most famous political leaders, is an important one, casting light on the continuing obsession many Indians have with Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born matriarch of the surviving Gandhis -- but the reader might have been better served if Tharoor had said so in plainer English.
Still, against the sweep of all that Tharoor can tell us about India, these are quibbles. Unlike many Indians, who approached the 50th anniversary in a mood of despondency, Tharoor emerges as an optimist, setting out economic and political prescriptions whose adoption, he believes, can help India to "make the 21st century her own." Given the vast distance the country has to make up between itself and the most advanced nations of the earth, and even between it and some of its own near neighbors, and given the evidence Tharoor himself cites, this has to be taken as a triumph of hope over experience.
But at least Tharoor has not given up on democracy, despite the chronicles he offers of a political overclass mired in "venality, bigotry, dishonesty, incompetence and just plain criminality." Like many others, he sees evidence of real change in the turn during the 1990's toward a market-based economic system, with the effect that has had of stripping powers away from corrupt politicians and bureaucrats; and in the shift in power away from New Delhi to the Indian states, characterized by the emergence of the current Government of Prime Minister I. K. Gujral, which is not much more than a coalition of regional power blocs.
Beyond this, Tharoor sees the need for sweeping constitutional change, the abandonment of the current parliamentary system in favor of something more like the American and French systems, with an elected president directly accountable to the voters. But it is a solution that seems highly unlikely to be adopted by the current generation of politicians, who, as Tharoor has amply shown, have expended much of their effort in recent decades bankrupting the democratic system deeded to them by the generation of leaders who won the country's freedom.

HOUSING PARTNERSHIPS
 A New Approach to a Market at a Crossroads.
 By Andrew Caplin, Sewin Chan,
 Charles Freeman and Joseph Tracy.
 265 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
 The MIT Press. $35. 
 America is, as everyone knows, a nation of homeowners. Nearly 66 percent of all householders own their own homes; as sociologists will tell you, homeowners make better citizens than renters, being more engaged in their communities. But home prices are rising faster than most incomes. And as they do, proposals emerge to help people find a way to buy houses who could not afford them under the present system. One approach gaining ground seems as improbable as the 30-year mortgage must have seemed in its early days.
The 30-year mortgage came into being in the Depression, when house prices were falling and banks refused to renew the five-year loans that were the traditional means of paying for a house. Today, the crisis is affordability, not credit. Fewer people under the age of 40 own homes than in the 1970's and 80's. Mortgages are easy enough to get, but paying them off consumes ever-increasing portions of family income.
So why not devise a system in which the homeowner is still the master of his domain but pays only 50 or 60 percent of a house's price? A limited partner, presumably a professional investor, shows up at the closing and pays the rest. That cuts the homeowner's cost in half -- to only $50,000 or $60,000 for a $100,000 home. Naturally, the mortgage is scaled back proportionately. Young families could save enough to afford homes sooner, and they would commit less of their monthly incomes to mortgage payments.
The limited partner gets his payoff when the house is eventually sold, presumably at a much higher price. And if the investor does not want to wait for the family to sell, or thinks home prices might go down instead of up, he can always sell his limited partnership on a newly created exchange, as if it were a share of stock. That new marketplace would probably need Government sponsorship, just as 30-year mortgages came into existence only after the Federal Government told banks that for qualified applicants it guaranteed repayment of the mortgages.
Housing partnership is not a new concept. As a perk, for example, some universities put up part of the money and retain partial ownership of a home purchased by a newly recruited professor. A few organizations construct single-family houses and then retain part ownership so the purchase price and carrying charge can be lowered for a family that otherwise could not afford a home.
Now, in a book titled "Housing Partnerships," three economists and an investment banker offer a detailed description and analysis of how a national system, open to everyone, might work in this country. The authors -- Andrew Caplin and Sewin Chan, economists at New York and Rutgers Universities, respectively; Charles Freeman, a vice president of Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation; and Joseph Tracy, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York -- are clearly evangelists. And even they point out that housing partnerships, however logical, might not work in practice, or even get into the discussion stage. "One of our deepest causes for concern," they write, is lack of a "political climate conducive to rational discussion of reform."
Nevertheless, this book has great value as an eye-opener, since it explains why home ownership in America is at another of those historic moments requiring innovative change. Whatever the political hurdles, the new direction appears to be toward some system of home ownership for people who do not pay the full price of the home.
Affordability is the catalyst in this process. Citing a great variety of statistics and studies, the authors note that the gap between home prices and incomes is growing at an accelerating rate. Young families buy homes at a later age than their parents because saving for a down payment takes longer. And, the authors say, as current trends continue, "a significant portion" of Americans may never have the means to own a house.
Mortgages are so front-loaded with interest payments that the slightest downturn in home prices leaves a family owing more than the house is worth. A $5,000 down payment on a $100,000 house means annual carrying charges of about $12,000 a year, including taxes and insurance. That is a considerable bite for the 60 percent of American households with incomes of less than $50,000 a year. Right now, the net worth of most couples consists mostly of their homes, leaving them short of money for retirement.
Reverse mortgages, in which banks send out monthly payments and are repaid with interest when the house is finally sold, have failed so far to catch on as a solution, either with the banks or the elderly. Housing partnerships might also meet resistance, particularly if the Federal Government failed to help in the creation and support of a market for trading the partnerships. And in some communities, these authors say, the Government might have to subsidize limited partners, who otherwise would be reluctant to invest. The payoff for the Government would be that the promotion of home ownership would resuscitate these communities, preventing their deterioration.
As for homeowners, the authors lay out a dozen reasons that they should welcome limited partners, not only for their investment but for their expertise. The limited partners could be particularly valuable in dealing with real estate agents, home inspectors and mortgage appraisers, who protect the interests of sellers rather than buyers under the present system. "The need to face the financially powerful and well-informed limited partner's scrutiny might greatly discipline" these agents, the authors argue in a frightening description of the home buying process that portrays the buying family as hopelessly vulnerable.
That chapter is easy reading. The rest of the book is not. It is pitched at the public but written as if it were a research paper. The charts are often hard to decipher, and the sentences too frequently slip into language, and algebraic symbols, familiar only to experts.
Skip these paragraphs, skip whole pages, but keep reading. Enough is understandable to make you come away converted, if not to housing partnerships, then to the realization that home ownership, to survive as a democratic institution, must somehow be recast.

IT is shopping season for high-school student travel overseas for next summer. These days, it is also shopping time for children as young as sixth grade. Catalogues and applications arrive and are perused. Notices appear on school bulletin boards. Meetings are held. Families call other families about their experiences.
Parents have good reason to be concerned with good references. Unlike a summer camp, which you can visit, organizations that sponsor student travel may be just an amorphous 800 number. Adults may be unsure whom they are dealing with, even if a familiar teacher has signed on as a tour leader. Frequently, as families learn, a teacher is signing up after hearing from a colleague about a good experience a year, or even years, before. 
 But a company that got good reports on its trips may be taken over. So some trade organizations, including the new Student and Youth Travel Association of Sacramento, Calif., require applicants to show stable ownership over three years.
A rare resource for parents of high school students is the Advisory List published by the Council on Standards for International Educational Travel, an independent nonprofit organization set up at the behest of the State Department in the 1980's. The 13th edition of this booklet, just published, lists 64 organizations, both nonprofit and profit-making, that sought endorsement. All paid $1,100 to $13,000, depending on size, for evaluation. The council has rejected applicants, or given a provisional listing pending changes.
Seven listings were new this year. The majority of the groups sponsor foreign students on visits to the United States, some sponsor students' trips overseas and some do both.
Some exchange organizations are big, for example, A.F.S.-U.S.A., formerly the American Field Service, in New York, which operates in 62 countries and has been sponsoring exchanges since 1947. It sponsored almost 4,000 students in the last year. Other groups are tiny, for example, the Association for Teen-Age Diplomats in Rochester, which sponsored about 40 students traveling to and from Rochester last year. Some small groups use a listing in the book as an economical way to tell parents what they do, while demonstrating that they are accredited.
But the book also prints the standards by which programs are judged; this chapter can help parents appraise programs that may never have sought the organization's approval. The most crucial question is who has direct, hands-on control: Who will be responsible for the well-being of the children. Frequently, a sponsoring group uses a commercial operator to conduct the actual trips, and this is vital information. Parents need to be tough in questioning people who will take charge of their children on a trip that will inevitably involve the unexpected.
The advisory list is available by mail from the council, 212 South Henry Street, Alexandria, Va. 22314, for $15, which includes postage, plus 4.5 percent sales tax for Virginia residents. Phone inquiries, but not orders, may be made to (703) 739-9035.
 
The A.F.S. Program
In its 50 years, A.F.S. has placed more than 200,000 students and teachers with families in 80 countries. Sarah Morse, who worked for the organization for 15 years, said the organization and its vast volunteer network engender the sort of lifelong loyalty that colleges can. "When people see one of our A.F.S. T-shirts in an airport," Ms. Morse said, "they are willing to speak to utter strangers."
The organization runs semester, academic-year and summer programs. In the summer, there are basic home-stay programs, where young people 15 to 18 are placed with a family and, in the words of Janet Stark, a spokeswoman, "just hang out." Then there are four- to eight-week programs in which the visitors study the language, and six- to eight-week stays during which they also take an adventure trip -- camping, bicycling, rock-climbing.
The Americans do not travel in groups. Ms. Stark says the students are even discouraged from going with a friend, although sisters and brothers have gone together. The work in the host towns is carried on by community-based volunteers, although A.F.S. has a paid staff in New York.
Ms. Morse said her own experience as an exchange student in high school led her to work for the organization, which she still refers to as "we," although she is now an admissions officer for a school in Baltimore. "I stayed with a family in Belgium," she said. "They had a gas station. My parents thought I would be visiting the Louvre, but I was pumping gas. You learn a lot."
She said the growing-up on A.F.S. trips surpasses that on usual student tours because students get past the "everything is wonderful and new" stage and learn how to manage when things are difficult simply because it's not home. She said tests had shown that A.F.S. students became less materialistic and developed skills at thinking critically.
Last summer, 600 students participated in the summer programs in 20 of the organization's 62 host countries. The cost for the coming summer will be $3,000 to $3,900, including international transportation.
A.F.S.-U.S.A. has a Web site at www.afs.org/usa. Catalogues can be obtained from the organization at 198 Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016; (212) 299-9000.
 
A Group Program
In contrast, the People to People Student Ambassador Program of Spokane, Wash., sends its students out in groups of about 30. They may be all from the same area, or if the numbers require it, from a couple of areas: say, students from Philadelphia and Boston. It has the largest number of outbound students in the Advisory List: it sent 11,000 students overseas last summer.
Over its history, starting in 1963, it has sent out 80,000 students. Doug Neil, head of the student program and director of marketing for both the adult and student ambassador programs, said that in the early years, the organization sent out only a few hundred yearly. Things began to boom 15 years ago.
The Student Ambassador Program has programs for children as young as sixth grade. Mr. Neil says that these programs involve more physical activity that those for older students: A trip to Sherwood Forest instead of a museum, for example.
One important aspect is a request to teachers and alumni to recommend students for inclusion, although this is not required. Recommended students get letters saying they have been nominated, with a quote from President Clinton about the student ambassador program. Mr. Clinton, like eight Presidents before him, is honorary chairman of People to People International, a nonprofit affiliate of all the People to People Ambassador programs, which touch many adult professions, teaching and the law, for example.
One parent who wanted to remain anonymous to protect her 13-year-old son's privacy, described his invigorating 21-day trip to Britain this summer. She said the "nomination" letter, which arrived unexpectedly, made a crucial difference. Her son, normally not a participator, was tremendously excited and the mother said she stifled her concerns. They attended regional meetings with their student team and leader, a youth worker in his late-30's from a local church who impressed the parents with his knowledge and travel experience.
The trip, in July, was a fabulous rite of passage for the youth, his mother said, although she wished there had been more home-stay opportunities. Generally, there are a few nights on the trip when the students stay with families with children, and may even attend school with them. Mr. Neil said the program changed destinations to avoid wearing out the Americans' welcome.
On the basis of a three- or four-page summary of the trip, which is sent to Eastern Washington University in Cheney, Wash., high school students can get credit for the trip.
The prices include air travel from the East or West Coast, housing in hotels or universities, plus brief home stays, three meals a day, bus travel from place to place, teacher leaders on the basis of 1 to every 10 students, local guides, health insurance and educational material. The total depends on destination and age, and ranges from $4,140 for a high school student going to Australia for 20 days to $2,990 for a sixth-grader going to Hawaii for 14 days. Cancellation insurance is extra.
The student program is a for-profit subdivision of Ambassadors International, a company headed by Peter and John A. Ueberroth that made a public stock offering in July 1995 and is now traded on Nasdaq. Most of the members of the new student travel trade association are also profit-seeking companies, and Mr. Neil said that he expected his organization would soon join.
A vice president of the new association, Earl M. Grossman, said that when it came to evaluating companies, an annual report to stockholders was good information, just as a nonprofit company's 501(c)3 data were. He said the ones he worried about were the companies that reported to no one and submitted no applications to trade associations.

HEADLINE: ART;
Capturing the Flow of Life In War and in the Depression

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
AN exhibition at the Yale Center for British Art, "Humphrey Spender's Humanist Landscapes: Photo-Documents 1932-1942," charts the inexorable daily grind that can wear people down. Elsewhere in the New Haven museum the three large canvases that encompass the 19th-century painter John Martin's "Vision of the Biblical Flood" show humanity's dramatic trial by water.
The years encompassed by Spender's exhibition are, of course, years of economic depression and war. The photographer doesn't even attempt to glamorize these facts of existence. His photographs are so unrelievedly black and white that they seem almost sooty. But Spender's concern isn't the obvious plight of people. He searches out patches of sunlight. 
 His own emotional attitude toward his material doesn't really matter, the current demand that the British show their feelings notwithstanding. He aimed for objectivity, and in that regard he worked most of the time as a photojournalist.
Beginning in 1937 he joined Mass-Observation, a largely volunteer project whose aim was achieving an "anthropological study of our own situation." The immediate impetus was the national crisis of confidence caused by the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936. M-O, as the project was called, was intended to help the British public regain its bearings through a presentation of facts gathered by watching people in all their activities. As time went on, the organizers of M-O inevitably came to disagree on what constituted facts.
The towns of Bolton and Blackpool, near London, were the site of most of Mr. Spender's Mass-Observation pictures. Some of them are of the smoky panorama of factory chimneys relieved by an occasional church steeple, but Spender evidently would rather mingle with the populace and catch the flow of life. Not much got past him. He recorded everyone, at home or at play, or doing chores. He documented people going to work, and unwinding after work, but he let others document the factory work itself. Sometimes he resorted to being a sort of spy, as with the diverse line-up of people at the bar in "Lambeth Walk, Feather's Pub"; one disdainful patron catches him taking the picture, but in another pub photograph a drinker waves at the camera.
Humphrey Spender is the younger brother of the poet and prose writer Stephen Spender, and was part of a group that included W. H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood. In their writing they were attempting to widen the circle and include broader social concerns in their stories or poems of personal drama.
While the other three men became major creative artists, Humphrey Spender applied the group's broad outlook to his pioneering of the documentary movement in Britain. But a strong fine art component often appears in Spender's work. It is an exhilarating sensation when a picture rises above gritty realism and become surreal. "Wash on the Lines, Bolton" is such a picture; billowing clothes, especially the plump pillowcases, become stylized clouds. Other photographs contain discrete words or phrases, parts of signs, that are at odds with the bleak scene.
The exhibition, organized by the independent curator Deborah Frizzell, includes much supplementary material, including paintings from the period, many by other members of Mass-Observation, that betray the same social awareness. One painting by Spender, of the foundations of a building, is surreal in its feeling of limitless monotony.
His wartime photographs are rather few in this show, but they naturally have a wider scope. In these heroic pictures, too, Spender favors the off moment, such as sailors acting boisterously in a pub and airmen between raids catnapping in armchairs.
The British Art Center will be closed throughout 1998 for repairs to its roof. It's tempting to think this action may be a reaction to John Martin's "Vision of the Biblical Flood" played out in three paintings exhibited together for the first time in this show organized by the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. That museum owns the becalmed third painting in the series, "The Assuagement of the Waters," while the portentous opener, "The Eve of the Deluge" belongs to Queen Elizabeth II. "The Deluge" itself, the middle work, is Yale's.
It was a 19th-century custom to present works of extraordinary size and with large themes like theatrical events and charge admission to view them.
The British Art Center reprises this in a teasing way: the paintings are in a room fronted by a red velvet curtain, and a dollar is charged -- but for the exhibition brochure. Viewing is free. A spectator will notice that there is no animal-filled ark; Martin concentrates on the unfortunates.
But his real subject was an acknowledgment of then-evolving discoveries in paleontology and geology and their possible agreement with the biblical story. Martin played the romantic artist to the hilt, yet he had rational underpinnings.
The wine-dark "Deluge," was painted first in 1834. The central drama is turbulence in the sky and on the land that is rapidly becoming sea. Humanity is subordinate to this, at least visually. If Martin was the de Mille of his day, as is often said, he favored the long shot. It is also said that he couldn't draw people, and most of the time he is content to sketch them in. One tantalizing incident in "The Deluge" is a snake and human body intertwined, reminiscent of Hieronymus Bosch. The stranded crowd are reminiscent of the survivors in Delacroix's "Raft of the Medusa."
The flanking paintings were done in 1840, and show the influence of Turner, particularly in their roseate skies. In "The Assuaging of the Waters" the viewer's eye rides easily on the creamy expanse of blue and white waves. Martin's abstract side -- catch the jagged lightening bolt in "The Deluge" -- might be his strongest.
"Humphrey Spender's Photo-Documents" continues through Nov. 9 while John Martin's "Vision of the Biblical Flood" ends Nov. 30.

HEADLINE: Benefit Events Gained Huge Sums

BYLINE: By RICK MURPHY 

 BODY:
THE dust from the benefit circuit in the Hamptons has finally cleared, and the results are in: the wildest, most successful season ever, proving again that the word nonprofit can be a misnomer.
"It was wild," said Ed Knight, an owner of Water Mill Party Rental, which handled a slew of affairs. "Everybody and their brother had their hands out." 
 "I call it 'The Checkbook Hamptons,' " said Joan Jedell, a photojournalist. "If you're not invited to one, you feel like you're not part of the 'in'crowd." For the guests, it may be a chance to schmooze and be seen, but for the organizations that are hosts to them, the benefits are a vital cog in their financial wheels. John Haigney, a vice president for the Long Island Association for AIDS Care, said fund-raising provided 25 percent of his organization's budget.
The success of the association's annual summer event, "Take Off," held at the East Hampton Town Airport, has stunned even the most jaded partygoers. More than 2,000 people paid up to $200 a ticket to dine in an airplane hanger and dance under a 14,000-square-foot tent to the sounds of the disco queen Gloria Gaynor.
"It's an enormous amount of work," Mr. Haigney said. "The thing that enabled us was the volunteer staff -- we had 150 people working. And the town was extremely cooperative." Though the association's party drew the largest crowd, Southampton Hospital may have won the award for the most funds raised -- $1.5 million.
The evening of dinner and dancing was called the Summer Party because "it's the party of the summer," said Mary Lynch, a coordinator of the event. "But it started back in January," after Lynette and Howard Gittis agreed to be co-chairs of the party, Ms. Lynch said. Ms. Gittis has wide-ranging charitable interests, and her husband, a Revlon Group executive, has wide-ranging social and business contacts.
"They had a party in New York, then in April Mr. Gittis had friends in West Palm Beach host another," Ms. Lynch said. With the contacts made at those events added to the list of regulars from previous years, "we knew we were going to sell out," Ms. Lynch said. As it turned out, 1,425 people paid $250 each to have cocktails under one huge tent and dinner under another, record numbers for the 37th running of the benefit. Ads in the Journal, which was underwritten by the Gittises, also swelled the proceeds.
"People have been very loyal to the hospital," Ms. Lynch said. Having Jean Remmel Little on the board of directors also helped. Ms. Little is well known as a highly successful fund-raiser for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital and had been a mainstay of the Southampton Hospital efforts for a dozen years.
Scores of events were held last summer, and there will undoubtedly be even more next year. The Animal Rescue Fund, Guild Hall in East Hampton, assorted village improvement societies, the "All for the Sea" concert at Southampton College, opening benefits at the Elaine Bensonart gallery and dozens more all drank from the seemingly bottomless well.
The Water Mill "think tank" created by Robert Wilson had Lou Reed performing at a fund-raiser; Jerry Della Femina and his wife Judy Licht were hosts for a party for the East Hampton Day Care Center with a performance by dancers from "Forever Tango," a Broadway musical, in which Tito Puente and his band played. The Della Feminas were also hosts for an AIDS benefit for God's Love We Deliver, a food-delivery service in New York City, an event begun by the late James Revson. And the ringmaster from the Barnum and Bailey circus served as a master of ceremonies for a luncheon at Kay LeRoy's Amagansett house for the Pediatric Dental Fund, perhaps the most apropos appearance of them all.
When a group of Westhampton Beach residents formed at the beginning of the year to discuss creating a performing arts center there, they also found a community more than willing to aid them financially.
"Fund-raising is based on personal connections and tapping into certain circuits," said Len Conway, a vice president of the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center. "We got together and began phoning friends, and they started phoning their friends." The goal was to purchase an abandoned movie house and convert it into a venue for live events.
By spring, 80 people had agreed to become benefactors at a cost of $500 each. By May, 125 had signed on. By the beginning of the summer, there were 300. "It's important, and people are getting involved because they realize the only way it will happen is if they make it happen," Mr. Conway said.
Mr. Conway believes that second-home owners, many of whom are wealthy, are spending more and more time at their vacation homes, and thus are more aware of what is going on in their communities. Like others involved in fund-raising, he feels the robust economy plays a part. "We're having positive financial times and that often translates into greater generosity," he said.
Ms. Jedell travels the benefit circuit in search of celebrities to photograph. Familiar faces abound, some over and over. The actors Ben Gazzara, Roy Scheider and Billy Baldwin were regulars, she said, as was China Phillips and Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross. "People like her; she's very sociable," Ms. Jedell said. Donald Trump also made several appearances in the Hamptons, and Ronald Perelman, who once shunned such affairs, was seen quite a bit as well.
Linda Shapiro is a licensed fund-raiser and a special events coordinator. Needless to say, she had a busy summer. She said the trick to a successful fund-raiser was an integrated guest list. "It's not like eenie, meanie, mieny, mo," Ms. Shapiro said. "You try to find synergy between the sponsor, the event and the celebrities."
Ms. Shapiro has witnessed the scene take off over the years. "On any given Saturday night there were 10 benefits," she said. "We've grown out of yard sales. The elegant cocktail party is a bygone era. The smaller organizations must be sharp and trendy to stay competitive --- you have to do theatrical events."
Mr. Knight started out providing silverware, china, napkins and so on. "We don't even do tents now; we farm the whole thing out," he said. People want weird, and if it's weird we have it, everything from Clydesdale horses to fairytale type carriages." He recently did a wedding where the mother of the bride -- an actress -- had him erect huge see-through plastic sheets so guests could see the ocean without having to deal with the wind.
"I don't want to tell you what we charged her," he said. "We have a whole slew of trucks now. We go in at midnight and put the whole thing up and tear it down two days later." Among his clients: the Hamptons International Film Festival and the Bay Street Theater.
A whole closet industry has emerged -- waiters and busboys, bartenders, caterers, manual laborers, parking lot attendants and, of course, as Ms. Jedell said, "check writers."
While some annual events, like the Parrish Art Museum's "Midsummer Gala," reported record crowds, others, like the Rogers Memorial Library (both are in Southampton) opted to forgo a benefit this year.
"We concentrated on the passage of the bond vote," said Lyn Ashe, the director, referring to financing for a new library building that had become a controversial matter, failing to get the voters' nod on its initial go around. It passed this time, d, and Ms. Ashe said the library's gala was likely to return next summer. "We have a fun enterprise, and our basic price, $150 a ticket, isn't so high that local people can't come, but we also appeal to people in the social circle," she said.
The Parrish Museum charged anywhere from $250 to $600 a ticket, and also brought in a "significant" amount of silver benefactors, at $5,000 a person, and golden benefactors, at $10,000. "It was delightful," said Anke Jackson, an aide at the museum. "It was wildly successful. People care about our institution, they understand it's important, and they have fun." Next year, the museum's centennial, promises to bring "something special" to the benefit table, Ms. Jackson said.
The annual Back to the Ranch rock concert in Montauk did not materialize this year. The event, which has drawn as many as 10,000 people, was tabled after the Nature Conservancy, its chief benefactor, pulled out as sponsor. Though organizers vow to return next year, Conservancy members said privately that there was uneasiness over the discrepancy between the amount brought in and the amount dispensed to it and other nonprofit organizations.
There is a misconception that money raised at nonprofit events all goes to charity. Many organizations pay generous salaries to its administrators and hire professional fund-raisers who get a percentage of the money collected. Some event organizers said that caterers had made fortunes providing food to such events. Their donation, if any, may be 10 percent off their normal fees, they said.
Despite the success of "Take Off," Mr. Haigney said the event might not be repeated. Instead, the Long Island Association for AIDS Care is planning a 100-mile bicycle ride from Manhattan to Southampton next year. "It's important to change," Mr. Haigney said. "We want to go out on a high note. People get tired and want something new."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/West Chelsea;
Ex-Garages Attracting Art Galleries From SoHo

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE gritty industrial neighborhood of West Chelsea between 10th and 11th Avenues and from 20th to 26th Streets is sporting a new look these days. New owners are taking unused former garages and warehouses and converting them into art galleries in hopes of luring buyers from more established gallery locations.
Many of the galleries are moving northwest from their previous locations in SoHo. They are following a predictable economic cycle: artists needing space and light take over old industrial buildings whose days as manufacturing facilities are over. Galleries, which also need space and light, follow, changing the tone of the neighborhood to artsy from industrial. 
 With affluent art collectors walking the streets, restaurants start to open, attracting more people who may not collect art but like trying new restaurants. Then the mom-and-pop stores start to disappear and are replaced by brand-name retailers, who often combine several old store spaces into a one bigger store.
Competition among retailers for street level space drives rents up beyond the ability, or inclination, of gallery owners to pay. The galleries then have to decide if the location is so good that they can survive on the upper floors of a building or whether it is time to move.
So far, 39 galleries have set up shop in West Chelsea, mostly between 20th and 24th Streets. As many as 50 are expected within the next year or so.
Barbara Gladstone is a gallery owner who decided to move. She shifted her operation from Greene Street in SoHo to 515 West 24th Street. "My lease was coming to an end in SoHo and it did not make sense to stay there for another 10 years," she said.
She said the same problems that had driven her from 57th Street a decade ago had developed in SoHo. "I left 57th Street because it was too crowded and it was difficult finding places for trucks to park," she said. "It's the same way in SoHo now."
The new home of the Barbara Gladstone Gallery is in a converted garage building with garage-style doors in front, which makes it easy to move big works of art in and out. (It is also next to a working garage, Adolph's Trucking, which Ms. Gladstone said was convenient for having her car repaired.) Ms. Gladstone bought the building with Metro Pictures and Matthew Marks, each of which has 50 feet of street-level frontage in the 150-foot-wide building. The galleries opened late last year.
One of the attractions of the old garage buildings, which once serviced the trucks that made deliveries to and from a largely vanished garment manufacturing industry, is the wide expanses of column-free space.The first floor of the Gladstone Gallery is mostly open space, well lit by natural night coming through the glass-paneled doors. There is also an interior space for viewing video art.
On the second floor are offices, the gallery's library, a screening room for special clients and kitchen facilities.
"These are solid industrial buildings with integrity in their space, so we did not have to do much," Ms. Gladstone said. "We kept the facades intact and just sealed the floors."
JUST down the block is another old garage building that is about to be converted into space for the Luhring Augustine and Andrea Rosen Galleries. If the starkly finished Gladstone Gallery illustrates what can be done with garage buildings, the structure at 525-531 West 24th Street shows what the owners have to start with.
The concrete floors there are still stained and a loading dock dominates the back of the building. The skylights still have wire mesh glass that reflects the building's 1930's roots.
Nevertheless, Roland Augustine, a partner in Luhring Augustine, pronounced himself delighted with the structure, whose steel truss roof makes it possible for the interior space to be completely free of columns. As with the Gladstone building, the two galleries will split the frontage, and the loading dock will be removed so a mezzanine level can be built in the back.
In Mr. Augustine's side of the building, the mezzanine level will house offices, a conference room and a video display room, all divided by a wall from the main gallery. "We have learned that you need space that is separate from the main exhibition space," he said.
The old roll-up doors will be replaced by pivoting doors that will flip up as canopies over the sidewalk. Mr. Augustine said plans were to move the galleries into the building next April and to open in May.
Mr. Augustine said he was pleased to have street-level exposure, unlike his second-story location in SoHo, and to be away from what he considers to be the overcommercialization of that area. "There is so much bad, schlock art on the market there," he said of SoHo.
Indeed, brokers said that many of the gallery owners were tired of swarms of what are derisively referred to as "bridge and tunnel people" crowding the streets of SoHo during weekends. "The tourists go into the galleries, laugh at the art and don't buy anything," said Ruth Barone, a senior vice president with The Carlton Group Ltd. who has represented several gallery owners who have moved to West Chelsea. "They are, in effect, providing free entertainment, which real collectors don't need."
Ms. Barone said most galleries moving to West Chelsea were buying their buildings because the single-story garages were far more affordable than the multistory, cast-iron structures common in SoHo. Nevertheless, she said, prices were shooting up because of the increased interest in the area. "Single-story buildings are selling for $150 to $200 a square foot, depending on the condition of the building and the location," she said. Two years ago, before it became obvious that a critical mass of galleries was going to move to the neighborhood, sales prices ranged from $50 to $70 a square foot, she said. In SoHo, the buildings are usually so large that gallery owners generally cannot afford to buy them, brokers say.
In spite of rising prices in West Chelsea, Ms. Barone said, gallery owners continue to put together partnerships to buy buildings, rather than rent space. "The rental market has not caught up with the investment market," she said. "There has been very little leasing activity."
THE zoning of the area, which was formerly an adjunct of the garment district, has also been helpful, Ms. Barone said. Garment manufacturers were permitted to have showrooms in their buildings and art galleries qualify as showrooms.
The herd instinct appears to be at work as well among gallery owners, brokers said. "When Matthew Marks and Paula Cooper and Bonin Alexander moved in, they set off a land rush in the area," said Jed Garfield, who is with Leslie J. Garfield & Company. "A lot of people in SoHo saw these guys moving and decided they had to follow."
Most gallery owners agree that being in a location with many of their peers does boost traffic. But some say the neighborhood has advantages beyond the availability of ground-floor space at reasonable prices. "This is a nice walking area," said John Cheim, a partner in the Cheim & Read gallery on West 23d Street. "The streets are wide and you can see the sky instead of being buried in a canyon."
Jonathan P. Switzer, a senior managing director with the Winoker Realty Company, also attributed the outflow of galleries from SoHo to Chelsea to the fact that SoHo had become increasingly crowded and expensive. Mr. Switzer handles leasing for 568/578 Broadway, at the northeast corner of Broadway and Prince Street in SoHo.
"Prices are up 25 percent in the past two years," he said. "What had been a $14-to-$15-a-square-foot neighborhood has become a $19-to-$23 neighborhood."
He said that galleries selling mainstream art were generally still able to hold onto their ground-floor locations in SoHo but that others selling less widely accepted contemporary art were being squeezed out.
Mr. Switzer said Soho had the advantage of being near several major subway lines while West Chelsea was not well served by public transportation. But some of the relocated gallery owners in West Chelsea see this as a benefit, rather than a problem."Being away from the subways means the area is not conducive to retail," Ms. Gladstone said. "That way, the neighborhood will keep its character."

For Tinton Falls, a Vast Continuing-Care Complex

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
CONSTRUCTION of one of the state's largest retirement communities is to begin later this month in Tinton Falls. It will eventually turn 134 acres into a complex of 1,786 residences that will offer people 62 and older meals, services and health care at each stage of aging.
The first phase of the project, known as Seabrook Village, involves 92 residences and a 60,000-square-foot community center. They will be joined over the next four to six years by 1,694 more residences and two other community centers, which collectively will include six dining rooms and a medical center. There will also be a 240-bed nursing home and amenities, ranging from a health club to computer and crafts rooms to continuing-education classes and shops. 
 Seabrook Village will have 1,650 independent-living apartments, where residents capable of living on their own will get such services as housekeeping, transportation, social activities and one meal a day. There will also be 136 assisted-living units for residents who need help with daily living. They will receive all the services plus three meals a day. For those who need more medical attention there is the nursing home.
As is typical of many continuing-care retirement communities residents at Seabrook Village will pay an entrance fee that will entitle them to access to a1l levels, as well as a monthly service fee.
The fees are being targeted to middle-income residents "which is a solid and definitely underserved market," said Daniel Rexford, vice president of marketing at Senior Campus Living, in Baltimore, the developer. Financing for the $300-million project is coming from the company and its financial partner, a division of LenLease, an international developer based in Sidney, Australia.
Two years after the initial wave of independent-living units is built construction will start on the health-care component, either the assisted-living apartments or the nursing home, said Mr. Rexford, adding that since marketing began in April deposits had been taken on 85 percent of the first 92 units.
Elda and Benjamin Pinz, who have two grown daughters, reserved one of the initial units. The couple -- she is 72, he is 80 -- say they are ready to surrender the maintenance and chores tied to their single-family home in Marlboro. "We want to be independent," said Mrs. Pinz. "This is a way to leave our care to someone else rather than our children."
The Pinzes are among the growing number of older people who are seeking an alternative to nursing homes that offers care as they age, but avoids the regimentation of a medical setting. Stoking the trend are demographics and the desire by the aging to stay close to their families and friends.
With nearly 1.1 million of its 8 million residents age 65 and older, New Jersey has the ninth-largest aging population in the nation. The fastest growing segment of that population is people 75 years of age or older.
Those demographics attracted Senior Campus Living, which hopes to open up to five communities in New Jersey as part of its 10-year expansion program. The company is negotiating to build a second continuing-care development, a 1,400-unit project in Pequannock, in Morris County.
Seabrook Village is getting under way at a time when a spate of varying kinds of specialized housing for the elderly is also advancing in the state. The big surge is in assisted-living complexes, a relatively recent alternative to nursing homes. Beyond such services as dining and housekeeping, these complexes have staff on hand to help with daily needs like dressing and bathing and taking medications.
Since 1994, when the state started licensing assisted-living communities, 36 have been built and licensed and 234 more are in various stages of the approval or application process, according to state figures.
UNLIKE continuing-care retirement communities -- there are 21 in the state and two more are planned -- assisted-living projects do not offer three levels of care or guarantee access to each. But an entrance fee is not required.
Some communities that offer all levels of care, such as the Windrows at Princeton Forrestal in Plainsboro, also do not require entrance fees. Windrows is structured as rentals and a condominium "so residents have control of their assets while maintaining a continuum of care," said Michael Zaccaro, executive vice president at Care Matrix of Needham, Mass., the developer.
The project, which will have a medical as well as a community center, is rising on 45 acres in Princeton Forrestal Center, the mixed-use complex developed by Princeton University. It contains 180 nursing beds and 83 assisted-living units, with monthly rents, including all meals and services, of $2,350 to $4,000. There will also be 294 independent-living residences priced at $174,900 to $444,900. Monthly fees of $1,135 to $2,268 will cover all services and 30 meals a month.
Because of the rising number of options the growth of continuing-care retirement communities, which surged during the 1980's, has leveled off, said Barbara Kleger, president of Senior Living Associates, a Philadelphia-based marketing firm. "But the ones being developed tend to be well-planned and cater to certain niche markets," she said.
At Seabrook Village, the entry fee will be 100 percent refundable upon death or departure after the unit is reoccupied. The fees, which will range from $107,000 to $312,000, will be used to pay off construction costs and, later, to finance improvements.
There will also be a monthly fee of $1,167 to $1,172 for the studio to 2-bedroom independent units, which will have 625 to 1,414 square feet of space. For a second person there is an added $554 fee. For the 550-square-foot assisted-living units the fee wi1l be $2,200. The monthly fees will cover everything but advanced medical care, which residents will pay for as they need it, Mr. Rexford said. Those entering the nursing home will pay a "competitive" daily rate, he added, noting that it was too early to give exact figures.
"It is very reasonable for what the community is providing," Mr. Pinz said of the monthly fee, which he said was slightly more than what he and his wife pay per month to maintain their home. "But I will not have to worry about the washer or some other appliance breaking down."
Having so large a project allows the company to achieve certain economies of scale. But the size was a tough sell in Franklin Lakes and Wayne, where the company advanced earlier development plans that were derailed by local concerns.
But the Monmouth County community of Tinton Falls welcomes Seabrook Village, which will rise on Essex Road, a mile east of a point between Exits 100A and 102 the Garden State Parkway. "It is a self-contained community that will have little impact on municipal services, especially schools," said Anthony J. Muscillo, the township's Business Administrator.
From 1985 to 1995 the population of Tinton Falls rose to 15,000 from 8,000, prompting the expansion of three elementary schools. But the township did not see corresponding commercial growth, Mr. Muscillo said, adding that "this project will go a long way to keep real estate taxes stable."
Mr. Rexford said his company had bought the site, which was rezoned from office use, because of its size and highway access. Moreover, he said, a market study showed that 22,258 people age 75 or older live within a 10-mile radius of the site.
The independent-living units will be in 12 residential buildings laid out in 3 neighborhoods, each with 4 buildings around a community center. The assisted-living units will be in a separate structure, as will the nursing home. All the buildings as well as the community centers will be linked by enclosed walkways. Initial occupancy is scheduled for next fall.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Jersey City;
Now as Then, a Place for New Beginnings

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
FOR nearly two centuries, Jersey City, a short boat ride from Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, has served as a first American home for hundreds of thousands of immigrants. More than a fourth of its residents are foreign born, with large numbers from the Arab world, the Philippines, South America and the Dominican Republic.
But Thomas Gallagher, director of the city's Department of Housing, Economic Development and Commerce, notes that there has also been an influx of urban professionals. 
 "They take the PATH train from Exchange Place, near the waterfront, and are at the World Trade Center in Manhattan in two minutes," he explained.
Among those new residents are John and Kathleen Robinson and their 14-month-old son, John Jr. Two years ago the couple moved from a 3-bedroom, $2,100-a-month rental in Brooklyn Heights to a similar-sized apartment here renting for $1,300.
"That savings allowed Kathy to stay at home with our son," said Mr. Robinson, a lawyer who works in lower Manhattan.
A year later the Robinsons paid $208,000 for a renovated four-story brownstone in the upscale Hamilton Park area. But the Robinsons plan to leave the city before their son reaches school age, reflecting a concern over the troubled 32,000-student school system.
The system was taken over by the New Jersey Department of Education in 1989 following disclosures of widespread political nepotism in the appointment of teachers and supervisors. At the time, the city's elementary school pupils had placed 29th in the state's 8th-grade Early Warning Test for New Jersey's Special Needs Districts, 28 impoverished urban school districts designated by the State Supreme Court as having special needs. Those needs must be financed by the state.
"We have made progress, but still have a long way to go," said Dr. Richard A. DiPatri, the state-appointed District Superintendent of Schools for all of Jersey City. "We are now 14th among the Special Needs Districts. Our attendance rate has risen from 87 percent in 1989 to 91.4 percent last year."
Mayor Bret Schundler says conditions in other areas have also been improving throughout the city over the last four years. The unemployment rate has fallen by 3 percentage points to 11 percent, he said, and the number of jobs has climbed from 50,000 to 63,000, mostly in financial services and retail. And the city has bought a 26-block stretch of Martin Luther King Drive, the main thoroughfare cutting through some of the city's poorest neighborhoods, and leveled more than 100 boarded-up buildings.
IN their place, a new business and residential district called the Hub is to be built, with construction to start next month on a 50,000-square-foot supermarket and a post office. The cost of the whole project, expected to be completed by 2001, is estimated at $60 million in Federal, state and local funds.
Jersey City is a state-designated Urban Enterprise Zone, which means that shoppers pay half the normal 6 percent state sales tax. The tax revenue is returned to the city for the improvement of its business districts. Last year alone, the city received $18 million in sales-tax revenue, part of which is being used to redo sidewalks, street lighting and facades.
"Every major commercial area in town is now being renovated or is slated for major infrastructure improvement," said Nicolas C. Fargo, the Mayor's chief of staff.
Jersey City has long been a gateway to Manhattan. In 1804, Robert Fulton built his shipyard at Green and Morgan Streets and later established a 14-minute steamboat ferry service to Manhattan. In 1836, the Morris Canal was extended to Jersey City, bringing coal from Pennsylvania to fuel a growing industrial base. By the turn of the century, Jersey City was a booming industrial city of 206,000, with four railroad terminals -- the Erie, the Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Valley and the Jersey Central -- and a fresh crop of immigrants who had fled revolution in Germany and the Irish Potato Famine. In 1927, the Holland Tunnel was opened, giving the city a vehicle link to Manhattan.
Among the modern-day immigrants here is Adnan Kwara, a native of Syria who owns a small Middle Eastern restaurant and pastry shop in a century-old building on Grove Street with an original tin ceiling.
"My customers are as diverse as this city," said Mr. Kwara. "There are Arabs, Jews, Indians, Hispanics and other Americans." His wife, Amal J. Awad, a lifelong resident, likens Jersey City to a university.
"A walk down the street opens your mind," she explained. "I love it."
Minds are also opened at two public colleges -- Jersey City State College and the Hudson County Community College -- and the coed Jesuit St. Peter's College.
The 1990 census found that Jersey City had 90,723 housing units, most built before 1940 and fewer than a third owner-occupied. The most expensive area is Port Liberte, a 363-unit gated condominium complex on a finger of land that juts into Upper Newark Bay.
Laura Skolar, manager/broker at Century 21 Plaza Realty, said a 4-bedroom, 3-bath luxury town house there with a private boat slip recently sold for $425,000. One-bedroom units can be had for $110,000.
Close to Port Liberte is the 1.8-million-square-foot Harborside Financial Center on the site of a former rail terminal and Newport, a huge mixed-use complex that includes two office towers, a mall and five residential buildings with a total of 1,500 rental units and 445 condominiums. When completed, the riverfront complex with its views of Downtown Manhattan will include 9,000 residential units.
SOME of the better residential areas surround Hamilton and Van Vorst Parks and the Paulus Hook Historic District, where the first permanent white settler, Michael Paulusen, a Dutch trader, built his home in 1633 and started trading with the Communipaw Indians. One-family brick or brownstone rowhouses range in price from $125,000 to $170,000, according to Ms. Skolar.
A couple of blocks from the parks, housing prices decline sharply, with some single-family homes selling for as little as $75,000. Two-family houses in the three prime areas start at about $140,000. One recently sold for $264,000. Three- and 4-family houses start at $170,000 and range up to $300,000.
Ms. Skolar said most of the rentals are in small multifamily dwellings. One-bedroom apartments in prime areas command monthly rents of about $925, with some 2-bedrooms going for as much as $1,200. In other parts of the city, rents can be as low as $300 for a 2-bedroom apartment.
One- and two-family frame dwellings that practically touch each other in the Jersey City Heights, Journal Square and West Bergen sections are considered the middle of the market. Single-family dwellings in those areas range from $70,000 to $110,000, with two-families going for about $40,000 more.
In poorer areas, such as the Greenville and Bergen/Lafayette Section, abutting the 1,122-acre Liberty State Park, many new immigrant families are buying their first homes for as little as $40,000 for a one-family and $65,000 for a two-family.
Condominium apartments in small, converted rental buildings are bargains, Ms. Skolar said, noting that she had recently sold a 2-bedroom, 1-bath condominium apartment in Jersey City Heights for $40,000. She said the owner had paid $124,000 in 1987 when housing prices peaked.
Jersey City has a host of fine restaurants, including Casadante (Italian) on Newark Avenue in Journal Square, Laico's (Italian) on Pavonia Avenue, Komegashi (Japanese) on Montgomery Street and the Iron Monkey on Green Street, which serves a mixture of Continental and Asian food from a rooftop terrace overlooking Manhattan.
AS for the educational system, Superintendent DiPatri said 10 of the 30 elementary schools were outstanding and 9 perform dismally, despite the fact that spending per pupil is comparable to that of much wealthier districts.
As an example of an excellent school, Dr. DiPatri cites School 27, in which 100 percent of last year's eighth graders passed their Early Warning Tests in reading, writing and math. But School 27 has 28 students per classroom -- 6 above the state average -- and more than 70 percent of the students come from low-income households.
"I've made the principal of School 27 my executive assistant and started a no-holds-barred campaign to bring all of our schools up to her standards," Dr. DiPatri declared. "We will withhold salary increments from teachers and principals who don't improve the academic performance of their students. The parents of every at-risk student are being told that there will be no promotions for students who do not attend special summer programs."
The district's five high schools offer 16 advanced placement courses. The highest-rated secondary is the Ronald McNair Academic High School, which accepts the top 100 graduates from the city's elementary schools each year. Its dropout rate is zero and all but two of last year's 98 graduates went on to four-year colleges. On the SAT tests McNair's students had combined verbal and math scores of 1,104, which is 100 points above the state average.
A more typical Jersey City high school is the William L. Dickinson High School, which had a 14.3 percent dropout rate and average combined SAT scores of just 791.
The largest county-owned park here is the 273-acre Lincoln Park, with a multitude of playing fields and 21 tennis courts. The most widely used city-owned park is the eight-square-block Pershing Field off Central Avenue. It contains an ice skating/roller hockey rink, an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a jogging trail, four tennis courts, two basketball courts, two baseball fields and a refurbished playground.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Hiring A Cleaning Service

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
MANY people who have read the notes tacked on the local supermarket bulletin board have considered hiring a cleaning person or cleaning service to help with household chores.
Unlike plumbers, electricians, exterminators and reputable home-improvement contractors, however, local house cleaners and cleaning services are generally not licensed and rarely belong to a trade association that can refer consumers to qualified practitioners and businesses. 
 As a result, hiring someone to help around the house is usually a hit-or-miss proposition. The best method, of course, is to ask someone you know to refer someone they know. Failing that, the options left are to consult the local Yellow Pages, keep an eye on the classified ads in the newspaper or read the notes tacked on the supermarket bulletin board.
"If you're looking in the Yellow Pages, the easiest thing to do is check the size of the ad," said Chris McLaughlin, vice president of McMaid Manhattan, a New York City cleaning service in business since 1971.
While such advice may sound simplistic and rather unreliable, Ms. McLaughlin said, it is at the very least an indication of how serious a company is about being in business.
"Those ads can get pretty expensive," she said, adding that a good advertisement will also contain information about services that are available and whether the company guarantees its work.
"You want to be sure you're dealing with a reputable business," Ms. McLaughlin said, adding that one way to determine that is to ask whether the company is insured and its employees are bonded. "It doesn't hurt to ask for a copy of their insurance certificate," she said, adding that for those who live in apartments, information about cleaning services working the building might be available from neighbors, front-desk personnel or the managing agent.
Another important piece of information to elicit from a cleaning service is the nature of its relationship with its employees.
"The first question you should ask is whether the company pays the employee and takes out taxes or whether it's your responsibility," said Martha Bourbeau, president of Custom Maid, another Manhattan cleaning service.
Some companies, Ms. Bourbeau said, are essentially employment agencies that provide independent contractors to customers. Generally, she said, the company is paid a fee for providing the cleaning person, but it is up to the customer to pay the worker. That, Ms. Bourbeau said, may be more trouble than it is worth for many people because of the tax issues involved.
"We think the customer is better off when the company pays the employees and takes care of things like taxes and Social Security payments," Ms. Bourbeau said. "I'm not saying there's anything wrong with companies that do it the other way, but who wants to be responsible for dealing with somebody else's taxes?"
When a new customer calls, most cleaning service companies will interview the customer over the telephone to determine what services are going to be required and how long it will take to perform them.
"I usually ask the size of the house or apartment, how many beds and baths, and whether there's laundry or ironing to be done on a regular basis," Ms. Bourbeau said, adding that the minimum charge for a one-time cleaning is $58.50. The charge is based on a three-hour minimum, she said, and should cover most studio and one-bedroom apartments.
Michael Podell, the owner of Maid to Order Cleaning and Maintenance in Jersey City, said that before he takes on a new customer, he prefers to see a house or apartment in person so he can give an accurate price quote. "I like to walk around the house with clients so I can show them what we'll be doing and what kind of work it will entail," Mr. Podell said.
"Usually, the initial cleaning is going to be a little more intense," he said, adding that he generally charges about $22 an hour for "standard" cleaning chores such as sweeping and washing floors, dusting tables, bookshelves, paintings, blinds and furniture, and cleaning kitchen appliances and bathroom fixtures. "And there's a difference between a cleaning and an organization," Mr. Podell said, explaining that customers can economize on cleaning service costs if the cleaning person does not have to spend time picking up clothes, stacking papers, reshelving books and moving objects from one place to another to clean under them.
Mr. Podell said that for most of his customers -- typically, homeowners in Hudson, Essex and Bergen Counties -- an average cleaning of an average house on a weekly contract takes about two hours because in most cases, employees are sent out in pairs.
One of the most significant concerns for those hiring a cleaning service is security. Indeed, that is why it is considered so important to hire a company that provides bonded employees.
Ms. McLaughlin of McMaid Manhattan explained that a bond is essentially an insurance policy that provides coverage for the illegal acts of an employee.
"If something is missing from your apartment, you want to know that somebody is going to be responsible for it," she said. In addition, Ms. McLaughlin said, customers should never be required to give a key for an apartment to a cleaning person or to the company itself.
On the other hand, she said, customers who do choose to provide keys should insure that the keys will be kept in a safe place at the company when not needed by the cleaning personnel. "When we hold keys to an apartment they're coded and secured in a safe," Ms. McLaughlin said, explaining that coding keys involves marking the key with assigned words or numbers and then keeping the customer's name and address in a separate secure location.
Ms. Bourbeau of Custom Maid said that customers in apartments who feel uncomfortable giving their keys to the cleaning service can usually leave the keys with the doorman or at the front desk when they are not going to be home. And some customers who have two or more locks on their door, she said, can give a key for just one lock to the cleaning service.
"You just have to make sure to leave the other locks unlocked on the day the cleaner is scheduled," she said.
Of course, not every cleaning service is willing to tackle everything.
Mr. Podell, for example, said that in most cases, he'll pass on doing laundry. "And ironing is a definite no-no," he added.
Ms. McLaughlin said that McMaid Manhattan bristles at doing windows. "We pride ourselves on doing esthetic cleaning," she said. "We like to do fine detail cleaning, like $45,000 tables and original Monets."
Ms. Bourbeau said her company would not only do laundry and ironing, but windows too. But there is a point where Custom Maid has had to draw the line. "One customer asked if we could wash his pet rabbit," Ms. Bourbeau said. "I had to tell him we don't do pets."

HEADLINE: Connecting Hartford and Its Neighbors

BYLINE: By STEPHEN L. PURDY 

 BODY:
CONTRACTORS have been chiseling out a new food court in the century-old Richardson Building on Main Street in downtown Hartford. Down the block, Fleet Bank and Aetna have renovated office space. Nearby, Main Street Market hums with vendors, farmers and entertainers, especially in milder weather.
Hartford -- having barely survived the 80's real estate collapse, a shift in store locations and the defection of a National Hockey League team -- is showing signs of repair. Still, many residents are cautious about the latest fixup's significance. 
 They remind themselves that Main Street Market stands on land where the Society for Savings bank demolished a landmark building in 1989, then scrapped their plans to put up a Cesar Pelli-designed skyscraper.
Many residents and businesses, arts and entertainment groups, government and regional councils want this revival to be the real thing.
For Connecticut's capitol city, traditionally ill-defined and caught in the shadow of New York City and of Boston, the key, they suggest, is that significant projects connect themselves to a region, with a core city at its center.
"When we talk about Hartford," says Joe Marfuggi, the executive director of Riverfront Recapture in Hartford, "we are talking about this region." Phil Dal Ponte, manager of Main Street Market, founded in 1992, and recently reorganized, said that as of late August the market was 85 percent rented and an incubator for small businesses. Its vendors sell food, clothing and flowers, and its farmers accept Federal nutrition coupons.
A West Indian food business called Apron Strings, which began in a stall and is still doing well, recently opened a restaurant nearby. Pat Evans, owner of Elma's Tropical Market, is encouraged. "Things are not as bad as they were a couple years ago."
And Leonid Natapov, a Russian immigrant who runs Market Flowers, says, "A lot of people want to come downtown, and it's because of the market." Meanwhile, farmers debate their success. Andy Caruso, of the Upper Forty Farm in Cromwell, says that, with Main Street Market as well as theaters and bars, Hartford is in an upturn with all its suburbs involved. He adds that among his customers are workers moving into Aetna's new office space across the street at State House Square.
Barbara Lerner, chairwoman of Business for Downtown Hartford and a board member of the newly-formed Main Street Market Corporation, says she feels the market serves city residents mostly, but the Deputy City Manager, Patricia M. Williams says the farmers make a connection between the region around the city and the city's residents. Since the market is at the hub of the regional transportation system, she said it would see increasing traffic.
This automatically places the market on one of the Capitol Region Council of Government's welfare reform initiatives: to carry city residents to jobs in the suburbs. Richard J. Porth, the council's executive director, says his council, which represents the 29-town capitol region, has been pro-Hartford and works on the whole region's concerns with the state legislature.
Mr. Dal Ponte says that the success of a mixture of customers is evident. At any time, he says, visitors will see city residents and suburbanites side by side.
With the summer's daily entertainment paid for by sponsors and running in about two or three sets every day on an outside stage, many customers would buy food from vendors and sit down in market chairs or benches.
Two city workers who said they visited the market three or four times a week, said they enjoyed lunch and the music there. On a wet day, a group of construction workers from State House Square were disappointed that the outdoor entertainment they enjoyed had been rained out.
Night life in the city is also far improved, Mr. Dal Ponte says, "So many people are down here."
More workers downtown are, in part, the result of Aetna's purchase last year of U. S. Healthcare. A spokesman for Aetna, Fred Laberge, said the company decided the first two floors of State House Square, which it had owned since its completion in the early 90's and whose mortgage it took back in 1996, was ideal for the overflow of employees from its Middletown office.
Mr. Laberge said that Aetna sees downtown Hartford as strong for employees' business and personal needs, for restaurant and banking services.
Consolidation of the retail portion from the first two floors to ground level was a related priority for Aetna; its grand reopening was Sept. 29. Now the shops are visible from the street, clustered together and more attractive to walk-in traffic.
George Kearnes, of the Natural Health Food Restaurant, agrees with the change and says it can only mean more customers. Sonia Baez, the manager at Nicky's News, says, "Actually, we've seen quite a few new faces." Aetna has moved in about 650 employees, with 100 more expected.
Philip Schonberger and Sam Fingold regard their renovation of the Richardson Building as another aspect of the block's renaissance. Mr. Schonberger says he sees an upturn in downtown Hartford's economy -- though not necessarily in construction -- and he thinks this project is still a worthwhile step. "Our goal was to be sure that one of the city's most spectacular buildings is preserved, in a useful state, for the long haul."
Mr. Schonberger is known for his caution. "He gives a unique perspective," says Steven D. Park, a member of the Hartford City Council and chairman of its planning, development and zoning committee. "Not only does he do business all around the United States, he now has invested in some major buildings here in Hartford."
Mr. Fingold says the Richardson Building reminds skeptics that such work can be done. "Hartford hasn't had a lot to be positive about in the last couple of years. You do these very small projects and hopefully it'll build momentum."
Indeed, the Hartford Stage's managing director, Stephen Albert, thinks downtown real estate may be turning a corner, though there is much work to be done. With a theater telemarketing operation already installed in the Richardson Building, he said the company was considering permanent rehearsal space in the building.
Mr. Albert thinks that arts are, indeed, one of the main reasons people are seeing Hartford more as regional. "What they're doing on a monthly basis is bringing hundreds of thousands of people to downtown. They're creating energy and economic development, including jobs."
Fleet Bank officials hope that repairs of a more practical nature at its 777 Main Street office, will also be appreciated. A Fleet spokesman, Jim Schepker, said the company has taken up sidewalk surfaces to stop water from seeping into the building, then put in newly-designed and landscaped sidewalks. Mr. Schepker, whose office overlooks Main Street Market, says he thinks big changes are happening in the neighborhood and city.
"This summer has been particularly exciting there," he says, pointing to the market. "The crowds are larger, the entertainment's more diverse, and there's just generally a feeling of Big City." He said he was encouraged by the food court and office space at State House Square. "That building is going to be very occupied," he said.
Regardless of Main Street's view of itself and its importance to the region, most involved in its development agree that the now-emerging Riverfront Park System, centered just east of downtown on the banks of the Connecticut River, is the strongest symbol of the city's revival, and most connected to regional initiatives.
The system, created by Riverfront Recapture (a nonprofit corporation supported by a public/private partnership), is a mixture of parks and riverwalks, cruises and rowing, adventure training and fishing, concerts and festivals. The park system's director, Mr. Marfuggi, sees the river, as a critical link rather than part of a barrier between Hartford and East Hartford and to surrounding towns as well.
"We're now bringing in at least one major national sporting event a year," he said. He cites the U.S. Rowing Association's 1997 national convention and a championship bass fishing tournament.
Barbara Lerner, of Business for Downtown Hartford, says she feels the leadership "clicked in" when Michael P. Peters was elected Mayor in 1993. Ms. Lerner says Mr. Peters made the critical connection with people. "We have a mayor now," she says, "who made it clear, during his first year in office, that he was interested in having a more regional view. He went out to Jaycees, Rotaries, morning talk groups in all the surrounding communities, saying, 'You all have to be a part of Hartford.' "
The Mayor's office agrees. Paul Shipman, Executive Assistant, says Mayor Peters's approach is to invite people to come and enjoy the city, while simultaneously educating governments to accept the concept of regional cooperation.
"You can have a concert on the green in your town," Mr. Shipman says, zeroing in on the Mayor's energy toward arts in the city. "But do you have 20 venues that you can pack together and people can actually walk to?" Urban and regional development requires a commitment to education as well. The Hartford Consortium for Higher Education's goal is to create a downtown collegiate center, anchored by Capital Community-Technical College and combining resources with at least 10 other institutions. A principal recommendation by a mayoral task force on higher education was to increase interaction among higher education and the business, health care and arts sectors of the region.
What the region needs, says P. Anthony Giorgio of the Capitol Region Growth Council, is an overall plan for development, especially in the area of building the economy.
The Growth Council, which is private and nonprofit, is supported by each of the 29 towns in the capitol region, large and small companies, and local chambers of commerce. The council has developed the MetroHartford Millenium Project, which sets out to develop a strategic direction for the capitol region. "We will have a universally accepted direction," says Mr. Giorgio.
The Growth Council's concern about an active plan is corroborated by Robb Hankins of the Greater Hartford Arts Council, creator of the arts arm of the Millennium Project. "To effect change," Mr. Hankins says, "we're going to stay focused on the five or six major initiatives that come out of Millennium."
At the very least, Hartford appears to be moving. James P. Denno, the owner of DJ's Deli at State House Square, echoes the universal hope: "We're looking forward to it happening, big time."

HEADLINE: In the Workplace, Power and Sex

BYLINE: By MELINDA TUHUS 

 BODY:
SEXUAL harassment is an old story to several women who gather every other week in the office of a psychologist, Dr. Barbara Moynihan, in Branford. They talk about incidents that have left them feeling abused, angry, and, in many cases, unemployed.
The women say they are victims of sexual harassment and they are suing companies where they have worked for 8 to 15 years. Though such harassment affects both men and women, overwhelmingly it is women who are subjected to unwanted comments about their bodies as well as to jokes, touching or advances sexual in nature. And the Yale study makes a point of the detrimental effects of even seemingly minor incidents. 
 Sexual harassment is an abuse of power that is expressed sexually. As defined by law, it must affect the complainant's pay, benefits, working conditions or work environment.Various polls and studies indicate that between 44 percent and 68 percent of women report being sexually harassed on the job; the latter figure came from interviews with 300 female employees at Yale University, in a study made public last month.
According to a 1991 study by the Connecticut Women's Education and Legal Fund, 21 percent of women complainants in Connecticut quit their jobs; 19 percent were fired or laid off, and 30 percent took sick leave. A 1992 study by the National Organization for Women found that 90 percent of the victims were unwilling to take action against their harassers for fear of retaliation and loss of privacy.
Those fears are well founded, the women in the support group say. That's because, unlike the progress made in court proceedings by rape survivors over the past few decades, victims of sexual harassment have no such protection in court. The private lives of rape victims, including past behaviors and mode of dress, can no longer be brought up by defense attorneys in an attempt to discredit the accuser.
The women in the support group say they have found that when they take an alleged harasser to court, their entire lives and the lives of their families become public. That, they say, is a powerful deterrent to filing charges.
Last year the Connecticut Women's Education and Legal Fund published a 44-page booklet called "Sexual Harassment in the Workplace." It includes statistics, myths about harassment, a description of the pertinent state and Federal laws, and how victims of harassment can get help.
The Connecticut Human Rights and Opportunities Act prohibits sex-based employment discrimination and the law applies to all employers with three or more workers. It requires companies with 50 or more employees to provide supervisory workers with training on the laws regarding sexual harassment and the remedies available to victims.
Federal civil rights laws also apply. Under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, victims may sue for back pay, compensatory and punitive damages, and may demand a jury trial.
Dr. Moynihan says she started the support group in 1993, "based on the calls I was getting about sexual harassment." She continued: "A woman continues on the job almost as a hostage, because she never knows when her harasser will make a move. The fear of harassment and the harassment itself affect her performance. It's relentless, it's coercive, so it begins to chip away at self-esteem, competence, the ability to eat and sleep.
"The frequency and the trauma associated with it is so significant that I thought it would help reduce the women's sense of isolation and create a safe place to share their stories, to share resources and be there for each other."
One member of the support group told how she'd worked as a senior product manager for a manufacturing company for seven years, getting bonuses and commendations for her efforts, when the harassment occurred. "In my case," she said, "a stupid conversation carried on by a vice president at a sales meeting was extremely embarrassing for me. A week later he started penalizing me. I was told by the harasser in my review that it was my fault, that I had made 10 men uncomfortable."
She said that when it became obvious that her boss wanted to get rid of her, she went to the president of the company and to a human resources manager and tried, for more than two years, to work things out before consulting a lawyer. Waiting that long was a big mistake, she says now. "Retaliation has been the worst part: creation of a hostile environment," she said. The woman also said she blamed the company more than the harasser: "You will always run into jerks," she said, "but they would have no power if the companies didn't back them."
In Connecticut, sexual harassment complaints are filed with the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities. Between 1990 and 1994, the percentage of sexual harassment complaints nearly doubled, to 10.4 percent of all employment complaints.
But the women in the support group are unanimous in saying that the commission is not an advocate for them. "It seems the C.H.R.O. is there to minimize the risk to the companies," said one woman. "We cannot file a lawsuit until we have gone through C.H.R.O. I filed a complaint and 18 months later they had done nothing.
"There are no advocates for us except for ourselves and our therapists," she continued. "The companies want us to disappear. Our families and friends want us to minimize our pain and walk away from this. Our lawyers want to get this over quickly and minimize their work, so they push for low settlements. If we publicize this we will never be hired by another company again."
If a woman sues for emotional distress, the company's lawyers can ask questions about her or her family's life that most people would regard as too personal. "The companies' defense against us is that we are sluts, nuts or golddiggers," says another member of the group. "The system helps them by allowing the companies to question every aspect of our personal lives -- our medical histories, our sex lives, our finances -- things which have no bearing on the crime committed against us. After being mentally, financially and physically abused on the job we are subjected to further abuse in depositions and on trial. The process goes on for years until we are drained."
One of the most frustrating aspects of filing a complaint, many of the women say, is that lawyers for the companies and company representatives deny any harassment took place. And in a company's defense, the women say, representatives repeat myths like women having no sense of humor or misinterpreting behavior meant as a harmless joke, or that women make false charges to get even or to get ahead.
It's taken five or six years for most of the cases in the women's support group to go to trial. In that time many have strained their emotional and financial resources to the breaking point. "I have been to foreclosure court three times since I was fired in 1993," says one woman. "I have been on welfare and food stamps. I have sold family heirlooms."
One woman who wants to go public said she hoped her story would be a cautionary tale for other women. Fatima Silva, of Monroe, sued her employer after she was fired for insubordination, as a result, she says, of blowing the whistle on fraudulent sales practices and then resisting her boss's sexual attentions. She says the harassment made her suicidal. "I went to Portugal with my daughter. I was going to explain to her to be careful. Then I was going to put her on a plane and I was going to commit suicide." She returned and filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission against her former boss and the company, New York Life Insurance Company, charging wrongful termination, retaliation and defamation. A lawyer in New Haven representing the insurance company, George O'Brien, says: "There was no retaliation against her, and the proceedings of the C.H.R.O. clearly established that. She has brought four Federal lawsuits in Connecticut. They are consolidated and are proceeding. She also has a state lawsuit against New York Life, which is pending in State Superior Court. In addition she has filed complaints with the State Insurance Commission, the State Labor Department and the C.H.R.O., and she has filed other lawsuits in New York. She is engaged in a broad vendetta against the company which has nothing to do with the facts of her case."
All the women in the support group are pursuing legal claims against their employers or former employers. Both state and Federal law require that complaints be filed within six months.
Dr. Moynihan, who works with survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence, says "the Yale study supports what we already knew -- that most women who work in institutions that have traditionally been male-dominated experience sexual harassment."

Cash Keys for Meters
Borrowing a page from New York City's book, White Plains now has a version of E-Z Pass, the electronic toll collection system, for parking meters. 
 Under the cash key system, which is being used by 13 other cities in the country, drivers will not have to use quarters to park in metered spaces when they shop or catch the train to Manhattan. The city, the first in the New York metropolitan region to introduce the system, expects to have some meters outfitted for cash keys this month and others by early next year.
"This is the future of money in the parking industry," said Albert T. Moroni, executive director of the White Plains Parking Authority. "There's no need to carry cash."
A cash key is a special debit key resembling a car key, and drivers will be able to prepay from $10 to $125 worth of meter time.
Mr. Moroni estimated that it would save the city's Parking Authority as much as $30,000 a year in reduced labor costs for handling coins and maintaining meters. Collectors now take in $4.6 million in coins -- about 120 tons -- a year. Of the city's 11,500 parking spaces, 8,000 are metered. Of those, 1,500 have new electronic parking meters, which will accept cash keys. The city will eventually replace all of its older mechanical meters with the electronic ones.
 
Health Center Cuts Ties
The Greenburgh Neighborhood Health Center has chosen to operate independently of the county, a move that its board of directors expects to lead to more and better services for its 12,000 patients. In addition, the health center has teamed up with the Mount Vernon Neighborhood Health Center to combine purchasing, billing and other services.
The Mount Vernon clinic, which separated from the county about 12 years ago, has since tripled the size of its staff and the yearly number of patient visits.
Robert Mauro, chairman of the Greenburgh clinic's board of directors, said a freestanding health center would be able to become part of a variety of managed-care plans. As a county agency, it was limited to two plans approved by the county's Department of Health.
"We can now accept all third-party payers for the first time and hope to attract new patients by offering competitive costs for basic services," Mr. Mauro said.
The clinic receives about $700,000 a year in Federal funds, about one-fourth of its $3 million annual budget. In addition, the county will continue its annual $1.2 million in aid to the clinic for another year.
The center has been providing primary and preventive health care for the working poor, the uninsured, Medicare and Medicaid recipients, the unemployed and the homeless since 1972.
 
More Minority Officers
Under pressure, Police Commissioner Donald P. Christopher of Yonkers has announced a drive to recruit more women and minorities.
Last month, when it hired 35 officers and only one was black and another Hispanic, the Yonkers Guardians Association, a 24-member group representing black police officers, objected, Detective Vincent Tilson, vice president of the organization, said.
And because some of the recruits were relatives of former and current police officers, several of those who were not accepted on the force complained of favoritism, a charge the department denied.
The Commissioner has appointed a recruitment team of seven minority and two non-minority officers, said Lieut. Lorenzo Paul, a department spokesman. Mr. Christopher has also appointed a minority civilian advisory board -- a rainbow coalition, Lieutenant Paul said -- to help the recruitment drive.
Both boards will encourage minority candidates to take a Dec. 6 Civil Service test. There are 566 officers in the police department, of whom 467 are white men.
 
New Trailway Center
The county has announced plans to open a recreation center at the site of an abandoned stone restaurant along the Saw Mill River Parkway in Arsdley next to Woodlands Lake and the old Putnam Railroad right of way. County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Planning Department and the Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation plan to use the stone structure -- which was built in the 1920's -- as a cafe and rental outlet for boats, bikes, in-line skates and fishing gear.
The $1.6 million project also includes a proposal to connect the center with the proposed South County Trailway, which will run along 5.6 miles of the right of way.
The site was formerly occupied by the Cantina and Roadhouse restaurants, which have closed. But as Mr. O'Rourke said, "Over the past several years there has been a growing concern about the viability of a restaurant on this site because of the difficult vehicular access from the Saw Mill River Parkway." He said an alternate route to the site would be developed along the trailway.
A paved terrace for family picnics will be built at the former restaurant site, and picnic tables will be installed. The plan also calls for a food concession. Woodlands Lake will be dredged for boating, fishing and nature studies, and there will be a nature and hiking trail around it.
 
Flu Vaccines
Flu vaccines are available at 43 clinics in the county through Nov. 12. With three strains of flu expected this year, the Health Department is recommending the vaccine for those who may be at high risk of complications from the flu, including residents older than 65, people with chronic diseases and employees of health care institutions.
The vaccine is aimed at combating the A/Johannesberg, A/Nanchang and B/Harbin strains of flu, the department said.
Dr. Ada Huang, the county's Deputy Commissioner for Disease Control, said the following people should consult their doctors before receiving the vaccine: those who are pregnant, are allergic to eggs, have a history of serious allergic reactions to the flu vaccine, have an acute febrile illness or have had attacks of Guillain-Barre Syndrome or of other neurological illnesses.
"Now is the best time to schedule your influenza immunizations, well before the flu arrives in Westchester," Dr. Huang said, explaining that the vaccine takes a few weeks to reach its full protective effect.
The flu season usually begins in late October and runs through April.
The shots are covered by Medicare; otherwise there is a $10 fee. Information on clinic dates and sites is available from the the county's Office of Citizen Services, 285-2170. ELSA BRENNER

HEADLINE: The View From: Norwich;
A New Beginning For an Old Port City

BYLINE: By STACEY STOWE 

 BODY:
THE specter of Norwich's 18th- and 19th-century past, when the city bustled with merchant ships bound for the West Indies and hummed with textile mills, dwells in the minds of people eyeing its future.
From Ron D. Aliano, who spent more than $12 million transforming the city's harbor from an abandoned coal distribution point into a marina and recreation area, to two elderly sisters who own Fagan's, a closet-sized newsstand on Main Street, the city reflects its glory days. 
 Perhaps it is because the architecture of the city has been largely untouched. Many of its streets are lined with once majestic Victorian buildings and stately private homes, the legacies of its prosperous native sons who centuries ago made their names and their fortunes from Norwich.
A few years ago, people in the city said there was a palpable sense the past was all Norwich had. After World War II, mill operators started moving South and prosperity began to slowly slip away.
By the 1960's and 1970's, the city had become a hub for the disenfranchised and impoverished; patients released from the Norwich State Hospital, a center for the mentally ill, often settled in the city. The hospital, which once served 3,000 people, closed in 1996.
But Norwich is now in the midst of an intense revitalization effort with its main focus aimed at increasing tourism. As part of a a $230,000 streetscape project, sidewalks are being bricked and old-fashioned street lamps installed. Antiques shops and restaurants are moving into the empty Victorian buildings downtown. Hotels and apartments are being built.
Two museums and a botanical garden are planned. A 44,000 square foot ice skating rink was built. A high-speed ferry service between New York City and Norwich may be operating soon.
Why the current burst of activity for a city that has been flagging for close to 50 years? City officials and residents agree it certainly has something to do with Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun, two casinos a few miles from downtown. Hundreds of thousands of people pass through Norwich on their way to gamble. But there is also a strong sense that the city could be more than just a stop on the way somewhere else.
The Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, which owns Foxwoods in Ledyard, is building the Sassacus, the ferry that will twice a day bring passengers from New York to Norwich in two and a half hours before they are bused to Foxwoods. Casino employees are trained in the Lightolier Building in the Norwich Industrial Park.
The tribe is also poised to spend $20 million downtown, building the Mercantile Exchange, a 150,000-square-foot commercial and retail building that will also contain apartments. A block-long stretch of buildings will be razed to make way for the project but the tribe plans to replace them with period-style architecture and perform an archeological dig at the site prior to excavation, said Bruce MacDonald, a spokesman for the tribe.
In the late 1980's, Mr. Aliano, who owns an ambulance company, decided to invest in the city's harbor, citing the site's potential and its history as a shipping center in the 19th-century. "I looked out the window and saw a wasteland," he said. "It was a travesty when you consider the history, what Norwich was."
Mr. Aliano has built boat slips, a banquet site, restaurant and miniature golf course that includes a 40-foot erupting volcano, and he said he was considering a hotel and footbridge from the marina to the city's downtown.
Norwich has recently finished a $1.2 million facelift of the exterior of the city hall, which dates to 1873. An interior renovation is now underway.
"It's a long process to redefine your image," said Margaret Malmborg, the city's director of tourism. She said the new projects and street improvements would create a sense of charm that should cause people to linger in the city.
The Konover Hotel Corporation is planning to restore the Wauregan Hotel, a 60,000 square- oot building that dates from the mid-1800's. Once an elegant, luxury structure, it served until five years ago as housing for people on welfare, until it was condemned by the city as a fire hazard, according to Colin P. Brogan, coordinator of economic development for Norwich. Faded murals advertising the Wauregan still adorn the brick sides of some buildings downtown. (The renovation is expected to create between 50 and 75 jobs.) Three other hotel projects have been built or are under consideration.
The prospect of more jobs from the development pleases Beverly Goulet, the director of social services for the city since 1984, but she says she is concerned about the ability of $6- and $8-an-hour service jobs to support families who once held jobs with the area's military contractors that paid between $18 to $22 an hour.
"Southeastern Connecticut was the most defense dependent part of the state," she said. "We're seeing enormous stresses on families who, when they do find employment, need to work two and three jobs just to keep their heads above water."
Ten years ago, 18,500 people worked in the Groton shipyard of Electric Boat, the submarine builder; today 8,500 are employed, said Neil Ruenzel, spokesman for the company.
The unemployment rate in Norwich hovers at about 6 percent, higher than the state average of 5.2. Some 5,000 Norwich families live at or below the poverty level, Ms. Goulet said.
Despite being ranked among the poorer cities in the state, Norwich students have scored at or above state averages on the Connecticut Mastery Tests for at least the past two years. Suzanne Murphy, curriculum director for Norwich Public Schools, said that about 44 percent of the 4,300 students in kindergarten through eighth grade receive free or reduced-price lunches.
"America's Living Time Capsule," is the working name for a 44,000-square-foot museum proposed for downtown. The $9 million building will trace the history of the world from the geological land formations to the present day using Norwich as its model, said Margaret S. Wilson, a local historian and one of 17 civic leaders developing the museum. A state grant for $2 million was secured to renovate the two historic buildings, which were donated by the city and are between Main and Water streets.
Ms. Wilson, who has encyclopedic knowledge of the city's history and enjoys ticking off the long list of its famous natives (from Samuel Huntington, first president of the Continental Congress to William Darrow, who isolated the AIDS virus) believes the city's revitalization will be as an arts and cultural center.
"I never thought it would come back as a shopping center," said Ms. Wilson, who was born and raised in Norwich and who, like the two women who own Fagan's newsstand, remembers when the streets downtown were so crowded that one had to step off the sidewalk to avoid the bustle. Bookstores, antiques shops, art galleries, restaurants, a movie theater and toy store are the businesses she believes will ultimately thrive downtown.
In capturing tourist trade, Norwich's advantage is its authenticity, according to Ms. Malmborg. Because much of the development over the years bypassed the city, Norwich retained much of its original architecture.
"Mystic and Sturbridge are wonderful re-creations of period villages but in Norwich we're not copying or re-creating something. You see it as it looked," Ms. Malmborg said. "It's not all shiny and clean but it's real. You see the dirt under the fingernails in a town like this."

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
A Leasing Pickup on the Brooklyn Waterfront

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
LARRY FOX, the owner of a small Brooklyn company that distributes paper products to party-supply stores, grew up in Flatbush but until recently had not been near the waterfront in Sunset Park in 10 years. He had been storing goods in Kearny, N.J., although he garaged his trucks on Neptune Avenue in Brooklyn, and he was looking for a place in which to consolidate operations.
"The last thing I remembered about the area was gangs," he said. "But I came on a Saturday and I was amazed at the amount of business coming in." 
 Now Fox Paper is part of the quiet, steady transformation that has brought broad occupancy gains to the industrial property on the three-mile stretch from 17th Street to 65th Street, between the Gowanus Expressway and Upper New York Bay, which has been designated the Sunset Park In-Place Industrial Park. The recession in the early 90's had put many smaller companies out of business or into bankruptcy.
There is an estimated 75 million square feet of space in the area's industrial buildings, much of it in major properties like Industry City at Bush Terminal, which Irving T. Bush developed as Bush Terminal between 1910 and 1922, and the Brooklyn Army Terminal, which the city now owns and operates.
But for a sense of how small or even start-up companies are using the area, there is no better place to turn than the property where Fox Paper took 35,000 square feet in December. The property is called Harborside -- a million square feet mainly in four large buildings on 90 acres between 42d and 50th Streets from First Avenue to the water.
Once the property was part of the Bush Terminal operation, but about 30 years ago the operating company at Bush Terminal turned over its uneconomic, dilapidated piers and their support facilities to the city, which has owned them ever since. For the last decade, Dominick Massa, a trucking company owner who is the former chairman of the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation, has operated the onshore property associated with the now-defunct pier operation through the Harborside Management Corporation on a long-term lease from the city.
Both Mr. Massa's parents worked for the Ann Page division of of A.&P. 45 years ago, which made private label products for the store chain and was a major tenant at Bush Terminal. Two of the products were chocolate and macaroni. "My father worked in starch," Mr. Massa said. "My mother was in chocolate."
Occupancy was "almost zero" in the city-owned buildings when he took them over, Mr. Massa said. It reached about 45 percent a little over two years ago and is now at 85 percent. Rents are about $3 to $3.50 a square foot a year.
The biggest factor in the recent upsurge was the elimination of the city's tax on commercial tenants, which was 6 percent of their annual rent, Mr. Massa said. The Giuliani administration eliminated the tax in 1995 for all parts of the city except most of Manhattan south of 96th Street. As of June 1, it was eliminated in Manhattan as well for tenants paying under $100,000 a year. For those paying more than $100,000 (after allowable adjustments), the tax is 4.5 percent.
"For a 50,000-square-foot tenant, it was a lot of money," Mr. Massa said. "Ninety percent of the tenants I spoke to used to wind up in Jersey because they refused to pay the tax."
Another improvement in the last few years has occurred in the private carting business, Mr. Massa said. "The carters used to come in here and tell me, 'Here's your charge,' " Mr. Massa said. "And the pickups were sloppy. Now there's competition. There are 15 carters, not one. I get bids. I negotiate prices. The streets are cleaner."
There are still vacancies, mainly on the upper floors of the large multistory buildings that account for 800,000 square feet of Mr. Massa's space. But Harborside was the locale chosen by Borough President Howard Golden in August after he decided to spend $300,000 of his budget allocation to create a "Brooklyn Garment Manufacturers Incubator."
A section of the fourth floor of a Harborside building at 43d Street and First Avenue, with 30,000 square feet of space, will be renovated into modern space for garment tenants starting next month. "It's not for startups and they don't have to be operating in Brooklyn," said Kenneth Adams, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, which is managing the program. The base rent will be less than $2.50 a square foot, Mr. Massa said, though tenants will pay additional amounts for special financial, technical and computer services.
At the Brooklyn Army Terminal property farther south, tenants are somewhat larger and pay more rent. But there, too, occupancy is up. In Building B, with two million square feet of space, it is at 90 percent, higher than at any time since the building opened in 1987, the city's Economic Development Corporation says. Asking rents are about $4.75 a square foot for upper floors.
THE first two floors of Building A, with 400,000 square feet of space, were rehabilitated in a subsequent construction phase and were ready for occupancy in 1994. They are fully leased. The rest of the million-square-foot building has yet to be renovated. "Many tenants left or went out of business in the early 90's," said Leo Greco, the leasing manager, echoing Mr. Massa. "From 1993 on, there has been a gradual increase in arrivals."
One recent arrival is American Documents Security, which Mr. Greco said took 27,300 square feet of space in Building A. The company collects and shreds corporate documents and trucks them to recycling stations. It employs 20 to 30 people, Mr. Greco said. Throughout the facility, about 3,000 jobs have been created in 2.1 million square feet of leased space, 1,200 of them in the last four years, according to Charles Millard, president of the Economic Development Corporation. The ratio of 1.4 jobs for every 1,000 square feet leased is a bit better than the rule-of-thumb standard of one job per 1,000 square feet in industrial real estate.
Then there is Industry City at Bush Terminal, the name for the four million square feet in 10 industrial buildings between 37th and 32d Streets just off the Gowanus Expressway. They were managed by Helmsley-Spear Inc. after Harry B. Helmsley and his partners bought them in 1964, but they were sold to an investment group called Industry City Associates in 1986.
There was 70 percent occupancy at the time, said Bruce B. Federman, director of real estate for the owning partnership, but after a rebound beginning in 1993 occupancy now stands at 98 percent. "We have garment manufacturers, import-export businesses, furniture manufacturers, many startups," Mr. Federman said. "We have relocatees from the West Side of Manhattan, from Queens, from New Jersey."
About 5,000 people work at Industry City, and some of the manufacturing businesses that operate there expanded this year. For example, the A.J.V. Prime Source Corporation, a cabinet manufacturer, expanded to 25,000 square feet from 10,000 and has increased its employment to 45 from 15, Mr. Federman said. At the same time, fewer businesses seem to be failing.
"In the late 80's and early 90's, we had 10 or 15 business failures, through bankruptcies, default or closure," Mr. Federman said. "That has been reversed."
One consequence is a rise in asking prices in the sales market. Mr. Federman estimated that about two million square feet of property could be enhanced with new ownership and management.
What the area does not have, and is unlikely to get, is the large manufacturers with thousands of employees who once traipsed to a busy waterfront with ship as well as truck traffic. The shift is principally to distribution or small businesses, or retailing, as in the arrival of a new Costco store near the 39th Street exit of the Gowanus Expressway.
But Mr. Massa noted that with garment manufacturing, he could have 300 or 400 people working in his incubator space. "I've got a silk screen printer with 35 or 40 people in 22,000 feet," he said. "I've got a guy who prices and packs towels with 25 people in 17,000 feet. We've got 700 people working here. Ten years ago, we had zero."

HEADLINE: For Family (Tax) Shelter, The Rules Have Changed

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
ACCORDING to estimates by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, there are approximately 65 million homeowners in the United States. For many, the purchase of a home was the most significant investment of a lifetime. For some, that investment has proved fruitful indeed: It is not uncommon for a house bought for $50,000 a quarter century ago to have grown -- through appreciation, a series of sales and purchases, or a combination of both -- into an asset worth several hundred thousand dollars. The equity in the family home often represents a major portion of the total estate to be passed from one generation to another.
For many, though, a home's value is measured not just in dollars and cents but in memories that span a lifetime. The decision to sell a home and move -- or to keep it and leave it to the children -- typically involves balancing emotional, economic and practical considerations. Such decisions can become more difficult later in life when the empty nest becomes a cherished gathering place for children and grandchildren scattered by time and individual fortunes. 
 Earlier this year, however, such decisions were made easier for some -- and more difficult for others -- with the passage of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The act produced significant changes in the way gain on the sale of a principal residence is taxed -- or not taxed -- for virtually every homeowner in America. Under the new law, which applies to sales after May 7, 1997, profits on the sale of a home are not subject to tax unless they are over $250,000 for an individual, or $500,000 for a couple who file joint tax returns; an interval of at least two years must take place between sales. Tax planners and real estate lawyers say the change was so significant it is likely to have a profound impact, not only on the purchase and sale of residential real estate, but on the role of such property in tax planning, estate planning, divorce and the distribution of marital assets.
"The impact of the new tax law is going to be nothing less than extraordinary," said Gary Schatsky, a Manhattan lawyer and financial consultant. "Average homeowners now have a tax loophole they can drive a truck through."
Tax planners and lawyers have long devised various strategies, primarily of use to the wealthy, to help their clients avoid -- or at least minimize -- the taxes imposed when assets are passed from one generation to another.
Typically, Mr. Schatsky said, only relatively large estates are subject to Federal estate taxes. Under current Federal Gift and Estate Tax law, individuals can pass to heirs or beneficiaries upon death a lifetime total of up to $600,000 in assets without the transfer being subject to Federal tax. With a little planning, Mr. Schatsky said, married couples can effectively transfer up to $1.2 million in assets free of Federal taxes. The new tax law is even more generous, Mr. Schatsky said, and provides gradually increasing exemptions over the next nine years. By 2006, he said, individuals and married couples will be able to transfer tax-free up to $1 million and $2 million in assets, respectively.
And though New York imposes an inheritance tax on property that passes at death to anyone but a surviving spouse, the amount of the estate exempt from taxation -- now $115,000 -- will be increased to $300,000 on Oct. 1, 1998, and increased again on Feb. 1, 2000, to match the Federal exemption, which will be $675,000 at that point. Connecticut is also phasing out inheritance taxes on transfers to children (there are none on transfers to spouses), which at present are imposed on amounts over $250,000, and will have no such taxes after Jan. 1, 2001. New Jersey imposes no inheritance taxes on transfers to a spouse or children.
Even though most homeowners have not had to worry about estate or inheritance taxes when deciding whether to sell their home or let it pass through their estate, other tax considerations often factored heavily in such decisions.
"The old tax law encouraged people to hold onto their house until they died," said James Chesterton Jr., a certified financial planner with Brighton Financial Planning in Clinton, N.J. The tax act of 1997, on the other hand, Mr. Chesterton said, should have the opposite effect.
Many homeowners, he explained, have accumulated significant equity in their homes over the years. Under prior tax law, he said, the payment of tax on that gain could be avoided if the profit from one house was rolled over into another principal residence of equal of greater value. When a taxpayer turned 55, the law provided for a one-time exemption of $125,000 -- resulting in tax liability on any gain that exceeded that amount.
In many cases, however, particularly in the metropolitan area, where property values have increased significantly in the last 20 or 30 years, an exemption of $125,000 would often leave hundreds of thousands of dollars in accumulated value subject to taxation. That resulted in even average taxpayers employing a rather basic estate-planning strategy to avoid paying taxes on the gain.
When a house passes through an estate, Mr. Chesterton explained, the heirs receive what is known as a "step-up" in basis. When a child inherits a $400,000 house that his parents originally bought for $50,000, the child's tax basis is $400,000. The child can then sell the house for $400,000 and no tax would be due from the child (the $400,000, however, is included in the estate for estate-tax purposes). On the other hand, if the parents had sold the house for that amount, and had not rolled over the profit into a replacement dwelling, they would have had to account for $225,000 in gain after taking into account the $125,000 "over-55" exemption -- if they had been old enough to qualify for the exemption at the time of sale.
In many cases, the most economical, practical and emotionally acceptable option is to leave the house to a child or children. And while leaving a house to an only child presents few problems, leaving property to two or more children is another matter entirely.
"There's nothing like dividing up an estate to bring out the worst in a group of siblings," said Charles D. Whelan 3d, a New Brunswick, N.J., lawyer who specializes in trusts and estates. Frequently, Mr. Whelan said, parents who think they are doing their children a favor by passing the family home to them upon their death are actually setting the stage for a sibling civil war.
"I've seen situations where brothers and sisters haven't spoken for years," Mr. Whelan said. "One of the kids wants to move into the house and the other wants to sell it. It can get really very ugly."
Generally, Mr. Whelan said, he has advised clients who want to leave a house to their children to put specific language in their wills instructing the executor to sell the house as soon as possible and then divide the proceeds among the children.
And while parents may still choose to leave a home to their children and let the children decide how the property is to be divided, the new tax law provides most homeowners with additional options.
Mr. Schatsky, the Manhattan lawyer and financial consultant, explained that under the new tax law, individual taxpayers can realize up to $250,000 in tax-free gain on the sale of a principal residence. For married taxpayers who file jointly, the exemption is $500,000. "That means that the average couple can do just about whatever they want with their home," Mr. Schatsky said. A couple with a built-in $350,000 gain in a principal residence, for example, can sell the house without having to worry about paying tax on any of the profit.
"Many people with grown children have much more house than they need," Mr. Schatsky said. "Now they can buy a smaller house, or rent an apartment, and, if they want to, they can still give $10,000 a year, tax-free, to each of their children."
The new capital-gains tax exemptions, Mr. Schatsky pointed out, are available on any property that has been used as a principal residence for at least two of the five years preceding the sale. Moreover, he said, unlike the one-time, over-55 exemption of the former tax law, the current exemptions can be used over and over. That means that homeowners who have vacation homes that have appreciated in value can sell those homes and pay no tax on the gain merely by using the vacation home as a principal residence for at least two years.
THE new tax law may also contribute to a lessening of the emotional and economic stresses that often accompany a divorce.
"For years, one of the greatest problems encountered in a divorce has been the sale of the marital home," said John P. Paone Jr., a matrimonial lawyer in Woodbridge, N.J. "Usually, a divorce triggers the recognition of a capital gain because neither party is in a position to roll over the gain into a new house."
An additional problem under prior law, Mr. Paone said, arose from the fact that husbands who agreed to allow a former spouse and children to remain in the house -- with the understanding that the house would be sold when the children were grown -- would usually have to pay capital-gains tax on half the profit at the time of the sale because at that point, the house was no longer the husband's principal residence.
Under the new law, however, not only will both parties be able to avoid being taxed on up to $250,000 each in gain in the event of an immediate sale, but the two-out-of-five-year provision allows the parties up to three years to sell the property -- and still obtain the exemption -- even though one former spouse no longer resides there.
"It doesn't solve everything, but it should make reaching a settlement a whole lot easier," Mr. Paone said. "And it will make the sale of the home a little less traumatic."
IN fact, while the new tax law should prove to be beneficial to most homeowners, it could result in making sales more traumatic for those with gains that exceed the allowable exemptions.
Martin Shenkman, a Teaneck, N.J., tax lawyer who has written several books on real estate taxation, explained that while the new tax law allows for exemptions every two years, it no longer allows property owners to avoid taxes on the sale of a principal residence by rolling over their gain into a replacement dwelling of equal or greater value. It has also eliminated the over-55 exemption of $125,000 in profit.
"If the gain on the sale of a home exceeds $250,000, or $500,000 for a couple filing a joint return, then a significant capital-gains tax could be incurred," Mr. Shenkman said. And even though the capital-gains tax rate itself has been reduced under the new tax law -- from 28 percent under the former law to about 20 percent now -- there is no longer any way to avoid payment.
So, Mr. Shenkman said, while the new tax law may encourage sales by those with gains less than the maximum exemption, it could discourage sales by those with bigger gains. Moreover, he said, those with such significant gains are also more likely to have estates that exceed the Federal Gift and Estates Tax Unified Credit -- now $600,000 for an individual Such people, Mr. Shenkman said, typically require more sophisticated tax planning strategies, the most common of which is the Credit Shelter Trust.
With such a trust, Mr. Shenkman said, a married couple can insure that they obtain the full benefit of both spouses' unified credits. The spouses indicate in their wills that assets representing the maximum available credit at the time of the first spouse's death should pass to a trust -- the beneficiaries of which are typically the children -- instead of to the surviving spouse. By doing that, Mr. Shenkman said, the estate of the second spouse to die does not include assets from the first spouse that could have otherwise escaped taxation.
Taxpayers with estates that exceed the combined unified credit of both spouses can use an additional estate planning tool called the Qualified Personal Residence Trust.
Such a trust -- referred to by its acronym, "QPRT" (pronounced "Cue-pert") -- allows a homeowner to give a principal residence or a vacation home as a gift to a trust established for a specific term. Though the gift reduces the individual's Federal Gift and Estates Tax Unified Credit, the value assigned by the tax law to the property that is conveyed to the trust is discounted considerably.
For example, Mr. Shenkman said, a $1 million property placed in a QPRT for a term of 15 years is valued for tax purposes at only $280,780.
That means that if the owner survives the term of the trust -- as is required -- he or she will have transferred a $1 million asset, plus any appreciation over the 15 years, while using up only $280,780 of the unified credit.
Mr. Shenkman said that all estate-planning strategies have distinct advantages and disadvantages that vary according to an individual's financial situation. Accordingly, he said, those who believe they may benefit from any of the devices should consult a tax adviser.
One adviser -- Mr. Schatsky, the Manhattan lawyer and tax consultant -- offered some advice he said should apply to every homeowner.
"When dealing with a personal residence," he said, "you should decide what you would do with it if there were no income taxes, there were no estate taxes and there were no children to leave it to. Because if you don't do that first, you're letting the tax tail wag the dog."

What comes next? And how soon?
These are impatient questions, without immediate prospect of answers. But they will be asked over and over here with increasing interest and urgency for at least a generation as Newark's leaders in business, education and politics look for ways to capitalize on the new Performing Arts Center, whose own success will not be gauged for some time. 
 With less than a week to go before the first audience hears the first note of music in Prudential Hall, there is a great intake of breath and an audible pause here. The people in a position to talk about what's next are upbeat but circumspect, eager to praise the present, but careful not to predict the future, as if wishing out loud might annoy the gods of renewal enough to make them lose interest in a place that has needed serious attention -- if not divine intervention -- for more than 30 years.
The future ceased to be encouraging a long time ago as Newark's downward slide into an urban reservation for the poor seemed unending. The calendar moved forward, but the future did not always come with it.
Yet now, on the edge of the single most significant change in Newark since the 1967 riots, it seems no one is fully prepared (nor, perhaps, should be) to discuss the most impatient question of all: Will the arts center lead to a renewal big enough to spawn new market-rate residential housing in the center of Newark, together with a revival of its shriveled retail trade?
Will a development impresario -- someone with the muscle and pizazz of Donald Trump -- come riding into the city with an open checkbook and a plan? Is the city prepared to work with outsiders to make the deals it needs to make? And will further development gradually help improve the schools and standard of living for the thousands of Newark residents who still need jobs, or the hope of getting them? In other words, will Newark become an Atlantic City without the gambling, or will the middle class come back?
Those questions have been waiting for answers since long before the urban wars of the 1960's. And the answer was almost always that better luck was just around the corner. That kind of big-time luck is a tall order, and it takes time.
But now more than just the hope of real change downtown, particularly along Broad Street, Newark's main boulevard, has begun to take shape. These are physical changes, some visible at street level, some not. Some are cosmetic; some go deeper. The future has finally arrived, on the 12-acre arts center site and elsewhere, and it is palpable, even quantifiable.
"Certainly the potential is there, if done right," said Dr. James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "Newark is at the core of the fifth largest metropolitan market in the country. There is enough potential support to make the center a success in and of itself."
Over the last 15 years, he said, north central New Jersey has evolved into a much more self-contained economy despite a continuing link to New York.
"It was a non-player in the regional office market in 1980," he said. "Today it has over 180 million square feet of office space, just behind New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco." But, he added, "the spillover effects are going to take an enormous amount of time."
Drawing a comparison with Lincoln Center's role in revitalizing the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Dr. Hughes said: "For 10 to 15 years afterward, we saw very little change in land use. The area was barren for a long time. Only in the boom years of the 1980's did we get a whole range of restaurants and other things."
He warned against the danger of impatience: "If we don't see something happen immediately, we claim it a failure as an economic development tool."
Broad Street north of Market, its major cross street, is still home to some of the largest empty buildings in town -- the old Hahne's Department Store and the Griffith Piano Building, to name two. In recent years, they were acquired by Miles Berger, a Newark developer who says he intends to turn some of his holdings into parking lots, retail space and, perhaps, residential or office space.
Beneath Military Park, a swath of green along Broad Street, is a vast parking garage that until recently was a dungeonlike maze of gray concrete, as desolate as the nighttime streets above. Now, because of the arts center development, it has been thoroughly renovated.
"It's now the sexiest garage in New Jersey," said Lawrence P. Goldman, president and chief executive of the center. "We've got Beethoven coming through the speakers."
The city has made good on its pledges to repave streets in and around the arts center. For the first time, hundreds of signs pointing drivers to Newark have gone up on the highways that border it, and scores more are hung around town, calling attention to historic sites and the large and growing campus complex on both sides of Broad Street. These include Seton Hall University Law School, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, and Rutgers's Newark campus and law school, which is putting up a new $55 million building. Close by, too, is the sprawling campus of the University of Medicine and Dentistry and other medical institutions.
The arts center plan, presented almost a decade ago, included a master plan for all of downtown, drawing together Newark's various campus centers. How to do that and how to pay for it remain to be discussed. "The hope is to be able to use the arts center to provide the linkage to these other circles, rather than have it just be another circle itself," said Marilyn Taylor, a partner at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Manhattan architectural firm that helped produce the master plan and the arts center.
"All healthy places are a walk," she said. "They are a string of destinations, not just a destination. So when you go downtown to buy a dress, stopping for a cup of coffee seems like a good idea, and so does a movie."
The original site proposed for the arts center was on Broad Street, but eventually planners and civic leaders agreed to move it closer to the Passaic River, Ms. Taylor said. The point, she added, was to try to make yet another link, this time with the waterfront.
Sharpe James, the city's Mayor since 1986 and its most tireless booster, said last week that in advance of any major new initiatives, the city has already undertaken these:
* Establishment of a special improvement district downtown that will involve store owners in sidewalk and facade beautification projects, increase police presence and chase peddlers away.
* A new minor-league baseball and soccer complex off Bridge Street, within walking distance of the center.
* Plans to complete waterfront development near the arts center.
* Plans, now before New Jersey Transit officials, to complete a rail link between Lackawanna Station, the arts center and Pennsylvania Station.
Next week, a $1 bus service called the Loop will connect Penn Station with important locations downtown, including the arts center. "Things are already happening," the Mayor said. And then he recalled a conference in Virgnia not long ago at which other mayors told him, "You know, Sharpe, the best thing that ever happened to Newark was the development and growth passed you by for two decades."
Why is that? Mr. James asked.
"You won't make all the mistakes," he said they told him. "You'll do it right."

A Man of Particular Passions

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
THE president and chief executive of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center is a slender, intense, impeccably dressed, graying 51-year-old who looks as if his name would be something imposing and formal. And it is, on his official biography, the one that says Lawrence P. Goldman has a Ph.D. from Princeton University and notes that his responsibilities include overseeing the design, construction and operation of the imposing new $200 million center.
But those who know him even a little don't call him Mr. Goldman, or Lawrence. It's Larry. 
 He's the kind of charismatic visionary who might have been invented for the task of turning the arts center from a dream of urban renewal to the brick colossus at One Center Street, a pragmatic idealist who came of age in the civil rights era and, looking for a solution to race problems, turned to urban planning.
But he is also the kind of manager who wanders through his giant work in progress at every opportunity, chatting up the construction workers and picking up errant pieces of tape on the carpet. The kind of boss who remembers birthdays, gives presents in the holiday season, gets mad at his secretary if she doesn't tell him that an employee has a sick relative -- and pops through his office door dozens of times a day with sudden, urgent imperatives. "Somebody want to pick that up?" he'll say if a phone rings more than four times.
He is also the kind of third baseman, he notes ruefully, who can field but not hit. "There was a time when a great deal of my sense of identity came out of baseball," he says. A devoted player in college at Colgate, he now plays on an over-40 league: "That's very important to me."
The arts center is very nearly complete, but a few giant walls of glass are still waiting to be installed. Pickup trucks and vans are parked all over the grounds. Cranes here and there poke toward the sky.
Mr. Goldman speaks to workers on the supposition that they know who he is. Sometimes they don't know exactly who he is, but they always know he's the boss. One reason they know him is that he spoke at the recent Hard-Hat Concert.
"When we got started," Mr. Goldman said, "we told the construction workers the very first event here would be for them. We wanted them them to feel they have a personal relationship with their work. We're all in this together."
The only child of a haberdasher in Larchmont, N.Y., Mr. Goldman has a blend of altruism, confidence and single-mindedness that underlies his professional achievements. "I've been so fortunate," he said. "Look at my career. I've been involved of three of the great urban transformation programs in the region: Roosevelt Island, the most ambitious community planning ever. Carnegie Hall, which, when I was there, seemed like the center of the universe. You couldn't walk out the door without some press person grabbing you." And now the Performing Arts Center, which he watches over like a new mother waiting for baby's first smile.
That's the exact quality for which he was hired, although he also had longstanding ties to Newark, from his years studying urban issues at Princeton. Raymond G. Chambers, a foundation head who is now a chairman at the arts center, said Mr. Goldman's energy was crucial to turning the dream of an arts center into reality.
Their first contact was in the late 1980's, when Mr. Goldman was overseeing the redevelopment of Carnegie Hall, including the construction of a Cesar Pelli tower.
"It was the recognition of his passion, more than anything else, that was compelling," Mr. Chambers said.
"We initially retained him as a consultant to help us think through the feasibility of the performing arts center. And we were immediately so impressed with his background as matching the needs of the art center. But my best recollection is that we knew he was the right person when he displayed his passion, not just for a building or performing arts center, but for the people of Newark, and the hope that this world-class performing art center could bring to those people."
That interest started long before. Mr. Goldman still has an aging copy of a paper he wrote at Princeton, dated March 1969, titled "Black Mayoral Politics in Newark: Getting It Together for 1970." In a characteristically advantageous turn of fate, that paper introduced Mr. Goldman to Ken Gibson, who in 1970 was elected the first black Mayor of Newark, the first black Mayor of any major American city.
At Princeton, Mr. Goldman also met Paul Ylvisaker, the legendary state Commissioner for Community Affairs, who ran down the streets of Newark after the riots to stop armed National Guardsmen from performing threatening house-to-house searches. "He was as close to a saint as any man I ever met," Mr. Goldman said.
He keeps a picture of his mentor, who died in 1992, on his desk, along with a collection of shots of his three children and his wife, Laurie Chock, a documentary film maker.
They met 20 years ago, he said. He was wandering around, an odd August Friday night with nothing to do, and for the first time in his life he went into a restaurant to have dinner alone. He happened into Marvin Gardens, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and saw "three attractive women having dinner." He asked if he could join them. They were Ms. Chock, her sister and a friend.
"Now, there's no important decision I make that I don't discuss it first with her," he said.
Mr. Goldman didn't have a chance, though, on Wednesday. She was in Portugal filming when his assistant, Olga Rivera-Ayala, opened his office door and announced that President Clinton, on his way to the Metropolitan Baptist Church and an appearance with the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, State Senator James E. McGreevey, might be stopping by.
Mr. Goldman paused only briefly.
"How do you know?" he asked. "Why would he be coming here?"
It was a false alarm. "He's not coming here," Ms. Rivera-Ayala said. "He's driving by. But you might see him."
Dryly, he responded, "That'd be great."
Anyone else's pulse might have risen. But not Mr. Goldman's. "We've never been shy about the idea of getting national and international attention, though it would be arrogant to say that the day we open, we'll be the equal of Kennedy Center and Lincoln Center," he said. "Still, with time, I expect that there will be many Presidents here. We've already had a prime minister."
ALONG with Presidents, the arts center is meant to attract members of the black middle class who, like their white counterparts, fled Newark after the riots. And he is convincing when praising the corporate leaders who gave money and support to the arts center, whom he calls "truly enlightened."
Not only do they understand that this area must offer a good quality of life for them to attract and retain employees, he says, but they also grasp a basic piece of urban reality: "Suburban Northern New Jersey can't sustain long-range health if New Jersey's largest city isn't healthy."
"In other words," he says, "they get it. You can't turn your back on it."
The opening is Saturday, but Mr. Goldman frequently reminds himself and his staff that the mad scramble to have the building ready in time is "a race to the starting line." In terms of his own long-term ambitions, he intends to run the race.
"People have to feel so damned good about being here," he said, pumping his fists. "There has to be a total attention to detail -- in the parking, the ushering, the dining. Everything about this has to be upbeat."

New Jersey, Healthy for All, Aiming at Health of the Elderly

 BODY:
New Jersey residents lead healthier lives than those in three-fourths of the nation, according to a survey released last week.
New Jersey ranks 12th from the top when all of the factors considered by the Reliastar Financial Corporation of Minneapolis in its annual evaluation are combined. The survey considered such seemingly diverse factors as a state's unemployment rate because that has a bearing on a person's ability to obtain health insurance; the rates of heart disease, cancer and infectious diseases like AIDS; the mortality rate; job-related fatalities, and motor vehicle deaths. 
 Minnesota, the home state for Reliastar, a life insurance, employee benefits and mutual funds holding company, comes in first with the healthiest residents followed by New Hampshire, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Wisconsin. Louisiana and Mississippi tie for last place.
"This is a general survey, not something that is necessarily precise," said Leah Ziskin, deputy commissioner of the state Department of Health and Senior Services, "but I think our concerted effort to reduce youthful smoking and to promote the use of seat belts and reduce the number of drunken drivers contributed to our high ranking."
Residents of nursing homes or those 65 and older being discharged from hospitals will be offered influenza and pneumonia vaccinations under regulations being drafted by the state Department of Health and Senior Services.
Thirty-seven percent of New Jersey residents 65 and older now get flu shots, compared with 41 percent nationally, and 13.5 percent get pneumonia shots, vs. 16 percent nationally. The new requirements for nursing homes and hospitals are designed to reduce the 2,000 deaths among New Jersey seniors that are caused each year by the two diseases, Len Fishman, state health and senior services commissioner, said in announcing the program Thursday.
Until the regulations are changed, the health department is asking hospitals and nursing homes to begin immediately to offer the shots voluntarily, which are covered by Medicare. There are slightly more than one million New Jersey residents over the age of 65.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Nipping at the Hand That Has Long Fed Him

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
To hear Murray Sabrin tell it, government should limit its role to helping individuals defend themselves from force and fraud.
Mr. Sabrin, the Libertarian Party's candidate for governor, does not think taxpayer dollars should be spent on much else. He wants to abolish the income tax, and most other state taxes, for that matter. 
 If elected, he vows to dismantle state government, eventually eliminating virtually all state agencies and programs, with the exception of the prison system, the State Police and the court system.
He promises to take state dollars and state regulations out of public education, leaving local residents to pay for schools and giving them the option of deciding what education the schools should offer.
"We must slash government spending by billions of dollars to restore constitutional government in New Jersey," he says.
Mr. Sabrin may not sound like your typical candidate, but he shares a common trait with some other politicians: he says one thing yet does another.
Although he has embraced the anti-government philosophy of the Libertarian Party for almost two decades, Mr. Sabrin, 50, who lives in Leonia, has personally benefited from government largess for most of his life.
Take his campaign for governor. He began his radio and television advertising campaign late last week, urging voters not to waste their votes on "Whitman or McGreevey." Even though he says he does not believe that taxpayer dollars should be used to cover the cost of campaigning, he is using taxpayer dollars -- about $330,000 worth -- to help finance the media spots and his campaign.
As a child growing up in New York City, he attended public schools in the Bronx. He earned a bachelor's degree in history, and later a master's degree in social studies education at Lehman College. He did not have to worry, as most young people today do, about graduating with thousands of dollars in college loans. There was no tuition for students at Lehman College, now part of the City University of New York. Tuition was covered by city taxpayer dollars.
Even when he decided to pursue his goal of becoming a college professor, after four years as a public-school teacher in New York City, he attended a university subsidized with state tax dollars. He earned his Ph.D. from Rutgers in economic geography.
Over the years, he has held a few jobs in the private sector. He is host of his own radio and cable television program, "On the Money," on which he discusses financial matters. In the 1980's, he worked in sales and marketing for two years, and as a staff economist for the American Institute for Economic Research for three years, and as a senior investment analyst for American Investment Services in 1981 and 1982.
But for the last 12 years, he has been paid with state taxpayer dollars for his work as a college professor. Mr. Sabrin now earns $63,000 a year as a professor of finance in the school of administration and business at Ramapo College in Mahway. .
Mr. Sabrin defends his decision to take taxpayer dollars to help wage his campaign. And he defends his decision to oppose government spending for everyone else, even though he makes his living today at an institution financed by state taxpayers.
"We are playing by the rules that have been established by the government establishment," he explained. "We did not create these rules. We would not have created these rules. We believe that peaceful change is the best way to achieve the Libertarian goals for New Jersey: limited government, personal responsibility and home rule."
It is under New Jersey's taxpayer-financed system of paying for gubernatorial campaigns that Mr. Sabrin is able to get his message across. He is the first third-party candidate to qualify for public money and to earn a place at the televised gubernatorial debates. To qualify for matching funds, he raised $233,000 from friends and Libertarian Party supporters across the country.
Of course, Mr. Sabrin says that if elected he will abolish public financing of political campaigns in the state. But it is the one thing that violates Libertarian Party principles that he might want to keep.
After all, public financing is giving him a chance to voice his ideas this year. Or maybe, if he is elected, then he will share another common trait with incumbents, which is to do everything possible to keep the job.

Rickel Home Centers Will Go Out of Business

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

 BODY:
Forty-four years after brothers Mort, Al and Bob Rickel opened their first store on Route 22 in Union, Rickel Home Centers said last week it would go out of business and lay off all 2,700 employees, including 2,000 in New Jersey. Rickel, based in South Plainfield, will close its 38 New Jersey stores and 11 others in New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware by Dec. 31, said Greg Hanselman, vice president for marketing. Rickel overexpanded by acquiring the Channel Home Centers chain in November 1994, Mr. Hanselman said, then fell into bankruptcy 14 months later and failed to attract badly needed investors despite a streamlining plan to boost profits. "Basically, we just ran out of cash," he said. 
 Brian Burns, a spokesman for the state Department of Labor, said the department would help Rickel employees preregister for unemployment insurance and apply for tuition grants under state and Federal retraining programs. STEVE STRUNSKY

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mercedes-Benz ML320;
Star of Sport Utilities Is Suddenly 3-Pointed

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
BEST you think the new ML320 "all activity vehicle" is not a true Mercedes-Benz, check out the big, bold three-pointed star embedded in the plastic grille. The badge is a whopping eight inches in diameter, just so no one misses the point: although this is a different kind of vehicle for Mercedes, and it comes from Tuscaloosa, Ala., instead of Stuttgart, Germany, it is a Mercedes nonetheless.
A week at the wheel convinced me. Even without the star, there would be no doubt that the ML320 is pure Mercedes. 
 The ML320 is the first of Mercedes's new family of M-Class sport utility vehicles (320 refers to its 3.2-liter V6 engine) and it is the first product built at the company's new Alabama assembly plant. It is also a standout among several new vehicles from the company, which has moved quickly and skillfully in recent years to expand on its prior reputation for well-engineered but very conservative and expensive cars.
Mercedes advertising has become clever -- cool, even -- and cars like the C-Class sedan, the SLK roadster and the new CLK coupe are putting the three-pointed star within the grasp of younger buyers. In Europe, the avant-garde A-Class subcompact and the soon-to-come Smart city car make the company seem more friendly and more environmentally aware.
If the "old" Mercedes had created a sport utility, it would likely have aimed at the top of the market -- at vehicles like the $60,000 Range Rover and $50,000 Lexus LX 450. (Indeed, the company builds the $130,000 Gelandewagen in a joint venture in Austria, but that military-design vehicle is sold in the United States only through an independent distributor, Europa International.)
Instead, the newly aggressive Mercedes-Benz is taking on the heart of the midsize sport utility market, a segment dominated by the Ford Explorer and the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Mercedes figures that many Americans who appreciate the ruggedness and cargo capacity of those truck-derived sport utilities would prefer a more comfortable ride, more carlike handling, extra safety features and better fuel economy.
The ML320's rounded silhouette contrasts with the boxy shapes of the Grand Cherokee and especially the Explorer. In fact, the ML320's aerodynamics are the best in the segment, which results in a respectable mileage rating of 21 miles per gallon on the highway. Up front, the gray bumper and that wide grille with the big star are prominent. But the homely back end looks like the rump of a mini-van.
During my week-long test drive, the ML320 drew surprisingly little reaction, though I was often asked "What is that?"
The ML320 is wider and taller than the Explorer and Grand Cherokee. The wheels are pushed toward the corners, minimizing the front and rear overhang to lend an aggressive look and make the interior more spacious.
Inside, the instrument panel, from the type face of the numerals to the layout of the dials, is pure Mercedes. A large speedometer is prominent.
Two familiar Mercedes features were missing. Instead of a single windshield wiper, like the one in Mercedes cars, the M-Class has two wipers. And where were the familiar seat adjusters? Seat-shaped controls, placed on the doors of Mercedes autos, were absent. Instead, the test vehicle (with only basic equipment, including a cloth interior) had six-way manual controls on the front and side of the bottom cushion.
The center of the dash is clean, simple and logical. The audio system is situated just below three big air vents and above large rotary climate-control dials. Other controls are minimal: buttons for the air-conditioner and four-wheel-drive low range, and toggles for the optional seat warmers and the standard rear window wiper and defroster. The power window switches are on the center console and there is an extra 12-volt outlet.
Beyond the glove box, which can hold little more than the leather-encased owner's manual, storage is bountiful. All four doors have pockets. An optional, lockable drawer pulls out from beneath the front passenger seat. A garage-door opener fits into an overhead compartment. The center armrest covers a deep bin. In the cargo area, which comes with a privacy screen, another bin kept my purse out of sight while I picked apples at an orchard.
The cup holders, which fold down from each end of the dash and from the back of the center console, are neatly designed but accommodate only cups sized just so.
The cargo area is deceptively large. The hatch opens upward and the liftover is low, so it is easy to slide groceries forward. I handily hoisted in a child's bike; an adult model would not fit without folding the second row of seats. (One, two or all three of those seats fold to create a flat cargo floor.)
The ML320 accommodates five people, and a third-row seat will be offered later as an option. Seating is comfortable, with plenty of leg room and head room in every position. My children ranked the ML320 one of their favorite vehicles because of the high seats and expansive view through lots of glass. The large doors and low step-in height were also a plus, and the children got in easily without assistance.
We were disappointed, however, that safety-conscious Mercedes had not installed a shoulder-lap belt in the middle rear seat, a feature now found in less expensive cars like the Chevrolet Prizm. Still, I felt extremely safe, almost invulnerable. The ML320 has dual front air bags, side air bags in the front doors, emergency seat-belt tension retractors and anti-lock brakes. It is also constructed with a steel safety cage around the passenger compartment.
The stiff body structure benefits handling, which along with the comfortable ride sets the ML320 far above the competition. Many sport utilities promise carlike attributes, but no one else has delivered them to such a degree. The ML320 rides like a luxury sedan and grips curving roads like a sports coupe.
Acceleration from the new V6, rated at 215 horsepower, is surprisingly quick. (And if it isn't enough for you, a V8 will arrive in a year.) The five-speed automatic transmission, which adapts to one's driving style, shifts imperceptibly. The brakes are beefy.
The ML320 is equipped with an innovative full-time four-wheel-drive system that requires no action from the driver. It electronically senses wheel slippage and applies the brakes to the slipping wheels while delivering just the right torque to the tires with grip -- even if only one has traction. A low gear range, for low-speed hill climbing, can be engaged with the push of a button.
The ML320 comes with a long list of equipment. Options are grouped in five packages, with leather seats, walnut trim, CD changer and cellular phone included in the top-of-the-line package; separate available items are limited to a sunroof, metallic paint and a premium audio system. Dealer-installed options include a navigation system.
Then there's the price. Starting at about $35,000 and topping out at $41,000, the ML320 seems a bargain compared with luxury versions of the Explorer and Grand Cherokee, which move into similar territory once a few options are checked. Lucky for Ford and Jeep that ML320 production will be limited to 70,000 a year, with half for export.
Given the choice, which sport utility would I buy? The ML320, hands down.
Plus, it's a Mercedes.

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
State Street Global Advisors, which runs the SSgA family of funds, is leading the way for large mutual fund companies into the new world of medical savings accounts.
Medical savings accounts became available in January as a kind of medical I.R.A. They are intended for the self-employed and the employees of small companies and are packaged with high-deductible health insurance to cover serious illness. Contributions to the accounts are tax-deductible, and interest earned on the savings is tax-exempt, as long as all the money withdrawn from the account is used for medical expenses. At age 65, account holders can withdraw the money for any purpose without penalty. 
 For its medical savings accounts, State Street is offering investment options in 15 of its no-load mutual funds. An investor can put money in any combination of funds, as long as the $1,000 initial minimum per fund is met. Its best long-term performers are its domestic equity funds, including SSgA Small Cap and SSgA S.& P. 500.
So far this year, the bulk of these accounts have been created by insurance companies, including Mutual of Omaha and New York Life, and by a sprinkling of banks, including Mellon and Wells Fargo, according to the Council for Affordable Health Insurance, a nonprofit group in Alexandria, Va. But Kelly A. McCarthy, the council's director of public affairs, said she expected that to change.
"Now that the learning curve is over and people know what M.S.A.'s are, the types of companies that offer them will start to diversify," she said. Among mutual fund companies, only Mennonite Mutual Aid, which manages about $135 million in three MMA Praxis mutual funds, offers these accounts so far, according to the council.
With the universe of providers expanding, how should consumers choose where to set up a medical savings account?
It comes down to convenience versus return, Ms. McCarthy said. "It's more convenient to get high-deductible insurance and the medical savings account in one place at an insurance company," she said, "but if you get it from a mutual fund company, you can hope for a higher return on your investment."
Medical savings accounts can be set up by self-employed workers and people at companies that have 50 or fewer employees. For an individual to qualify, the deductible on his or her health insurance plan must be $1,500 to $2,250; for family coverage, it must be $3,000 to $4,500. Employer contributions are deductible by the company and are tax-free to employees. The maximum annual contribution is 65 percent of the deductible for individuals, or $1,462; for families, it is 75 percent, or $3,375.
 
Cutting Fees At Heartland
Fund investors who keep a sharp eye on expenses may like what they see at the Heartland funds of Milwaukee.
In a bid to draw new money, management is subsidizing all fees for the Heartland Large Cap Value fund, whose normal expense ratio is 2.12 percent, and is reimbursing Heartland Mid Cap Value so that its total annual expenses do not exceed 1.25 percent of assets, down from 1.46 percent.
Small, young equity funds often waive fees to build assets quickly. Both funds started last October.
"We believe that the fee waivers and reimbursements, combined with the first-year record, will make the funds attractive to investors," said Mitchell Kohls, chief operating officer for Heartland Advisors.
Large Cap Value, which holds $7 million in assets, returned 33.6 percent for the 11 months ended Sept. 30, compared with 32.5 percent for its large value peers, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund trackers. Mid Cap Value, which holds $33 million, gained 37.2 percent in that time, compared with 35.5 percent for its group.
"Also, by building assets, we seek to achieve economies of scale that would benefit all shareholders," Mr. Kohls said.
Heartland Advisors said that all or a portion of the fees for both funds might be reinstated at any time. No target date has been set; Mr. Kohls said the arrangement would be reviewed regularly.
Heartland also announced last week that two other funds -- Small Cap Contrarian and Value -- would close to new investors on Oct. 31. Existing shareholders on that date will still be able to add to their accounts.
The 13-year-old Heartland Value, with $2.3 billion in assets, beat other funds that invest in small value stocks by about four percentage points a year, on average, for the five years through September, according to Morningstar. Small Cap Contrarian, which started in April 1995 and has $339 million in assets, rose 26.6 percent for the 12 months through September, compared with 41.1 percent for its small-cap value peers.
 
New Funds
Flex-Partners International Equity aims for long-term growth by investing at least 70 percent of its portfolio in equity securities in developed countries and up to 30 percent in emerging markets.
Phoenix Growth and Income is managed by Steven Colton, who most recently ran American Century Income & Growth, and Dong Hao Zhang, former manager of American Century Equity Growth, using a value investment approach. Phoenix Core Equity will buy large, high-quality companies with reasonable valuations that its managers believe have the best potential to outperform the market.
 
Merger
Muir California Tax-Free has been merged into the Citizens Income fund. Both funds are members of the Citizens Trust family.
 
New Fund
Compass Capital International Small Cap Equity will use a value approach to picking stocks with market capitalizations of $100 million to $1 billion in developed and emerging markets. The maximum initial sales charge is 5 percent.
 
In Brief
Towneley Capital Management's Web site, www.towneley.com, offers various data on the four Eclipse funds: Balanced, Growth and Income, Equity and Ultra Short Term Income. The site includes monthly and quarterly performance, risk and other statistics, portfolio characteristics and prospectuses.
Dreyfus Small Company Value will close to new investors when assets reach $500 million. The fund currently has $341 million.

MARKETS
Tilting at Exuberance Again
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, was wearing his Cassandra hat in public again last week. In testimony before Congress, Mr. Greenspan returned to the themes of his famous December "irrational exuberance" speech, calling any hopes that the stock market will continue to roar upward at its recent pace unrealistic and warning that inflation remained a looming threat. As usual, he avoided saying definitely whether an interest-rate increase was in the offing, but investors took his remarks to heart and pushed stock and bond prices down.
 
MORE IS MORE
Buying the Competition
Federal Express struck a deal to expand into trucking and logistics by agreeing to buy Caliber for $2.7 billion, thereby also acquiring RPS, a big competitor in the business-to-business end of the speedy delivery market. One reason Caliber may have looked especially tempting to the generally acquisition-shy Fedex: Like Fedex (but unlike U.P.S.), Caliber is nonunion. . . . Not long ago, the North Fork Bancorporation had a half-dozen branches and a chairman trying to control costs by telling workers to make do with one pen and one pencil apiece. With a deal last week to buy New York Bancorp for $800 million, its ninth acquisition in as many years, North Fork will become the biggest bank on Long Island, and a serious competitor in the retail backyard of the giant New York City banks -- maybe serious enough to get itself bought in turn.
 
LESS IS MORE
Addition by Subtraction
Fed up with trying to persuade the market that its highly profitable finance arm ought to make its stock worth a lot more, the Ford Motor Company decided to hand over its 80.7 percent stake in Associates First Capital to Ford shareholders. The almost $18 billion spinoff accounts for nearly a third of Ford's market value but less than one-twelfth of its second-quarter profits. . . . Champion International also felt the urge to become a purer play, saying it would sell off roughly a quarter of the company to concentrate on coated papers, unbleached paperboard, softwood timberland and distribution. Analysts said Champion could net about $1.1 billion, including the sale of 325,000 acres of timberland, much of it in the environmentally and politically sensitive Adirondack Park in upstate New York.
 
TECHNOLOGY STOCKS
Sell on 'Oops,' Buy on Thud
A tale of two losses: On Monday, Silicon Graphics brought investors up short with word that it expected to report a loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30. The market, noting that the company's previous quarter was gangbusters and its competitors in the client-server business are thriving, reacted by hacking a third off its share price. On Tuesday evening, the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices reported an even bigger loss than analysts had been expecting since the company gave warning a month ago. Did the market mind? Not for long. After a rough morning, the stock rallied to close higher and rose again the next day.
 
SAFETY
Lock and Unload
The stories are heartbreakers: Children find their parents' handgun in the dresser drawer, they play with it and one winds up maimed or dead. Those stories ought to be growing rarer by the end of next year, when the manufacturers of most handguns made in the United States say they will be shipping all new handguns with a child-safety lock. . . . Chrysler continues to be haunted by allegations of defective rear door latches in the 4.1 million of its mini-vans built before 1996. A Federal jury in Charleston, S.C., awarded $262.5 million to the family of a six-year-old boy thrown from a mini-van in a 1994 traffic accident. Chrysler has a program to replace the latches but has not formally recalled the mini-vans. The company says it will appeal the verdict.
 
CURRENCY UNION
The Euro's Bitter Medicine
Getting Europe's economies synchronized for the introduction of the planned common currency in 1999 is proving painful. Germany's central bank felt compelled to head off any hint of inflation with a surprise interest-rate increase, its first tightening in more than five years, despite slow growth and record unemployment rolls. Five neighboring countries swiftly followed suit. In Italy, the center-left coalition Government of Romano Pradi, struggling to trim its too-big-for-the-Euro budget deficit, found itself cutting social welfare spending too deeply for the Communist Party to tolerate. Loss of the Communists' votes in Parliament brought down the Government.
 
SOUTHEAST ASIA
Indonesia Calls for Help
Long discredited in geopolitics, the domino theory seems to be reappearing in geofinance. Some of the same pressures that toppled the Thai baht over the summer have since set Indonesia's currency to teetering. Indonesia still has substantial reserves of foreign exchange, but the writing on the wall looked dire enough last week to prompt a request for standby aid from the International Monetary Fund to help stabilize the rupiah. Two more hard-hit currency dominoes, the Malaysian ringgit and Philippine peso, managed gains last week.
 
ACCUSATIONS
All the Way to the Top?
The senior F.B.I. agent in the investigation of possible fraud at Columbia/HCA, the nation's biggest hospital chain, called what the Government has uncovered so far a "systematic corporate scheme" perpetrated by senior executives -- and not an isolated error or aberration. The chain's billing and accounting practices may not ultimately prove to have been criminally improper, analysts said, but at the least, the company's defenses against pending shareholder lawsuits appear badly undermined by the contents of a 75-page affidavit partly unsealed last week. Neither the company nor its battered stock showed much reaction.
 
COINCIDENCES
There's That Word Again
What's hot, black, caffeinated and seemed to figure in every other headline last week? In politics, the long-running Washington donnybrook over campaign finance flared up when videotapes, shot at the famous White House coffees for high-rolling contributors, materialized belatedly. In Silicon Valley, Sun Microsystems sued Microsoft and threatened to yank its license to use Sun's Java programming language on the assertion that Microsoft had twisted Java into another way to seal the hegemony of its Windows operating system. In media, the editor of The Los Angeles Times, Shelby Coffey 3d, resigned, denying that he was driven out by corporate plans to give marketing executives unprecedented sway in the newsroom. Even in the weather report, a hurricane bearing down on Mexico's coffee country made commodity traders jittery at midweek. The storm devastated the coast but largely spared the crop; by Friday the futures pits had calmed down and so had prices, closing up mere pennies from a week earlier and still far below their May peak.

HEADLINE: Whip Deflation Now?;
Two Cheers for Inflation, Given the Alternative

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
INFLATION made headlines last week. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned that labor shortages could lead to rising prices. The German central bank raised a key interest rate, citing as a reason the need to prevent inflation. And the Labor Department reported that an index that measures the prices of goods as they leave American factories jumped sharply in September. But for all the focus on inflation as a big threat to the economy, Wall Street analysts, economists and investors talk increasingly about its opposite -- deflation -- as the potential source of the next crisis.
Deflation, last experienced in the Depression, means falling prices across the economy. That is not even close to happening now. But just as Wall Street has worried over a rising inflation rate long after it stopped rising, now it begins to speak of deflation as the direction prices could easily take if the economy weakens. 
 "Deflation is a word that has two meanings on Wall Street right now," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a bond firm. "One is the good meaning: that companies are more efficient, so they can lower prices and still make good profits. The other is the bad meaning, that companies can produce much more than people will buy and prices will tumble."
Two recent developments, both bad, are encouraging the almost casual use of the word deflation, a descriptive noun shunned for its scary connotations or confined to tales of the Depression, when prices and wages fell and unemployment shot up. One is the unusual spectacle of a falling inflation rate -- it is now just over 2 percent annually as measured by the Consumer Price Index -- in the midst of a strong economy. Since the 1960's, inflation has risen sharply during economic expansions and more slowly during most recessions. The concern today is that, during a downturn, the already-low inflation rate could slip below zero.
 
Zero for the Year
 One inflation measure, the Producer Price Index, measuring what manufacturers and other producers charge wholesalers and retailers for their goods, has actually fallen most of this year. A jump of five-tenths of a percent in September, reported on Friday, brought the annual rate up to zero. "That jump was clearly due to temporary factors that will disappear," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
The other concern is overcapacity. Just when factories are opening or expanding around the globe, the booming Asian countries -- big importers from the United States and other industrial nations -- are cutting back on purchases, raising the specter of too many goods chasing too few buyers. That is a recipe for falling prices.
"I was describing the Asian situation in a luncheon speech at the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations this week," said David Hale, chief economist at Zurich Kemper Investments. "I said the result could be more disinflation, by which I meant that prices could rise even more slowly than they are now. And a money manager in the audience got up and said, 'Why do you talk of disinflation? Why don't you say deflation?' "
The anecdote illustrates, Mr. Hale says, that Wall Street is relaxing a little about inflation. Stock and bond traders have traditionally put great pressure on the Federal Reserve to fight inflation, existing or expected, by raising interest rates to slow economic growth. The majority still do. But a shift in mood, reflected in the growing references to deflation, has diluted that pressure.
The Fed itself seems caught between concern that inflation will rise and the fact that the actual inflation rate is declining. Mr. Greenspan's comments have reflected the uncertainty.
In speeches and testimony over the last six months, Mr. Greenspan has suggested that the United States might have entered a new era of rising productivity that helps companies hold down prices -- the good deflation -- and still keep profits growing. And he has suggested that job insecurity may be inhibiting wage demands.
But on Wednesday Mr. Greenspan argued that the strong economy is using up the nation's labor supply and that worker shortages must inevitably push up wages and then prices, despite the improvement in productivity.
"It is clear that the Fed chairman on Wednesday took strong issue with the deflationist minority," Mr. Jones said.
The deflation-inflation debate divides executives even within Wall Street firms. Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, for example, is an inflation hawk, and he applauded Mr. Greenspan's freshly stated view that rising inflation is the big risk.
"Very bluntly, the deflation talk is in the market because it is bullish," Mr. Roach said. "If you can make a case for deflation, the Federal Reserve won't raise interest rates, and in doing so end the stock market rally. These deflationists are just talking their book."
But Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's chief strategist for global equities, worries about deflation. "I am not saying deflation is going to happen," he said. "I am saying we could be in an environment where prices are as likely to go down as they are to go up. We are involved in investing in companies all over the world, and it is just stunning to hear the managers of these companies talk about how they can't raise prices. And frankly, it frightens me."
Partly because of such fears, long-term bond yields have fallen in anticipation of harder times. Interest rates on mortgages and car loans have fallen in tandem. And stock prices have risen sharply, in part because stocks seemed to offer a better return than Treasury securities and bonds, with their falling yields.
"The chairman was concerned that the combination of rising stock prices and falling interest rates would then, unintentionally, be the stimulus for a fresh surge of economic growth that would finally be inflationary," Mr. Jones said. Since Mr. Greenspan's testimony, stock prices have fallen and bond yields have risen.
The new circumstances are markedly different from the ones that got people using the word deflation in the past. The word surfaced briefly after the 1987 stock market crash, but quickly disappeared. In the post-Civil War decades, prices fell as industrialization and rising productivity flooded the nation with goods.
Mass production and new technology kept the prices of these goods falling, much as technology breakthroughs keep computer prices falling today. But a growing, ever more prosperous population absorbed the flood of goods and the nation entered a golden era, although falling food prices hurt farmers and fomented Populism. In the 1930's, a different deflation struck. With banks failing and stocks plunging, people stopped buying and prices and wages fell drastically. Debts became hard to pay, and consumers made matters worse by putting off purchases, waiting for prices to fall even more.
Some on Wall Street today use deflation to mean a version of the post-Civil War golden era. Mr. Steinberg at Merrill Lynch is in this camp. "The term deflation makes people nervous," he writes, yet "costs have declined faster than prices" and profits have risen. Others, like Mr. Biggs, see in the growing overcapacity a deflation closer to that of the Depression era, although much milder. And a third, majority group, represented by Mr. Roach, insists that rising inflation is the issue.
The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the Consumer Price Index, sees mainly disinflation. It reports that prices have been rising much more slowly for many items, including medical care and new autos. "The result," said Patrick Jackman, chief of the Bureau's C.P.I. division, "is an inflation rate this year that has not been lower in two decades."

Inflation usually rises sharply at the end of an economic expansion; it rises more slowly as a recession takes hold, a phenomenon known as disinflation. In the last year, however, the inflation rate has dropped by nearly a percentage point despite a strong economy, raising the possiblity that in the next recession it may slip below zero, into inflation.

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
BACK in 1923, Rolls-Royce accessorized a stately Silver Ghost with a gun rack, a large spotlight and a Gatling gun so its owner, an Indian prince, could hunt tigers.
But as membership in the world's upper crust has changed, so have cars. In 1995, a Silver Spur was created for a businessman who wanted all the comforts of the office when he was on the road. The car had a fold-out fax machine and printer, a walnut case for a laptop and slots in the ceiling for filing paperwork. 
 For nearly a century, luxury cars have been barometers of the world's upper classes -- and their tastes. These days, a growing proportion of the buyers of Rolls-Royces, Aston Martins, Porsches and other extravagant cars are businessmen.
Since what passes for luxury in the 1990's is the ability to work all the time, many Rolls-Royces are being designed as portable offices, not just portable bars. Younger magnates are ordering theirs with five phone lines as well as a fax and an outlet to plug in a computer for the Internet, CD-ROM equipment and computerized navigation systems.
Are luxury cars becoming remotely practical? Not quite.
"In one sense, the businessman justifies to himself why he's spending so much," said Clive Chajet, a New York City consultant on corporate identity. Yet turning a Rolls-Royce into a mobile office makes it more of a status symbol in the workaholic 90's. "You're signaling that not only are you successful but, boy, are you busy," Mr. Chajet said.
More businessmen can afford these luxury cars since their salaries have swelled to fortunes -- last year's top-earning chief executive officer, Lawrence M. Coss of Green Tree Financial, was paid $102 million.
That kind of money comes in handy for putting a hold order on Aston Martin's cheapest car, which is $125,000. A specialized Porsche can cost $100,000; Rolls-Royce prices start at about $150,000 but can escalate to $2 million or more for owners insisting on bomb-proofing or on gold plating on its hood ornament, the Flying Lady.
Executives have become less shy about indulging their wealth lately, what with the economy growing and fewer companies wracked by downsizing. "You can't lay off 30 people and then drive to the office in a brand-new Rolls," said Daniel J. Phillips, publisher of the Robb Report, a monthly magazine for the rich.
While luxury car companies have always had their share of celebrity clients -- from old Hollywood to arriviste sports stars -- Rolls-Royce buyers are more and more often "self-made people who have been extremely successful because of their hard work," said Graham J. Morris, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars P.L.C., which began building cars in 1905. The world's riches, he says, are increasingly going to a business class, not to nobility.
"Despite our customers being very wealthy, they demand an absolute value for their money," Mr. Morris said. "They didn't become wealthy by throwing their money away." Microsoft's Bill Gates, who drives Porsches and not yet Rolls-Royces, is famous for flying economy class.
"They really want to know what the car will do and how it will handle," said Roger J. Miller, general manager of Rolls-Royce of Beverly Hills, where sales to executives -- largely those from computer companies -- are up 30 percent from a decade ago.
The boom in business buyers isn't just in this country. One of the best markets for Rolls-Royce has been Hong Kong, where sales have been strong all year. "A lot of rich and influential Chinese are coming over the border," Mr. Morris explained. "Long may that go on."
Indeed, some say the changing tastes in cars may reflect democracy's triumph over communism. "The fundamental change is the victory of capitalism and the respectability that financial success has gained," said Mr. Chajet. "Capitalism has really won."
Perhaps that depends on how you measure it. The 1961 Rolls-Royce Phantom that belonged to Hong Kong's former colonial Governor, Chris Patten, is on its way back to the United Kingdom. At best, it will be relegated to a museum. At worst, it will be sold as a used car.

HEADLINE: Word for Word/Republican Remedies;
Speak Less Loudly And Stop Calling the Speaker 'Newt'

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AFTER the election of 1994, President Clinton sank into despair as Republicans took control of Congress. But ever since a resurgent Mr. Clinton won re-election last year, it is the Republicans who have been suffering through a crisis of confidence.
Now self-flagellation is practically their favorite sport. For a year, debate has reverberated through the party ranks and the conservative intelligentsia: Was the loss of 1996 the fault of an uncompromising right wing? Was a tongue-tied, aging, Establishment candidate the problem? Was the party outmaneuvered by a Democratic President who stole its issues? Maybe moderates were to blame. Or how about the tide of history, which left conservatives looking for a new rationale after the cold war? 
 At least one Republican strategist thinks it's time to move on. Several months ago, Frank Luntz, the wunderkind consultant who helped draft the "Contract With America," sent Republicans in Congress an unsolicited, 222-page advice manual-cum-pep talk that began, "For all those who have complained that we have no 'message,' this book was written for you."
Here are excerpts from the prologue of his treatise, "The Language of the 21st Century," instructing Republicans on how to connect with the American public. ALISON MITCHELL
When I was a child, my mother had a Portuguese maid named Maria who came to clean our house once a week. She was a strong, kindly woman who never missed a day of work and really loved my family. The only problem was, she didn't speak a word of English.
For 10 years I witnessed the same routine every Tuesday morning. She would arrive at 7 A.M. sharp. My mom would meet her at the door and explain in English exactly what she wanted done. Maria would look at her quizzically and shrug her shoulders, prompting my mom to repeat her words exactly as before -- only much louder. This would go on week after week, until finally I said, "Mom, she's not deaf. She just doesn't understand English."
The Republican Party in 1997 is just like my mom. Every time Republicans get into a conflict with the President, you begin to shout, mistakenly believing that if you speak loudly enough, your message will get through. But the American people aren't deaf. They simply don't understand what you're saying or understand its relevance to their day-to-day lives.
You have suffered through communication disaster after communication disaster, and nothing ever seems to change. Task forces, rapid response teams, truth squads and other structural fixes have not addressed the more fundamental and potentially fatal problem: Linguistically, you are out of touch with the American people. They really think Bill Clinton feels their pain, and they really think you feel nothing.
To make his point, Mr. Luntz cited the spring standoff in which Republicans attached miscellaneous political measures to a disaster relief bill, prompting Mr. Clinton to veto aid to flood victims. Hurt by the ensuing public uproar, Republicans backed down and passed the relief bill unencumbered:
The disaster relief disaster was just the latest wake-up call. Telling everyone you failed to communicate effectively is not effective communication. A thorough change in language and emphasis is long overdue. The following should help you communicate in language that is soothing to the American ear.
Mr. Luntz then lists a dozen points:
1. Principles are more important than policy or politics. The hallowed halls of Washington echo with the sounds of Republican actors and activists clamoring for a new agenda. Yet in my weekly forays into real America, I have found that average Americans could not care less about agenda politics. Americans aren't searching for an agenda. They're looking for principles and the politicians who exhibit them. The way to convince a cynical populace that you deserve their support is to demonstrate that you are standing up for principle, not that you are loyal to a cause.
2. Try going five minutes selling Republican ideas and principles without criticizing Bill Clinton or the Democrats. Sure it's more fun to attack the opposition, particularly when they are so wrong, but the American people have had enough of all the bickering. . . . Remember, mud splatters, and every time you attack, you soil yourself as well.
3. Stop overselling your achievements. You may not want to hear this, but almost no one outside of the Beltway (or on Capitol Hill for that matter) thinks the recent budget and tax agreements are home runs. Why are you selling them that way?
4. Stop being defensive. Instead of talking about recent strategic failures, talk about the principles you have attempted to defend. For example, if the topic is your attempt to avoid a Government shutdown, ONLY talk about "getting your message across," "end games" and "doing a better job explaining things" IN PRIVATE. In public, you should instead talk about the PRINCIPLES of "working together," "listening to the people," "making the government run more effectively and less expensively" and so on. Americans want to know your motives. Only journalists want to know your tactics.
5. Appeal directly to the voter. You know just how overtaxed Americans feel they are. . . . You know how much money Americans feel is wasted by Washington. Appeal to that emotion. Republican leaders have to attack the President from time to time, but if you want to be effective, get the American people on your side rhetorically BEFORE you launch.
6. Embrace the moral agenda. Four out of five Americans believe that our country is facing a moral crisis, yet too many Republicans judge the health of America by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. They are missing the sickness in the soul of our nation. You cannot shy away from discussing values. In fact you should embrace them. . . . America is in danger of winning the whole world -- economically, militarily, ideologically -- and losing her soul.
7. Abolish the National Endowment for the Arts. This makes sense for strategic reasons as well as on principle. Napoleon spoke of the importance of feeding your army if you expect your soldiers to go off to battle. You must deliver some nourishment to the true believers. The budget and tax agreements aren't going to drive social conservatives to the polls on Election Day. You need a symbol that both differentiates the two parties and stirs up the troops. If you truly believe in shrinking Washington and returning power (and money) to local authorities, start with the arts.
8. Start a national-local education partnership. Newt Gingrich's greatest accomplishment in the 104th Congress was shepherding welfare reform through Congress. Without the support, participation and political capital of the 32 Republican governors, welfare reform would still be on the shelf. The Speaker and the Senate majority leader need to adopt the same strategy in the education reform effort and that requires turning over the education debate to the governors.
9. End Washington-mandated affirmative action now. If welfare reform was the Speaker's crowning achievement, his unwillingness to abolish Federal affirmative action laws has been his biggest mistake.
10. If you want to focus on policy rather than politics, stop talking about politics. The only people who follow the internal struggles of the Congressional leadership are the players themselves. If you don't want the media to focus on internecine warfare, stop answering questions on the subject. Better yet, change the subject.
11. Stop calling the Speaker "Newt." The elected office generally holds a greater deal of respect than the man or woman who is temporary custodian of that title. That's why you never hear Bill Clinton's advisers or Cabinet officers referring to him by name (much less his first name). It's always "the President." If you really want to help restore Newt Gingrich's credibility, start referring to him by his title.
12. Stop stacking votes. For three straight years, Republicans have missed countless opportunities to receive deserved credit for passing popular legislation because they have held multiple high-profile votes in the same week. Take a lesson from Presidents Reagan and Clinton. Any more than one theme -- or one major vote -- at a time will be lost on the American people.
Before he launched into pages more of advice, Mr. Luntz said: "We don't need a Contract II or an Agenda 2000. We simply need to stop the name-calling and talk about principles."

Maybe a Bankrupt Nation Isn't The Worst Thing in the World

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN political systems collapse, the United Nations now routinely arrives to glue things together and organize or monitor elections, whether the problem erupts in Cambodia, Angola or Mozambique. When currencies collapse, the International Monetary Fund shows up. Its team of experts parachutes in, often followed by billions in loans to restore the confidence of international investors who suddenly discovered, to their shock, that last week's emerging market is this week's submerging one.
Mexico was the patient two years ago, but the lessons of its debacle never fully sank in around the globe. This summer the Philippines and Thailand got the treatment, and last week Indonesia became the latest to call for help. Lost in all the headlines about rescue packages, though, is a question that many American officials are quietly raising around the world: Does it always make sense to save countries and their investors from dumb mistakes? Put another way, has the knowledge that the world will not let countries fail actually encouraged investors to lend their money cheaply to almost anyone, even to countries that overbuild, overspend and, in cases like Mexico and Indonesia, make corruption a national sport? 
 "This may be the toughest issue we face today, and we're wrestling with it every day," Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the I.M.F., said the other day between meetings about how to prop up Indonesia's fragmenting banking system.
 
World to the Rescue
 Naturally, politicians hate coming to the I.M.F. for help. Not only is it embarrassing, but the aid usually comes with strings attached, forcing the countries to reveal uncomfortable financial details and to discipline their economies.
But investors, even small investors who funnel cash into developing-country mutual funds, "probably take some comfort from the possibility that if in trouble, countries can borrow from the I.M.F.," Mr. Fischer said.
That is a polite way of saying that every time the world saves a country -- not just from huge crises like the one that hit Mexico but also from milder growing pains like those that took the roar out of the Asian tigers -- it also saves the big-time investors from paying a steep price for putting their money in the wrong place. The austerity program the Mexican Government put in place when its economy faltered was a devastating blow to the country's working poor, but the big investors emerged largely unscathed. The immediate goal of the United States and the I.M.F., which together led the $50 billion bailout plan, was to insure that the Mexicans did not default on their debts -- so that one day soon they could once again borrow on world markets. That day arrived quickly, and the country has repaid most of its loans.
So by most measures the Mexican bailout was such a success that, perversely, it sent the wrong message to international investors. "Would I have liked to figure out a way to save Mexico and still make the investors take a haircut?" Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin asked rhetorically not long ago. "Yes, I would have. The problem is, we have not figured out an effective way to do that yet."
Investors, however, have not been spared all the pain. If your broker suggested a few mutual funds last year that buy up the stocks of Malaysian and Thai firms, you definitely winced as their currencies dropped in value by a third. But the big investment houses that lent money to those countries' wildly overextended and underregulated banks have barely suffered at all. Nations don't like their banks to fail, so they bail them out, as the United States did in the savings and loan scandals, and as Japan did when its inflated property market was found to be built like a house of cards.
Part of the problem is that far more countries can borrow money on international markets than ever before. Lawrence Summers, Mr. Rubin's deputy, noted in a speech recently that five years ago only 16 countries could borrow money on the global capital markets. Today, 56 countries can, and "that has spurred much of the rapid growth seen around the world," Mr. Summers said. The question, he added, is "whether borrower and lenders recognize that returns do not come without risks."
 
An Energetic Tango
 Look at Argentina, which President Clinton will visit this week to celebrate the sweep of capitalism and democracy throughout Latin America. For most of the past half century, Argentina was a hyperinflating wasteland. In the last six or seven years, it has been a success story; such a success story that when Argentina issues a 10-year global bond these days, which is the standard way of borrowing money from investors around the world, it offers to pay them an interest rate that is only two-and-a-quarter points above what investors receive for comparable United States Treasury bonds. Not only Argentina delights in borrowing cheaply. So does Russia -- and so does Albania.
Those interest-rate differences -- what investors call the spread between United States Treasury bonds and those issued by another nation -- represent the market's risk assessment of whether the country will pay up. And over the past few years, the size of those spreads has gradually diminished, a sign that investors think the risk is also diminishing. Partly, that is the I.M.F. effect. And it has its costs: When countries can borrow cheaply, they are less likely to reform their economies.
This could be more evidence, of course, of worldwide prosperity, and confidence that it will continue. But it may also be a sign of what Alan Greenspan called irrational exuberance, applied on a global scale. One day, a rescue plan may fail.

HEADLINE: Tighter Borders Also Keeping Illegal Immigrants in the U.S.

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 11

 BODY:
A study of California's agricultural communities concludes that illegal immigrants working in the United States stay in this country instead of returning to their homelands because of fears about tightened security at the Mexican border.
The study, titled "Poverty Amid Prosperity," was released on Thursday by the Urban Institute, a research group in Washington. 
 It found that the illegal immigrants make up 40 percent of the California farm work force today, compared with under 10 percent in 1990, after the amnesty program of the late 1980's. The percentage continues to grow, the study found.
"People are still getting in through the border, and because it's tougher to get back in once they leave, they're staying longer," said a co-author of the study, Philip L. Martin, an economist at the University of California at Davis.
In the past decade, the Federal Government has more than doubled Border Patrol forces at the border while using more enforcement money and hardware than ever before, from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. But increased enforcement has driven prices charged by smugglers higher while pushing illegal immigrant traffic away from thoroughly policed hubs like San Diego to the deserts and mountains to the east, where Border Patrol ranks are stretched thin.
Some officials concede that the building pressure has served to turn temporary illegal immigrants into permanent residents.
"It's a predictable response," said Eric Andrus, spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who considered the phenomenon evidence of success at the border. "This is another sign that our efforts to control the border are working."

HEADLINE: Critics Say Clinton Panel About Race Lacks Focus

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Three months after President Clinton appointed a seven-member advisory board to help develop a national dialogue on race, the initiative is being criticized for its slow start and lack of focus. Some critics say the board's desultory beginning even raises the question of whether the White House is using the panel to duck, rather than confront, the country's thorny racial issues.
Advocates, writers and academics involved in race relations issues -- both on the right and on the left -- have in recent days expressed disappointment with Mr. Clinton's Initiative on Race and Reconciliation. They say that the panel has already frittered away a quarter of its yearlong deadline and has yet to decide which of the myriad issues that deal with race it will tackle. 
 "It's rudderless," said Ward Connerly, a member of the University of California Board of Regents who has emerged as a leader in the fight against race-based preferences.
"There is a shared sense that it's got to have some focus and take on some of the tough issues in the area of race," said Hugh Price, president of the National Urban League. "It's got to aim to do something."
Conservatives say that by avoiding affirmative action the panel is sidestepping the most explosive racial issue. And some liberals say that the panel's slow start is giving an impression that the body is little more than a veneer to cover White House indifference to racial issues.
Roger Wilkins, a professor of history at George Mason University, said the President's greatest risk is to start an effort and then not follow through. "If that happens," he said, "then people will say, even on race, where he is supposed to have some genuine feeling, when the rubber hits the road, Bill Clinton wasn't serious."
Members of the advisory board and its staff acknowledge the effort's slow start and the criticism it has drawn. "I am not surprised there is a degree of impatience about what we're doing and how fast we're doing it," said Judith Winston, the board's staff director.
While saying that the criticism is premature, some board and staff members also acknowledge that they have been hampered by a lack of direction from the Administration.
"We are dependent on direction from the White House as to where we should be going," said Thomas H. Kean, a board member and former Republican Governor of New Jersey. Conservatives who disagree with Mr. Clinton on hot-button racial issues like affirmative action tend to be much more dismissive, pointing out that the panel's makeup does not include people who question race-based preference programs.
"If you want to do a serious commission, you need to get a variety of voices," said Abigail Thernstrom, a co-author with her husband, Stephan, of "America in Black and White: One Nation, Indivisible" and a critic of affirmative action. "It's monologue. Let's have a dialogue."
But liberals, who were hopeful that the panel's work would lead to better race relations, say its lack of focus reflects a lack of commitment by Mr. Clinton. They compare the board's work with the Administration's sharp focus on issues like free trade agreements with Latin America. "I think what people are sensing now is a lack of energy," Mr. Wilkins said.
White House officials recently have taken steps to try to better coordinate the panel's efforts. On Friday Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff, convened a meeting with senior members of the President's staff to urge them to take the matter more seriously. At the meeting, it was decided that people like Gene Sperling, head of the National Economic Council; Bruce Reid, a senior adviser to the President; Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, and others would begin to work regularly with the staff of the advisory board.
Though Mr. Clinton announced the formation of the board, headed by John Hope Franklin, in a speech in San Diego in mid-June, the White House did not have a staff ready to step in to do the nitty-gritty research that such an effort requires. Indeed, the board's staff director, Ms. Winston, was not appointed until the first week in August and has only in the last few weeks assembled a staff.
Aware that the work has gotten off to a slow start, White House officials now say that the one-year deadline could be extended.
Ms. Winston said that staff and board members are starting to work more efficiently. Individual board members have been looking at places that are successfully grappling with racial issues and hope to be able to recommend to Mr. Clinton ways those efforts can be duplicated.
"It's not how you start, it's how you finish," Ms. Winston said. "I think that on this issue to have a series of false starts would be more damning than starting slow and doing it right."

HEADLINE: Dairy Farmers' Woes Grow by the Gallon;
Milk Producers See a Way of Life Threatened by Lagging Prices and Rising Costs

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

DATELINE: CANAJOHARIE, N.Y.

 BODY:
As it often does in the fall, the price of milk at the grocery store is going up by as much as 25 cents a gallon in some parts of the New York metropolitan area.
That ought to be good news in the rolling hills of dairy country west of Albany. Instead, here, as in dairy areas across New York State, New Jersey, Connecticut and much of the rest of the nation, dairy farmers are saying that what little they will see of the money will be too little and too late. 
 The price farmers are paid for their milk is as low as it was a decade ago. But the cost of running a dairy farm has climbed. The result, according to government and private estimates, is that an average dairy farmer in the New York region is now paid less for a gallon of milk than it costs to produce that amount.
That money-losing formula means that in places where dairy farming is not just the biggest industry but a way of life, people are beginning to speak of a new farm crisis. In dairy areas like this one in Montgomery County, merchants and bankers say a ripple effect of farm failures and faltering local economies is worse than anything they have seen in decades, even though people in urban America have not seemed to notice.
Donald R. Davidsen, New York State's Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, said the financial stresses could force as many as 1,000 of New York's 9,000 dairy farms out of business. In New Jersey, Art Brown Jr., the Secretary of Agriculture, said the state could lose 50 of about 215 remaining dairy farms.
Shirley Ferris, the Commissioner of Agriculture in Connecticut, did the math. "Dairy farmers are getting the same amount for their milk as they did 10 years ago, but the cost of everything they have to buy has quadrupled," she said. "I don't need to say any more."
Dairy farms have been vanishing for much of this century, and farmers' complaints are so familiar that some milk distributors and consumer advocates dismiss the current anxiety as little more than a new round of lobbying for higher prices.
But government and academic experts say the financial crisis in many dairy regions is more urgent than it has been in years. "Farmers are feeling powerless to do anything about it," said Andrew Novakovic, an expert on dairy issues who is chairman of the agricultural, resource and managerial economics department at Cornell University.
Estimates of farm production costs by farm credit agencies so far this year suggest that the average dairy farm in New York and New Jersey has lost about 14 cents for every gallon of milk. Connecticut farmers have lost about 3 cents.
Here in Montgomery County, where the 237 dairy farms are important institutions in the lives of its 50,000 residents, the mood among farmers is desperate. "I don't think people understand, and I don't think they care as long as there's milk on the shelf when they go into the store," Christine Nellis said as she took a break from the 5 A.M. to 7 P.M. schedule she keeps on the dairy farm she works with her husband.
To nods of agreement from other dairy farmers around a neighbor's kitchen table, Mrs. Nellis said she once believed that sophisticated management would allow good farm managers to prevail. Now, she said, as every gallon she sells increases her losses, she no longer believes that. After a year of backbreaking labor, she said, she and her husband broke even last year.
The price that farmers are paid for their milk fell this summer partly because of an oversupply of milk nationally and partly because of new Federal policies intended to remove Government price supports. Agricultural experts say the prices paid to farmers are likely to remain low.
Commissioner Davidsen of New York said increased dairy farm failures could shift one of the region's oldest industries to other parts of the country. But perhaps of broader interest, he said, is that dairy farm failures would open to development vast new tracts of farm land that have provided a bucolic buffer around the region's cities. The number of dairy farms in New York State has slipped to 9,000 from 14,500 in 1987.
One effort at easing dairy farm distress is the Northeast Dairy Compact, a federally approved program in the six New England states: Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. The Federal law permitting the compact allows a commission to set a milk price that is higher than the price farmers would receive otherwise. Without the compact, the farm price is set according to a formula that links the price of milk to the price of cheese.
In Connecticut, farmers received an additional 11 cents a gallon in July, the first month the compact was in force. Some farmers here in eastern New York State who ship their milk to New England are receiving the higher price.
Critics call the compact a legal cartel. State officials in Connecticutcalculate that it has cost consumers at least 20 cents a gallon because the higher prices were passed on to consumers. In September, the average price of a gallon of whole milk was $2.90 in Connecticut. In the New York City area, it was $2.53. In northern New Jersey, it was $2.70.
Some farmers are pressuring New York State to join the compact. Farmers are sharply divided on the issue, however, with some saying they would fight any new form of regulation. The State Legislature, which would have to vote on the compact, has not been enthusiastic about the proposal in the past.
But even among farmers in Connecticut and those here in eastern New York who have been receiving the additional 11 cents a gallon, the compact has hardly been greeted as the solution to their problems. Many say it is little more than a Band-Aid that perpetuates an image of dairy interests squeezing consumers.
Some farmers who have been receiving the additional 11 cents say it is not enough to make them solvent. Eleven of Connecticut's 270 dairy farms have folded this year.
In Canajoharie, David Caldwell, 55, is lucky. His 35-cow farm sells to a distributor that ships milk to New England, so he has been getting the extra 11 cents.
The added money, he said, helps but is not enough to stop the financial drain. Mr. Caldwell said his finances have deteriorated every year since he moved to the farm with his wife and four children in 1981. Last year, he said, he declared a gross income of $6,000 on his tax return. "Any other investment you can sell," he said. "What do you do, put an ad in the paper: 'Losing Farm for Sale'?"
Such stories do not move everyone. In Brooklyn, Henry Beyer, president of a milk wholesaler in New York City, Beyer Farms Inc., said that even if the region's smaller farmers were losing their place to bigger producers outside the region, that was only economics at work.
"If they're inefficient and they're small and they're going to go out of business, that doesn't mean the consumer should subsidize them," said Mr. Beyer, who is a spokesman for New York State Dairy Foods Inc., a trade group of milk wholesalers and processors.
But around the kitchen table at Mike Cole's dairy farm here, farmers made dire predictions. "I can't make ends meet," Mrs. Nellis said as other farmers agreed. "And that will catch up with me and it will be devastating."
Many in Montgomery County are convinced of the dairy farmers' predicament and its effect on them.
Donald L. Brass, the chief executive of Central National Bank of Canajoharie, said rising costs and sliding milk prices have caused great anxiety for the farmers and the bank. He said the bank, which has been a major farm lender for more than a century, had never seen so many of its customers so close to being unable to repay their loans.
At Randall Implement Company, which sells dairy farm machinery here, the owner, Robert Freeman, said that in 31 years in business he had not seen so many customers late with their payments or in default. One salesmen, he said, used to call on 40 dairy farms. Of those, he said, 8 folded this summer.
Mr. Freeman said he had seen many ups and downs for dairy farmers. But now, he said, "I think the spirit's broke. Or it's bent awfully bad. And that's the scary part. Farmers are resilient. But I've never seen it as bad."

HEADLINE: Report Says Health of Society Lags Behind That of Economy

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
An annual analysis of 16 social indicators shows the nation's social health is improving, but noted that this was only the second time in seven years that such an improvement has been seen.
The analysis, the Index of Social Health, is produced by the Fordham Institute for Innovation in Social Policy in Tarrytown, N.Y. It is constructed on the model of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, combining statistics from a number of areas, from drug abuse to average wages. 
 "Although any improvement is a good sign," said Marc L. Miringoff, the institute's director, "the overall picture in the 1990's is not very encouraging. Of the eight worst years since 1970, six have been in this decade. The social health of the nation has not kept up with the recovery of the economy."
The first such report, produced in 1985, used statistics dating to 1970 and found that the nation's best year during that period was 1973, with an index of 77.5 out of a possible 100. Since then, the worst year has been 1994, when the index hit 37.5. This year's report analyzed figures from 1995, yielding an index of 40.
The six indicators from 1995 that showed improvement were the percentage of children in poverty, unemployment, poverty among the elderly, homicides, the gap between rich and poor, and alcohol-related traffic fatalities. Those worsening were health insurance coverage, drug abuse, average wages, the percentage of high school dropouts and food stamp coverage.
Indicators that remained about the same were teen-age suicide, out-of-pocket health costs for the elderly, access to affordable housing, infant mortality and child abuse.
In a special section, the report analyzed long-term trends in two indicators: wages and health insurance coverage. Average weekly pay hit a peak, in constant dollars, of $315 in 1973, and was $256 in 1996.
"From the end of World War II to 1973, American wages increased virtually every year," the report said. "From 1973 to the present, wages either declined or stagnated."
And the report put the number of Americans without health insurance at 40.6 million, an increase of 41 percent since 1976.
"These trends in wages and health insurance tell us much about our basic condition," Mr. Miringoff said. "Like poor test results from the doctor, they are a warning sign."
The United States, the institute says, is the only industrialized nation that does not officially monitor overall social progress, although economic analysis is comprehensive.
The report took special note of the growing gap between the nation's economic and social well-being. "The fact that trends in Gross Domestic Product and social health, once so similar, have consistently diverged for so long a period of time supports the idea that the Gross Domestic Product along does not tell as much as it once did about the condition of the nation," the report concluded.

HEADLINE: Golf Is Carving a Place in Colorado's Ski Country

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: CARBONDALE, Colo.

 BODY:
With a perfect swing, Jack Nicklaus recently sent a golf ball arcing through the thin mountain air, past a sylvan backdrop of golden aspen leaves, a languid trout stream and the granite mass of Mount Sipris.
"When I first came up here, in 1975, there was basically one public golf course in the Vail valley and another in this valley," said Mr. Nicklaus, the golf professional and golf-course architect, after inaugurating Aspen Glen, a course in the Aspen valley. "Now I have two in each valley." 
 In Colorado's high country, golf is experiencing in the 1990's the kind of explosive growth that skiing had in the 1960's. Though no new ski areas have opened in Colorado since 1982, the number of golf courses in the Vail and Aspen valleys has quadrupled, to 20 from 5. Along Aspen's 42-mile-long river valley, golf courses are opening at the rate of one a year.
Critics say this march of the golf courses is accentuating class divisions. As real estate prices soar, workers face longer and longer commutes to jobs in the gold-plated resort towns. In addition, most of the new courses are private, doing little to lure vacationers who could help the ski-town hotels fill rooms in the summer and fall.
But with private golf clubs charging initiation fees of up to $100,000 and greens fees as high as $195 a round, the demand for memberships has led developers to plan a total of 10 more private courses in both valleys in the next decade.
Only 2 of Vail valley's 11 courses are open to the public. The rest are private centerpieces of luxury second-home developments like Aspen Glen, a former 964-acre cattle ranch where empty quarter-acre lots on the Roaring Fork River sell for $575,000.
"There are days when we will turn away more golfers than we will take in," said Ken Everett, director of the Snowmass Lodge and Club, a public course near here.
In addition to trying to balance summer-winter resort economies, the mountain golfing boom has been attributed to the aging of baby boomers, the longer golfing seasons in the mountains and the fact that golf balls travel about 12 percent farther at 6,000 feet than at sea level.
In the old days, the 1970's, golfing seasons ran from Memorial Day to early October, and the courses were mostly at the bases of ski areas like Aspen, Copper, Keystone and Vail.
But the new courses are being built in the "banana belts" -- the valley areas that are often 1,500 feet lower than the ski towns. The dream of Colorado's amateur athletes -- ski in the morning, golf in the afternoon -- is now a springtime reality in the Rockies.
"We are almost 100 days longer in terms of golfable days than they are at the Vail golf courses," said Fred Kummer, who is planning a development with 36 holes of golf about 40 minutes west of Vail. "The lower we get in elevation, the longer the seasons we can have."
The experience of Mr. Kummer, the owner of Colorado's largest hotel, the Adam's Mark of Denver, is an example of Colorado's gradual shift in resort development to golf from skiing.
Almost 30 years ago, he started petitioning the Forest Service for a permit to build a ski area on Federal land adjoining 5,000 acres he owned. Although the permit was issued in 1981, wrangling with environmentalists and having to get more government approvals delayed the project until Mr. Kummer finally gave up last May.
Now, building only on his own land, Mr. Kummer said he hoped to start construction in a year on a development with three golf courses, a 125-room hotel and 1,270 houses.
"The difference is that the golf courses are all built on private land," Mr. Kummer said of the boom in the number of courses. In Colorado, almost all ski areas are built on Forest Service land. Though no new ski areas have opened in Colorado in the last 15 years, the acreage of ski slopes increased by 43 percent and the number of days spent skiing in the state increased by 56 percent.
Colorado's rush to the greens can be seen in Carbondale, once a gritty coal miner's town, 30 miles from Aspen.
"In two months, we sold 36 lots, with only 10 left to go," said David A. Burden, president of The Melrose Company/West, the developer of Aspen Glen. When completed, the community will hold 630 luxury homes.
Charles L. Cunniffe, the lead architect for houses in Aspen Glen, said of the buyers: "They are coming from everywhere. England, Belgium, across the United States."
As a reflection of how the Colorado Rockies are now part of the world economy, the initiation fees charged by some private golf clubs are more than double the fees charged by the Denver Country Club, the most exclusive golf club in the state's largest city.
"The market is there," said Richard A. Kirk, president of the Denver Country Club. "They can charge that amount." A weekend resident of Carbondale, Mr. Kirk owns a lot at Aspen Glen.
But the exclusivity bothers some Coloradans.
"The average family does not have access, so we only mention golf in passing in our summer marketing," said M. Ross Boyle, chairman of the Vail Valley Marketing Board, a regional promotional group.
More public golf courses should be the next step in the Rockies, argued Warren Simmons, executive director of the Colorado Golf Association, a private group that represents state golfers and golf courses.
"We don't necessarily need to build these heroic monuments to the golf architects," Mr. Simmons said. "They probably have pretty well tapped the existing high rollers. Affordable golf in the mountains need not be an oxymoron."
Another line of criticism comes from residents who say that the hundreds of millions of dollars being funneled into gated golf-course developments are widening income disparities.
In Carbondale, once considered a working-class satellite of Aspen, the average price of a single-family home has jumped to $220,000 from $90,000 in a decade. When Aspen Glen and a second golf community here, Roaring Fork, are completed, they will add about 1,250 houses with an average price of nearly $1 million to this town of 3,500 people. In addition, the communities will contain about 65 houses for lower- and middle-income families.
"Wages are not keeping up with living costs," said Mike Chamness, a Carbondale bartender and artist who is also chairman of the Green Party of Colorado. "What we need around here is more employee housing, more affordable housing in general."
But as developers scout nearby mesas for more golf courses, they seem confident that the nation's demographics are on their side. Members of the baby boom, a generation of unprecedented affluence, are moving through middle age.
Still spry after 18 holes of golf at 6,200 feet, Mr. Nicklaus, 57, expressed his generation's growing wariness of skiing: "I can't afford to be laid up for six months. I don't want to break bones."

HEADLINE: Cuba's Communists Peer Ahead, Then Opt to March in Place

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Faced with the uncomfortable options of moving ahead or turning back, Cuba's Communist Party has seemingly opted to do neither.
At a three-day party congress that ended here late Friday with chants of "Fi-del! Fi-del!," President Fidel Castro and his advisers and followers endorsed policies intended to maintain the status quo for as long as possible. 
 Since the party hierarchy last gathered, in 1991, sheer necessity has forced Mr. Castro to seek foreign investment in state companies, allow some limited self-employment and permit the use of the dollar as a parallel currency. The party congress approved all of those moves, but balked at taking further steps that might open up the economy or reduce Government control.
"The state continues having the guiding capacity in directing the economy, and under any formula, therefore, its interests will be adequately represented," proclaims the economic policy statement the congress approved. The document, in its draft form, also supports "space for the functioning of market mechanisms under state regulation" and speaks of the need to "avoid monopolistic prices and unjustifiable profits" that might result from a faster economic opening.
Since returning from a visit to China late in 1995, Mr. Castro has spoken admiringly to visitors about the results of economic changes there and the prosperity they have generated.
But in his closing address to the congress here, he made it clear that he opposed privatizing state enterprises, a step ordered by the Chinese party at its congress last month, or allowing workers who might lose jobs by such an action to set up businesses of their own.
"We have no reason to create millionaires, to create enormous inequalities," Mr. Castro said. As Marxist-Leninists, he added, "we fight not to create individual millionaires, but to make the citizenry as a whole into millionaires."
At a news conference the day before the congress opened, Esteban Lazo Hernandez, the party secretary for Havana and a member of the Politburo, said Cuba could not take the same path as China because "conditions are completely different" here. The Chinese have "an economy based in the countryside," he said, and "there is also a difference of magnitude" that permits China more latitude to experiment economically.
"If we take these steps, how can we keep health, education and public welfare free?" Mr. Lazo asked. "That comes out of the profits of state enterprises."
In addition, he said, China does not have to contend with the hostility of the United States. While some economic experimentation is worth considering, he said, "the blockade and the effort to drown us don't permit that right now."
In Washington, James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said the tone of the party congress here conveyed "a sense of a certain time warp." Mr. Rubin told reporters who inquired about Mr. Castro's address, which lasted 6 hours and 43 minutes, that "no matter how many times you play the same old movie, it's not going to change the desires and the needs of the people of the modern world."
Despite growing concerns outside Cuba about a lack of mechanisms to groom possible successors to Mr. Castro, the party proved nearly as cautious on matters of personnel and leadership as in dealing with the economy.
Though eight people were dropped in the reshaping of the Politburo, the party's most powerful deliberative body, its ideological composition and balance of power remain largely unchanged, political analysts here said.
Most of those removed are members of the generation that took power with Mr. Castro in 1959, so-called "historicos" like Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, who is 84, and Osmany Cienfuegos, another longtime associate.
But also stripped of their posts were Nelson Torres, who as Minister of Sugar is regarded as responsible for the failure of this year's harvest, and Jorge Lezcano, party secretary in Havana when the rafter refugee crisis erupted in 1994.
The six new members include several such technocrats and party bureaucrats. Jorge Luis Sierra, a 40-ish provincial party secretary who was among those promoted, described the final result as "a mixture of generations." But a diplomat here noted that the authority of all of the newcomers "derives directly from Fidel" and predicted they would be followers rather than innovators, at least initially.
Mr. Castro also made a point of reaffirming that his younger brother, Raul, 66, the Minister of Defense and the party's longtime No. 2 leader, remains his designated successor. The continued presence of Raul Castro, whom he described as his "backup" or "relief pitcher," "gives us great tranquillity and continuity," he said.
In a somewhat surprising move, the party's Central Committee was reduced from 225 members to 150. Raul Castro explained the streamlining, which diplomats said would enhance the power of the Castro brothers, by saying that membership in the body should be based "not only on representativeness but skill."
But the younger Mr. Castro also expressed concerns about ideological purity. It was necessary, he said, to "elect a Central Committee that will keep the revolution immune from ideological viruses" so what occurred in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the late 1980's would not be repeated here.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 13, 1997, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the Communist Party Congress in Cuba misidentified two officials in some copies. The party secretary for Havana is Esteban Lazo Hernandez, not Esteban Lazo Cardenas. A new Politburo member is Jorge Luis Sierra, not Jose Luis Sierra.

Rate of Property Crimes Is at a 17-Year Low in U.S.
With little public notice, property crime in the United States has fallen sharply since 1980, data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation show, with burglary rates down by almost half. That gives New York a lower burglary rate than London, and Los Angeles fewer burglaries than Sydney, Australia. 1

It is easy to forget what an unusual political road Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, traveled to arrive at this: running for Mayor as the Democratic nominee, with moderate viewpoints and seasoned handlers. But for those who wonder how she presses forward in the face of long odds or why many Democrats have defected to her Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a partial answer lies in that journey. Ms. Messinger has always been something of an insurgent, an outsider who never fully found her way in. 1

HEADLINE: Search for Libyan's Fate Leaves Wife in Disbelief

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Libya's leading dissident, Mansour Kikhia, was by all accounts in a pretty good mood on the night he disappeared nearly four years ago.
A scholar and former diplomat, Mr. Kikhia was in Cairo to attend a meeting of an Arab human rights group he helped found. He was four months away from getting his American citizenship and, at 62, was looking forward to abandoning political work for a life of comfortable serenity in Washington. 
 That much his wife, Baha, knows. She also knows that he drank coffee with a Libyan emissary in the plush lobby of Al Safir Hotel, where he was staying, and that he left the leafy Cairo neighborhood with an unidentified man for a meeting with a Libyan ambassador. A diabetic, her husband intended to return soon; he had left his insulin-injection kit by his hotel bed.
Since that night, on Dec. 10, 1993, Mrs. Kikhia, who is an American citizen, has relentlessly tried to track the other facts surrounding her husband's disappearance in a search that has taken her to three continents.
The pursuit has included meetings with President Clinton and his national security adviser at the time, Anthony Lake; with her husband's nemesis, the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and with scores of senior intelligence and State Department officials in Washington, as well as top Egyptian, French and Libyan decision-makers in Cairo, Paris and Tripoli.
But after almost four years of searching, Mrs. Kikhia contends, she has learned only one thing for sure: she is getting the runaround.
The Governments of the United States, Libya, Egypt and France, all acting out of competing interests, she says, know a lot more about what happened to her husband than they are willing to tell.
"I just want to know the truth," she said on Thursday in an interview, which she said was intended to pressure all the parties to reveal what they know. "I don't want to play politics any longer."
"I don't care how it happened as long as I find out what happened," she said. "But the Egyptians are lying about their role, the Americans are telling part of the truth and trying not to embarrass their Egyptian allies, and the French intelligence tells me he was, until 1995, alive and had several meetings with Qaddafi. The Libyans say they know nothing about the whole thing."
"All these stories are not convincing. I would like now for the law to take its course," she added, and said that she was planning to file suit.
Mr. Kikhia served Colonel Qaddafi as a trouble-shooter, Foreign Minister and United Nations delegate, until he broke with the regime in 1981 and led the opposition to the Colonel.
Having just returned from her fifth visit to Libya, Mrs. Kikhia said she is convinced that her husband is alive and remains under detention there.
She prefers to remain hopeful, she said, despite a visit to her home in Vienna, Va., on Aug. 26 by two State Department officials who delivered parts of a four-month investigation by the Central Intelligence Agency. The report concluded that Mr. Kikhia was abducted in Cairo with the help of Egyptian agents, who turned him over to Libyan counterparts, and that he was executed in 1994, shortly after his forced return to Libya.
"We learned this summer and developed credible information that Mr. Kikhia is dead and was murdered in Libya," the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said when asked about the report.
"We so informed his family and raised the matter with the Egyptian Government, because we had some indication of involvement by Egyptian officials in the matter," he said. "We are insisting on a full investigation by the Egyptians and we are determined to get to the bottom of this case."
Revealing the conflicting pressures placed on her by the many governments who have competed to promote their own interpretation of the disappearance, Mrs. Kikhia said that she was pressured by the State Department to publicize the C.I.A. report at a news conference, but that she resisted. The United States, she said, wanted to take advantage of the report to press its point that Libya sponsors terrorism.
"I just don't want to be used by anyone and certainly do not want to do further harm to Mansour if he is alive," she said in the interview.
She said the two State Department officials told her that if she failed to publicize the C.I.A. report it would end up in The Washington Post. And indeed she discovered last month, while in Libya, that details of the report had been published in the newspaper.
"I don't want to blame anyone," she said. "If he is dead, I have not seen enough evidence to confirm it. The way information is communicated to me seems designed to serve political purposes, not to relay facts. But what we know is the end, not the beginning or what happened in between -- the names, the people involved -- we know nothing about all this."
She said she had been shown only parts of a faxed document and given no details except that the information came from a reliable agent in Libya. "The manner of presentation -- it was not even an official letter -- was not convincing," she said. "Eventually the State Department sent me a letter of condolences, but I am not persuaded."
A State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it would be unusual for officials notifying a family of a death to even discuss the issue of publicity, let alone pressure a family member to publicize the event. "We were informing her of her husband's death, not to publicize it, but to do the right thing and inform a family member of what we knew," one official said.
What the C.I.A. report did succeeded in doing, however, was to provoke a diplomatic scuffle between Egypt and its principal Western ally, the United States. The claim that Egyptian agents may have taken part in Mr. Kikhia's disappearance infuriated President Hosni Mubarak and triggered an attack on the United States in the Egyptian press.
"What are they up to here?" a visibly angry Mr. Mubarak said of the United States to reporters in Cairo on Wednesday. "If they have new evidence, the Americans can get in touch with the public prosecutor. But to distribute unfounded accusations and to say people took him out of Egypt without evidence will not do. Anyone who has names or something new to add can get in touch."
Mr. Mubarak pointedly noted that when the North Korean Ambassador to Cairo defected to the United States a few weeks ago "the C.I.A. knows very well how he left."
Mr. Mubarak also said that details of the report had been released now in an attempt by the United States and Israel to pressure Egypt to release a convicted Israeli spy who was sentenced last month to 15 years in prison.
"We regard President Mubarak's comments as surprising, and we can't quite understand why he would even suggest American involvement in this," said Mr. Rubin, the State Department spokesman. "It's illogical. Nevertheless we are determined to continue to work this case at the highest levels and get to the bottom of this."
The dispute was only the latest between the two allies. Egypt has long insisted that its shared economic, strategic and political interests with Libya are too important to jeopardize in the service of America's feud with Colonel Qaddafi. Libya employs Egyptians and invests heavily in Egypt, and both Governments have a common stake in combating Islamic militants.
Last month, to the irritation of the United States, Egypt and other Arab League countries voted to defy the civilian flight ban that has been imposed on Libya for years by the United Nations. And the last few months, Egyptian editorial writers and politicians have become far more sensitive to the assumption that their country will do America's bidding.
Indeed, Mrs. Kikhia said the tensions were vividly displayed in a meeting she had at the White House with Mr. Lake, the former National Security Adviser, when he seemed to indicate that United States officials assumed that Egypt would readily respond to American pressure, given Egypt's enormous dependence on the $2 billion a year in aid it receives from Washington.
She said Mr. Lake asked her what she wanted the United States to do about her husband.
"I said, 'Pressure Egypt if you cannot pressure Libya,' " she recalled. " 'This is where he disappeared.' So he answers: 'That is very easy. We have two buttons here: one says Egypt come, and the other says Egypt go.' "
At the time, Mrs. Kikhia was having trouble arranging a meeting with President Mubarak. "Obviously he called, and the next thing I knew I had a meeting set up in Cairo with President Mubarak's senior policy adviser, Osama el-Baz," Mrs. Kikhia said. "He did not tell me anything, but he met with me and was very nice."

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Man's Goal Is to Rid Town of Tobacco

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG

DATELINE: WINTHROP, Mass., Oct. 7

 BODY:
From this well-worn seaside town beneath the planes roaring into the nearby Boston airport, 74-year-old Ralph Sirianni watched the unveiling of the tobacco industry settlement this summer with mounting discontent.
He also watched teen-agers continue to light up their illicit afternoon smokes not 20 feet from school. 
 The proposed $368 billion settlement did not go far enough to stop Americans from smoking, he said, because the deal makers seemed to care more about money than saving the lives of millions of children.
So Mr. Sirianni, a retired state lawmaker, decided to do something about it. And he has.
In the last two weeks he has turned this town of 18,000 people into a new front in the tobacco wars with a proposal that officials from both the American Cancer Society and the Tobacco Institute said they believed had never been made before.
Just as many American towns and counties have voted to become "dry," banning the sale of all alcohol within their borders, Mr. Sirianni argued, Winthrop should become tobacco-free, forbidding the sale of all tobacco products here.
As one of the three members of the Winthrop Town Board of Health, Mr. Sirianni put forth the proposal last month and received hearty initial approval from his colleagues -- and a response of pure joy from some anti-smoking groups.
"Everybody was pretty excited and surprised," said Lori Fresina, the coordinator of grass-roots advocacy for the state office of the American Cancer Society. "It's a social experiment the whole country will be watching. More power to them."
Many townspeople, however, are less than thrilled. "I think this is one of the craziest things they've ever wanted to do in this town," said Patsy Cimino, owner of the Meat Market near Town Hall. "All small businesses survive on selling cigarettes," though Mr. Cimino said he did not sell them himself.
"Some people don't like to smoke and drink but you have to respect other people's rights," he added.
One local merchant, the owner of the White Hen Pantry convenience store, got so upset that in an interview with the local newspaper, The Sun Transcript, he called the move unconstitutional and asked whether the Board of Health was taking up where Hitler had left off.
Convenience stores get about 27 percent of their sales from cigarettes, said Walker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, an industry-financed group.
"I don't know what this is going to do aside from put some businessmen out of business," he said. "This kind of thing is just tailor-made for encouraging surreptitious black market smuggling of cigarettes."
Some anti-smoking advocates have also remained cautious about the Winthrop initiative, saying they believe more in the gradual route of education and dissuasion than in outright bans.
With so many people addicted to them, "I don't think we have enough science in our hands right now to support prohibition of cigarettes," said Gregory Connolly, director of Massachusetts' state tobacco control program. "We need a lot more scientific investigation on developing less harmful sources of nicotine."
But others point out that anti-smoking measures have long tended to come about locally rather than in state legislatures and Congress, where tobacco lobbyists ply their craft. They say Mr. Sirianni's move is only the latest step in the spread of local bans on smoking in restaurants, buildings and public places.
"Most of the activity that needs to go on over the next few years is on the local level," said Dr. Blake Cady, a leading opponent of smoking in Massachusetts. "It makes the tobacco companies gnash their teeth. They control the Senate and the House in Washington and they can work their magic through money, but they have a difficult time combating these brush fires on the local level."
The Winthrop initiative would also conform to a Massachusetts tradition of setting anti-smoking trends.
Just this week, the Legislature became the first in the country to require the state's pension fund to divest itself of all tobacco stocks in its portfolio. Massachusetts was also the first state to require that cigarette makers disclose all additives and total nicotine content on labels in their products sold here. And in 1992, a referendum drive led by Dr. Cady resulted in a 25-cent-a-package tax on cigarettes to finance anti-smoking education.
Still, Mr. Sirianni, who, as a State Representative for 10 years in the 1960's and '70's learned how to maneuver through the political system, has no doubt that he has a major fight ahead of him.
Rather than try to have the Board of Health impose the ban unilaterally, Mr. Sirianni, who smoked two packs a day from the time he was 15 until he was 50, proposed that the ban be discussed at a hearing on Oct. 15 and be voted on by a general Town Meeting, expected to be held in November.
How that vote would go remains to be seen. In general, about 25 percent of the American population smokes, Mr. Merryman of the Tobacco Institute said, but the proportion tends to be higher in populations with large numbers of blue-collar workers and low-income families.
Winthrop, though a beach town, is not Malibu. It is not even Sharon, the middle-class Massachusetts town that gained some national attention in 1995 when its Town Meeting voted 196 to 149 to ban smoking in any municipal recreation area. Winthrop's median household income is only $37,240, compared with Sharon's $61,692, according to a Boston Magazine compilation of census data.
But Mr. Sirianni already has backing from the town selectmen -- the town has no mayor -- and is trying to draft support from the state's active anti-smoking forces.
Once passed by the Town Meeting, Mr. Sirianni said, his ban on tobacco sales would also have to be approved by the State Attorney General, Scott Harshbarger. There, by all preliminary indications, it would be likely to get a sympathetic hearing: Mr. Harshbarger, who is now running for governor, was a prominent player in the proposed tobacco settlement negotiated by state officials, lawyers, health advocates and representatives of the tobacco industry.
"Our view is this," said Ed Cafasso, Mr. Harshbarger's spokesman: "There are communities in Massachusetts that are dry communities, that have decided not to allow the sale of alcohol within their borders. Our view is that state and local governments have the right to choose to ban the sale of products within their borders."
The settlement proposal was reached in June and would require cigarette companies to pay $368.5 billion over 25 years in compensation for smoking-related illnesses, to finance anti-smoking programs and underwrite health care for uninsured children, among other things. The proposal has stalled, with Congress and President Clinton objecting to some points. Mr. Clinton has proposed stiff penalties on the tobacco companies if steps to reduce teen-age smoking by 60 percent in 10 years fail to meet the goal.
 Under pressure, the major tobacco companies on Friday, settled a class-action lawsuit filed by flight attendants over the effects of secondhand smoke by agreeing to spend $300 million for the study of tobacco-related diseases. The settlement was the first by the industry in a case filed by private citizens.
As anti-tobacco efforts inch forward on the national level, Mr. Sirianni dreams of setting off an anti-tobacco chain reaction in towns across Massachusetts.
"I'm hoping this will start at the grass roots, as a lot of things do, and mushroom outward," he said at his paper-strewn dining room table.
And if legal challenges to tobacco bans also mount, he said, he will not be surprised if they make their way up to the Supreme Court -- where, he believes, his reading of the Constitution must prevail.
"I can't imagine anyone with any intelligence can say they put economics and money over public health and the welfare of the people," he said. "I just can't imagine it."

TOWARD THE END
 OF TIME
 By John Updike.
 334 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $25. 
 "Toward the End of Time" is John Updike's 47th book, and it is deplorably good. If only he would write a flagrant bomb! That would be news. But another excellently written novel by an excellent novelist -- what can be said? Surely no American writer has written so much, for so long, so consistently well. Such feats tend to be undervalued. They shouldn't be. Walking across Niagara Falls blindfolded on a tightrope for the 47th time is certainly as remarkable as having made it across the first time, more remarkable, perhaps; but the viewer's response is all too likely to be not a delighted "How praiseworthy!" but a jaded "What else did you expect?" And at 65, Updike isn't even old enough to be told he's performed very well for his age.
Age is nevertheless the burden, this time, of his song. The title's "end of time" may be that of the United States of America -- the book is set in the third decade of the 21st century, after a devastating war with China has disassembled the great Republic, which nobody seems to miss much. The almighty dollar has been replaced by a local scrip, economic refugees are now sneaking into Mexico instead of out of it, sci-fi creatures called metallobioforms roam loose in the shrubbery, devouring life like army ants, and the independent country of Texas is busily taking over adjacent states, but the book doesn't concern itself overmuch with such details. The important things are still in place: automobiles have roads to run on, the electric lights work, Fedex is operating and the mail and newspapers continue to be delivered, at least in semirural Massachusetts, where the book's protagonist, Ben Turnbull, can still thankfully play golf.
Or the "end of time" may be the end of the earth's time, as there are rumors of possible drastic cosmic events. Or it may be the end of the notion of linear time itself, as Ben Turnbull's consciousness takes startling sideways leaps into the ancient past and the possible future, into the land of what might have happened instead of what did. Or it may be the end of the personal time on earth of Ben himself, who becomes, in the course of the narrative, by no means a well person. His gradual disintegration is the novel's most compelling theme.
Turnbull, a 66-year-old retired investment adviser, is the book's single narrator, and like the earliest European inhabitants of Massachusetts, those voluminously self-searching Puritans, he keeps a spiritual journal -- spiritual not because it's holier than thou, but because it's concerned with the state of what would once have been called his soul, a soul in muted torment, living from hand to mouth and from day to day. The book's underlying structure is linked to the changing seasons, and its method is that of a sinister "Year in Provence," or, more accurately, of a "Walden" gone haywire. Indeed, if Nathaniel Hawthorne was the great-grandfather of "The Witches of Eastwick," Thoreau is the great-grandfather of "Toward the End of Time." Thoreau and Turnbull both live in their isolated and outwardly tranquil houses in the country while the world goes to ruin elsewhere, though Turnbull's well-kept bourgeois mansionette is not exactly a hut. They make similar meticulous and frequently breathtaking observations of nature, they share the tendency to combine the grubbily mundane with the airborne metaphysical, they both indulge in track-jumping digressions and in mordant philosophical observations; but the innocent gaze of the young Thoreau has been transmuted by the aging Turnbull into the gritty-eyed squint of a battle-hardened cameraman. Ben Turnbull is a Thoreau run through the meat grinder of the 20th century, world warfare, economic warfare, racial warfare, sexual warfare and all, and spat out the other end of it covered with blood.
And yet, within the stringent parentheses he's set for himself, Updike manages an amazing range of moods with his usual grace and dexterity. Turnbull's annus horribilis begins on a day in November -- the month of Scorpio, sex, death, regeneration and Thanksgiving, which pretty much covers all the bases. It's the day of the first snow; he hopes for childhood exhilaration but gets none, only "an unfocused dread of time itself, time that churns the seasons and that had brought me this new offering, this heavy new radiant day like a fresh meal brightly served in a hospital to a patient with a dwindling appetite." Yet within an hour he's happily clearing off the porch, delighted by his new orange plastic shovel and hymning the praises of the snow itself. "Does the appetite for new days ever really cease?" he asks. Not for Ben Turnbull it doesn't, and through all the tribulations that beset him it's this appetite -- his ability to be surprised, his childlike curiosity in himself and in what may happen next -- that keeps him going.
He was once married to a woman named, tellingly, Perdita, but his wife of the moment is a vigorous, practical, superficially optimistic woman called Gloria -- surely a relative of Gloria Mundi, the medieval church's much distrusted "glory of this world." Gloria too is aging, despite fresh wardrobes and trips to the hairdresser's for dye jobs, but the process seems only to invigorate her. As the book opens, she's obsessed with the deer that's eating her hedge, and wants Ben to shoot it. Ben secretly sides with the deer, and has become afraid of Gloria. "My wife is a killer," he says. "She dreams at night of my death." The unvoiced power struggle between Ben and Gloria, each civil and affectionate on the surface, each watching the other like a hawk to see which will display the telltale symptoms of croaking first, is one of the best things in the book. As Ben wanes, Gloria waxes; she's even got her natty widow's outfit together beforehand. Nevertheless she tends Ben, nagging him into shape and mothering him relentlessly. "To Gloria I am a kind of garden," he muses, "where she must weed, clip, tie, deadhead and poison aphids."
Gloria isn't the only female threat around. There's also Deirdre, who may be the deer of the book's first section metamorphosed into the paid working-class slut of the second, or may on the other hand be a superheated fantasy of Ben's. A rollick of complicated sex ensues -- Updike is funny and brutally observant on this subject -- as the two bend each other's bodies and heads into ever more twisted positions. If Gloria inspires fear, Deirdre inspires lust, contempt, hatred, guilt and a mournful longing for lost youth. After Deirdre departs, having cleaned out the valuables in the house -- or perhaps not -- Gloria returns, having either been dead or, on the other hand, merely at a conference.
The third in Updike's Gravesian trio of crone, Venus and maiden is Doreen, the barely nubile sidekick of a gaggle of juvenile extortionists who have moved into the woods on Ben's property and are running a small-time protection racket, targeting him and his neighbors. (This is the future, and the police are useless.) Ben gets a perverse kick out of turning himself into their fatherly business counselor, advising the killing of pet cats and the burning down of beach houses in return for a percentage -- retirement hasn't suited him, after all -- while exchanging cash for touching-only privileges with Doreen. He's afraid of Doreen too, but she arouses mostly wistfulness. Through her he has access to the lost prepubertal inexperienced self he once was, for whom he feels a tense nostalgia.
Disaster strikes the young racketeers. Then disaster strikes Ben, in the form of an illness that cripples the part of himself that has meant the most to him. Like many late-20th-century writers, Updike is fascinated with bodily goo, and by things that go yuck in the night. The verbal pleasure he takes in describing the exact nature and texture of Ben's searing and dribbly symptoms rivals Cormac McCarthy on exploding skulls or Patricia Cornwell on decaying corpses. As a commentator, Ben is nothing if not ruthless; but he's as ruthless with himself and his own body as he is with everyone else, and with everyone else's body. Alongside the ruthlessness he does manage, from time to time, a sort of wry tenderness. "To be human," he says, "is still to be humbled by the flesh, to suffer and to die."
It's finally Ben's evenhandedness that confers on "Toward the End of Time" its eerie ambiance, its ultrarealism, its air of a little corner of hell as meticulously painted as a Dutch domestic interior. The light of his intelligence falls alike on everything: on flowers, animals, grandchildren, corpses, copulations; on ancient Egypt and plastic peanuts; on memory, disgust, dread, lust and spiritual rapture. The brilliant metaphors -- and they are almost always brilliant -- are applied, like Whitman's, to everything from the cosmic to the scatological. As a writer, Updike can do anything he wants, and what he's wanted this time is quintessence of mortality. As memento mori and its obverse, carpe diem, "Toward the End of Time" could scarcely be bettered.

HEADLINE: Of Megatrends and Giveaways: Some Thoughts and Regrets of Chairman Hundt

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
In his four years as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Reed E. Hundt has presided over the most tumultuous era in the F.C.C.'s history, a period during which change -- economic, political and technological -- washed over the communications industry like a tidal wave and made this relatively sleepy regulatory agency one of the most powerful forces in Washington.
Mr. Hundt, who is leaving the F.C.C. soon, says much of the change was a result of converging circumstances -- most notably, the computer industry's emergence as a global economic force. 
 But Mr. Hundt's recognition of changing trends and his attempts to manage their repercussions made him probably the most influential F.C.C. chairman in years. "You know what they say about surfing," Mr. Hundt said. "Some of it's the wave, some of it's the board, and some of it is you."
Under Mr. Hundt's often combative leadership, the F.C.C. held auctions that raised more than $20 billion, on paper, for the Government by auctioning parts of the radio spectrum -- for cellular phones, pagers, satellite TV and other services -- that had previously been given away.
Several bidders in the largest-grossing auction, however, are proving unable to raise the cash to pay what they had promised. It is likely to be up to Mr. Hundt's successors to figure out either how to get the money or retrieve the licenses for resale.
And Congress did not heed Mr. Hundt's plea to make broadcasters bid at auction for their share of the greatly expanded spectrum made possible by digital television. He still hopes that they will be required to provide specific public-service benefits, like free commercial time for political candidates, in return for their digital spectrum.
In an interview on the eve of his departure, Mr. Hundt reflected on his tenure. Excerpts follow.
 
ON HIS PHILOSOPHY
The traditional old Democratic view is, 'We like monopolies, and we regulate the heck out of them.' That view was spawned in the New Deal, which enshrined monopolies and created commissions to regulate them. . . . The new Democratic view is to replace the old regime of regulated monopoly with a new paradigm of sound, pro-competitive economics. . . .
On the second front, the public-interest agenda, our goal of advocating vigorously for a broad distribution of public benefits from technology has been specifically illustrated . . . by requiring some education television for children, for free, over the broadcast airwaves and . . . ordering communications companies to pay for connections of computers -- the information highway -- to every single classroom in the country. . . .
I don't think these goals are contradictory as much as they represent a holistic vision. On one hand, you want the bulk of the economy to be competitive and deregulated. On the other hand, you have to recognize that market values are not family values, that markets will leave you a little bit short of certain things.
 
ON HIS GOALS
When we got here four years ago, two great megatrends were occurring globally. The first was the computer becoming a communication tool. The second was the American information economy being exported globally.
The personal computer back then was an unconnected freestanding object; it was an uncommunicating object. . . . Now, the PC connects you and everyone. It's your window on the world, and it's the world's way to get to you. The World Wide Web was invented while I was in this job. And it has changed everything. "One thing we did was to understand this was happening, and to bring the computer industry people into the fray, to listen to their ideas . . . and to solicit their participation. . . .
The second thing is, on the public policy front, the building of communities through technology. . . . When we got here, 3 percent of all classrooms had some kind of communications hookup, and now it's 11 percent and climbing. It needs to be 100 percent. . . .
Third is the three-hour rule on children's educational television. Americans don't want be told there's no market for educational TV. Whether there is a market for it or not, it's positively a good thing to have, because you'll have some millions of kids in your audience.
 
ON HIS BIGGEST REGRETS
(Mr. Hundt here refers to the transfer of spectrum to television broadcasters for high-definition broadcasts or other digital services.)
We tried to wake people up to the fact that this was a giveaway of historic proportions, in return for something that was really nothing. Something huge for something small, maybe you could live with that, but to give away billions of dollars worth of spectrum in return for nothing leaves you aghast. In the end, Congress ordered us to do the giveaway. But whether there will be a 'get back' is not decided yet, and it can still happen. . . . Congress can be obliged by public opinion, I believe, to create reasonable access to the airwaves for all candidates.
What kind of world is it where ABC or NBC can take billions of dollars of its own time to advertise itself, in promotional spots, but finds it inconceivable that a mere $100 million might be set aside every even-numbered year to have a political debate occur? I hope the next commission will muster the votes to do what President Clinton wants, which is have the F.C.C. open an inquiry on free time. . . .
 
ON HIS PLANS
I'm definitely going to write a book. It's going to be called "You Say You Want a Revolution." It shouldn't take too long to write; I've been giving the oral version of it for about four years.

HEADLINE: American Orders For Machine Tools Increased in August

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
American orders for machine tools rose 10.2 percent in August from the month before, lifted by purchases by the auto parts and aerospace industries, according to a survey by two trade groups.
Orders from American companies for domestic and foreign-produced machine tools rose to an estimated $703 million in August from a revised $638 million in July, according to the report, to be published on Monday by the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association. 
 "The impact of spending by the automotive supply chain as well as the boom in aerospace investment has resulted in continued growth for machine tool orders," the Association for Manufacturing Technology's president, Albert W. Moore, said.
August's total also brought orders up 17 percent to $5.6 billion in the first seven months of this year compared with the corresponding period a year ago.
Estimated orders climbed 38.4 percent this August from $508 million in August 1996.

HEADLINE: Albert Blumberg, 91, Philosopher and Communist

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Albert E. Blumberg, an idealistic philosophy professor who fought for economic and social reforms as an oft-harassed Communist Party official in the 1940's and 50's, then continued the fight with somewhat more success as a Democratic Party district leader in Manhattan, died on Wednesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center near his home in upper Manhattan. He was 91.
To the Congressional committees and Justice Department officials who hounded him over two decades, Dr. Blumberg's professed interest in improving the plight of workers and minority groups was a sham. 
 As they saw it, his work as secretary of the Communist Party in Maryland and the District of Columbia, and as the national party's legislative director, was a cover for his role in a Stalin-directed conspiracy to overthrow the Government.
To those who knew him during his years as a respected philosophy professor and department chairman at Rutgers University and as a Democratic leader in New York, his commitment to helping others was real.
Among other things, since settling in northern Manhattan in 1965, he organized and led numerous community organizations, served as president of the Audubon Reform Democratic Club and of the Congress of Senior Citizens of Greater New York and became an adviser to officials like City Councilman Stanley E. Michels, Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., State Senator Franz S. Leichter and Mayor David N. Dinkins, who named him chairman of the senior citizens advisory panel.
A native of Baltimore whose parents were immigrants from Lithuania, Dr. Blumberg was a brilliant student who graduated from Johns Hopkins University before going off on a grand academic tour, picking up a master's from Yale, studying at the Sorbonne and receiving a doctorate from the University of Vienna, where he was attracted to the Vienna circle of logical positivists.
In recent years, Dr. Blumberg talked so little about his past that it is hard to know just how or why he became involved with the Communist Party, but a nephew, recalling his uncle describing campaigns against Jews in Vienna in the 1930's, suggested that, like many European Communists of the day, he came to see Soviet Communism as an antidote to Nazism.
Whatever the initial attraction, Dr. Blumberg and his Baltimore-born wife, Dorothy Rose, quickly became prominent in party circles.
In 1940, for example, he was cited for contempt for refusing to identify party members to the House Un-American Activities Committee, but apparently did not learn the intended lesson: in 1957, he refused to answer similar questions before the Senate Internal Security subcommittee.
By then, Dr. Blumberg had become one of the first Communists convicted under a provision of the 1940 Smith Act equating party membership with conspiring to overthrow the Government.
Despite that 1956 conviction, Dr. Blumberg did not go to prison. In 1957, while his appeal was pending, the Supreme Court declared the provision unconstitutional. (His wife, convicted earlier under a different section, served a three-year term.)
For Dr. Blumberg, the victory was a hollow one. Although he had taught philosophy at Johns Hopkins in the 1930's, he could not get a teaching job and worked in a bookstore until he was hired by Rutgers in 1965.
There he helped organize Livingston College, the university's first residential college for men and women; served as chairman of its philosophy department; wrote an acclaimed textbook, "Logic: A First Course," and was repeatedly elected president of the faculty governing body. As a colleague, Dr. Peter Klein, recalled on Friday, Dr. Blumberg was a master synthesizer who would often astound his colleagues by tapping his gavel during a rancorous dead-end debate, declaring, "I think I hear a consensus," then articulating an inspired compromise.
After retiring in 1977, he stepped up his political activities in New York. By then he had become such an established figure in the local Democratic Party that he won a 1977 election as leader of the 71st Assembly District even though his opponent had tried to use his Communist past against him.
As district leader, Dr. Blumberg was chairman of the county committee's policy committee and worked to bring his upper Manhattan neighborhood's growing Dominican population into the party's inner circles, succeeding so well that he lost his post to a Dominican rival in 1985.
Dr. Blumberg, whose wife died several years ago, is survived by a brother, Harold, of Boston.

HEADLINE: Worldcom Fancies Itself Muffler of the Local Bells

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
When Bernard J. Ebbers, the chairman of Worldcom Inc., wanted to convince MCI Communications shareholders on Friday that his company would be a better mate for MCI than British Telecommunications P.L.C., the main reason he gave was that Worldcom owns local phone networks around the United States, while British Telecom does not.
Lost in the din over the potential implications of combining the No. 2 and No. 4 long-distance carriers is the fact that the $33.9 billion MCI-Worldcom transaction that Mr. Ebbers proposed could create the most significant new competitor in the market for local telephone service, still the largely unchallenged domain of the five regional Bell companies. 
 "Up until now, there really hasn't been a very effective competitor nationally against the regional Bells," Bruce Roberts, an analyst with SBC Warburg Dillon Read, said. "But when you take MCI's marketing muscle and its dollars and its contacts in Congress, and you put that together with Worldcom's local markets, you bring a much stronger player to the table and you increase the pressure on state regulators to open local markets."
Since its $14 billion acquisition of MFS Communications last year, Worldcom has been the nation's largest competitor of the regional Bells -- Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, SBC Communications and U S West -- in providing local phone service. That position was solidified last week when Worldcom said that in addition to its bid to spirit MCI away from its reluctant suitor, British Telecom, it had agreed to acquire Brooks Fiber Properties, a big competitive local telephone carrier, for $2.4 billion in stock. Worldcom now offers local service in 52 markets, and analysts estimate its local customers number about one million.
Since the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which set the stage for the tarantella of industry deal making, MCI has been the most aggressive of the big three long-distance carriers -- AT&T, MCI and Sprint -- in moving into local markets. It has spent $1.7 billion on its local telephone effort and now offers service in 25 areas. AT&T and Sprint have been more cautious, focusing on their core long-distance businesses and wireless ventures.
Indeed, MCI has been so aggressive that it took the company's disclosure that it could lose as much as $800 million in its local markets this year to prompt British Telecom to back out of its original $24 billion offer for the American carrier. B.T. persuaded MCI's board to accept about $5 billion less, and that opened the door for Mr. Ebbers to ride in with his unsolicited, all-stock offer.
And Worldcom is aware of what MCI can do for it in local markets. "It's the old two heads are better than one," said Catherine R. Sloan, vice president for Federal affairs. "We feel we can go it better together than alone in going up against these 75-year-old monopolies. Worldcom brings to the table its aggressiveness and innovativeness in building local networks, while MCI is ahead of us in its overall marketing engine, certainly its name recognition."
Counterintuitively, perhaps, the regional Bells are quietly rooting for the MCI-Worldcom deal to go through. They are convinced that if Worldcom-MCI becomes a one-stop telecommunications shopping center in both the local and long-distance arenas, that would bolster their case that they ought to be allowed to offer long-distance service themselves.
Under the Telecommunications Act, the Bells will not be allowed to sell long-distance service within their regions until they open their networks to broad competition.
Worldcom has focused on selling to business customers, frustrating the Bells. Business customers make more and longer calls than residential users, generating more revenue for the telephone companies they patronize. Because businesses also have many phones on desks close together, the cost of running wires to a business customer is more palatable to a new company than that of providing service to houses with only one or two phone lines each.
MCI has offered its local service mostly to businesses. After it renegotiated its deal with British Telecom, it said it would scale back its investments in local markets. "I wouldn't describe it as retrenching," said Raymond C. Allieri, MCI's senior vice president for local market initiatives. "I would describe it as at each step along the way, we have to reassess the landscape."
But Worldcom might not be as skittish about making costly local investments as British Telecom, analysts speculated. And while the economics of offering local service to residential customers remain daunting, MCI's experience in selling long-distance services would give Worldcom expertise it has lacked.
"Worldcom is used to sending salespeople out knocking on doors," Mr. Roberts said. "If you win a business customer you can sign up 100, 200, 300 lines at a time. But winning residential customers is a house-to-house battle and it requires mass marketing, which is not Worldcom's strong suit. That's what MCI brings to the table."

HEADLINE: Utah Is Warming Up To Newest Monument

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: ESCALANTE, Utah

 BODY:
One year ago, President Clinton and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt were hung in effigy here on the day that President Clinton announced, from the safety of Arizona, the creation of the new Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.
But one year after the new designation, which protects a Delaware-sized chunk of Federal land in Utah, Escalante's Prospector Inn has had no vacancies on some nights, the lone waitress at the Cowboy Blues Diner has struggled to keep up with the crowded tables, and the number of tourists going through the Federal Government's visitor center here has jumped by 58 percent, to 21,699 visitors for the first nine months of this year. 
 "People have come to terms with what happened -- they now know the monument is here to stay," said Louise Liston, a Garfield County commissioner who was once one of the monument's most vocal opponents. "People are thinking about what the monument can do for them, instead of what the monument did to them."
The surprise pre-election announcement that the land would become a monument has led to three lawsuits against the Federal Government, helped Utah's Democrats lose their sole seat in the Congress and earned Mr. Clinton the undying enmity of Utah's overwhelmingly Republican elected officials. The monument designation limits development on the land but is a step below a national park in the level of protection.
Mr. Clinton's action is still having repercussions in Washington. The House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans, recently voted to weaken the Antiquities Act, the 1906 law that Mr. Clinton used to designate the Federal land as a monument on Sept. 18, 1996. The White House has also been issued a subpoena by the House Resources Committee for documents about the monument's creation.
But public opinion in Utah seems to be mellowing on its gigantic new reserve, the largest national monument in the lower 48 states.
Last year, in a pre-election statewide poll commissioned by The Salt Lake Tribune, 47 percent of respondents said they opposed the monument. But by May, in a second statewide poll conducted for the newspaper by the same polling company, the opposition had dropped to 32 percent.
Last year, Kanab, a desert town on the monument's southern edge, greeted President Clinton's announcement by shuttering stores in mourning and releasing 50 black balloons as a warning to other states about abuses of Presidential power. Dale Clarkson, a local developer, angrily dismissed the new park monument as offering fourth-class scenery.
Today, Mr. Clarkson is applying to monument-related projects the kind of industriousness that gave Utah its nickname, the Beehive State.
On the monument's first anniversary, a visitor to Mr. Clarkson's real estate office on East Center Street in Kanab found him poring over blueprints for a visitors center, a "deluxe" recreational vehicle park, a luxury resort in a box canyon and a souvenir trading post catering to tour buses ("best toilets in town"). His new brochure for Deer Springs Ranch, a ranchette development, boasts that "it's just a short trip" to "the new Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument."
"We may have been aggravated by the way it came about," Mr. Clarkson said, "but it was Government property to begin with -- and it still is."
Ever since Utah became a state, in 1896, the Federal Government has owned about 90 percent of southeast Utah. Today, only 10,000 people live in Kane and Garfield Counties, an area almost the size of Belgium.
For decades, people steered clear of the monument area, a baking, inhospitable expanse where place names that made it sound like Halloween in the desert: Spooky Gulch, Carcass Canyon, No Man's Mesa, Devil's Garden, Little Death Hollow and Harvey's Fear.
Still one of the most remote places in the nation, Escalante is a five-hour drive from the nearest city with a major airport: Salt Lake City, Phoenix or Las Vegas, Nev.
But now tourists are venturing into the area, guided by copies of a brand-new, four-square-foot glossy map that was produced last summer by the monument's Federal caretaker, the Bureau of Land Management. In the last year, the Sunday travel sections of virtually every major newspaper in the Rockies has carried articles featuring the monument's red rock landscape: slot canyons, natural arches, sandy washes and crumbling buttes.
"The other day, I pulled out a 65-year-old couple who had gotten their car stuck in the mud," said Lincoln Lyman, an Escalante native who grades the monument's dirt roads twice a year -- once in the spring and once in the fall. "In years past, you might see one or two cars a day. Now there's a lot more traffic."
Initially, many people in the two counties wanted the main roads, which are dirt tracks in some cases, to be paved across the desert. Now many residents do not want the roads paved because they fear that tourists might simply speed through the area on their way to Lake Powell or Zion National Park.
"We don't want drive-by tourism," said Harriet Priska, a Californian who owns the Serenidad Gallery on West Main Street. Her growing sales reflect the soaring numbers recorded at the visitors' center down the street.
"Every month since May has been the best month since we opened five years ago," Ms. Priska said on a recent Saturday, hours before holding a mortgage burning party. Her husband, Philip, who specializes in selling old Western license plates, added: "The other day we had a busload of French tourists. In 10 minutes, they bought $100 worth of license plates."
The town's largest food market, Griffin General Mercantile, recently took on European airs, posting an outdoor sign reading "supermarche."
Behind the change of heart in this town is a growing realization that the region's immediate economic future lies not with coal, oil or gas, but with tourism, modern Utah's largest economic activity. While Escalante's new tourism and second-home economy seems to be rumbling toward a takeoff, government regulations are curbing the region's ranching, mining and oil production.
Louise Liston and her husband, Robert, both descendants of pioneers, got so fed up with Federal officials changing the rules for ranching on public lands that they gave up most of their cattle and now raise ostriches on their own land. And even though the monument contains 11 billion tons of low-sulphur coal, a Dutch company gave up in January on an underground mine project, citing bureaucratic hurdles created by the new monument status.
The Bureau of Land Management recently gave Conoco a permit to drill an exploratory well here. But environmentalists, who lampoon the agency as the Bureau of Logging and Mines, are appealing that decision and have vowed to fight every permit application in the future.
"I'm an industry man, so I don't think we can live off tourism in the future," Mr. Lyman groused, noting that he had worked on recent projects around here to mine coal and zirconium and drill for oil. But Mr. Lyman tempered his criticism of a tourist economy, noting that his construction company had poured cement foundations for many of the 30 new homes built in Escalante in the last year. In the last two years, land prices in this town have doubled.
Indeed, a search for entrepreneurial opportunities since the advent of the new monument was a common theme voiced by residents who attended public meetings held in August in Escalante and six other villages that ring the vast monument.
"If you read the headlines in Utah, people are upset and angry, but if you attend the meetings, people are getting ahead with their lives, seeing what the opportunities are," said Scott Groene, a spokesman for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, a group that fought for the monument status. Mr. Groene, who attended Escalante's meeting, added: "The really shrill rhetoric you only hear from the politicians. And that rhetoric is 30 years old."

HEADLINE: In Venezuela, Clinton Promotes Hemisphere Trade Zone

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Envisioning "a new world in the making," President Clinton arrived here today to begin his first trip to South America, planning to oversee the signing of modest agreements on energy, education and the environment -- and hoping to generate enthusiasm back home for a free-trade zone throughout the hemisphere.
Mr. Clinton was starting a week-long trip that would also take him to Brazil and Argentina. He wants to use the visits to challenge stereotypes about the region and to build support in Congress for his flagging trade initiatives by underscoring "this quiet revolution," as he called it today -- the transition of Latin America nations to democracy and their growing free-market economies. 
 "When the first explorers came to the Americas centuries ago, there was no distinction in their minds between North and South America," Mr. Clinton said at an arrival ceremony, as gray clouds piled up against the jagged green hills in front of him. "It was simply the new world. Now we have an opportunity to bring the Americas together again."
Saying that "command economies have given way to free markets" in Latin America, Mr. Clinton urged the lowering of trade barriers to "create good jobs for all our people in the Americas, North and South."
That is expected to be the essence of Mr. Clinton's message in each of the three countries, as he tries to persuade Congress to enhance his power to negotiate trade deals abroad. Mr. Clinton had planned to make his Latin American visit last spring but postponed it after injuring his knee in March.
At the Summit of the Americas in Miami in 1994, Mr. Clinton called for the establishment of a hemispheric free-trade zone by 2005. But he has been slow to follow up on his proposal. Meanwhile, as their trade with Europe has surged, Latin American leaders have suggested that they are not particularly eager to lower their barriers to American goods.
Reluctant to raise an issue that divided Democrats during last year's campaign, Mr. Clinton held off until last month before asking Congress to renew his increased trade-negotiating authority, known as fast track. Many Congressional Democrats fear that trade deals on Mr. Clinton's terms could cost American jobs, depress American wages and damage the environment.
At the arrival ceremony at an air force base here, President Rafael Caldera of Venezuela praised Mr. Clinton's trade goals. "We know that you, Mr. President, are very much committed toward globalization and want the United States to play this role," he said.
But not all of Mr. Clinton's trade headaches come from Congress. Officials from Venezuela and the United States have not yet agreed on the details of a business-investment agreement that they had hoped to sign during the President's visit.
Mr. Clinton was accompanied here by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. His delegation consisted both of Cabinet members, including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, and of members of Congress, including Nydia M. Velazquez, a New York City Democrat.
Mr. Clinton is confronting sharply different circumstances in each country. Venezuela is emerging from an economic crisis, including the collapse of its banking system in 1994. Its economy contracted last year but is expected to grow by about 2 percent this year -- still lagging behind Brazil's and Argentina's. Mr. Clinton praised Venezuela today for growing "in the wake of real sacrifice."
Venezuela is the biggest supplier of oil to the United States, and Ms. Albright is expected to sign an agreement on Monday under which the two nations will cooperate in developing safe and reliable energy sources. Venezuela is also a major transshipment point for cocaine and heroin into the United States, and both countries also plan to agree on Monday to cooperate further to fight drugs.
In Brazil, Mr. Clinton will focus on education, a favorite topic of his and of that nation's charismatic President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Mr. Clinton is planning to offer help in wiring Brazilian classrooms to the Internet, implicitly pointing out to Americans that the technological revolution is taking place in Latin America too.
And in Argentina, Mr. Clinton is planning to hold a town hall meeting, televised by the network Univision throughout the Americas, at which he will field questions from what his aides call "young leaders" in Buenos Aires, Los Angeles and Miami.
For all the talk about a more unified New World, Mr. Clinton will probably face some prickly military issues on this trip, a sign of the lingering suspicions and divisions in the region.
Argentina was angered by a recent decision by the United States to lift an embargo on sales of sophisticated arms in Latin America, permitting the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Chile.
Partly to mollify Argentina, the United States now wants to name it a so-called "non-NATO military ally," increasing its ties to the American military. But that step, in turn, has irritated both Chile and Brazil -- which were already disappointed that the United States was not supporting any single Latin American country for a regional seat on the United Nations Security Council.

HEADLINE: Study Links Drop in Support To Elitist Attitude in the Arts

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
Stunning increases in the numbers of American artists and arts groups over the last 30 years have far outpaced the growth in public and private support and cannot be sustained, a new Federal study says.
What's more, the report holds artists themselves partly responsible for the growing alienation it sees between the public and the arts -- a gap that made recent cuts in government arts spending possible. 
 "Sad to say," the study concludes, "many American citizens fail to recognize the direct relevance of art to their lives."
Too often, the report says, arts institutions are elitist, racially segregated, class-based and isolated from the "communities they claim to serve, but don't."
The 193-page document, prepared by the National Endowment for the Arts for release on Wednesday, was provided in advance to The New York Times by an endowment official.
While some artists predict that the leveling off of arts spending during the 1990's will give way to better times and what the report calls a "Renaissance Lite," the heavy spending seen in the previous three decades was probably an anomaly, the report concludes.
The report expresses the views of dozens of artists, arts officials and social critics who attended privately financed National Endowment forums in six cities in 1996, as well as the conclusions of scholars who have studied the nation's thousands of arts groups. It also reflects growing anxiety about the future of the arts from Jane Alexander, the outgoing chairwoman of the embattled endowment, whose budget has been cut almost in half during her four-year tenure.
But unlike most arts surveys, "American Canvas," as the report is titled, does not attribute the "marginalization of the arts" in American life even mainly to the loss of support from Federal, state and local governments. It emphasizes factors like the increasing commercialization of American culture, the aging of audiences, the decline of corporate and private giving, the loss of arts education in public schools and the attitudes of artists and cultural groups themselves.
"The arts community itself bears a measure of responsibility," the report says, because it "neglected those aspects of participation, democratization and popularization that might have helped sustain the arts when the political climate turned sour."
The survey quotes Alberto Duron, a Los Angeles lawyer and cultural activist. "What's happened to public arts funding is in no small measure the fault of the arts institutions and the individuals who run them," he said. "Critics in Congress and elsewhere would never have been able to galvanize large segments of the public if it were not for the vulnerability of the arts community brought on by its isolation and intransigence."
In a 1996 study cited by the report, John Kreidler, a veteran arts writer, credits the Federal Government, which created the endowment in 1965, and the Ford Foundation, which made $400 million in arts grants between 1957 and 1976, with helping to ignite the explosive growth of nonprofit arts groups during that period.
According to the endowment, between 1965 and 1994 the number of professional orchestras in the United States grew to 230 from 100, professional opera companies to 120 from 27, dance companies to 400 from 37 and theater companies to 425 from 56.
But the Ford Foundation saw itself as a catalyst, not a permanent provider of money for the expansion, Mr. Kreidler added. While those employed in the arts increased by 48 percent from 1970 to 1980, their earnings decreased by 37 percent, he said. "The Ford era could not be sustained," Mr. Kreidler concludes.
Arts groups today, the report argues, are battered by tensions between the marketplace and public responsibility that are crowding out nonprofit culture, often at the expense of quality.
Though surrounded by myriad forms of art and entertainment, a "staggering" number of strikingly original American voices "find themselves so far from the cultural mainstream as to be virtually silent," the report says.
By "enshrining art within the temples of culture -- the museum, the concert hall, the proscenium stage," the report says, "we may have lost touch with the spirit of art: its direct relevance to our lives."
Meanwhile, even those institutions like art museums whose visitors are multiplying are increasingly hard pressed financially. For instance, the report cites a 1995 survey of 174 members of the Association of Art Museum Directors that showed that museum expenses outstripped income by 22 percent. Similarly, Dance/USA's survey of the 65 largest dance companies, all with budgets over $1 million, reported total expenses of $257 million and total revenue of $163.7 million, for a 36 percent overall deficit.
While private contributions to the arts will remain the financial linchpin of the nonprofit arts economy, private support from foundations, corporations and individuals has fallen -- from an all-time high of $10.23 billion in 1992 to just under $10 billion in 1995, the first three-year period of no or negative real growth in the 31 years that such statistics have been kept, the report states.
Corporations' share of the donations declined from 11.8 percent in 1992 to 9.3 percent in 1995.
"Given the many social challenges facing American society," the report asserts, "it's unlikely that the competition for funding will be any less keen any time soon."
Even when the operating incomes of art museums were included, along with public and private contributions to the arts, the nonprofit arts sector of the economy totaled just $7.3 billion, or "slightly more than one-thousandth of the gross domestic product that year," says the report, citing a 1993 study by two economists, James Heilbrun and Charles M. Gray.
Americans spent $4.31 billion for admission to live nonprofit performing events in 1990, the report says, less than half of they paid "for flowers, seeds and potted plants that year."
The loss of arts education in public schools is also eroding arts appreciation, the report states. And despite recent research documenting how training in music and other art forms can improve cognitive skills in young children, the arts have not yet earned "a secure place in the basic curriculum."
Though the report's tone is largely gloomy, it finds some hope in innovative local initiatives, particularly those aimed at convincing people that controversial artists are worth supporting and those preserving folk arts.
The report applauds the growing strength of some of the nation's 4,000 local arts agencies, especially those that emphasize the arts as a vehicle for community development. Local government support for the 50 largest local agencies, it notes, has increased 35.3 percent since 1990.
It also praises public-private partnerships and efforts to form arts consortiums to raise money and share resources. It cites the Delaware Arts Stabilization Fund, in which eight of that state's largest arts groups, which banded together in the late 1980's to raise $21.5 million for long-term capital needs, as a model that could be followed by other states.
But ultimately, the report concludes, the arts will not remain vibrant without "a broad arts advocacy movement," similar to the environmental movement that took hold at the turn of the century. That, in turn, will happen only if arts groups connect themselves to different segments of their communities, it says.
As long as arts patrons are primarily perceived as "older, wealthier, better educated and whiter than a typical cross section of the American public," arts support will be limited, fragile and politically vulnerable, the report says.
Arts champions, the study notes, point to a 45 percent increase in the number of blacks who attended a live performance between 1982 and 1992 and a 64 percent increase in Asian, Hispanic and Native American attendance. But such figures do more to illustrate "the cultural apartheid in which we began this century" than to demonstrate progress toward cultural equality, the report concludes.

HEADLINE: Wes Gallagher, 86, President And General Manager of A.P.

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Wes Gallagher, who as president and general manager of The Associated Press oversaw substantial changes in news coverage and in the use of technology, died on Saturday at St. Francis Medical Center in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 86 and lived in Santa Barbara.
Mr. Gallagher, a booming-voiced Californian, was the news agency's general manager and chief executive from 1962 until 1976. He was also its president from 1972 to 1976, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 65. 
 The Associated Press is a cooperative owned by its member newspapers and radio and television stations in the United States. In 1976 its reporting appeared in up to 1,300 newspapers, went to 3,500 radio and television stations in the United States and was transmitted to 100 foreign countries. The agency's headquarters is in Rockefeller Center in Manhattan.
During Mr. Gallagher's last decade at The Associated Press, he oversaw an evolution in its perception of what was news.
In that period, the news service kept reporting about events as they occurred, but it came to put a new emphasis on dispatches that tried to go beyond the hard facts of the news. By 1976, the agency was sending to its subscribers longer and more detailed stories reporting in depth about topics like life styles, inflation and the environment.
As general manager, Mr. Gallagher oversaw the creation of a team of energy specialists who wrote interpretive and background stories about that era's oil shortage. He created a "Mod Squad" of roving reporters to write about the evolution in American life that began in the late 1960's. And he set up a special group of reporters to chronicle urban problems in the 1970's.
"We found that it was not enough to just expose these things day after day," he said in a 1976 interview. "The man in the street has become more cynical and what he wanted was more interpretive reporting. He wanted to know what to do about these problems. He wanted them in a cooler perspective."
By 1976, The Associated Press was still covering foreign news, but under Mr. Gallagher, it was putting less emphasis on day-to-day events.
"Following Vietnam, readers turned off," Mr. Gallagher's deputy, Keith Fuller, said in 1976. "They were sick of foreign news."
During the Vietnam War era, Mr. Gallagher stressed objectivity in the reporting of foreign news. In 1965, in a speech to a group of newspaper editors, he observed that Government officials frequently cited what they called "the national interest" in trying to discourage the reporting of unpleasant news from Vietnam and other troubled areas.
"We are not a vehicle to serve the 'national interest' as defined by politicians," he said, "but to publish the truth as we see it."
In the technical field, Mr. Gallagher oversaw the use of computers in various aspects of the agency's gathering and reporting of the news, along with an acceleration of the transmission of news that was made possible by technological advances. His other innovations included founding a division to compile "instant" books about important events.
Mr. Gallagher was born in San Francisco, graduated from Louisiana State University and worked for newspapers in California, Louisiana and Rochester before joining the agency in 1937 in its Buffalo bureau. He was a daring and respected war correspondent in World War II, and afterward directed the agency's operations in Germany. He was transferred in 1951 to the agency's New York headquarters, where he held a succession of executive posts.
He is survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Betty Kelley; two daughters, Jane Gallagher of Cresskill, N.J., and Christine Gallagher of Los Angeles, and a son, Brian of Great Falls, Va.

HEADLINE: Union Vote In Mexico Illustrates Abuses

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico, Oct. 9

 BODY:
For three years, Armando Hernandez belonged to a Government-controlled union he had never heard of, led by labor bosses he had never seen. His 85-cents-an-hour wage was set by a contract negotiated in secret that he was not allowed to read.
Mr. Hernandez began to figure all this out recently when he and scores of other welders walked off their jobs at the Korean-owned Han Young factory here, demanding a raise and vowing to form an independent union. A stranger appeared, identified himself to workers as their union representative, and said they were lucky to be earning twice Mexico's minimum wage, which is about 41 cents an hour. Infuriated, the workers began pelting the man with their leather welders' gloves, driving him from the plant. 
 But it has been harder for the workers to get rid of the hitherto-secret union itself, which is affiliated with the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. After months of turmoil, Han Young workers voted overwhelmingly on Monday to oust the PRI union and recognize one of their own choosing. But a Government labor board has refused to announce the results, and Mr. Hernandez and his colleagues are charging fraud.
Union elections in Mexico are often disputed, but this one has attracted rare attention. American trade unionists and other sympathizers, many of whom traveled to Tijuana to monitor the balloting, as well as several members of the United States Congress, are pointing to the case as an instance of labor abuses they say are routine despite Mexico's pledges under a side accord of the North American Free Trade Agreement to respect the right of workers to form independent unions.
"The Government is trying to swindle this election," said Teresa P. Valladolid, a field representative for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. who attended the vote.
The Han Young plant where Mr. Hernandez works, which makes chassis for tractor trailers, is one of Mexico's 2,700 border assembly plants, called maquiladoras, which assemble imported parts for re-export tax free. Not one of these plants has an independent union, labor experts say. The turmoil at Han Young is one of a number of recent challenges to the country's authoritarian labor system, which Mexican labor lawyers and other critics say has served mainly to turn out votes for the PRI on election day and to keep labor cheap.
The efforts by Americans to aid the Han Young workers have angered Tijuana employers.
"This is an attempt by the United States labor movement to destabilize Mexico's maquiladora industry," said Jose Mandujano Alvarez, a prominent strategist for Tijuana employers, who watched Monday's vote. "It's part of their strategic plan to provoke our workers."
There are other causes for the sparks of restiveness among Mexican workers. Local PRI unions like the one at the Han Young plant belong to labor federations that are wings of the party, giving PRI leaders considerable control. Several times in recent years, the PRI federations have prohibited members from marching in their traditional May 1 workers' holiday demonstrations, for fear that their chants might embarrass Mexico's President.
But now there is a power vacuum; the recent death of Fidel Velasquez, the country's 97-year-old labor patriarch, has left a group of bickering septuagenarians in charge of the PRI's once-mighty labor empire. Although the economy is booming, a fifth of Mexico's workers earn a daily minimum wage of about $3, which buys only a fraction of what it purchased 20 years ago. And as successive economic crises have impoverished many Mexicans, democratic changes in Mexico's political system have aroused hopes for democracy in other institutions. As a result, isolated labor disputes have flared in a working population that has been extraordinarily long-suffering.
"The country has changed at the electoral level, but at the workplace, authoritarianism remains a fact of daily life," said Arturo Alcalde, a Mexico City lawyer representing workers in several independent organizing campaigns. "And that's a major reason why workers endure such miserable wages."
The Constitution, written in 1917 during the Mexican Revolution, outlines a detailed list of workers' rights. But Nestor de Buen, a consultant to the Government on Nafta labor issues, said that over the years the rights have eroded.
"Unionism in Mexico now has the goal of protecting the state, not the workers," Mr. de Buen said. One common practice, he said, is for employers to sign collective bargaining agreements known as "protection contracts" with PRI-backed unions, bypassing entirely the workers affected by the contract and greatly complicating the formation of an independent union.
A survey conducted this year by an independent labor federation concluded that 95 percent of Mexico's organized workers belong to unions they had no voice in choosing.
Workers seeking to transfer union jurisdiction at their workplace from a PRI-backed union to one of their own choosing face a legal labyrinth and risk mass dismissals or violence at the hands of people known as "golpeadores" or beaters.
Last month, for instance, on the day workers at a brake-shoe plant outside Mexico City were to vote whether to decertify a PRI-backed union, employers brought in scores of beaters who roamed the factory floor, slapping workers and warning them not to vote for change. With many workers casting ballots in tears, a majority decided to keep the existing union.
Since the welders at the Han Young plant began their organizing drive in June, management has dismissed seven workers, including Mr. Hernandez, and has hired 20 welders from another state to replace them. Nonetheless, the drive has come closer than at any other maquiladora plant to stripping a PRI-backed union of legal recognition.
Offering free advice to the Han Young workers have been several Tijuana lawyers loosely affiliated with the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution, which made strong gains nationwide in the July elections. Another important ally has been the Support Committee for Maquiladora Workers, a San Diego group.
Mary Tong, the committee's director, has been visiting border plants in Mexico for several years, and now publicizes maquiladora organizing drives across a nationwide network knitted together by phone and fax.
"It struck me that if people in the United States got word about the conditions in these plants, it would bring tremendous leverage," Ms. Tong said.
To observe Monday's balloting at a Government labor board office in Tijuana, she organized a delegation of a dozen Americans, including a labor professor from a Los Angeles community college, a retired Peace Corps worker, a human rights organizer from San Francisco and a staff aide to a San Diego City Councilman.
In a voice-vote election witnessed by reporters, 54 Han Young workers said they wanted to install a new union at the plant, while 32 workers voted to retain the PRI-backed union. Nonetheless, Carlos Perez Astorga, the board's acting director, has twice delayed certifying the results and has refused to set a date for doing so. A lawyer for the PRI union, Francisco Maldonado, fueled fears of official manipulation by claiming victory in an interview after the vote.
"The balloting was very favorable," Mr. Maldonado said. "We had at least 80 percent of the votes."

Book jacket blurbs are, by definition, shameless. Want attention? Pan your own author.

BYLINE: By Doreen Carvajal 

 BODY:
BREATHLESS blurbs in praise of books are as mechanical as a response to "How are you?" Fine. Also delighted, haunted, satisfied, engaged, moved, thrilled and gripped.
So common is the industry practice of issuing cloying endorsements to grace dust jackets and advertisements that the compliments of luminaries seem rather meaningless. 
 "No informed person takes them seriously because of their tainted history of shameless cronyism and grotesque hyperbole," Camille Paglia once wrote, scoffing at the time-honored custom, in that case in the trade journal Publishers Weekly.
Given the rather airy state of blurb inflation, some publishers have resorted to a twist on the conventional approach: acid blurbs, nasty and pointed as a fountain pen.
"There's so much hyperbole in publishing that it's actually quite hard to make an impact with something that's positive," said Colin Robinson, managing director of Verso, a small publishing company, which values the negative approach. "I think it's quite good to go the other way."
Verso's jacket for Christopher Hitchens's critical biography of Mother Teresa, "The Missionary Position," includes a blurb from a New York Press review, "If there is a hell, Hitchens is going there for this book."
From his present vantage on terra firma, Mr. Hitchens confesses that he loathes the practice of trading endorsements. "I resist whenever I can giving blurb," he said. "I try to give it to people who are struggling. I really wish publishers wouldn't ask for it. I hate asking people for them."
Publishers, however, have no such qualms, freely seeking endorsements because they provide a shorthand way of appealing for attention from booksellers and reviewers. Books and boilerplate letters soliciting comment are frequently sent to authors with well-known names.
The stamp of approval is particularly helpful for younger writers promoting first-time novels, like the praise Charles Frazier received for his first work, "Cold Mountain," from John Berendt, author of the perennial best seller "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."
"This is a highly competitive field, and it's a field that honors the opinions of important writers. And that factor of conferring prestige is terribly important," said Ira Silverberg, editor in chief of Grove Press, an imprint of Grove Atlantic, which published "Cold Mountain."
"The credibility factor helps enormously with reviewers and booksellers," Mr. Silverberg said. "I don't know how much it means at the consumer level, but booksellers care about blurbs. It helps them to contextualize. I still firmly believe that a writer will blurb another writer only when they believe in the book."
Of necessity, Verso has taken a different approach to blurbs. Verso, based in London and New York, specializes in progressive and radical books that face a very difficult climb to the top of best-seller lists. Its promotion budget is skimpy, forcing it to be more inventive.
According to Mr. Robinson, Verso follows a philosophy derived "from a variation of Lao Tzu's 'The Art of War.' "
"The point about negative blurbs is that they advertise to your readers that people they hate, hate the book, and therefore they'll probably like it," he said. "It's a bit like the rules of war, the enemy of my enemy is my friend."
Verso has published blurbs accusing its own author, Alexander Cockburn, of setting a "new standard of gutter journalism" and excoriating another author, Andy McSmith, as "biased, ill-informed, malicious and unpleasant."
It designed a poster of another author, Doug Henwood, with a simple two-sentence critique: "You're scum. It's tragic you exist."
Before Mother Teresa died early last month, Mr. Robinson said he had unsuccessfully sought negative comments from the Roman Catholic Church assailing Mr. Hitchens. "We made an enormous effort," he said. "We sent out the book to everyone we could think of in the Catholic hierarchy, to the Cardinal in New York, to the Pope. We figured that anything that upsets the Catholic Church is good news for our readers."
Verso's spring catalogue heaped even more criticism on Mr. Hitchens and his Mother Teresa biography. Its description included the disdainful observation of The Sunday Times of London, "Veteran left kicks old nun; old nun forgives; lefty doesn't want to be forgiven," and this from another British newspaper, The Mail on Sunday, "Hitchens is sad, unhappy, bewildered, needing love and spiritually starved."
In general, the British press seems to set the standard for vitriol. The Evening Standard was so appalled by Will Self's horror book, "My Idea of Fun: A Cautionary Tale," that its publishers thought the critique might actually entice readers. It wrapped the title with this band of words: "Will Self's first full-length novel is the most loathsome I have ever read. I have read it twice to make sure and I am oppressed by a sickening, fatalistic feeling that I may soon read it again."
Earlier this summer, the publishers at Villard were pondering quotations to use in connection with a reissue of a book by the British writer Iain Banks, "The Wasp Factory." There was no lack of passionate comment to choose from.
The Times of London trained its fire on the writing: " 'The Wasp Factory' soars to the level of mediocrity. Maybe the crassly explicit language, the obscenity of the plot, were thought to strike an agreeably avant-garde note. Perhaps it is all a joke, meant to fool literary London into respect for rubbish."'
But The Irish Times turned its outrage against those responsible for nurturing the work. "It is a sick, sick world when the confidence and investment of an astute firm of publishers is justified by a work of unparalleled depravity," it said.

HEADLINE: New York Harbor Steps Up Share of Cargo Traffic

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Buoyed by a strong economy and a reduction in shipping fees, New York Harbor handled nearly 12 percent more cargo traffic during the first half of this year, compared with the same period last year, the Port Authority reported yesterday.
The increase ultimately means that New York and New Jersey have increased their share of the Northeastern seaboard shipping market by less than one-half of one percent over last year -- to slightly less than 40 percent, a far cry from the 70 percent or more that it enjoyed during its heyday. But the numbers were seen by shipping analysts as encouraging evidence that lower labor costs, an expensive overhaul of the harbor and docks and an aggressive marketing campaign have begun to pay off after a decades-long decline in the ports' fortunes. 
 "New York has been fighting to maintain its position, and it is now getting to the point where it can be more competitive," said Michael L. Sclar, an analyst who recently completed an examination of shipping trends for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
But Mr. Sclar and other analysts warned that as a new class of giant container ships begins to ply the oceans, New York must move faster to fix its most intractable problem: the tons of riverborne silt that clog the harbor's shipping lanes. A change in Federal law recently closed the port's main dump site for mud off Sandy Hook, N.J., and while dredging began again this summer, it is clearing less than half a single year's accumulation of mud. Meanwhile, officials desperately search for new dumping grounds (they recently reached an agreement with Pennsylvania to use some of the mud to seal abandoned mine shafts).
"Down the road, huge amounts of cargo will be coming to the Eastern ports from East Asia, and those cargoes will be coming in ships that require a 45- or 50-foot draft," Mr. Sclar said. "New York has to begin to send signals that it will be ready."
Authority officials said they believed that the rise in cargo traffic in the first half of this year was partly a result of a half-billion-dollar modernization of the docks over the last five years, including a ship-to-rail terminal in Elizabeth, N.J., that has helped cut costs for importers and exporters.
Earlier this year, the New York Shipping Association also reduced the assessment for cargo moving through the ports to $2.90 a ton, from $3.50. The assessment has long been used to pay the salaries of unionized workers for whom there is little or no work -- an agreement reached in the late 1960's, when containerization began to render many longshoremen's jobs obsolete.
But now, said Lillian C. Borrone, director of port commerce for the Port Authority, the number of longshoremen has dropped to about 2,700 through retirement, from 20,000 at its peak. The number required to perform the work is about 2,200, Ms. Borrone said.
But the number of surplus workers has shrunk enough for the cargo fee to be decreased, which officials said they believe has played a part in steering more of the economy's new business into New York and New Jersey ports in Newark, Elizabeth, Staten Island, Red Hook in Brooklyn and the Port of New York itself.
"We believe this growth reflects the fact that shippers are seeing that we are more productive and that costs are lower," Ms. Borrone said. "We are getting a substantial share of the trade growth."
Increases during the first half of this year were seen mostly in imports and exports of stereos, VCR's, television sets, alcoholic beverages, toys, clothing and shoes -- the kinds of consumer goods that the surging United States economy is both snapping up and producing. The number of loaded aluminum containers moving through the port -- lifted by spiderlike cranes from the ships onto trains or trucks -- rose to 832,499 this year from 744,727 last year.
Car imports also jumped -- to 165,262, from 143,212, or by 15 percent -- a figure that does not reflect recent decisions by two major manufacturers to ship 60,000 more cars a year through the ports.
Increases were almost evenly split between imports and exports. And the growth came from nearly every part of the world, port officials reported. Imports from and exports to Latin America led the way, with a 21 percent rise from last year. Trade with Europe was up 15 percent, with Africa, up 13 percent, and with Mediterranean countries, 12 percent.
Analysts said the increase in the number of containers was probably the largest year-to-year jump in 15 or 20 years and was significant because containers usually carry packaged raw materials or finished consumer goods, the most valuable and sought-after cargo for large ports.
Hugh O'Neill, an economic consultant who left the Port Authority in 1991 as a director for planning and development, said the rise in car imports was also a sign of the increasing attractiveness of New York Harbor because the car business is among the most competitive in the shipping business. "People will kind of go where they can get the best deal," Mr. O'Neill said. "This is clearly against what the trend has been."
But others said they believed that the size of the jump both in containers and cars probably had more to do with the booming economy than the ports' performance. "There is no question in my mind," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University, "that this is a consequence of a thriving national economy and the increase in demand for consumer goods."

Medicine and Politics

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The medical use of marijuana remains a poisonous idea in political Washington. Williams Weld's support for it was one of Senator Jesse Helms's stated reasons for blocking his nomination as Ambassador to Mexico, and no one in Washington wanted even to discuss it.
But in the scientific and medical world, there is increasing support for the use of marijuana as an aid to treatment -- or at least for open-minded testing. 
 The National Institutes of Health in August issued a report by an eight-member committee calling for N.I.H. tests of marijuana's efficacy in four medical areas. The chairman of the committee, William Beaver of Georgetown University, said: "For at least some potential indications marijuana looks promising enough to recommend that there be controlled studies."
In The New England Journal of Medicine dated Aug. 7 a strongly worded article by George J. Annas condemned political interference in the question -- in particular, the Clinton Administration's threat to prosecute any California doctors advising marijuana use after the state's voters overwhelmingly approved the idea in a referendum last year.
"Doctors are not the enemy in the 'war' on drugs," Mr. Annas said; "Ignorance and hypocrisy are. Research should go on, and while it does, marijuana should be available to all patients who need it to help them undergo treatment for life-threatening illnesses."
The best popular discussion I have seen of the scientific-medical issues appeared in The Economist on Aug. 16. It described four kinds of illnesses in which patients have found marijuana helpful.
One is glaucoma. The increased pressure in the eyeball that the disease causes is eased by smoking marijuana. Indeed, the Food and Drug Administration allowed its use when other glaucoma treatments were unavailing until 1991 -- when it may have given way to anti-marijuana hysteria.
A second medical area is neurological diseases. Sufferers from multiple sclerosis, for instance, find relief in marijuana from burning sensations in their arms and legs.
Third, there is what The Economist called "marijuana's well-known ability to stimulate the appetite." This is reportedly of crucial help to AIDS sufferers.
Finally, The Economist said, marijuana is "of undoubted benefit in suppressing the nausea suffered by many people on anti-cancer therapy."
One patient who reported being greatly helped in that way is Prof. Stephen Jay Gould, the esteemed Harvard paleontologist, who was driven to near despair by nausea when under treatment for abdominal mesothelioma. (He is one of the first people, ever, to survive the disease.) Marijuana, he said, "was the greatest boost I received in all my year of treatment, and surely the most important effect upon my eventual cure."
President Clinton's drug czar, retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey, has scoffed at the idea that marijuana is medically indicated. It is unnecessary, he wrote last month, because its active ingredient, THC, is synthesized and available as a prescription drug, Marinol. "The argument that this chemical needs to be smoked . . . doesn't make sense."
But numerous patients who have tried Marinol and found it ineffective report having benefited from marijuana. It may be that the vapor form of THC is more readily absorbed by the body, or that the smoke contains other ingredients not yet known.
Disquiet is growing more broadly in the medical community about the punitive nature of American drug policy. In July a new organization was formed called Physician Leadership on National Drug Policy. Dr. Lonnie Bristow, former president of the American Medical Association, said: "The current criminal justice-driven approach is not reducing, let alone controlling, drug abuse in America."
And last month another new group of scientists, officials and drug experts called for discussion of drug policy in practical terms -- what actually works. Open debate is now inhibited, they said, by the treatment of critics as traitors.
The Economist put it succinctly in its article on medical use of marijuana. "Some drugs are known to induce paranoia through chemical action," it said. "Marijuana, it seems, can do it through political action."

HEADLINE: Climate Change Imposes Heavy Financial Cost

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Doubts on Cost Are Bedeviling Climate Policy" (front page, Oct. 6) examines the costs of changing energy policies to address climate change, but the issue of avoiding the economic damages from climate disruption receives less mention. The insurance industry and public health community are not so sanguine. 
 Records from the National Climatic Data Center indicate that extreme weather events have increased in the continental United States and elsewhere. Droughts have become longer and bursts of precipitation more intense. Worldwide, the rise in severe wind and flood-related events has caused extraordinary losses for property insurers. Annual United States reinsurance payouts have risen sevenfold this decade.
To avoid the costs of climate disruption, a shift in priorities, credits, subsidies and incentives will be needed to help develop technologies that steer us into a renewable and energy-efficient future. The biggest surprise may be the better distributed economic opportunities produced by this transition.

HEADLINE: Climate Change Imposes Heavy Financial Cost;
Mexican Auto Controls

 BODY:

To the Editor:
At the White House conference on global climate change (news article, Oct. 7), President Clinton made it clear that there would be no tax increases for fossil fuel energy as a means to encourage the economy to shift away from this principal source of carbon emissions. The President would speak up only for improved technology, arguing that a climate change treaty with such taxes would get nowhere in the Senate. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that in its member countries about 30 percent of all emissions of carbon, a major greenhouse gas, emanates from transportation, mostly cars and trucks. Except for the European Union, the major energy users of the planet are unwilling to commit to fixed goals and timetables for reducing carbon emissions. What is to be done if gas taxes are unthinkable?
One place to look is at Mexico City, which has had auto controls in place since 1989. This policy of a no-driving day may be the beginning of a plan that environmentalists, politicians, the public and economists can accept as a method for wringing contributions to greenhouse gas reductions out of the transport sector and taking pressure off fixed emissions sources.

Envisioning "a new world in the making," President Clinton arrived in Caracas, Venezuela to begin his first trip to South America, planning to oversee the signing of modest agreements on energy, education and the environment -- and hoping to generate enthusiasm back home for a free trade zone throughout the hemisphere. His week-long trip is also to take him to Brazil and Argentina. A3
 
Union Dispute in Mexico
Workers at a Korean-owned automotive factory in Tijuana, Mexico, voted last week to oust a union affiliated with the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party and to recognize one of their own choosing, but a Government labor board has refused to announce the results. American trade unionists are pointing to the case as an example of labor abuses they say are routine despite Mexico's pledges under a side accord of the North American Free Trade Agreement to respect the right of workers to form independent labor unions.

Questions Over Cuba Bombings
The Cuban authorities are holding a suspect charged with carrying out a half dozen of the recent bomb attacks on hotels and restaurants here that have unnerved Government officials and ordinary Cubans. At a news conference last week, Cuba's Justice Minister, Juan Diaz Sotolongo, said no date had been set yet for the trial of the 26-year-old Salvadoran who was apprehended last month, Raul Ernesto Cruz Leon. Prosecutors have "totally overwhelming proof" of Mr. Cruz Leon's involvement in the bombings, he said, while declining to provide specific evidence. A8
 
Train Crash in Japan Injures 32
Thirty-two people were injured, two seriously, when two trains collided in central Japan. A Tokyo-bound express train carrying 550 passengers hit an empty passenger train near Otsuki station, about 50 miles west of Tokyo. The cause of the crash was not immediately known, but news reports said that railway officials suspected the driver of the out-of-service train may have overlooked a signal as he left the station.

Arts Growth Is Outpacing Its Funding, Study Says
Stunning increases in the numbers of American artists and arts groups over the last 30 years have far outpaced the growth in public and private support and cannot be sustained, a new Federal study says. In addition, the report holds artists themselves partly responsible for the growing alienation it sees between the public and the arts -- a gap that made recent cuts in government arts spending possible.

New York City is coordinating an aggressive effort to evaluate whether people on welfare are healthy enough to work for their benefits. The administration of Mayor Giuliani says that using a single, city-financed operation is necessary to discourage fraud and inconsistency in evaluating welfare recipients, and that it is pleased with the performance of H.S. Systems, a private, for-profit clinic which receives $6 million a year for the evaluations. A1

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN STOP: Views From the Neighborhoods;
Safe and Satisfied in Whitestone

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
Bessie Aslanidis was in a hurry. She was feeding quarters into the meter, trying to avoid a parking ticket on busy 14th Avenue in Whitestone, Queens. She was rushing to get her nails done in a salon around the corner. But she stopped for a moment to consider the New York City mayoral campaign.
"There are more police out on the street," Mrs. Aslanidis said, assessing the term of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "There are more jobs. We're happy with the things he's done over the years." 
 She stopped for a second to gather her thoughts. "I think Giuliani is perfect," Mrs. Aslanidis said.
The sentiment is echoed, though perhaps not quite so extravagantly, throughout the clean, calm suburblike streets of Whitestone. A middle-class, overwhelmingly white neighborhood of leafy parks and single-family homes, Whitestone is precisely the kind of community where Mr. Giuliani has done very well in the past. All signs point to a repeat.
In extensive interviews over several days last week, dozens of people encountered in Whitestone's commercial center, at the crossroads of 14th Avenue and 150th Street, said they had voted for Mr. Giuliani when he ran previously for mayor, and that they would vote for him even more enthusiastically on Nov. 4, when he will seek re-election after four years at the helm of the nation's largest city.
"I just think he's done a great job running the city," said Arthur Chiaramonte, a real estate appraiser whose office is in Whitestone and who lives in neighboring Bayside. "I think the city over all has improved over the last four years. I think Giuliani did a good job handling the crises during this period. Just general good management."
Nearly three out of four people interviewed during the random and informal survey said they thought Mr. Giuliani was a forceful leader and an able administrator. Most voters ticked off a similar list of his accomplishments (the same list that the Mayor himself recites): serious crime has declined citywide, the streets are cleaner and the economy has generated new jobs.
And while Whitestone has few, if any, of the serious problems that plague less affluent New York City neighborhoods, local residents said they had seen small improvements in their own area. There are new traffic lights, including one at 17th Avenue and Willets Point Boulevard that several residents said they had been requesting for 30 years. Drag racing has been cut down on Francis Lewis Boulevard. Police officers are seen on patrol more often.
"I like Giuliani," said Carol Fiore, a hairdresser who works in a beauty salon amid the everyday shops -- cleaners, bakeries, candy stores, diners and hardware stores -- that line 150th Street. "When anything happens, he's right there."
"I think he's done a very wonderful job," said Ms. Fiore, who voted for Mr. Giuliani when he ran for mayor unsuccessfully in 1989 and then successfully in 1993. She said she intended to vote for him again.
Although some Giuliani supporters said they had serious misgivings about his aggressive personal style, Ms. Fiore was not among them. "I enjoy seeing him on TV," she said. "He speaks well. I can understand him."
In Whitestone and other white middle-class neighborhoods in northeastern Queens, Mr. Giuliani won more than 80 percent of the votes cast four years ago, when he successively challenged the incumbent Democratic Mayor, David N. Dinkins, who had defeated him in 1989.
Mr. Giuliani appears likely to do as well this time. Of 40 people interviewed at length last week, 28 said they had already decided to vote for the Mayor, who will be on the Republican and Liberal Party lines. Seven people said either that they had decided not to vote at all or that they had not yet made up their minds.
Only 5 of the 40 people said they would vote for Mr. Giuliani's Democratic challenger, Ruth W. Messinger, who is the Manhattan Borough President.
"She's more of a real human being than Giuliani," said John Cunningham, a service technician for Bell Atlantic who described himself as a liberal Democrat. "I believe Giuliani is probably a very talented man. He gets his message across. He's good at projecting. But I don't believe he's real. I don't believe he has any substance."
Several Messinger supporters grudgingly gave the Mayor high marks as a manager, but said they would not vote for him because they were put off by his personality.
"He did a good job, but he's a little on the rough side," said Fern L. Ives, a retired advertising agency executive who described herself as a loyal Democrat who had voted for Mr. Dinkins and would vote for Ms. Messinger. "I don't think she'll be as outspoken, as aggressive as he is. I think she'll stop to think before she talks."
Other Democrats were dismissive of both the Mayor's policies and his temperament. "I don't like the brute who is now the Mayor," said Herbert Katz, a retired assistant high school principal. "He's a bully."
"The man knows how to keep the streets safe, but it's not that difficult to do if you have the manpower left for you," Mr. Katz said, referring to the huge expansion of the Police Department that Mr. Dinkins and the City Council negotiated with the State Legislature in 1991.
Mr. Katz also said Mr. Giuliani did not devote enough time or city resources to the public schools. "I don't think he's given the schools any attention at all," he said.
This was not the prevailing view in Whitestone, where Democrats have repeatedly forsaken their party to vote for Mr. Giuliani, where the Republican Party has shown real vitality and where for decades the white middle class has sought refuge from the crime, density and racial tensions of more hardscrabble New York neighborhoods.
"I'm a Democrat, and I'm crossing," said Billy Geminder, a retired cabdriver who has lived in Whitestone for 42 years. "In general, I think things are much better."
William Bonilla, a city firefighter who lives and works in Whitestone, is another Democrat planning to support the Mayor. "He just seems to be turning the city around," Mr. Bonilla said. "The guy's delivering. I'm not crazy about him, but he's delivering."
Many political polls have shown repeatedly that New Yorkers are concerned about the state of the city's schools. But many people in Whitestone, including Janet Gonzalez, a travel agent and an independent voter, said they admired Mr. Giuliani's school policies. Other Giuliani admirers said they expected him to attack the schools' problems in a second term with the zeal and efficacy with which he confronted crime in his first term.
"I think he's going to change the school system," said a middle-aged woman who would not give her name. "I think he needs another term."
Nicole Sulmers, a postal worker who lives in nearby Queens Village and works in Whitestone, said she had voted for Mr. Giuliani in 1993. "I think he's good and I would vote for him again," she said. "I hold him responsible for crime going down."
Carlo Zappavigna said he planned to vote for the Mayor because of his welfare-to-work initiatives. "I feel he's doing the right thing," he said. "He's trying to get people out to work."
Mr. Zappavigna said he himself is on welfare and was required to pick up trash in the streets for three years in return for his benefits. But, he said, he was unable to find a private-sector job, and, because he is 54, he was eventually exempted from trash pickup. "There are a lot of young people who need that," he said of the Mayor's workfare requirements. "It shows them that you ain't going to die if you go out to work."
Among the other surprises were several people who said they had chosen Mr. Dinkins over Mr. Giuliani in 1993 and have now reconsidered the Mayor.
Angelo Silecchia, who owns a men's wear shop in Whitestone, said he would vote for Mr. Giuliani this year after rejecting him four years ago. "I think he's done a good job," Mr. Silecchia said, "He has brought down crime significantly, and I feel the city is better off."

HEADLINE: Pride and Privacy Are Submerged in Workfare Evaluation

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
The welfare recipients in the overcrowded waiting rooms of H.S. Systems on West 45th Street are called by number, not by name. Ordered to the Manhattan clinic so the city can determine whether they are too sick or disabled to work for their benefits, they sit or stand with their canes, walkers and braces, waiting to be examined. To keep crowding down, the city tells them they must come alone. Some must hold on to urine samples while waiting.
One morning, a woman furtively filled out the psychological portion of her medical questionnaire, unable to shield one answer -- "attempted suicide" -- from the man next to her. In a public hallway, women stood waiting for their physicals, their handbags tearing at their paper gowns, leaving them partly exposed. 
 The day's traffic was heavy: 15 doctors examined about 350 welfare recipients, in theory reviewing medical records and questioning people with lengthy, imperfectly documented histories. An additional 375 recipients gave blood and urine samples.
The stakes were serious -- the doctors deciding who was well enough to clean the city's streets or public toilets, the welfare recipients aware that they would lose their benefits, including medical coverage, if they were ordered to work and did not.
"It is humiliating and sad," said Nemrod Shayne, adding that he was at the clinic because his back had been seriously injured in an elevator accident in 1994. "But there is no option."
Health Services Systems, a private, for-profit clinic, is an essential part of the city's aggressive effort to require able-bodied people on welfare to work for their benefits. The administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani says that using a single, city-financed operation is necessary to discourage fraud and inconsistency in evaluating welfare recipients, and that it is pleased with the performance of H.S. Systems. The clinic -- the only place in the five boroughs where such evaluations are conducted -- receives $6 million a year from the city.
But interviews with recipients, advocates for the poor, government welfare workers, mental health professionals and others, as well as an examination of state records, reveal many troubling aspects of the city's evaluation system:
*Officials with H.S. Systems say every recipient is given an evaluation of at least 20 minutes, but numerous recipients say theirs lasted only 2 to 5 minutes, that doctors regularly disregard the medical information recipients offer, and that language problems can make basic communication impossible. H.S. Systems says its 15 doctors conducted 80,200 examinations of welfare recipients last year.
*Two staff doctors at H.S. Systems have at one time been placed on probation by state authorities. One was found guilty of "inappropriately prescribing controlled substances" and the other was cited for "patient neglect" at a nursing home. A third physician, who still works at H.S. Systems as a consultant, was placed on probation last year for what the state called "gross negligence" in treating two emergency room patients.
*When recipients appeal to state officials to challenge the city's determination that they are fit to work, the city's decisions are overturned or withdrawn in 40 percent to 50 percent of cases. These recipients, who can have their benefits extended during the hearing process, are either granted new examinations or exempted altogether from their work assignments.
*Medical oversight of H.S. Systems is minimal. The New York State Department of Health has not conducted a comprehensive review of the company in more than a decade, even though it has occasionally been cited by the state for faulty operating procedures, improper infection control and inadequate record keeping.
*The city, citing crowding concerns, instructs recipients not to bring a relative, nurse, counselor or others to the examinations, and several people who went to help recipients said they had been ordered out of the clinic by doctors and staff. Initial interviews of recipients with psychological problems are conducted in public spaces, and not by doctors. Recipients are not given the results of their exams unless they specifically request them.
*Welfare recipients found by H.S. Systems to be "employable with limitations" -- cleared, for instance, to do only indoor work because of severe asthma -- repeatedly wind up having to do inappropriate or even dangerous assignments, according to a lawsuit brought by the Legal Aid Society.
This is partly because H.S. Systems fails to specify what those limitations are, said a lawyer for the Society, whose suit accuses the city of wholesale violations of Federal and state laws protecting the rights of the disabled. Relatives of a woman who died while at her workfare job, as well as a man who claims to have been left disabled as a result of having to work for his benefits, have also sued the city and H.S. Systems.
"If people, including poor people with multiple medical problems, must be made to work, this system is the antithesis of how it should be done," said City Councilwoman Mary Pinkett of Brooklyn, who conducted public hearings in August into the performance of H.S. Systems. "All the administration wants H.S. Systems to do is move people along the line, and get doctors that will help move those people without asking too many questions."
Officials with H.S. Systems declined to be interviewed for this article, as did officials with the Human Resources Administration, the city's welfare agency.
But the clinic's president, Yvonne M. Jones, testifying before the City Council in August, defended its treatment of welfare recipients. She insisted that the examinations were as thorough as necessary, and she emphasized that H.S. Systems had no "stake" in their outcome.
 
City Is Hamstrung By Sheer Numbers
Nationally, states that require welfare recipients to work have adopted varying policies for those claiming to be physically incapable. Like recipients here, those in Massachusetts are evaluated at a contracted medical center. But in Virginia, recipients seeking an exemption because of health problems are allowed to produce evidence from their own doctors.
But New York City's experience is unusual because of the sheer numbers of recipients. Thus the scene inside the H.S. Systems office -- not unlike that in a neglected public hospital's emergency room -- is daunting, as more than 700 people are processed daily.
Marlene Schonbrun, a mental health counselor with a New York hospital, once accompanied a client, a paranoid schizophrenic, to his appointment at H.S. Systems. "It was dismal, confusing, kind of like a mill or a factory," Ms. Schonbrun said. "He was asked questions that he totally misunderstood. He couldn't register what they were saying. I do not know what he would have done had he been alone."
Joe Rivera, 25, was alone at H.S. Systems earlier this year. Mr. Rivera, suffering from clinical depression, an anxiety disorder and hallucinations, was a psychiatric patient at the Gouverneur Hospital. He said he took a note from a senior psychologist at the hospital with him when he reported to H.S. Systems, but was never seen by a psychiatrist there, was determined to be "employable with limitations," and was cut off from his benefits after not reporting to his janitorial assignment in a city building.
Months later, after a hearing, state officials restored Mr. Rivera's benefits, noting that the city and H.S. Systems had made no specific finding about Mr. Rivera's psychiatric problems.
"They look at you; they don't examine you," said Mr. Rivera, who prevailed only after getting the help of an advocacy organization, the Urban Justice Center.
 
Crowds and Long Waits At Only Exam Site
Many of the recipients who go to H.S. Systems say they are offended by the clinic and its surroundings. The entrance is next to a storefront peep show, and there is no special access for the disabled.
Inside, waits are long, tempers short. People are moved in bunches by security guards through the crowds, off to have their blood drawn. One morning, the receptionist was observed openly mocking Spanish speakers.
In her testimony before the City Council, Ms. Jones of H.S. Systems said that the center had six psychiatrists, that half the staff was bilingual, and that recipients were treated with "dignity."
Sarah Ramirez does not remember it that way.
She worked for 10 years for the city's Department of Health before she accepted a buyout package several years ago. She eventually wound up on public assistance. She was an outpatient at Long Island College Hospital, being treated for coronary heart disease, when she was ordered to work.
"I brought my documentation to the examination, but the doctor threw the papers on the desk and said he could not be guided by the information I gave," Ms. Ramirez said. "He asked me questions, then didn't wait for answers."
Ms. Ramirez, 55, was classified as employable with limitations. She appealed the finding at a state hearing and was declared exempt from her work assignment.
 
Determining Limits For Disabled Workers
Last year, 33,952 recipients were classified as "employable with limitations." The Legal Aid Society's lawsuit centers on the claim that those recipients are systematically assigned to jobs that are physically inappropriate, even perilous.
"These recipients are never told what the findings at H.S. Systems are, and when H.S. Systems tells the welfare agency that a recipient is employable with limitations, they never tell the welfare workers what the limitations are," said Helen Lee, a Legal Aid lawyer.
Three veteran caseworkers from the city welfare agency's office at H.S. Systems confirmed that they often do not know what a recipient's particular limitation is when they hand out workfare assignments. The forms the workers get concerning the recipients can typically say nothing more than: "light work."
The caseworkers say they have no choice but to give every recipient his or her computer-generated workfare assignment, whether or not it appears that they can do the job.
"We get the paperwork saying these people are employable, but we can tell by looking at them that it is a joke," said one caseworker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Their bodies are swollen or broken. The recipients can wind up doing any sort of job."
Another city worker said, "It's like three different operations -- the doctors, us, the people at the work sites -- working together, but not really working together at all."
Others charge that the mistakes have produced consequences both great and invisible, from death to scores of people quietly losing benefits after opting not to risk doing the workfare jobs.
Relatives of Marsha Motipersad, a 50-year-old woman with a history of serious heart disease, sued the city and H.S. Systems after she died of a heart attack last June during a lunch break from her workfare job in Coney Island. Doctors at H.S. Systems knew about the woman's heart problems, but ultimately cleared her as employable, sending her to fill out time sheets in a sub-basement office in a public restroom.
Mikhail Fridman has also sued the city and H.S. Systems. In July 1996, he said in a sworn statement, he went to H.S. Systems, explained that he was being treated for hypertension, but was not given a full exam by Dr. Aurelio Salon Jr. He was found employable with limitations, but was sent to work in a Sanitation Department garage. He suffered a heart attack that August and was recently declared permanently disabled by the Social Security Administration. A 47-year-old Bronx man, who provided details of his case only on the condition that his last name not be used, was found employable with limitations by H.S. Systems last spring. But despite serious respiratory problems resulting from a 1994 car accident, he was assigned to cut grass in a public park. He suffered a respiratory attack and was admitted to North Central Bronx Hospital.
Gloria Jimenez, 51, worked for 22 years in a belt factory. But suddenly unemployed when the factory closed, otherwise unskilled and suffering from severe arthritis in her hands, she wound up on welfare. After her examination at H.S. Systems -- conducted in English despite her ignorance of the language -- she was found to be employable with limitations. But she was ordered to sweep the streets. She missed a day when the pain in her hands was too great, she said, and lost her benefits. She said she had to sell her personal belongings to pay the rent.
"I had worked all my life, and then I was forced to work at something I couldn't do," Ms. Jimenez said in Spanish. "The doctor never even looked at my hands."
Officials with H.S. Systems, after listening at the City Council hearings to a day's worth of personal accounts of mistreatment by recipients who had undergone examinations, said they were disturbed by the reports, and that they would investigate.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY DAILY BRIEFING;
Commercial Construction Up

BYLINE: By JESSE MCKINLEY

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Nonresidential construction, which has lagged for several years, increased by 58 percent during the first half of the year in New Jersey, state officials announced last week. 
 Municipal construction officials authorized $2.17 billion in nonresidential building between January and June, compared with $1.37 billion during the same period last year, according to a report released on Thursday by the State Department of Community Affairs. George R. Nagle, executive director of the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisors, attributed the increase to a wave of casino expansion in Atlantic City and a strong demand for office space.

HEADLINE: Nimble Deal-Maker For Stars Of Science

BYLINE: By JAMES GORMAN

 BODY:
A FEW months ago, a group of authors gathered at a country house in Connecticut for a weekend, taking walks in the meadows and woods, dining alfresco and talking about their work. They did not, however, discuss movie rights, the fate of the novel or the current rash of memoirs. They talked about multiple universes, the philosophy of mathematics and the nature of consciousness.
This was a pastoral salon in which cosmologists, cognitive scientists, linguists and invertebrate paleontologists could discuss the evolution of the the universe and the problem of whether 1+1=2 is a tautology, a logical formula with relevance only to itself, or whether it has a necessary connection with the physical world. It was a meeting at which the authors could consider the question of whether there are questions that are unanswerable, in principle. 
 All the authors are scientists, and all except one are clients of their host, John Brockman, the literary agent whose house they were visiting and who presided over the occasion with his wife and business partner, Katinka Matson. Mr. Brockman, of Brockman Inc., with a penthouse office in Manhattan just off Fifth Avenue, may have more scientists as clients than any other literary agent. The Independent newspaper in England recently paid him the backhanded compliment of turning his name into a verb, suggesting that there are telltale signs when a scientist is "Brockmaned," one of them being a six-figure advance. His client list reads like a university's interdepartmental committee on evolution, computer science, consciousness and the fate of the cosmos.
At the gathering in Connecticut, for instance, were Steven Pinker ("How the Mind Works"), Lee Smolin ("The Life of the Cosmos"), Daniel Dennett ("Consciousness Explained"), Alan Guth ("The Inflationary Universe"), Nicholas Humphrey ("A History of the Mind"), Niles Eldredge ("Reinventing Darwin," "Dominion") and Frank Sulloway ("Freud," "Biologist of the Mind"), who is not a client, at least not yet.
Mr. Brockman also represents journalists, a number of them employees of The New York Times. But it is as an agent of scientists that Mr. Brockman has made his mark. He is known for striking quickly and treating publishers as adversaries in a contest for money. He sells foreign rights to books himself, rather than letting publishers reap those profits, and prides himself on working a global market.
He sold the just published "How the Mind Works" to W. W. Norton for $500,000 to $600,000, said an editor who was involved in the auction for the book but did not buy it. And he just struck a deal for another book by Dr. Pinker for a larger sum, the author said. "Ten years ago," Mr. Brockman said, scientists writing for a popular audience "would go to Basic Books or M.I.T. Press and get paid a modest advance and give up world rights." Today, they may think about $1 million.
"Scientists are getting what celebrities got 10 years ago -- well, actually, they're getting as much as celebrities in many cases," Mr. Brockman added.
And why not, he asks. "To me," he said, "the people that I work with are the glamorous people. They're the beautiful people. Is there something wrong with an evolutionary biologist being paid as much as a rock star?"
Editors and other agents who deal with Mr. Brockman or compete with him, complain, off the record, about quickie book proposals, overblown advances and books that do not come in on time or in good shape.
Unlike most agents, he submits proposals to a number of publishers at the same time, rather than dealing with them one at a time. "He's always looking for huge money," one editor said, and he does not wait for the scientists to decide that it is time to review their careers and write for the ages. He recruits professors who have received good press for their work the way another agent might recruit actors or quarterbacks.
Acting as a book packager, something between an agent and a publisher, he created a Science Masters series of short, reader-friendly books by scientists like Dr. Pinker and Dr. Dennett and others who are not clients, like the paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. He has sold the rights for this series worldwide.
Popular books about science have always been around. But an editor at Free Press (owned by Simon & Schuster) who has bought a number of books through Mr. Brockman, Susan Arellano, said, "I don't think they had the visibility that John has given them." He has raised the size of advances for books about science to a new level, she said, and Mr. Brockman agrees. "I had something to do with that," he said.
Of course, Mr. Brockman does not create the books. Jonathan Segal, an editor at Knopf, said that "there are a lot of good books out there in science," and that they are out there because of scientists' research and writing. And Mr. Segal pointed out that no one had to participate in a Brockman auction. "It's not John making us bid, it's us," he said.
Mr. Brockman says much the same. "It's the people writing the books that matter," he said. "The publishers that will fall all over me to buy book A won't take my calls for book B." In his characteristic conversational mix, stirring business, philosophy and a big name together in the same elliptical breath, he continued: "What I'm saying is the concreteness, in the Whitehead sense, lives with the manuscript and the author. It's not the agent, believe me." That's Alfred North Whitehead, by the way, the English mathematician and philosopher who wrote "Principia Mathematica" with Bertrand Russell. "I'm only as strong as the book I'm representing at that moment," he said, then paused. "Well, to some degree."
Mr. Brockman, 56, did not begin with books. After getting his M.B.A. from Columbia University, he moved almost immediately into Manhattan's downtown art world as an orchestrator of the avant-garde. In the 1960's, he put on multimedia events. He worked with Andy Warhol. He worked in Hollywood. And he wrote books himself, essays in which he reflected on subjects like cybernetics, the comparative study of brains and computer systems. His first was called "By the Late John Brockman" (Macmillan). By his account, he has now written, edited or been a co-author of about 18 books.
He started his literary agency in 1973 and, in the early 80's, had a flurry of success selling computer software and computer books. One of his first big books was "The Whole Earth Software Catalog," sold to Doubleday for $1.3 million. The computer world is still, in some sense, his home. He lives on E-mail and has just set up a Web site, accessed only with passwords, on which he posts proposals for books he is selling. He need only call a publisher or send E-mail to let an editor read a proposal immediately, with no printing or mailing costs for Brockman Inc.
One of the books Mr. Brockman wrote caused him a great deal of grief. It was titled "Einstein, Gertrude Stein, Wittgenstein & Frankenstein," and he had to tell Viking to pull it off the market in 1986 after James Gleick, then a reporter for The New York Times, noticed that sections of it strongly resembled an article he had written for The New York Times Magazine. This was a particularly serious crisis for a literary agent, whose livelihood is the word as property. The book was already in stores.
It was the worst moment of his life, Mr. Brockman said, acknowledging that there were sections in his book that should have been attributed to Mr. Gleick. He said the mistake had been made by a young assistant to whom he had farmed out some of the books' chapters to finish.
He has continued to write and edit and to organize intellectual salons, both live and virtual. The first was The Reality Club, which he started with the late Heinz Pagels, a physicist, as a way for researchers from different disciplines to get together and talk about their work. He now has a site on the World Wide Web for such discussions, with many of his clients and others talking about cosmology, consciousness and computer science. Reviews of the site are mixed. Murray Gell-Mann, a Nobel laureate in physics and another Brockman client, said that some of the discussion was good, some not. It contains, he said, "a considerable amount of nonsense."
The selling of Dr. Gell-Mann's book "The Quark and the Jaguar" has brought Mr. Brockman criticism. His handling of that book was excoriated in an article in The New Republic as typical of his approach to selling science books. Mr. Brockman was reported to have sold the book to Bantam for $550,000 and topped $1 million with foreign rights.
But Dr. Gell-Mann had great trouble writing the book and went through several collaborators, finally turning in a partial manuscript that Bantam rejected. Mr. Brockman then resold the book to W. H. Freeman for $50,000. Dr. Gell-Mann had to return his advance from Bantam, but he said in an interview that he was happy with Mr. Brockman as an agent. "I made a lot of money on the book," Dr. Gell-Mann said.
Alan Guth is another scientist and Brockman client who had a book, "The Inflationary Universe," that ran into problems. After an initial burst of enthusiasm and a hefty advance, Dr. Guth went through three publishers before his book saw print. He does not blame Mr. Brockman, although he does say, sounding bemused rather than resentful, "I would almost go so far as to say he tricked me into writing the book."
In January 1991, Dr. Guth related, one of those times when the Big Bang theory was being called into question and his work on an expanding universe was receiving attention, a front-page interview with him appeared in The Wall Street Journal. He received a good deal of publicity elsewhere as well.
Mr. Brockman seized the moment. He called Dr. Guth and told him that he could get a big advance if Dr. Guth would agree to write a book. Dr. Guth agreed, and Mr. Brockman sold the book to Bantam for $250,000. But Dr. Guth said the pressure of other work and his own perfectionism had slowed his progress. "The Inflationary Universe" was finally published by Addison-Wesley (the third of Dr. Guth's publishers) for considerably less than Bantam had agreed to pay.
Of course, some Brockman clients publish their books with no trouble, or even with high-flying success. And, as he and book editors also point out, it is an agent's job to get large advances for his clients. Both Dr. Gell-Mann, who had a world of trouble with his book, and Dr. Pinker, for whom all is going smoothly, say they have been quite satisfied with him as an agent.
Mr. Brockman thinks of himself not only as a deal-maker, but as a writer and a traveler in the world of ideas. What draws him to his work, he said, is "the idea of exalting ideas." Perhaps the best description of Mr. Brockman's relationship to science and scientists is that he is a fan, the sort who knows the ins and outs of the game, the hot subjects, the players, the coaches, the statistics and, of course, the salaries, bonuses and intricacies of free agentry. He is a fan who knows the game so well that he has been able to make it his business.
Being able to work with people he admires, promote important ideas, and, along the way, "make a fine living for myself" makes it, Mr. Brockman said, "the best of all possible worlds." He added: "What can I say? It's a great life."

Despite the Boom, a San Francisco Museum Struggles

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
These are palmy days for art museums. With the economy in a spectacular boom, people have the money and the inclination for culture, and many museums have seized the day, expanding their buildings, their collections, their programs and their publics. What, them worry?
Someone apparently forgot to tell San Francisco. 
 The M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, damaged by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, sits surrounded by trusses in Golden Gate Park, unable to forge a consensus either for rebuilding itself there or for moving its collection of Western art out of the park. Some exhibitions have been moved elsewhere to insure their safety. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, meanwhile, is happily ensconced in its two-year-old building, but it remains collection-poor and is struggling to attract the visitors it needs every day to make the move pay.
In the worst position of all is the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, which has been trying to move to larger quarters since the 1970's. The museum's board and administrators are so fixated on relocating that they have spent little energy building the collection or organizing major exhibitions. Yet with interest in all things Asian at an all-time high, museums around the country are vying assiduously for art from Korea, China, Indochina, Japan and the rest of Asia. The Asian Art Museum would have to run pretty hard just to stay in place, and it isn't even doing that, critics say.
"It's tragic that they haven't capitalized on the whole museum movement and the fact that they have such an extraordinary collection," said Walter Shorenstein, a prominent San Francisco real estate developer who, with his late wife, Phyllis, was a major donor to the museum. "They haven't been in the market buying to maintain its position."
The situation is alarming because the Asian Art Museum is the one uncontested art jewel in San Francisco, which for all its own eye-pleasing charms has never really been a place to view world-class art. Only in Asian art could San Francisco compete with the best, thanks to Avery Brundage, the late millionaire builder from Chicago who also headed the International Olympic Committee.
Beginning in the mid-1930's, Brundage succumbed to "the collecting disease," as he put it, amassing a matchless Asian art collection that encompassed bronzes, ceramics, scrolls, ivory and virtually everything except Chinese paintings. Twenty years later, he decided to donate the works. He smiled on San Francisco, which he called "the gateway to the Orient," when the Art Institute of Chicago, which had started its own Asian collection, wanted only some of his treasures.
San Francisco built a new wing on the de Young, and on June 10, 1966, more than a thousand politicians, foreign dignitaries and members of the city's social elite previewed the galleries at a gala involving what The New York Times called "an apparently unlimited supply of California champagne." The next day, the public got its first look at a collection then valued conservatively at $30 million, or about $146 million in today's dollars.
But the museum was never big enough. Ten years ago, its trustees agreed to a plan to turn the city's historic Old Main Library (which departed to a modern building) into the New Asian Art Museum at a projected cost of $110 million.
The plan uncorked a stream of critics. To some, the Beaux-Arts library seemed an incongruous home for Asian art, especially when a brand-new, more appropriate museum could be built for less (the Modern, which was built on land given to it by San Francisco, cost about $63 million). Then the museum discovered it had responsibility for 14 historic Italian panel paintings flanking the library's grand staircase that were not supposed to be altered. When the Asian proposed relocating them, an uproar ensued that still has not been resolved. And art experts have complained about the library's challenging design features, like high ceilings. "It is a curatorial nightmare," said Clarence Shangraw, the museum's former chief curator.
All the while, the Asian's popularity has been sinking. Emily J. Sano, the director, estimates attendance at 225,000 to 250,000 a year and said, "I don't know how it compares with the past." But Mr. Shangraw said there were 650,000 visitors in 1992, the year he left.
A new building and a strong program may bring people back, but acquisitions are more problematic. With just $250,000 a year to spend on purchases, "we don't acquire a lot," Ms. Sano admitted. "We're focusing mainly on the building right now." Some $51 million was raised in a bond issue, and the museum has gathered $41 million from donors, Ms. Sano said. That leaves about $20 million to go in the capital campaign before acquisition money could even be discussed.
The trouble is, the great quest for Asian artworks may be over by the time the Asian Art Museum is ready to get back in the game.
To critics, the remedy for the museum's sorry state begins with the board. "Funding is a major problem for that institution because board members don't give money," Mr. Sangraw said. "The board should face up to the major responsibility of giving money."
One trustee, Chong-Moon Lee, did step forward with a $15 million gift, but it promptly caused another stir. Mr. Lee's name, not Avery Brundage's, will be engraved in the new museum's facade, causing not a few jaws to drop.
"You have to get a more effective board, because they think they're doing fine," Mr. Shorenstein said, though he admits he has no reason to believe that will happen.
For her part, Ms. Sano is sure the museum will move on schedule in 2001. And she has written a different happy ending for the Asian. "When a museum builds a new building, it's an occasion for a lot of gifts," she said. "So I foresee that the collection will grow."

HEADLINE: Jobs Mean Less Crime

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Property Crimes Steadily Decline, Led by Burglary" (front page, Oct. 12), many explanations are given for the welcome changes. Curiously, the dramatic decrease in unemployment, especially since the early 1990's, when the most marked declines occurred, is not among them. 
 Research has shown a clear relationship between unemployment and crime. For example, a 1 percent rise in unemployment is followed a year or so later by an almost 6 percent rise in homicides.
Criminal behavior is too complex to be explained by a single cause. However, by recognizing the important role of employment, we may be more inclined to invest in creating jobs than in building prison cells.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Largely Higher In Light Holiday Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was higher against most leading currencies in a quiet session yesterday after Japan said its trade surplus grew less than expected in August, reducing worries about trade tension between the United States and Japan.
Dealings were light as the Columbus Day holiday left many trading rooms empty or sparsely staffed. 
 "It was basically a nothing day," said Enrico Caruso, a vice president at the Dresdner Bank in New York.
Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 120.80 Japanese yen, up from 119.78 late Friday. The dollar rose to 1.7508 German marks from 1.7486 marks. It eased against the British pound, which fetched $1.6234, compared with $1.6223 on Friday.
Early yesterday, Japan reported that the surplus in its broadest measure of trade rose 77.7 percent in August; analysts had expected an even bigger jump. The report lessened concerns that United States officials might seek a weaker dollar to slow Japanese export growth. American officials have complained in recent weeks about Japan's rising trade surplus, which is spurred by a weak yen that makes Japanese goods cheaper abroad and American products more expensive in Japan.
The yen was also hurt as traders sold it for marks after Germany's central bank raised a money market rate last week. Higher interest rates tend to increase demand for a country's currency, and Japanese interest rates are at record lows.
The mark's strength against the yen helped bolster the German currency against the dollar early in the session. But the dollar reversed course and emerged higher on signs of political stability in Italy after Prime Minister Romano Prodi resigned last week. Yesterday, Italian Communists began talks with leaders of Mr. Prodi's coalition partners, in a move expected to restore Mr. Prodi to power.
The mark had gained from Italy's turmoil as traders thought the problems could deter Italian participation in the planned European common currency, which many felt would strengthen the currency.
Traders also awaited American economic reports this week, including retail sales and consumer prices, in search of any inflationary hints that might move the Federal Reserve to raise rates.

HEADLINE: Crime Is Down All Over

 BODY:
Crime rates have declined for the fifth consecutive year. F.B.I. statistics show that violent crimes fell 6 percent in 1996 from 1995, and national murder rates reached the lowest level since 1969. Property crime rates continue to fall steadily, with burglary down by nearly half since 1980. In New York City, Mayor Rudolph Guiliani has taken credit for a reduction in crimes, large and small. This year homicides in the city are projected to drop to 779, fewer than even the 986 killings recorded in 1968.
Criminologists offer many guesses for why crime is dropping, but in this field where sociology, economics, community attitudes and policing strategies all come into play, few agree on which factors have the biggest impact or how long the trend can last. 
 Most experts say that demographics plays a role. A drop in the number of people in their late teens and early 20's, the age group most likely to commit crimes, has meant fewer potential lawbreakers. But that is about to change. The number of teen-agers is expected to start growing by 1 percent a year for the next 15 years.
Stabilization in the illegal drug markets and fewer turf wars among heavily armed teen-age dealers may also have led to the drop in murder rates. The average age for crack users is going up, perhaps creating a less violent market for the drug. Gun-control laws, community mediation for gangs and law enforcement with zero tolerance for small-time lawbreakers may be changing the atmosphere of casual violence in urban centers. Longer sentences and a near-doubling of the number of inmates in the nation's prisons over the last decade have also kept more career criminals off the streets. A strong economy could be causing some would-be criminals to seek legitimate employment.
But inquire into some of these reasons, and contradictory evidence shows up. Much has been made of New York's success in heading off more serious crimes by cracking down on minor offenses. Yet cities such as Los Angeles that have not embraced this approach have also seen big drops in murder rates in the past five years. Wildly different incarceration rates among states with comparable demographics have not produced dramatically different crime rates.
Historically, urbanization, poverty, family breakdown and changes in social ethos are big determinants of crime. There is no indication that those factors no longer matter. Some even say the latest downswing may be a natural statistical correction, in other words that crime rates had been so high for so long that they were bound to come down.
But whatever the national data suggest, the evidence of everyday life in New York City argues that better policing helps. No one who uses the streets and subways regularly can doubt that police are more visible while criminals are less visible and less bold. Citizens and visitors feel a palpable sense of security that was missing five years ago. Something has happened that seems clearly traceable to better law enforcement strategy, higher arrest rates and more certain sentencing.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Will Northeast Utilities survive New Hampshire's rate cutting?

BYLINE: By Agis Salpukas

 BODY:
UTILITY deregulation, which has many states scrambling to come up with large rate cuts, has put New Hampshire in a nasty bind. Regulators and politicians have raised hopes that residents will soon see big declines in rates, which are the highest in the nation, but now they are struggling to deliver.
To do so, they run the risk of forcing the state's largest utility, Public Service of New Hampshire, into bankruptcy and giving further shocks to stockholders of its parent company, Northeast Utilities. The troubles are an extreme example of what some other states have in store as deregulation spreads. 
 Northeast's stock had already fallen last year after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shut down the company's Millstone nuclear plant in Connecticut because of problems with operating procedures. But what sent Northeast Utilities shares plunging this year was the push to force the utility to cut rates in New Hampshire.
An investment adviser to the utility recently warned regulators that unless they backed off, the utility might default on about $500 million of securities that have to be refinanced next spring. The state, the adviser warned, needs to reassure worried stockholders.
In a recent report on Northeast Utilities, Penelope Adelmann, a utility analyst for Gruntal & Company, recommended that any investors without the stomach for risky speculation should sell the stock. She predicted that the state's Public Utility Commission would continue to press for rate cuts and that the utility would continue to use the courts to block them.
Hopes have been raised over the last year as thousands of residents of New Hampshire saw their electric bills cut 15 to 20 percent under the nation's first pilot program to study the impact of opening a state's utilities to competition. New Hampshire has received wide publicity for being the first to give deregulation a try. And local politicians, including the Democratic Governor, Jeanne Shaheen, who pushed for the experiment, have basked in the resulting good will.
But the ability to expand the pilot program has been crippled by past commitments the state made to help put Public Service of New Hampshire back on its feet after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1988. Just 17,000 customers are now part of the pilot program. But, under pressure to pass the savings on to the rest of the state's 500,000 utility customers, the state's Public Utilities Commission issued an order aimed at deregulating the utility industry by next July 1 and cutting rates across the board by about 20 percent.
Public Service of New Hampshire, which serves more than 80 percent of the state's utilities customers, is bearing the main force of the drive for lower rates. After the commission's order was issued, Northeast Utilities' stock fell 17 percent in two days, from $11.625 to $9.625, a loss of $273 million in market value.
Fearing that the order would erode its revenue and force it to put a lower value on some assets, thus violating some of its agreements with the creditors who had forced it into bankruptcy, the utility filed a suit in Federal court in Rhode Island. A judge there issued a temporary restraining order that threw the whole deregulation experiment into legal limbo.
What becomes apparent in New Hampshire is that even when anyone is allowed to sell power in the state, they can offer customers only relatively small savings -- 5 percent at most. To make the savings significant in a pilot program, then, New Hampshire had to mandate that its utilities provide a 10 percent rate cut to some customers, which means they lost money on those customers.
In the utility's reorganization plan, it is committed to a certain level of revenues and a certain value for its plants. But the utility argues that if New Hampshire insists on similar large savings for the rest of its customers, its revenues would be so low that it would end up in default. The lower value it would have to put on plants that would no longer be economical would also violate the terms of the plan.
During hearings on whether rates should be reduced, the commission heard some sobering testimony from Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the managing director of the investment firm Rothschild Inc., who was acting as a financial adviser to the utility. Continuing pressure to cut rates, he warned, has led investors to view the utility "as a highly volatile, politically charged venture capital situation." While some have blamed the problems at the Millstone plant for the stock's decline, Mr. Ross said the stock market had already discounted those problems.
The warnings that deep rate cuts would financially damage the utility and its investors seemed to have an effect yesterday when the commission ordered a temporary rate cut of a modest 6.4 percent as of Dec. 1. How much utility bills will actually drop remains in doubt, for the utility expects to ask for a rate increase to offset higher fuel costs.
The temporary rates will be in effect until next year, when permanent rates are set by the commission, which is under a deadline to deregulate the industry by July 1.
That the commission apparently heeded the utility's pleas and made no huge rate cuts now helped Northeast Utilities stock price, which gained 12.5 cents, to $10.9375, yesterday.
But the state's pilot program has raised such high expectations for deep rate cuts that the issue of how the state will deliver has not gone away.

HEADLINE: A Self-Made Man Takes On Newark;
Shy Philanthropist Gives His Time And Money to New Arts Center

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
Few have ever heard of Raymond G. Chambers. That's just the way he wants it.
But when the $180 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center opens its doors on Saturday night, everyone there will owe Mr. Chambers a debt of gratitude. The obsessively private, philanthropic Mr. Chambers was not only the first to believe that Newark could be revived through a major cultural arts center, but also the first to pledge money, $12 million in all, and the first to rally other wealthy businessmen and public officials to the cause. 
 But the center is not Mr. Chambers's only achievement. Since he became a full-time philanthropist about a decade ago, he has given away millions of dollars, much of it to charities, schools and nonprofit groups in New Jersey, and has been a mentor to dozens of disadvantaged children.
In a region filled with wealthy and generous people, Mr. Chambers, 55, stands apart. He is one of the few wealthy, self-made Americans who have given up making money, long before retirement, to devote themselves full time to giving it away. What George Soros, the Hungarian-born financier, is to international philanthropy, Mr. Chambers is to New Jersey.
"Newark can and should be a great city," Mr. Chambers said last week in one of his rare interviews. "It's got a seaport, an airport, mass transit and proximity to Manhattan. All it needs is an after-dark life."
Fans and friends who have watched Mr. Chambers applaud his willingness to part so easily with his fortune, which Forbes magazine estimated at $200 million in 1986, the last year he made the list of the 400 wealthiest Americans. But, they add, he has given even more generously of his time, and has skillfully used his own donations to get the most out of the contributions of others.
It is hard to estimate his charitable contributions, since he will not talk about them and has asked his family and friends not to discuss him or his donations. But according to public records, Mr. Chambers has given away either directly or through a network of foundations more than $50 million, probably much more, since becoming wealthy through Wesray Capital Corporation. Wesray is a private partnership that specialized in leveraged buyouts that he formed in 1981 with William E. Simon, who was Treasury Secretary under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.
Tax filings at the Foundation Center and its Historical Foundation Collection in Indianapolis show that he has given away more than $30 million through the MCJ Foundation, his family foundation in Morristown, N.J., which is named after his three children, Michael, Christine and Jennifer. Another $10 million endowment pledge created a program called Ready, or Rigorous Educational Assistance for Deserving Youth, which has helped thousands of disadvantaged schoolchildren in Newark with money and Mr. Chambers's time.
In 1990, inspired by a speech by President George Bush, he helped finance and found Points of Light Foundation in Washington. The group, on whose board Mr. Chambers sits, provides about $10 million a year in guidance to volunteer organizations throughout the country. And although Mr. Chambers has consistently understated his role, President Clinton described him as the sparkplug of a bipartisan volunteerism summit last spring in Philadelphia. He is also the chief executive officer of America's Promise, the Washington group created to insure that those who attended the summit fulfill their pledges.
"I can't think of anyone in New Jersey who gives more than he does," said James C. Kellogg, president of the Community Foundation of New Jersey, a major charity in the state.
The son of a steel warehouse office manager, Mr. Chambers was born and raised in the West Ward of Newark. He worked his way through Rutgers University in Newark, playing the piano and keyboards in a band. He remains close to his fellow band members, formerly the Ray-Tones, now the Accidentals. He still plays with them occasionally.
He became a tax accountant with the Newark office of Price Waterhouse in the mid-1960's and started a nursing home care company in 1968. By the time he was 25, he had made his first $1 million. The millions multiplied with Wesray.
But as his earnings accumulated, Mr. Simon said, his partner seemed to grow increasingly dissatisfied with wealth, ever more eager to begin paying back, as he now calls it. There were rumors that his partnership with Mr. Simon, who is as extroverted as Mr. Chambers is shy, was marked by great friction, which both men deny. They still have investments together, dine often with each other's families and call each other friend. But Mr. Chambers ended active participation in the firm by the late 1980's.
It was about that time that Gov. Thomas H. Kean was having trouble generating corporate support for what was then just a dream of reviving riot-torn Newark by building a major performing arts center there. Mr. Chambers was the first to pledge $5 million from his Amelior Foundation, Mr. Kean recalled recently. Others say Mr. Chambers then called a few friends and business associates, many of whom were skeptical about the idea, and would not stop pressing them until they came on board.
Since then, Mr. Chambers has given $7 million more in gifts that honor other donors and performing arts center officials, said Lawrence P. Goldman, the center's chief executive officer. Mr. Chambers recruited Mr. Goldman from Carnegie Hall, and when Mr. Goldman turned 50, gave another $100,000 to the center in Mr. Goldman's name.
Mr. Chambers's shyness evaporates when he talks about Newark. "No city can revive without a middle class," Mr. Chambers said, saying that the city's population of 406,000 before the riots has dropped to 275,000. "And you can't have a middle class without an after-dark life."
That is why it was so important to build a performing arts center in Newark, he continued. "More than 50,000 people commute into Newark every day and leave at night. All of us felt that the center would be a way of keeping them here."
Nothing seems to make Mr. Chambers more uncomfortable than talking about himself. Tall and fit, with silver strands in his neatly combed hair, Mr. Chambers looks like a cross between Robert Redford and Ted Turner. Because his smile is so ready and his enthusiasm for his work so obvious, the equally obvious anguish generated by a personal inquiry is all the more striking.
He would not talk about his wife, Patricia, or their children. Friends say that for such a wealthy man, he lives fairly modestly in Morristown. They joke about his penchant for giving credit to everyone except himself; "Chamberisms," they call his consistent praise of others for what he has done.
He can be relentless in his fervor to get others involved. Chuck Hirsch, a longtime friend and fellow philanthropist-entrepreneur, recalled an incident at his own wedding in Oregon last November. "I was in the midst of a dance with my bride and stepped away to talk to Ray. 'Hey, Chuck,' he told me, 'I'm working on this Presidential summit and I want to talk to you about getting involved.' I told him that I'd love to talk about it, but after my honeymoon," Mr. Hirsch said.
Nor is Mr. Chambers discouraged by occasional failure, like his lost investments in the New Era charity, a Ponzi scheme whose investors claimed losses of $700 million.
Mr. Chambers's other passion is being a mentor to students. "There is nothing that can make a difference in a young person's life as much as the presence, even part time, of a caring adult," he said. Mr. Chambers intends to bring a young man he has long advised to the gala: Atif Crawford, 18, who was born not far from where Mr. Chambers was born and whose tuition at the Salisbury School, a private school in Connecticut, he has helped pay.
Mr. Chambers beams with parental pride when speaking about Mr. Crawford, who is the quarterback on his school's football team. They met, Mr. Chambers said, when Mr. Crawford was 8 years old at a Newark Boys Club during a Ready board meeting. "Atif looked us over and said that he wanted to compliment the board on how well we looked that day," Mr. Chambers said.
Mr. Crawford, whose father died when he was young, says that there is no man he admires more than "Mr. C," as he calls his mentor. "He never yells," he said. "He's so calm. He's a father to me."
Newark has thousands of young men and women just like Mr. Crawford, Mr. Chambers said. "All they need is a break."
The best way of helping disadvantaged children and the needy, Mr. Chambers said, is through the "public-private partnerships that we've seen at the Philadelphia summit and now at the performing arts center." While the private sector cannot replace government, or substitute for its resources, he said, "government alone cannot work without private, caring people."
The greatest threat to America's democracy and economic vitality, he added, "is the ever-widening gap between the haves and have-nots."
As for his passion for privacy about his giving, much of which is done anonymously, Mr. Chambers had a ready and compelling explanation. "When one gives to help others, the greatest satisfaction comes from getting nothing in return."
 
What They Gave, and What They Got
Here are some of the largest gifts from corporate sponsors to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark and what the sponsors are receiving in return, according to M. John Richard, the center's senior vice president for development and public affairs.
 
Prudential
The insurance company, which employs 7,000 people in Newark, donated a total of $6.5 million to the capital campaign in 1990 and 1996, taking advantage of what Mr. Richard called a naming opportunity. The center's biggest theater is being called Prudential Hall. The company also contributed a separate $250,000 donation in June to be one of four co-sponsors of the grand opening gala on Saturday.
 
Pepsi
In exchange for a $500,000 contribution in cash and free advertising, Pepsi will be the "official soft drink" of the Performing Arts Center. Only Pepsi products will be served at the center's bars and restaurants for five years. The company is also producing more than six million commemorative cans of Diet Pepsi.
 
Continental Airlines
The airline gave $250,000 worth of free and subsidized seats on its domestic and international flights for three years for the center's architects, consultants, performers and other associates. In exchange, the center will promote Continental, which has a hub at Newark, as its "official airline."
 
The CIT Group
CIT, a $1 million capital campaign donor, is also the $250,000 title sponsor of the new center's International Orchestra Series, which includes six now sold-out performances. It will be able to use its seats and boxes to entertain clients at the center, a common corporate practice at sports events.
 
Chase Manhattan Bank
The bank contributed $600,000 to the capital campaign. In return for a $400,000 commitment, Chase will sponsor for seven years the center's electronic billboard welcoming guests and publicizing coming performances. The bank has also pledged $50,000 to sponsor a concert by Mandy Patinkin, and will be the host for a reception for clients before the performance.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Restoring a French Antique;
New Wave Chief Brings Life to a Creaky Conglomerate

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
When Jean-Marie Messier was tapped 16 months ago to run Compagnie Generale des Eaux, he was taking charge of the top dinosaur in the Jurassic Park of French industry.
A sprawling conglomerate that outgrew its beginnings as a water utility to become the country's biggest private employer, Generale had its hands in everything from casinos and parking lots to telecommunications and real estate. But as the paradigm of a French big business culture that has long been unfocused, inward-looking, paternalistic and enamored of bureaucracy, not to mention just plain stodgy, Generale was a dinosaur in distress. When Mr. Messier took over, it had piled up $9.6 billion in debt and recently finished 1995 with its first loss ever, $624 million. 
 Mr. Messier, a perfect example of the young (he is now all of 40), modern manager on the move in Europe, has managed to hold off extinction. He quickly rid Generale of $5.3 billion of nonessential assets, trimmed the work force 10 percent, to 200,000, and sealed a series of alliances, many with non-French companies that brought $3 billion into Generale's depleted coffers. The company was in the black again last year, with net profits of $320 million on revenues of $28.5 billion, about the size of Motorola.
"We had to reform strongly and abruptly," Mr. Messier said in an interview in his office here. "Now, we are in a position to be more aggressive."
Whether he can continue to teach his dinosaur new tricks has ramifications that go far beyond Generale. Managers like Mr. Messier are struggling throughout France and much of Europe to join the new world economic order at a time when the old order is not quite yet ready to give up the ghost. The old ways have left Europe with a stagnant economy, marked by painfully high unemployment rates and an urgent need to go abroad to grow.
Steeped in the Continent's traditions but also comfortable with the brasher business practices of the United States, Mr. Messier and his peers are racing the clock to wean their companies from their ossified ways as Europe itself races toward full economic union to meet the growing challenge of foreign competition. The efforts of Mr. Messier and the others could send ripples across the Atlantic, and beyond.
The final verdict is not yet in, of course. But Mr. Messier's accomplishments have already made him "one of the two or three major players in French capitalism," said Elie Cohen, a leading academic economist. Among the others, Mr. Cohen lists Francois Pinault, head of Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, the giant retailing group that recently began a $5 billion takeover bid for a rival, Worms & Compagnie, and Claude Bebear, chairman of the big Axa insurance group.
Mr. Cohen points to Mr. Messier's peculiar weave of French and non-French qualities. Mr. Messier possesses, he said, "the ability to manage political interests, the interests of the company and his personal interests." He added, "This is quite French." But he is also "the first man at Generale to speak in terms of shareholder value," Mr. Cohen said.
Mr. Messier represents a break in matters of style as well as substance. Married and the father of five, he dresses casually and has an easy manner, a firm grasp of numbers and a flair for salesmanship. A fluent speaker of English, he talks readily about globalization and return on equity, terms often absent from the French business vocabulary. And he is chummy with employees, capable of the kind of egalitarian gesture his septuagenarian predecessor, Guy Dejouany, was never guilty of making.
Earlier this year, for instance, Mr. Messier invited 5,000 employees under the age of 30 to a kind of town meeting in Paris, where he explained his goals, fielded questions for more than two hours and then was host of a dinner and dance.
For all his groundbreaking moves, however, Mr. Messier has been careful not to cut off Generale totally from its roots: the company is still landing the kind of big Government contracts that have long been its bread and butter.
Mr. Messier can pull off all these disparate feats because he is a child of the very establishment he is shaking up. Like much of France's business and political elite, he is a graduate of the revered Ecole Nationale d'Administration. As a former aide to the conservative Finance Minister, and later Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, he had good political connections, and as a partner at Lazard Freres & Company, the venerable investment bank, he came with the right calling card to enter the inner sanctum of corporate decision making.
To be sure, some students of the French economy see a kind of inevitability in what Mr. Messier has achieved at Generale. Helie de Pourtales, a retired Lazard partner in Paris, after praising Mr. Messier as a "very special kind of guy," said, "If I ask the question, 'Where do you think a company like that should go?' most people would give the same answer." There was, he added, "nothing particularly original in that thinking."
Perhaps not, but the execution seems to have been masterful and the payoff substantial.
When Mr. Messier took control of Generale, it was delivering services like water and cable television in cozy relationships with municipal governments across France. Its executives, who saw their business as heavily dependent on political favor, were suspected of making illegal donations to political parties, and Mr. Dejouany, whose reign had endured more than two decades, was under investigation, with a clutch of other Generale managers. (The investigations are continuing, though there have been no indictments.)
And like many French giants, Generale was in abysmal financial shape. Numerous acquisitions had produced a mountain of debt and bad real estate investments had pushed the company into the red. Between the criminal investigations and the financial woes, many began to wonder whether Generale would be able to squeeze the potential from the new businesses it was entering, including TV and telecommunications.
Mr. Messier's youth -- he was 39 when named to the top job, the equivalent of chairman and chief executive -- caused some captains of French industry on Generale's board, like the feisty chairman of Peugeot, Jacques Calvet, to question whether he was up to the task of turning things around.
But Mr. Messier quickly showed just how aggressive he could be. He mopped up the real estate problems, concentrating the company's property holdings in a newly created subsidiary. And he shaved Generale's net debt -- by the end of this year, he hopes to cut it to $5.3 billion.
His goal now is to focus on three core businesses -- water and energy, property development and media and telecommunications -- and to raise shareholders' returns.
Toward that end, the company is tapping its rich experience in the French water and utilities market to expand abroad, where it is carving out a lucrative business in countries that expect shortfalls in water and energy supplies. Alliances will be the key to the effort. For example, Mr. Messier has formed a joint venture with the Marubeni Corporation of Japan to build power plants.
Intensely loyal to his predecessor, Mr. Messier believes the foundations for future growth were set by Mr. Dejouany in the early 1990's, when Generale acquired shares in Havas, a leading French media group, and in the television network Canal Plus, as well as a stake in Air and Water Technologies. Yet Mr. Dejouany, who was 75 when he retired, "knew he was not the one to be able to make the changes," Mr. Messier said. "So he chose someone from the outside."
Mr. Messier long showed a penchant for getting things done, and often in new ways.
After getting his degree at the Ecole Nationale, he went to work for Mr. Balladur, designing and putting into effect the first plans for privatization in France since the postwar nationalization of major industries.
In 1988, after the conservatives lost control of Parliament to the Socialists, Mr. Messier moved to Lazard, which sent him to New York for five months. On returning to France, he became a general partner in Lazard's Paris operations, where his clients included Generale and Mr. Dejouany. He joined Generale in 1994 as chief executive, taking over the chairman's spot as well in June 1996.
Mr. Messier brought with him a keen understanding of how French business works. He used his ties to Lazard and his connections to Mr. Balladur, who become Prime Minister when the conservatives briefly regained power in the 1990's, not only to arrive where he is, but also to make the changes he felt were necessary. He insisted that decisions regarding Generale were made on their financial and industrial merits and pointedly noted that he was skiing in the Alps the day last February when the Government awarded Generale the French national railway's 5,160-mile fiber optic network. Generale is to use the network to create the country's second wired phone system, to compete with the national system run by France Telecom. But others point out how much of Mr. Messier's time is spent massaging politicians.
Havas is a case in point.
In 1986, Mr. Messier helped privatize Havas, which he has since taken into the fold by raising Generale's holdings to a controlling stake. Now, he must use his political strength to influence legislation proposed by the Socialist Government that in effect would lessen corporate control over broadcasters like Canal Plus, which Havas controls.
In some ways, the pressures to change Generale are the same as those pushing the entire French economy to overhaul itself. With the stagnation of France's utilities sector, where annual growth is 3 to 4 percent, Mr. Messier is forced to reduce Generale's reliance on domestic public contracts and to go to Latin America and Asia, where the market is expanding by up to 20 percent. Overseas revenues now account for roughly one-third of the company's total, against one-fourth five years ago, and continue to rise. To pay for the expansion, Mr. Messier must raise capital, and he has lured international investors into the shareholder circle. Now, almost 40 percent of the shareholders are from abroad, mainly large American and British investment funds, compared with 30 percent two years ago.
Bankers say it is their presence that is driving the new focus on core businesses. When buying a French stock, fund managers "will penalize conglomerates that do not represent a brand name," said Arnault de Torquat, managing director of Salomon Brothers in Paris.
Certainly, Mr. Messier knows his strategy is not without risk. Numerous large companies with considerable experience in utilities and water management are jockeying for shares of the international market, for example. And for all of Generale's new-found strength in telecommunications, the full opening of the European market, which takes effect on Jan. 1, could spark cut-throat pricing and a collapse of revenues.
Pierre Coiffet, an analyst at the financial services group Paribas, says this uncertainty contributed to a weakening of Generale's share price in recent months, following a surge after Mr. Messier's appointment. Still, Mr. Coiffet recommends Generale for its long-term prospects.
"The story," he said, "is continuing."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Hostile Bids And Mergers Rise in Europe

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Europe became the staging ground today for a burst of mergers and hostile takeover bids potentially worth more than $100 billion, as corporate buccaneers from France to Italy to Britain were pitted against each other in at least three different industries.
In the insurance industry, Italy's largest insurer, Generali, announced a $9 billion hostile bid for AGF of France. Just two weeks ago, AGF had teamed up with the Agnelli family of Italy to hammer out a $5.4 billion "friendly" takeover of a separate French insurance company that was the target of Generali's desires. Generali's offer was almost immediately rebuffed. 
 Generali's surprise offer today came just one day after the Zurich Group of Switzerland and B.A.T. Industries of Britain announced that they were in "advanced" talks about merging their insurance and financial service businesses into a new company worth more than $30 billion.
In the beverage industry, Guinness and Grand Metropolitan moved closer to their planned $20 billion merger by cutting a deal with the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which had vowed to block the marriage. The head of LVMH, Bernard Arnault, had been pushing for its own big stake in the combined company.
Meanwhile, the British-Dutch publishing company, Reed Elsevier, announced a merger with a Dutch publisher, and two northern European banks proposed a $10.7 billion merger.
As if that were not enough, the French cement maker Lafarge announced a $2.8 billion hostile bid for Redlands, a British manufacturer of building materials.
While there was no connection between any of these deals, at least part of the driving force, analysts said, was Europe's accelerating push toward a single currency in 1999, the increasingly transparent flow of goods and services across national borders and the growing trend toward global markets. As Europe moves closer toward a single economy, the national fiefs are rushing to shore up their European position.
The extraordinary gyrations highlighted the tough new brand of empire-building that has seized European industry, where hostile takeovers were rare until recently in any place outside Britain.
That is particularly true in the staid insurance industry, now at the center of a cross-border pileup featuring executives who would have fit in with some of America's legendary corporate combatants: a French corporate raider reminiscent of T. Boone Pickens; a "white knight" company that rode in to to fend off the raider, and a surprise attacker with sights on the white knight.
But it also reflects the growing influence of a more bare-knuckled American approach to mergers and acquisitions. American investment banks have been advisers on many of Europe's biggest mergers over the last few years, and their tactics have been embraced by European institutions like Lazard Brothers, which had a role in several deals today, and Banque Paribas of France and Credit Suisse First Boston.
"The investment bankers have been working very hard to fan the flames of the perception that action is required," remarked Jonathan Lawlor of HBSC James Capel in London. "The sequence of transactions has been remarkable."
For those in search of corporate intrigue, it would be hard to match the frenzy of machinations that have swept through Europe's insurance industry in recent days.
In one corner is a maverick French entrepreneur named Francois Pinault, who has amassed a sprawling conglomerate of companies include the American luggage manufacturer Samsonite. Mr. Pinault began a $5 billion hostile bid several weeks ago for Worms et Cie of France. Worms, itself a product of a recent merger, has a prized asset named Athena. But with Worms's stock languishing, analysts say Mr. Pinault wanted to break up Worms and unlock the real value in Athena.
It was the kind of move that brought both fame and notoriety to people like T. Boone Pickens, who wanted to break loose the value of Gulf Oil and other petroleum companies with huge oil reserves.
But the family heirs of Worms fought back by enlisting a white knight to make a rival bid, financed by Italy's pre-eminent Agnelli family, which is also a Worms shareholders. By teaming up with the French insurer AGF, the Agnellis would control Worms and AGF would control Athena, thereby thwarting the unwelcomed bid from Mr. Pinault. AGF, formally known as Assurances Generales de France, already owned 7 percent of Worms and had wanted to acquire the Athena insurance company for well over a year. The Agnelli family, whose members are the major stockholders in Fiat, already owned 20 percent of Worms and agreed to take control.
But today's offer by Assicurazioni Generali tried to upend all that. Generali signaled its interest in Athena probably because the company had little presence in France and wanted to expand its Europe-wide position. By moving in on AGF, Generali could conceivably end up in control of both it and Athena.
Analysts say that the competition for Athena was merely the latest move toward consolidation in Europe's insurance industry. Less than one year ago, France's two biggest insurance companies -- Axa S.A. and Union Assurances des Paris -- united in a $10 billion merger.
"With the European Monetary Union coming along and national boundaries coming down, major insurance companies want representation across Europe," said Derek Elias, an insurance industry analyst at Banque Paribas. The problem, he added, is that there are only a small number of companies available for those who want to expand rapidly outside their own country.
That pressure has also been behind the Zurich Group's headlong expansion. Zurich bought the Kemper Corporation, a life insurance and mutual fund company for $2 billion in 1995. (The Kemper Insurance Companies of Long Grove, Ill., including four mutual property and casualty companies, were not a part of the acquisition.) Several months ago, Zurich began to negotiate on taking control of the insurance operations of London-based B.A.T. Industries.
On Sunday, after two British newspapers reported that the talks were taking place, the two companies acknowledged that they were discussing a merger of their insurance and financial-service businesses that analysts say would be worth from $32 billion to $35 billion.
Investors reacted jubilantly to the disclosure today, bidding up the stock of both companies. B.A.T., which would effectively liberate its insurance businesses from their linkage with its big tobacco operations, saw its shares climb 10 percent, or 58 pence, to 609 pence. The Zurich Group's stock jumped 7 percent, or 41 Swiss francs, to 641 francs. Analysts said the company's biggest gain would be acquiring a sales force of more than 14,000 people in the United States through B.A.T.'s American insurance subsidiary, the Farmers Insurance Group.

LVMH Now Backs Merger Of Grand Met And Guinness

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Ending a messy war over the future of the European spirits business, Guinness P.L.C. and Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. said yesterday that they would forge ahead with their $20 billion merger, this time with the blessing of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., which had said it would try to block the deal.
For his concessions, LVMH's chief executive, Bernard Arnault, is to gain control of most of the drinks distribution network of the new company, which will be known as GMG Brands, as well as a seat on its board. LVMH is also to receive 500 million, or about $810 million, split evenly between cash and a special dividend that would be distributed to all GMG shareholders. 
 Investors applauded the news, seeing savings, economies of scale and the end of what had been expected to be a protracted battle. In London, the shares of Guinness rose 28.5 pence, to 605.5 pence, and those of Grand Met were up 21 pence, to 604 pence; in Paris, LVMH stock rose 25 francs a share, to 1,248.
The news came as a surprise to many analysts, because Mr. Arnault has previously shown a taste for lengthy fights.
Guinness and Grand Met said in May that they intended to merge their drinks and foods businesses, which together make up the lion's share of the European spirits business, as well as Guinness beer and Grand Met's Burger King restaurants and Pillsbury food units.
Mr. Arnault, who owns stakes in both Guinness and Grand Met and whose luxury-goods company owns several high-end spirits, including Moet et Chandon and Hennessy Cognac, opposed the merger, lest he end up a lesser player in liquor.
Mr. Arnault instead proposed that Guinness, Grand Met and LVMH merge their drink businesses, that Grand Met spin off its food entities and that Guinness get rid of its breweries. He also sought a 35 percent stake in that merged company.
Guinness and Grand Met took a dim view of Mr. Arnault's proposal. He then began to increase his stake in Grand Met, raising it to 11.1 percent. Though he cut his position in Guinness, he kept an 11.47 percent stake. That gave him more than the 10 percent needed to call a special shareholder meeting at each company.
Eventually, the parties came to the bargaining table. Under yesterday's 10-year agreement, the current drinks distribution ventures of LVMH and Guinness in the United States, Asia and France are now to include Grand Met brands. LVMH is to retain the 66 percent it owns in its own drinks business, Moet Hennessy, and the 34 percent that Guinness owns will go into GMG Brands.
It was not immediately clear yesterday whether there were three moderate winners or three partial losers emerging from the deal. "It was a good settlement for both sides," said Russell Duckworth, an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London. "Guinness and Grand Met have come to an agreement with LVMH and reduced the risk of them disrupting the deal. But they paid for it by giving up their side of the benefits of distribution."
The merged parties estimate that the reconfigured distribution network will save them about 20 million each annually in costs. But there is some question as to how much that savings may be worth, since Mr. Arnault's support came at so high a price. And while Mr. Arnault expressed pleasure in the deal, it is not as sweet as the one he had proposed.
"It is disappointing to see that LVMH is not coming in 100 percent," said Martin Hawkins, an analyst at Greig Middleton in London. "It would have been unusual if Grand Met didn't go through with Guinness anyway, so this added nothing to the merger but cured what would have been a lingering aggravation."
Mr. Arnault may have conceded earlier than he would have liked because he had trouble convincing investors that his alternative proposition was worth the end result.
LVMH shares have suffered recently as sales of its luxury fashion, leather and spirits businesses have been sluggish, in part because of a weaker yen which has limited spending overseas by Japanese travelers.
Some of Mr. Arnault's biggest shareholders may well have been clamoring for results. "I thought he would fight it out," said Cedric Magnelia, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. "But a lot of large institutional investors would not support his proposition."
On the other hand, Mr. Arnault may use his new board seat, his hand in distribution and his generally aggressive nature to push for the break of assets he has sought.
"Both managements have looked in the past and wondered if the groups together make sense," said an investment banker who worked on the deal and spoke on the condition of anonymity. "If it makes sense from shareholder viewpoint, I am sure they will consider it."
Regulatory agencies in the United States and Europe have yet to sign off on the merger. The European Union has already expressed some concern about GMG's possible dominant market position in Greece, Spain, Belgium and Ireland. European regulators may force the new company to shed some holdings; in that case, it would most likely get rid of secondary brands.
Some analysts said they thought that regulators would cause little trouble, but others worried that selling pieces of the company would erode the point of the merger, which was to dominate all aspects of the spirits business.
"The story of the late 80's was spirits companies wrestling back control of third-party distribution," Mr. Hawkins noted. "Now, the regulatory authorities are trying to push back the clock by removing vertical integration."

Networks and N.F.L.: Heading North Again?

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
Pat Bowlen tried not to sound boastful. But you couldn't fault him if he bragged a smidgen thanks to the leverage the National Football League has on its TV "partners." Bowlen, who owns the Denver Broncos and heads the N.F.L.'s broadcasting committee, reckons that very soon, the networks will agree to pay "somewhere north of 50 percent" more than they are paying now.
The league is in the final season of being paid $4.38 billion over four years by ABC, NBC, Fox, ESPN and TNT. A new deal worth $6.6 billion isn't bad. 
 "This is a good position," Bowlen said yesterday from Washington, where N.F.L. owners will meet today and tomorrow. "I wouldn't want to characterize it that we have great leverage and we want to hold a gun to their heads. But N.F.L. programming is very important to the networks."
On the surface, a 50 percent-plus raise seems antithetical to logical economics. The league's overall trend in Nielsen ratings is downward. NBC's has fallen from a 12.5 in 1994 to an 8.6 so far this year. After a 17.8 in 1994, ABC's "Monday Night Football" is down to a 14.8 through this season.
However, Fox is up a bit to a 10.4 so far this season, but still down from a 12.5 for all of 1995. TNT is up to a 6.3 from a 5.4 at this time last year.
Why pay more for a product with diminishing results, and one that has lost its presence in Los Angeles, Houston and Cleveland since the current deal began? Because demand outstrips supply. CBS wants in, to avenge being deposed by Fox. And even at a reduced rating, the N.F.L. is the mightiest of all sports. And no network would spurn a chance to broadcast a Super Bowl.
"The ratings don't matter," said Bowlen. "I really think they don't impact us at all." He said that even a rising ratings trend would not affect the N.F.L.'s anticipated booty. It's the N.F.L. Just pay, baby.
Lower ratings "give the networks ammunition to talk about the problems they're having, and how advertisers are beating them up on ratings," said Neal Pilson, an industry consultant, who ran CBS Sports when the Laurence Tisch regime bid adieu to its National Football Conference package. "The league listens to them, and says, 'O.K., here's your number.' "
Serious discussions between the N.F.L. and the networks won't begin until after Nov. 1, when the incumbent networks' exclusive negotiating period ends. After that, CBS can enter on the broadcast side to challenge ABC, Fox and NBC, and Fox Sports Net on the cable side, to vie against ESPN and TNT. The money dance -- all orchestrated by the N.F.L. -- may drag on until January.
Bowlen would not speculate on the specifics of what each network must pay to keep its package, but he said Fox must pay "more than a token increase" above its $395-million-a-year fee for the N.F.C. "They're adamant at keeping what they have at their price," he said, "which is easy to say at their level."
The league seems to have the most leverage with ABC, which has paid $230 million a year since 1994 for the struggling network's highest rated show, after a 2 percent increase from the previous contract.
Sounds like real leverage. "You said it," said Bowlen. He would not say whether NBC has to leap up from $217 million a year to $330 million or more. But a 50 percent increase would mean $325 million.
"I can't speak for the networks' agendas," he said. "I can't get inside their heads or their businesses, but we know that all the networks consider our product important to their business strategies. We know why Fox did it, and even though their agenda is different now, they're not backing away."
In 1993, NBC loudly carped about its losses, but, faced with losing its A.F.C. package, it anted up. Now, no one is publicly complaining about losses or ratings, a sign that nobody wants to end up like CBS. The new CBS, looking to return, doesn't want to end up like the old CBS either.
"The landscape has changed since the Fox deal," Bowlen said. "We saw what the N.F.L. has done for Fox and for Fox's position in television."
Said Pilson: "The N.F.L. says, 'The values of carrying the N.F.L. are so high that you don't even have to make a profit on it -- other things in your company can make money.' " Gone are the days when the three networks could bargain a rights-fee reduction, as they did in the late 1980's. "The league had no leverage without a willing fourth party," Pilson said.
The N.F.L. is perceived to be so crucial, post-CBS, that Bowlen anticipates that Fox would like more than the N.F.C. package it has. "They'd like to add, take your pick, cable, or another broadcast package," he said. "They could take a swipe at the whole thing on Sunday afternoon. I don't know if that's in our best interest, but there's been conversation about it."
He doubted that the league would carve a new Thursday night package to accommodate CBS, thus providing something for everybody. "Creating a new package dilutes the current packages too much," he said.
But for a whopping, eye-popping sum? "Anything's possible," he said.
Pilson figures that CBS will target "Monday Night." He added: "If they want to pay, they have to lose $50 million to $100 million a year. I think CBS would pay $350 million now to get 'Monday Night Football.' "
Sweet, lush music to Bowlen's ears.
 
AIRWAVES
KEITH OLBERMANN's first assignment for NBC Sports since going to work for MSNBC will be serving as co-host with HANNAH STORM of the World Series pre-game show. . . . Primestar's bid to become the N.F.L.'s second direct broadcast satellite provider was nixed. Direct TV will retain its exclusive.

HEADLINE: How to Make Big Rubles? Invest in a Comrade's Debt

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
Stanislav Baranov sat in the computer-filled trading room at Rossiisky Kredit Bank, barely able to contain his glee.
He had made a big investment in Almazy Rossii-Sakha, Russia's biggest diamond-mining company, at a time when its outlook was shaky. Now, less than six months later, people were clamoring to buy him out at a big profit. "I'm holding it," he said with a roguish trader's grin. "We're not selling until it becomes worth more." 
 Victories like this are the bread of life for securities traders on Wall Street -- except that Mr. Baranov doesn't invest in stocks or bonds. He trades in unpaid bills. Hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid, overdue bills.
He is not alone. Russia's mountain of overdue debt has spawned one of the biggest and strangest developments yet on this country's rocky road to capitalism: a $15 billion market in i.o.u.'s. Known here as "veksels," many are redeemable for cash, as the diamond company's are. Others are good for oil, electricity, tires, chemicals or cement.
Whatever their form, the use of veksels has exploded in the last year. Companies issue them to pay their suppliers, which barter them for other goods or resell them to speculators for cash.
Banks and brokerage companies trade more than $100 million worth of them each month, and post prices for them on the Internet. Even a few American investors are snapping them up, viewing them as a Russian variant on American high-yield junk bonds.
The trade in veksels is a very primitive version of a corporate bond market, though one that is largely unregulated and often informal. In some cases it is similar to the practice in the United States of bundling mortgages, car loans or even troubled loans from distressed companies into securities that are sold to investors.
In many respects, swapping veksels is the financial equivalent of keeping the Mir space station in orbit. Overdue bills in business have tripled in the last two years, to $123 billion -- equal to more than one-quarter of the country's annual economic output, the Russian Government estimates.
Unpaid bills pervade Russian life. Companies cannot pay their suppliers; suppliers cannot pay their workers; workers cannot pay their utility bills or their rent, and almost everybody holds back on paying taxes.
The vicious cycle of nonpayment has become particularly acute in the last 18 months, thanks largely to the Russian Central Bank's get-tough policies on fighting inflation. Those policies abruptly choked off the money supply and brought inflation below 15 percent, from more than 200 percent in 1994. But the other result is that people literally do not have any money.
Many other countries have endured similar travails, and some have also resorted to high-level bartering as a solution. Indeed, the word veksel is a borrowing of the German "wechsel," for "exchange." Germany resorted to i.o.u.'s for a brief period after World War II. Several other former Soviet republics are using them today, and Mexican banks have developed something similar as well.
But few have responded on as large a scale and with such sophistication as Russia, blending the swagger of Chicago commodities traders, Internet technology and the hand-to-mouth survival schemes of companies in daily danger of collapse.
Typically, a company issues i.o.u.'s to its suppliers instead of paying cash. The suppliers can then either hold the i.o.u's and wait for them to be paid by an agreed-upon date, or try to cash them in immediately by selling them or exchanging them at a discount from their face value. The bigger the discount -- and they can be substantial -- the greater the risk that the i.o.u. will not be paid off on time -- or at all.
The market is a fragile one built on the idea that the securities will either be held or continue to be transferred.
Consider the case of Gazprom, the company that distributes natural gas across Russia as well as to much of Western Europe. Gazprom is one of Russia's strongest companies, one whose shares and i.o.u.'s are heavily traded around the country.
Like many other companies, Gazprom is caught in the middle of Russia's nonpayments crisis. Moscow's electric utility, Mosenergo, owes the company about three trillion rubles, or $512 million. Mosenergo's problem is that the Moscow city government, which subsidizes residential electric bills, owes it two trillion rubles, or $342 million. Part of the government's problem, in turn, is that neither businesses nor residents are paying their taxes.
Enter veksels. Gazprom has issued its suppliers about $170 million worth of i.o.u.'s, which are redeemable primarily for natural gas. Because Gazprom is big and credible, brokers say that its i.o.u.'s are always in popular demand among both investors and companies looking for natural gas. In fact, many Gazprom veksels ultimately end up in the hands of its debtors, who use them to offset their own overdue bills.
Whether the i.o.u.'s get swapped for natural gas or for money, they are valuable. Analysts at Renaissance Capital Group, a Moscow-based investment firm, calculate that Gazprom veksels yield a profit of roughly 25 percent a year. Conventional government bonds in Russia yield about 18 percent a year.
But investors with cast-iron stomachs say the returns on less familiar companies can climb to more than 65 percent. That was the case with Almazy Rossii-Sakha, the Government-owned producer of nearly one-third of the world's crude diamonds.
Almazy and the Russian Government had been close to cementing a lucrative contract with the De Beers, the South African diamond producer. But the two sides have been haggling for more than a year, which left Almazy almost drained of cash. So the company has issued more than $100 million in i.o.u.'s, many of them due to be paid in cash in 1998.
Now Almazy i.o.u.'s are suddenly hot -- so hot they are almost impossible to buy. The reason: Almazy and De Beers plan to sign a final contract later this month. As a result, the i.o.u.'s are now likely to be paid off on time, so their value has nearly doubled since last year. People who bought Almazy i.o.u.'s early are now likely to make a profit of 65 percent at the time of payoff, according to Renaissance Capital Group, a Moscow-based investment firm.
Numbers like that are attracting serious foreign investors, including Americans. "This is the first stage toward developing a corporate bond market," said Kyle Brandon, a partner at Orion Capital Advisors, an investment fund here that focuses on Russian securities and began buying i.o.u.'s a few months ago. What is the lure? "Sixty-five percent returns," said Ms. Brandon bluntly.
But the risks can be huge. The International Monetary Fund has been critical of veksels, saying they distort the true indebtedness of the country and the companies, and give companies a way to avoid taxes -- as the profit on i.o.u.'s is generated almost entirely outside the official economy and is generally not taxed.
The i.o.u.'s are also notoriously intricate, each tied to the bill-paying problems of a particular company and many loaded with quirky conditions. Many i.o.u.'s never even trade in the open market, and are simply swapped between companies that regularly do business.
Some electric utilities and power plants coordinate their unpaid bills. Kursk Atomic Power Station, a government-owned nuclear plant, has been left with millions in unpaid bills by local electric utilities across central Russia. So instead of promising to pay off its suppliers itself, Kursk Atomic pays off its own bills with i.o.u.'s that companies can redeem in the form of electricity at local utilities that owe Kursk Atomic money.
"You can talk about these things for weeks and never get a thing done," laughed Mr. Baranov, who heads Rossiisky Kredit's veksel-trading operation.
Though all i.o.u.'s are theoretically redeemable for cash at some date in the future, many of them end up as means of facilitating bartering.
Krasnoyarsk Tire Company in Siberia now relies on i.o.u.'s and bartering for almost all transactions.
"Only 3 to 5 percent of the money flow of the company is carried out in cash," said Sergei Chirkasov, who heads Krasnoyarsk Tire's i.o.u. activities. Over the last 18 months, he said, the company has more than doubled its use of i.o.u.'s. It plans to use them to pay its workers' wages.
Because Krasnoyarsk i.o.u.'s are generally redeemable only for tires, they are transformed into money through the alchemy of trading. The chain can take the i.o.u.'s across the country and back.
Krasnoyarsk, for example, uses tire i.o.u.'s to buy raw materials from Rosshina, a Moscow company. Rosshina exchanges them for electricity with a Siberian electric company called Tyumenenergo, part of Russia's nationwide power distributor, Unified Energy Systems. The electric company then trades some of the tire vouchers with Gazprom, to which it owes money for raw fuel.
At some point, the tire i.o.u.'s end up in the hands of a company that takes them back to Krasnoyarsk Tire and uses them to buy tires.
Serious investors say they usually trade only in i.o.u.'s redeemable for cash. Many big issuers of i.o.u.'s are banks, which sell their own to raise short-term capital for lending. But even those can be enormously risky.
In July 1996, a Moscow bank called Tveruniversalbank abruptly went bankrupt because it had issued far more i.o.u.'s than it could afford to pay off. When it collapsed, it left about $160 million in obligations.
Earlier this month, the daily Izvestia reported that counterfeiters in the Russian Far East had begun selling fake i.o.u.'s. The paper said the swindlers had produced convincing copies of i.o.u.'s issued by Sberbank, one of Russia's biggest banks, and were planning to sell more than $40 million worth. The gang, which included Defense Ministry workers, was caught when Sberbank officials spotted early forgeries.
Hoping to avoid further catastrophes, the Russian Central Bank has clamped down on the volume of i.o.u.'s that banks can issue. Meanwhile, companies that issue i.o.u.'s have formed a self-regulatory organization called Auver, which has created more formal ground rules and is trying to develop a system like those used to trade stocks and bonds.
Many experts predict that i.o.u.'s will fade into disuse as Russia's economy becomes more stable and as companies learn to borrow money in more conventional ways, by getting bank loans or by selling bonds.
But that may take years. Until then, or until another scandal erupts, veksels are moving full speed ahead.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "FOR EXAMPLE: I.O.U.'S Instead of Rubles"
With too little cash to go around, Russians are issuing and accepting billions of dollars' worth of i.o.u.'s in exchange for goods and services. Here is a recent chain of transactions that started with a shipment of rubber worth one billion rubles (about $170,000) to a tire factory in Siberia.
1 -- The Krasnoyarsk tire factory pays for rubber with an i.o.u.
2 -- Rosshina, the Moscow-based rubber supplier, settles a debt with a Siberian business partner by using the i.o.u. to pay the partner's electricity bills.
3 -- The electric com-pany uses the i.o.u. to buy natural gas.
4 -- With the i.o.u., the natural gas company buys tires for its fleet of trucks.

HEADLINE: Hospital Deals Raise Concern On Abortion

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN

 BODY:
When Northern Dutchess Hospital and Kingston Medical Center merged last year, they began the kind of streamlining and emphasis on preventive care that keeps hospitals afloat in the era of managed care.
But now the two hospitals -- situated on opposite sides of the Hudson River in upstate New York -- are merging with a third hospital, a Roman Catholic competitor in Kingston, N.Y., and this partnership will involve more than a mere re-engineering. The two secular hospitals are agreeing to follow Catholic doctrine practiced by the third partner, Benedictine Hospital, and will stop offering contraceptive counseling, abortions, tubal ligations and vasectomies. 
 They have also precluded the possibility of ever offering in vitro fertilization or artificial insemination to infertile couples -- procedures that are explicitly banned by the church.
The scenario upstate is repeating itself across New York State, the region and the country as health care institutions scrambling for economic security join forces with Catholic organizations, abandoning reproductive services in exchange for financial solvency.
Last year, there were 29 mergers or affiliations nationally involving Catholic hospitals, according to Catholics for a Free Choice, a nonprofit group that supports abortion rights. The group's figure would indicate that mergers have been on a sharp upswing. A total of 57 alliances with Catholic hospitals took place from 1990 to 1995.
"We are doing this for the survival of all three hospitals," said Anthony Marmo, chief executive of Kingston Hospital, which together with Northern Dutchess Hospital is now known as the Cross River Health Company. "Together, we create a large patient base and efficiencies we couldn't achieve on our own. It makes business sense."
Family planning advocates and women's rights groups say they are frightened and appalled by this trend. The Roman Catholic Church, they note, is already the largest nonprofit health care provider in the country, accounting for about one in six of all hospital admissions. If the church's presence increases through mergers with secular organizations, they say, options for reproductive services will shrink.
"This is not a classic pro-life, pro-choice abortion debate," said JoAnn Smith, executive director of Family Planning Advocates of New York State, a research and advocacy group. "We're talking about everyday reproductive care, like contraception. We're talking about adequate H.I.V. and AIDS counseling. We're talking about the morning-after pill for rape victims. Deals like these undermine the basic availability of quality, convenient health care for women."
Just a glance at some recent mergers in New York show how common the trend has become.
*In Troy, N.Y., the once nonsectarian Leonard Hospital merged with St. Mary's Hospital and became a Roman Catholic institution. Initially, doctors there could not perform abortions, nor even make referrals for patients, nor offer any kind of advice on contraceptives. Only after a lawsuit was filed did the combined hospital agree to provide referrals for such care.
*Fidelis Care, a Catholic-sponsored health maintenance organization serving Medicaid patients only in New York City, tripled its enrollment by purchasing the nonsectarian Better Health Plan, a statewide Medicaid-only H.M.O. Although it serves largely young, poor women of childbearing age, Fidelis refuses to provide coverage or referrals for significant family planning services like birth control, abortions, tubal ligations and comprehensive H.I.V. and AIDS prevention counseling.
*The only two hospitals in Batavia, N.Y. -- Genesee Memorial Hospital and St. Jerome Hospital, which is Catholic -- announced their intent to consolidate operations and abide by Catholic doctrine, banning abortions, tubal ligations, vasectomies and family planning.
Although they promised to build an independent, freestanding health clinic for women so that reproductive health services in the area would not be lost, those plans are stalled.
There have been similar results nationally in mergers or other partnerships in cities like Sacramento, Calif., Indianapolis and West Palm Beach, Fla. Hospitals in those cities stopped performing abortions when they affiliated with a Catholic institution. All three, however, continue to offer sterilization.
 
Priorities Made Clear During Negotiations
Executives for Catholic health care organizations said that there was nothing subversive about their business strategies and that they make their priorities clear when they begin negotiations to ally with secular institutions.
"Our beliefs are our beliefs," said Thomas A. Dee, chief executive officer of Benedictine Hospital. "We make no secret of them. Hospitals may choose not to join with us as a result, but our belief system is firm."
In many cities around the country where mergers between Catholic and nonsectarian hospitals have been planned, local residents have banded together in opposition. In some cases, their resistance has helped to kill deals.
Two years of negotiations to merge St. Peter's Medical Center with the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J., were quelled in June, because the two sides could not resolve their differences over reproductive services.
In Poughkeepsie, N.Y., negotiations to merge Vassar Brothers Hospital, a secular hospital, and St. Francis Hospital, which is Catholic, were scuttled when community pressure mounted after the hospitals revealed that Catholic doctrine would be followed.
And three secular hospitals near Hartford -- including the state-run University of Connecticut Medical Center -- announced in July that they were joining forces with a Catholic hospital to build an ambulatory care center that "respects Catholic health care principles." But the deal fell apart after community protests.
In a time of rising costs, shorter hospital stays and more specialized outpatient clinics, hundreds of hospitals struggling for survival have merged or affiliated with larger institutions that give them more bargaining power with health maintenance organizations and allow them to eliminate some duplicate and expensive medical departments and to consolidate services like billing and laundry.
 
Partnerships Needed To Assure Survival
Given the current tumultuous health care environment, executives involved in the deal between Kingston and Northern Dutchess Hospitals and Benedictine say they do not have the luxury of spurning attractive financial partnerships that they need to survive for the sake of preserving a relatively small corner of their business.
"Yes, there are emotional issues involved here and we are determined to see that these services be provided in another setting in the community," Mr. Marmo, the Cross River chief executive, said of the reproductive procedures his organization is planning to abandon when it merges with Benedictine. "But you have to remember that this is a very small portion of our business right now. And in terms of proportionality, there are so many more benefits to the community with this merger despite the unfortunate loss to some. Imagine the economic damage if these hospitals closed."
Cross River officials have promised that they will help build a freestanding women's health clinic where elective abortions and sterilizations could be performed and where advanced infertility treatments currently not available at either hospital could be added.
But many local residents remain unconvinced that such a care center would be either practical or financially viable. They fear, for example, that such a site could become a target for anti-abortion activists, who might harass and threaten patients and staff members.
They also contend that even with such a clinic, women who are in the hospital giving birth could not choose to have their tubes tied at the same time, thereby avoiding a second hospitalization, and that they could not get uncensored advice about their own health care.
"From a dollars-and-cents point of view, I see where this merger is a winning proposition for the hospitals," said Dr. Dean Bloch, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Northern Dutchess Hospital, who noted that the medical staff at that hospital had voted unanimously against incorporating Catholic doctrine. "But from a philosophical point of view, this is a dramatic difference. It's health care being ruled by something other than what's best for the patient."
In other proposed mergers, community outrage has forced the hospital partners to come up with creative solutions that allowed alliances between secular and Catholic entities to go forward while safeguarding reproductive services. When John P. Mather Memorial Hospital and St. Charles Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Port Jefferson on Long Island formed a joint venture recently, they excluded from their alliance services unacceptable to the Catholic Church: abortions, vasectomies and in vitro fertilization. Mather continues to perform those procedures on its own premises outside its agreement with St. Charles.
Rather than merging, St. Mary's Hospital and Horizon Healthcare Inc. in Wauwatosa, Wis., affiliated instead, a looser partnership that allows Horizon to continue offering sterilizations and in vitro fertilization, with St. Charles forgoing a share in any revenue from those procedures.
 
Rallies and Petitions To Protest a Merger
Aware of the success of other opposition efforts, people in Dutchess County have been organizing, hoping that their voices will help redefine the planned partnership between Cross River and Benedictine, which does not have a name yet. They have held rallies, sponsored community meetings and gathered nearly 2,000 names on petitions protesting the merger.
"We're not against an affiliation," said Mernie Dempster, a retired school librarian who helped lead the antimerger petition drive, standing outside the grocery store in downtown Rhinebeck collecting signatures. "We know hospitals are facing tough times. But there are many models where the nonsectarian hospital doesn't have to follow the dictates of the church. We want them to find a way to do both. We don't want services to be lost."
Opponents of the proposed merger were looking at the deal through very narrow lenses, said Mr. Dee of Benedictine. Over all, he said, medical services in the area would increase.
"It's very parochial to look at the effect of this merger on just two or three services," he said. "We see this as being all about growing services, about increasing trauma care, getting a Level 2 neonatal nursery and more rehabilitation services. We're looking to add high-end oncology. Whenever you have a merger, there are always some reductions."
In this case, Mr. Dee acknowledges, the cutbacks are directly in response to church doctrine. And many people who oppose mergers between Catholic and nonsectarian hospitals in which church law is adopted across the institutions say their position is one that is also based on religious freedom.
"There are many members of the clergy, even some who are opposed to abortion, who are very concerned that the ethical and religious directives of one church are being imposed on people of other religions," said the Rev. Tom Davis, a minister in the United Church of Christ, who retired as a chaplain and professor of religion at Skidmore College and now lives in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
"It used to be understood that if you went to a Catholic hospital, you knew that the doctrine of that church prevailed there," he said. "But these mergers are of grave concern because even hospitals that do not agree to become Catholic hospitals agree in these deals to abide by Catholic rules."

HEADLINE: In New Orleans, the House Loses

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Back in the early 1990's, when the Louisiana Legislature legalized casino gambling, it seemed to many New Orleanians that their city was the odds-on favorite to become the next Las Vegas or Atlantic City.
This is, after all, the "Big Easy," the city whose unofficial motto is "let the good times roll," the vacation destination every year of close to 10 million people. 
 What better way to sweeten the allure, and the take, than to add slot machines and gaming tables to the indulgent mix of crawfish etouffe, hot jazz down on the levee and boozy arm-in-arm strolls through streets that could be in Paris?
Alas, for all the high hopes and sure-thing conviction, the city rolled snake eyes.
Over the past three years, all three downtown riverboat casinos have foundered on economic, regulatory and legal difficulties, the last one shutting down just over a week ago. Worse, the city's only land-based casino has folded, too, and a gambling pleasure dome that was to replace it, a block-square structure designed to compete with just about anything in Las Vegas or Atlantic City, sits half completed on the edge of the French Quarter, mired in bankruptcy, its developers desperately searching for a way to head off liquidation and salvage their $830 million investment.
Unless owners of the newly beached riverboat and the all-but-liquidated land project come up with new operating plans within the next few weeks, particularly a new financing plan for the land project, gambling in downtown New Orleans in the foreseeable future is likely to be limited to a few electronic poker machines and betting parlors.
The Flamingo, the shut-down riverboat, could become just another faux paddle-wheeler hauling camera-toting day-trippers on the Mississippi. The empty shell of the French Quarter pleasure dome could be abandoned to the stray cats and foraging rats that have already taken up residence there, or it might fall to the wrecker's ball.
What happened?
What put an end to the hit-me-one-more-time talk of five years back, when the newly legalized casinos were just opening their doors and the promoters were projecting an annual economic infusion of $3 billion in gamblers' cash, with $300 million of that thrown off in taxes? What happened to the 50,000 new jobs promised on the bumper stickers plastered about by the promoters when the city was still staggering from the last national economic recession?
"Mistakes were made -- economic, political, sociological, legal, some just dumb," Mayor Marc Morial said. "I still believe casino gambling can be a viable business in New Orleans, though not our economic be all and end all as some predicted. The big question is: Can those mistakes be undone? I wouldn't hazard a guess on the odds."
Other cities and other casino operators have also made mistakes and experienced failure with gambling enterprises. What sets New Orleans apart is that the odds for success seemed all but unbeatable.
Both critics and proponents of casinos generally agree that the major blunders here were an overly optimistic promotion of the city's potential as a gambling center, a faulty structuring of licensing and operating requirements for casino owners and the imposition of unrealistically high taxes on casino receipts.
The most striking mistake was overestimating of the city's potential as a gambler's mecca.
Though some local residents have shown a penchant for playing the slots and tables, as have some tourists, New Orleans has yet to be viewed as a gambling center by anybody other than gambling promoters. The number of players on any given day and the amount they gamble have never reached the levels needed to cover casino operating costs here, the highest in the nation, and still leave a healthy profit.
Most disturbing of all, surveys of tourists arriving in New Orleans have found that two of every three have little or no interest in spending their limited time here bent over a craps table or transfixed before a slot machine when there is so much else to see and do.
"Ten million visitors coming to New Orleans every year doesn't work out to 10 million gamblers," said C. B. Forgotston, a lawyer who opposes efforts to turn the city into a major gaming center. "Proof of that is that we've had four casinos fold here while casinos over in Mississippi and up the river and over on the lake are doing just fine -- because gambling is all that they've got, all they do. That's where you go if gambling is what you want."
Jason Ader, a Wall Street analyst who follows gambling stocks for Bear Stearns, said that with the right regulatory and tax climate in the city, the flow of local and out-of-town gamblers into casinos, while still not a flood, would nevertheless be sufficient to keep gambling operations in the black.
"If they ran things in New Orleans like they do elsewhere, without all those high taxes and fees, you could do all right with a casino," Mr. Ader said.
But Louisiana legislators were so confident that casinos would rake in earnings by the millions upon millions that they rushed to enact taxes two and three times higher than other states impose on such earnings. And prospective casino operators were so certain of the big earnings that they readily agreed to pay the taxes and then -- this being Louisiana, where money often talks -- some even boldly offered, publicly, to pay premium fees in order to win licenses to operate.
Further, the cocksure prospective operators also went along with another potentially crippling regulation. Prodded by the powerful New Orleans restaurant and hotel lobby, the state ordered casinos not to lavish as many free rooms, meals and drinks on gamblers as do casinos in other states.
"The cost of running a casino in Louisiana is higher than just about anywhere else," said Timothy Ryan, the dean of the economics department at the University of New Orleans and a close student of gambling economics. "Most states put about a 7 percent tax on a casino's gross. Louisiana taxes at 18.5 percent. Some Louisiana casinos also impose a head tax on gamblers, whereas everywhere else gamblers are welcomed with open arms. I figure the riverboat that just shut down was paying about a 35 percent tax over all at the end. Who can stand that very long?"
The boat's operators, the Hilton Corporation and some Louisiana partners, are torn about whether to try to reopen in New Orleans and again risk not only the onerous tax but also cutthroat competition should the casino on land somehow eventually open. Alternatively, Hilton and its partners wonder whether they should try to move to some other, possibly more lucrative, river site in Louisiana.
In the meantime, as talks about what to do with the boat have dragged on, the boat's license to operate within the city has expired, which the operators said doomed the boat, whatever else might have happened.
The boat also faces another problem; the city treasurer contends its owners owe some back taxes and other fees, a contention the owners strongly dispute.
"Gambling is a business and if it makes economic sense, we'll go anywhere to operate," said Tom Gallagher, the executive vice president and general counsel of the Hilton Corporation. "From the early days, we've been concerned about the New Orleans operation because our numbers never were as good as we wanted and we worried about land competition down the road. I'm not sure what's next."
The operators of the half-completed land casino, Harrah's Entertainment Inc. and some local partners, have even more serious problems.
Not only are they being squeezed by cost overruns and huge payments on their debts, but as they seek new financing for the project, they are encountering resistance because of a promise they made earlier when they won their operating license. They agreed to guarantee the state a minimum $100 million tax payment each year of operation, even if receipts fell short and did not justify a payment that large.
"That promise is a big hurdle in finding new financing and time is running out," said Billy Patrick, the casino operators' chief lawyer. "The bankruptcy court wants some action by early November -- or else."
Might the state lighten up the terms of the tax payment guarantee? Or is that precluded by a growing frustration among Louisiana voters with the economic confusion, back-room dealing and rancorous wrangling that thus far has been the hallmark of gambling in the state?
"A guarantee is a guarantee," said Hillary Crain, chairman of the State Gaming Control Board. "When you face something like that, your best bet is to come up with some creative financing. It's up to them."

HEADLINE: AIDS Drugs Elude the Grasp of Many of the Poor

SERIES: LEFT BEHIND: The Destitute

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
The doctor's chicken scratch is barely legible, but to Luis Figueroa the scribbles on the little white slips of paper are precious. They are prescriptions for powerful new AIDS medications that once miraculously revived Mr. Figueroa, who was so close to death last year that his parents brought in a priest in case he needed last rites.
But there is a problem with the prescriptions. Mr. Figueroa cannot afford to fill them, and the government cannot afford to fill them for him. 
 The three-drug cocktail costs nearly $12,000 a year -- a sum that is beyond the reach of Mr. Figueroa, an unemployed 33-year-old printer who recently moved here from Washington, leaving his health insurance behind. On a recent morning, he went looking for help at a social service agency for people infected with H.I.V., but he found little solace.
There, a counselor told him that the Federal-state partnership that pays for AIDS drugs for the indigent was broke in Florida, as it is in 25 other states. It can pay for two of his antiviral medications, but not for the protease inhibitor, the most powerful drug in his combination.
"It's a matter of waiting and hoping," the social worker, Gilberto Robledo, said as Mr. Figueroa tapped his feet nervously on the floor. Mr. Robledo told Mr. Figueroa that his name would be placed on a waiting list. He did not tell him that the Florida list had 600 names.
So did Mr. Figueroa fall through the cracks of the AIDS drug revolution, and he is one of many. It has been 18 months since protease inhibitors came into widespread use in this country, helping to transform AIDS from a death sentence to a chronic but treatable disease for many patients, Mr. Figueroa included.
But the new drugs are expensive, and experts say tens of thousands of people who could benefit from state-of-the-art AIDS therapy do not receive it.
The reasons are varied. Some people with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, do not seek treatment. Others have yet to learn of combination therapy. And because the protease-inhibitor regimen is complex -- up to 30 pills a day, some with food, some without -- some doctors are purposely withholding the drugs from unstable patients, fearing they will miss their doses and, as a result, help the virus become resistant.
But as H.I.V. continues to spread among the poor, experts say, the main obstacle is increasingly money.
"I call it the therapeutic haves and the therapeutic have-nots," said Dr. Arthur Ammann, president of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. "Anybody who walks into a pharmacy in a poor neighborhood and looks at the line of people who are trying to negotiate which drugs they can or cannot get understands this."
 
Longer Lives for Some, No Benefits for Others
The problem is generating a host of complex public policy issues as well as anxiety for patients like Mr. Figueroa, who is hoping that his doctor will persuade a drug company to give him the medicine free.
As word of the benefits of the new medications spreads, clinics are jammed with patients who, imbued with a sense of hope, are eager for the drugs. Many are poor, and many have shunned treatment in the past.
At the same time, the fact that protease inhibitors have helped keep so many people alive is depriving others of benefits.
Enrollment in the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, the Federal-state partnership that provides the drugs to the needy, has exploded with the arrival of protease inhibitors. The rosters in some states have climbed as much as 2,000 percent, said Richard Jefferys of the AIDS Data Treatment Network, an advocacy group in New York.
And as patients live longer, there is barely any turnover in the program. In many parts of the country, precious slots are full, and state officials, short of cash, are faced with a wrenching problem: whether to cover all the drugs for some patients or some drugs for all.
"People are not dying as rapidly, so they are not opening up spaces," said Dr. Patricia Hawkins of the Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington, which treats and counsels people with AIDS. "There is so much hope in these medications, and then you have to tell people they can't get on it yet. It's very frustrating."
The problem is particularly acute in Florida, the state with the third-highest AIDS caseload, after New York and California. As Mr. Figueroa tries to remain calm -- "If I worry, I get stressed, and it's no good for me," he said -- he knows that the longer he goes without his medicine, the worse his condition is likely to become.
Other patients are growing angry.
"I feel stuck," said Mica Paris, 28, who is also on the Florida waiting list.
Ms. Paris was tested for H.I.V. as part of an outreach program run by the Health Crisis Network, the same agency where Mr. Figueroa sought assistance. Medicaid turned her down, and she says she has no money to fill her prescription.
"The whole purpose of me getting tested was to get treatment and help," Ms. Paris said. "I guess I'm not going to get help until I'm damn near dead."
According to the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 750,000 Americans are infected with H.I.V., and fewer than 1 in 5 of them have private health insurance. Roughly half are insured by Medicaid or other government programs, but 29 percent have no insurance at all.
 
'Greyhound Therapy' And Red Tape's Toll
Access to the drugs varies from state to state and even from county to county, contributing to what one expert called "Greyhound therapy," a tendency of some patients to move to where the drugs are.
If a patient and his doctor are aggressive, experts say, they can generally find a way to get the protease inhibitors through a patchwork of government assistance, clinical trials or, as a last resort, the pharmaceutical industry, which donates drugs through its "compassionate use" programs.
But sometimes the red tape proves overwhelming, and patients give up.
At the same time, drug companies, which say the high prices are necessary to recover millions of dollars that they are spending on research, are themselves feeling squeezed. They are inundated with requests from doctors and even state governments for free medicine.
The North Carolina drug program, for instance, closed to new patients at the beginning of October. And the Colorado program will run out of money in December, three months before the end of its fiscal year; after that, Colorado will ask drug companies to pick up the cost of medications for the 720 patients enrolled.
"We need to bear in mind that there are limits," said Joy Schmitt, a spokesman for Agouron Pharmaceuticals, which makes nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor. Another manufacturer, Hoffmann-La Roche, a subsidiary of Roche Holding Ltd., has closed its compassionate use program to patients in Florida, in an effort to press the state to pay for more.
"The state was zapping so many resources," said a Hoffmann-La Roche spokesman, Jeff Winton, that "some of the other states weren't able to put their patients in."
The Clinton Administration is considering a pilot program to expand Medicaid so that additional people with H.I.V. can get the drugs. Medicaid covers the protease inhibitors, but at present only people who are disabled by AIDS are eligible.
That policy flies in the face of what doctors know about the drug cocktails: that patients benefit the most when they begin taking them in the early stages of the disease.
"You've got to get yourself really sick so you can qualify to be totally disabled so you can get the medicine that might have been able to save you," said Dr. Hawkins, of the Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington. "It's a crazy system."
It was into this bureaucratic netherworld that Mr. Figueroa plunged when he decided over the summer to leave Washington for a warmer region. His predicament illustrates the stresses that uninsured, often desperately ill patients face as they struggle to get medications.
Mr. Figueroa, who was born in Honduras, immigrated to the United States with his parents 11 years ago and worked as a printer. In 1989, he found out that he was H.I.V.-positive. His employer covered his medical care.
But in 1995 he developed AIDS-related pneumonia and had to quit his job. He has no idea whether he is eligible for Medicaid; he says he never realized that he could apply.
Instead, he sought help from a friend who owned a business and who included Mr. Figueroa in the company's insurance plan, as an employee. Looking back, Mr. Figueroa acknowledges that the arrangement was not quite legitimate, and says he was never comfortable with it. But he was desperate.
By February 1996, the normally stocky young man was thin and wasting away. His count of T cells, which are crucial to fighting off infection, had fallen to 7. A normal count is more than 500.
He did not have the strength to rise from his bed to go to the bathroom. Thrush, a yeast infection, coated his throat, making it impossible for him to eat. "Basically," Mr. Figueroa said, "I was dying."
Then indinavir, a new protease inhibitor manufactured by Merck & Company, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. His doctor prescribed the drug in a cocktail with two other antiretroviral medications, and before long Mr. Figueroa had become another AIDS miracle, one of legions of patients whose health was seemingly restored by protease inhibitors.
His viral load dropped to 4,000 copies per cubic milliliter of blood, from 49,000. But by this summer, after he had spent more than a year on the drug, the numbers had started creeping up again.
It was about this time that Mr. Figueroa decided to move. The decision to give up his health insurance was not easy, but he feared another cold winter in Washington. He knew of patients who were receiving their medicine through government programs, and he thought he could do the same.
Had he moved to New York or California, he might have had an easier time. Those states, with the largest AIDS caseloads in the nation, have vastly increased their contributions to the AIDS Drug Assistance Program to cover all poor patients.
But Florida, which this year received $27 million in Federal money for the program, has not been so generous: the state contributes $2 million, while state health officials estimate the need at $12 million.
As a result, said Thomas Liberti, who runs the AIDS program at the State Health Department, Florida recently capped enrollment. Those who are already receiving the protease inhibitors may continue, but no new patients are being added.
"All you have to do is look at the math," Mr. Liberti said, "to know that we don't have enough money to go around."
That was a surprise to Mr. Figueroa, but it is no surprise to the doctors at the AIDS clinic at South Shore Hospital, the small community hospital in South Beach where he is being treated. About 85 percent of all the patients there lack health insurance. The Federal Government pays their medical bills with money from the Ryan White Care Act.
Most South Shore patients in combination therapies receive their drugs free from pharmaceutical companies, said Dr. Jose Hernandez, who treats Mr. Figueroa. But getting approval takes time.
"The patient has to go see his case manager," Dr. Hernandez said. "The case manager fills out the report. It comes back to me. I fill out my part. I give it back to the case manager. I'm writing prescriptions that I know are not going to be immediately filled."
Although his doctor is optimistic that he will eventually get the drugs, Mr. Figueroa is growing weary of the wait. It has been nearly a month since he picked up his prescriptions.
When he visited Mr. Robledo at the Health Crisis Network in late September, Mr. Figueroa says, he expected to receive his medication right away. He left three hours later empty-handed, with instructions to ask his doctor for a copy of the test showing his viral load -- the H.I.V. level -- and a letter explaining the need for the medicine.
"It's a runaround situation," Mr. Robledo acknowledged, "a back-and-forth kind of thing."
Early in October, Mr. Figueroa returned. He came away discouraged. He was not feeling well, he said, and was starting to worry about his health.
"Gilberto tried to help me," Mr. Figueroa said, "but we just filled out more forms. I have a cold, and I can't sleep thinking about all these things."

This is the last of three articles that have appeared since Aug. 22 on AIDS patients who have not fully benefited from the discovery of a powerful new class of drugs, protease inhibitors, that has revolutionized the treatment of AIDS.

HEADLINE: As Election Approaches, City Is Flush With Cash

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
New York City took in $150 million to $200 million more in taxes from July through September than officials had projected, which could allow Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to channel more money into popular programs in the weeks before Election Day.
The additional revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year came largely from the same source that flooded the city's coffers with tax revenue last year: Wall Street. The city ended its last fiscal year with a $1.3 billion surplus because of a boom in financial services, providing a respite from the hard times early in the Mayor's tenure, when the economy soured and the city's budget suffered as a result. 
 The Giuliani administration had predicted in the new $33.4 billion budget that Wall Street would have an average year, an assumption that independent budget analysts called prudent. But this sector continues to generate strong profits, so revenue from income, business and other taxes are greater than projected, officials said.
There was some disagreement yesterday between the Giuliani administration and the Democratic-controlled City Council over the amount of additional revenue in the first quarter. The administration put it at $150 million, while the Council said it was $200 million or possibly more.
Whatever the figure, the extra money could be a boon for Mr. Giuliani and his re-election campaign. The Mayor acknowledged in an interview that he might use a portion of the extra revenue to finance new programs that he would announce before Election Day. But he said he would allocate the money judiciously, saving some to deal with the city's long-term financial problems, which include large projected gaps in future budgets.
"We will not do it in a way in which we will spend all of the surplus," he said. "At this point, that is not our priority. Our priority is to really point out how the policies and programs that we have put into effect are working better than people expected."
Aides to the Mayor's Democratic opponent, Ruth W. Messinger, accused the Mayor of pillaging the budget in recent months, seeking to finance programs to address what the aides said were deficiencies in his record. They asserted that he would spend any unexpected revenue from the first quarter in the same way.
"I wouldn't be surprised if the symptoms of incumbent-itis which he has so exuberantly exhibited persist between now and Election Day," said Leland T. Jones, a spokesman for Ms. Messinger. "He certainly has a bad case of it."
Mr. Giuliani had already taken advantage of the city government's relatively robust fiscal health by announcing some new programs. His anti-drug initiative, for example, is to cost the city at least $80 million that was not allocated in the budget that the Council approved last June. He would have had more difficulty finding that money earlier in his term, when he had to cut some programs and reduce the rate of growth of others.
Despite the good news in the short term, the city is still facing large projected budget gaps over the next few years, so any additional money that Mr. Giuliani spends will not be available to reduce the city's long-term fiscal troubles. In the 1999 fiscal year, which begins next July 1, the city has a projected gap of $1.8 billion between revenue and expenses.
The new revenue was first disclosed by Thomas L. McMahon, the Council's finance director, after he was asked for an evaluation of the city's performance in the first quarter. The administration then confirmed that revenue was higher than expected, though it issued somewhat more conservative figures.
According to the Council's estimates, the city received $45 million more than projected in the first quarter from the general corporation tax; $42 million more from the personal income tax; $12 million more from the banking tax, and $11 million more from the unincorporated business tax, which many small businesses pay.
It also reaped $175 million more from the property tax, though Council officials cautioned that about half of that stemmed from early payment of tax bills, so it could not be considered additional revenue.
Mr. Giuliani also said some of the new revenue may have come from early payment of property taxes. Even so, the city is doing better than it did last year, he said.
"This really allows us politically to say that we are right about the economy and budget, and Ruth is very wrong about it," he said. "She has tried to create the impression that the city is in some kind of fiscal hole."
But the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said the city's budget and economy are not as strong as they seemed. He pointed out that the city's unemployment rate remains stuck around 9.5 percent, about double the national average.
"The good news is that a strong financial services sector continues to drive our budget," Mr. Vallone said. "The long-term concern for both the economy and the budget is that we are not adding enough jobs for New York City residents. That is a serious problem that needs to be addressed."

HEADLINE: As Washington's Attention Wanders, Brazil Plays a Quiet Catch-Up Game

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Three years after he corralled other leaders in the region into charting a Free Trade Area of the Americas, President Clinton stepped off Air Force One tonight to encounter a far more worldly and assertive Brazil, posing the first serious challenge to undisputed American leadership in the hemisphere.
While Mr. Clinton has been busy elsewhere since the December 1994 summit meeting in Miami, where the free trade area was discussed, Brazil has been quietly playing a skillful diplomatic game, strengthening its own regional trade group, Mercosur, and building ties with the European Union and Japan as a counterweight to United States dominance. 
 "I think the U.S. Government is coming into an awareness of great change worldwide a bit late," said Amaury de Souza, a political analyst at Brazil's Institute of Economic, Social and Political Studies. Citing "a shift of power and economic relations going on worldwide," Mr. de Souza said that these days Brazil is seizing the opportunity to grow "not only economically, but to become an important player in international relations."
Behind the fanfare and the optimism surrounding Mr. Clinton's whirlwind appearances here in Brasilia, in Sao Paulo and in Rio de Janeiro, is the glaring sense that South America has been a sorely neglected backyard.
Mr. Clinton is the first President in a quarter-century to put off his first visit to South America until his second term. Political analysts here said that even though it now appeared that he might well win fast-track authority -- which would allow him to negotiate trade agreements that Congress must vote on without amendments -- little progress toward creating a free trade area is likely by next year's economic summit meeting in Santiago.
Argentina, where Mr. Clinton goes after leaving Brazil, has been without a United States ambassador for six months, and no one has been nominated. The American Ambassador to Brazil, Melvyn Levitsky, will be going home a few months after Mr. Clinton's trip, and no successor has been announced.
For much of the century, the only serious challenge to Washington's dominance in South America came from the Soviet Union. Brazil was easily overlooked. Despite a population of 160 million, abundant natural resources, and territory nearly the size of the continental United States, the old saw about Brazil's being the country of the future, though the future never comes, held true. Internal disarray characterized by a roller-coaster economy, a 21-year military dictatorship and weak government institutions kept Brazil from assuming what would have appeared to be its natural role.
To be sure, despite impressive starts in reforming primary education, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has made only slight dents in many of his country's deep domestic troubles: rampant corruption, unchecked burning of the Amazon rain forest, police violence, lack of a credible judiciary, labor conditions that are tantamount to slavery in some parts of the country and vast disparities in the distribution of land, wealth and power.
The end of 2,500 percent annual inflation, however, has taken some of the lunacy out of everyday life in the country with the world's eighth-largest economy and opened the way for greater trade and investment. In just two years, direct foreign investment in Brazil has soared from $1 billion to $16.5 billion, thanks largely to the privatization of vast government-run industries in mining, electricity and telecommunications.
The regional grouping's trade has grown to an estimated $17 billion this year from $6.2 billion five years ago. And Brazil has become an important customer to its neighbors, spreading its purchasing power around by buying $1 billion a year in oil from Argentina and another $1 billion from Venezuela, purchasing electricity from Paraguay and, in the future, Bolivia.
The trade grouping, Brazilian officials point out, has become an important stepping stone to free trade, opening Brazilian industries to limited foreign competition and broadening their markets. Riordan Roett, director of the Latin American Studies program at Johns Hopkins University's School of International Affairs, said that Brazil now is eager to leave itself a free hand in forging economic relations. But, he said, "The United States is still thinking back in '93 and '94, when it could dictate politics in the hemisphere. The U.S. just doesn't get it."
For the most part, the rivalry is being played out sotto voce, with occasional slips and indirect maneuvers.
One apparent slip occurred last week, when the Brazilian Ambassador in Washington, Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima, was quoted as saying that Brazil would be "relieved" if Congress did not give President Clinton fast-track negotiating authority. The Ambassador later said he was quoted out of context. Nevertheless, the comments reflected the tone of Brazilian leaders in a series of interviews here last week, avoiding any claims to rivalry or leadership, while pushing forward their country's trade agenda.
President Cardoso appeared to soften Brazil's widely publicized push for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, which the United States has opposed. Washington favors expanding the Security Council, with a permanent seat for Latin America, leaving the Latin Americans to decide who should fill it.
"We are not anxious to have a specific seat at the Security Council," said President Cardoso. "What is important is to reorganize the whole international system." He said relations with the United States had never been better, though he added that with Brazil coming into its own, conflicts were inevitable.
American officials have diplomatically avoided public comment on the fate of regional trade organizations once the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas is built. But when pressed, they generally say that all regional blocs, Nafta included, would be subsumed by the greater Free Trade Area and follow its rules. Brazilian officials, however, make clear that they have no attention of letting the trade group disintegrate. To Mr. Roett, the wisest course the United States could follow would be to accept the Brazilian-led trade bloc.
"I really think we have to think of the Brazilians as the British thought of us at the turn of the century," Mr. Roett said. "They bet on us being an important country. We can't go on treating Brazil the way we treat Paraguay or Ecuador."

HEADLINE: Clinton Says He'll Win New Powers For Trade

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Oct. 13

 BODY:
President Clinton predicted today that he would ultimately win enhanced authority from Congress to negotiate free trade deals here in Latin America and around the world.
"It's a tough fight, but I think we'll win it," he said of the debate over whether his so-called fast-track negotiating power should be renewed. "It's a debate over principle with me." 
 He suggested that the country's international standing was at stake. "The United States has to send a signal to our allies, particularly in this hemisphere, and our allies in Asia and in Africa, that we know we are in a new world," Mr. Clinton said, "and it's a world in which we are interdependent."
He made the remarks on his plane as he flew here from Caracas tonight for the second stop of his Latin American tour, discussing his difficulties persuading Americans to embrace his vision of a hemispheric free trade zone, which he hopes to see established by 2005.
He said his visit to Venezuela showed that Democratic critics of his free trade goals, who worry that new treaties will not protect labor or the environment, could rest easy.
The Venezuelans, he said, "understand that they can't preserve their democracy in a free-market economy unless they try to strengthen their social compact." As a result, he said, "we're going in the right direction -- the direction the opponents of fast track want us to go in."
Working toward his goal of economic integration, Mr. Clinton spent his day, in Venezuela and then here, playing to local constituents by complimenting his hosts on their democracies and market economies -- as well as their music and baseball players -- while implicitly illuminating for his home audience the opportunities that await here.
Brazilian news reports have suggested that the United States still expects to dictate terms of its relations, rather than forge a genuine partnership. Almost immediately upon arriving here, Mr. Clinton tried to assuage such fears in an appearance with the Brazilian President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, at Itamaraty Palace, site of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "Mr. President, as we reach for the future, America reaches out to Brazil with a hand of friendship and a pledge of partnership," he said. "We share a vision of a better tomorrow."
In Caracas today, Mr. Clinton was able to make much the same point against a symbolically potent backdrop: the towering tomb of Simon Bolivar, the hero of Andean liberation and democracy.
"Bolivar belongs to all the Americas," Mr. Clinton said. "He was the first to imagine a hemisphere of democracies, united by shared goals and common values."
In a further effort to play to the local crowd, Mr. Clinton experimented with Spanish, drawing giggles and applause from the crowds. "Todo esta chevere," he declared outside Bolivar's tomb, using a Venezuelan expression to say everything was just fantastic.
The cobbled plaza before Mr. Clinton, ringed with banners in the yellow, red and blue of the Venezuelan flag, was only half full, with perhaps a thousand people. Michael D. McCurry, Mr. Clinton's press secretary, said the Venezuelans allowed entry only to people with tickets, rather than to the general population as the White House had wanted.
Mr. Clinton repeatedly praised the Venezuelans for their efforts to open their economy, permitting private investment in nationalized industries.
In addition to an agreement to cooperate further in the war on drugs, United States officials signed an energy agreement today with Venezuela, which now supplies 18 percent of America's oil, more than any other country. The two countries agreed to exchange scientific and technical information and to conduct joint studies on energy planning.
Venezuela is expected to open its nationalized oil industry to $30 billion in new private investment in the next 10 years, and executives for American oil companies -- some of whom Mr. Clinton met with today -- are eager for a piece.
Venezuela is planning to double its oil production in coming years, to 6.9 million barrels of oil daily. The United States wants to increase its reliance on Venezuela's oil "to be less dependent on unstable parts of the world," in the words of Energy Secretary Federico Pena.

HEADLINE: Goldman, Sachs Invests Time in City Schools

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Thomas B. Lewis said he had butterflies in his stomach as the chartered bus snailed north from Goldman, Sachs & Company's Broad Street headquarters through Manhattan's traffic-clogged streets. As the bus fell ever further behind schedule, his butterflies started kick-boxing.
Small wonder: Mr. Lewis and 105 of his colleagues were on their way last Thursday to teach basic business concepts at Public School 98 on 212th Street, in a primarily Dominican area of Manhattan that is alien to most Wall Street types. And to Mr. Lewis, a managing director in Goldman, Sachs's equities division, dealing with billion-dollar transactions and millionaire clients paled in intimidation value to his assignment, which was handling 30 fourth graders. 
 But after a few minutes with Class 403, the butterflies were gone.
"With clients, you have to figure out how to speak their language, how to get things going," Mr. Lewis said. "It's amazing how much easier it is to connect with these kids."
Mr. Lewis is one of 2,000 Goldman, Sachs employees, from secretaries through investment bankers, who will each spend four hours this month teaching business and economics at 28 New York City public schools -- and, they hope, demonstrating to the students that successful business people are not that different from them. On Thursday, the Goldman, Sachs volunteers taught students in 55 classes at P.S. 98.
"This shows the kids that they are important," said Lisandro Garcia-Marchi, the school's principal, who said that more than 90 percent of his students are from low-income Hispanic homes. "It gives them a taste of what the business world is about and a sense that they can join it."
The teacher-for-a-day program is a combined effort of Goldman, Sachs and Junior Achievement of New York, which provided a curriculum for the volunteers that ranged from defining producers and consumers to explaining municipal government and calculating profit margins.
Usually, Junior Achievement volunteers sign up for a semester's worth of classes. But the organization has had little luck getting people to travel regularly to the South Bronx or upper Manhattan. Hence, this four-hour program.
"In a lot of these neighborhoods the most successful business person is the local drug dealer," said Peter Mertens, Junior Achievement's executive vice president, who encouraged the volunteers to talk about their own lives as well as teach economics. "Even a one-day visit shows the kids that not all successful white guys grew up rich, that women can get high-level jobs, that poor kids can have opportunities, too," Mr. Mertens said.
From classroom to classroom the volunteers doled out encouragement along with facts. Never was an answer wrong. What is a producer? "A singer," piped up one third grader. "Well, that's another meaning for the word," responded the stock analyst-turned-teacher, before calling on another waving hand.
The children absorbed a lot more than some of the Goldman, Sachs people expected. To make a profit in a yo-yo factory, you have to subtract the cost of wood, string and people from the price, right? Hands shot up. "What about the cost of electricity?" asked one youngster. "Don't you have to pay rent on the building?" asked another. And then, from a third: "My mommy works the second shift. What arrangements would the yo-yo factory make for that?"
In one sense, the lessons were universal business fare. "I learned how we get our resources," said India Dix, a fourth grader, "and how business means getting things from people who have them to people who need them, just like trading baseball cards."
Across the hall, Magda Suriel and Jason Jiminez, also fourth graders, were getting excited about faraway lands during a lesson on global trade -- even if far away just meant Utah. "I'd never heard of the Great Salt Lake before," Magda said.
But in another sense, the lessons were tailored to an urban sensibility. In May, about 125 Goldman, Sachs employees, including Jack L. Kelly, the company's conglomerate analyst, and David J. Kostin, its real estate analyst, tested the half-day format at P.S. 30 in the Bronx. In one exercise, they helped a fifth-grade class staff a hypothetical ball-point pen company.
As part of that lesson, the two analysts took roles in a job interview, with Mr. Kelly playing a high-school dropout who would rather play basketball on Friday than work.
"Most of the class agreed they wouldn't hire me for the obvious reasons," Mr. Kelly recalled. "But one kid, from one of the poorest families, said he noticed that I didn't make eye contact during the interview. That kid understood what we were doing, and realizes he has a shot at being one of us." The experience led Mr. Kelly and Mr. Kostin to lead the effort to sign up their research department colleagues for the trip to P.S. 98.
While the visits were aimed at opening new worlds to the children, they opened more than one pair of eyes at Goldman, Sachs to some new realities, too. First, there was P.S. 98 itself -- a newly spruced-up, sparklingly clean building, peopled with seemingly unharried teachers and well-behaved children, many sporting neat blue uniforms.
"With all this negative press about New York City schools, it's really impressive how interested these kids are in learning," said Mr. Kostin, who taught a third-grade special-education class.
Mr. Marchi, the principal, is hoping that the interest cuts both ways, and that Thursday was not a one-shot deal. "I hope we've established a link with them, that some will want to come back," he said.
If the aftermath of the May pilot teach-in is any indication, they probably will.
"One volunteer sent the school a set of encyclopedias, another took an entire class to see 'Beauty and the Beast,' " said Janice L. Moore, the Goldman, Sachs vice president who runs the company's volunteer program. "I really believe this group will stay in touch with the school, too."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL: NOTEBOOK;
For Jackson and Bulls, One Last Mile Together

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE

 BODY:
David Halberstam asked Coach Phil Jackson over the summer about whether he could chronicle the Bulls' season. Jackson listened and said fine, but warned that a book written about Michael and the Miracles might be in direct competition with some of Jackson's memoirs.
It is not too early for Jackson to break out the quill and inkwell and begin "Dear Diary." 
 After all, as Jackson has said, the Chicago Bulls are about to embark on their last run. A basketball dynasty is a season away from expiring.
The season opener is still more than two weeks away and his team is going to Paris to play several overmatched European teams for the McDonald's Championship this week. Yet speaking to the national news media in a conference call yesterday, Jackson sounded more reflective than rejuvenated.
"We've had a run; it's been a great run," the Bulls' coach said. "We know we can't challenge Boston's incredible run in which they won 9 of 11 championships. But we know what we've done in modern-day sports is a pretty amazing feat."
Before Jackson signed his one-year, $6 million deal in July, he, Jerry Reinsdorf, the Bulls' chairman, and General Manager Jerry Krause agreed that Jackson would not return next season.
With Michael Jordan insisting he will retire if Jackson does not return, Scottie Pippen testing the free-agent market this summer and the Bulls thinking more about reloading than repeating, it is simply a matter of "putting the mantle down and handing it to somebody else," Jackson said.
"For the good of the organization, this team is going to have to move on and start building for the next century," he said.
Jackson took several subtle digs at Krause and Reinsdorf, making sure everyone knew that the fans in Chicago have questioned management's loyalty and commitment to winning in the present.
But he was more subdued and resigned to the fact that the Bulls, who have won five titles in seven years, will never be the same after this season.
Asked about Jordan's assertions, Jackson added, "Yes, I believe him and, yes, I will try to talk him out of it."
 
Attention All Agents
If the National Basketball Association finds itself in the middle of a labor war early next year, Billy Hunter wants to be prepared for the onslaught. Hunter, the executive director of the players association, has called for an agents advisory committee meeting on Oct. 24 in Manhattan to discuss strategy in the event the collective bargaining agreement is reopened in April.
Commissioner David Stern and the deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, reiterated the owners' stance at the league meetings in September: if the high salaries and economic inequities continue, the owners will exercise their right to reopen the agreement.
Twenty of the game's most prominent agents -- representing about 80 percent of the players -- have been invited by Hunter. The meeting will be the first serious attempt the players association has made at planning strategy.
 
To a Speedy Recovery
The worst-case scenario is said to be three months and the best-case scenario is supposed to be two months. But with proper rest and an aggressive rehabilitation employing every nouveau therapy available, Scottie Pippen may be able to return to the Bulls six weeks after undergoing surgery on his left foot.
Pippen had a soft-tissue arthroplasty performed last week in Manhattan by Dr. William Hamilton, who performed similar surgery on Charles Oakley in 1995. The surgery involves creating a new joint to replace a damaged or degenerated one between the foot and the toe.
 
Changing Places
Asked to comment on John Starks's desire to become a coach, possibly on the high school level, after his career is over, Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy could not resist a playful dig at his mercurial shooting guard.
"I just want to be a player on his team," Van Gundy said. "And I will torment him."
The coach added, "I imagine he'll let his players have more of a shot selection than most coaches."

In a Gesture in Ulster, Blair Meets With Adams
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain met with Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, in East Belfast, where the two reportedly shook hands. The meeting was the first between a British Prime Minister and a Sinn Fein leader in 76 years. A14 

Clinton Upbeat on Trade
As President Clinton flew from Venezuela to Brazil for the second leg of his visit to Latin America, he predicted that he would ultimately be granted enhanced "fast track" authority by Congress to make trade deals around the world. A6
 
Brazilian leaders have been strengthening their Mercosur regional trade group and building ties with Europe and Japan to serve as a counterweight to any potential American dominance in South America. A6
 
Inauspicious Vote in Cameroon
Government radio in Cameroon reported that President Paul Biya had been re-elected to another seven-year term with 80 percent of the vote. But few Cameroonians bothered to vote, and the West African country's three main opposition parties boycotted the voting after Mr. Biya's Government had refused to allow the creation of an independent board to organize the elections. Many citizens feared their country would join a regional trend of political and economic meltdown or enter a civil war. A3 
 
Prison for Korean Leader's Son
The scope of democratic change in South Korea was emphasized by the sentencing of a son of President Kim Young Sam to three years in prison for bribery and tax evasion. Lawyers for Kim Hyn Chul vowed to appeal, contending that the $6 billion he conceded to having accepted from business executives included no bribes. The sentence did not stir much debate because the President's term ends next year and he is barred from running again. A5

A Reversal by Italy's Far Left
Shortly after bringing down Prime Minister Romano Prodi's Government, Italy's Communist Refounding Party reopened talks that were expected to result in Mr. Prodi's being restored to power with his 1998 budget intact. The small party's gambit, to oppose further cuts to pensions and health care, stalled as a wide spectrum of Italians supported the center-left coalition's stoic resolve to qualify Italy for European monetary union.

Swiss Find More Accounts
Swiss banking officials said 4,000 more unclaimed accounts belonging to foreigners before and during the Holocaust era had been found in their archives. While twice the number of accounts discovered and published in July, these ones are apparently smaller, containing about $4 million. A list of another 10,000 accounts opened by Swiss citizens prior to 1945, some possibly as proxies for German and East European Jews, will also be published. A12

2-Tier Welfare System Blocked
A Federal judge has ruled that states may not discriminate against new residents by paying them lower benefits than long-time residents with the same income. His decision blocks Pennsylvania's use of a tool given to states by the 1996 welfare law. The decision has broad implications for other states that have adopted similar restrictions. A1

Hawaiian Trust Faces Scrutiny
The Bishop Estate, a massive $10 billion trust that dates to the Hawaiian monarchy, with investments from the Pacific Rim to Wall Street, is drawing unaccustomed scrutiny following allegations of self-dealing and financial mismanagement, among other charges, by its trustees. The sole beneficiary of the trust is the Kamehameha Schools, a 3,200-student school for Hawaiian boys and girls, but it is Hawaiians themselves who have become the most critical of the Bishop Estate.

Many Lack AIDS Therapies
Experts estimate that tens of thousands of people who could benefit from new state-of-the-art AIDS therapy do not receive it. The reasons are varied: the drugs are expensive and many people can not afford them; some people with H.I.V. do not seek treatment; the new protease-inhibitor regimen is complex, requiring up to 30 pills a day, some with food, some without; and some doctors are purposely withholding the drugs, fearing that unstable patients will miss their doses and the virus will become resistant.

HEADLINE: In War Against No-Shows, Restaurants Get Tougher

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
THEY call. They reserve. They don't come.
It's the saddest story in the restaurant business, but it's getting a new plot twist. 
 In coming months, diners all over the United States may find themselves paying for their sins. Like a date who's been stood up once too often, restaurant owners are getting tough with no-shows. Some demand a credit card number to secure reservations for tables of six or more. Others require a deposit of up to $300 and a signed agreement. Now, upping the ante, American Express is going nationwide with a pilot program designed to fight no-shows by dangling the threat of a charge, just like hotels and car-rental agencies.
The American Express initiative, called the Guaranteed Restaurant Reservations Program, allows restaurants to impose a penalty of $60 to $300 on diners who make a reservation for a party of six or more and then fail to cancel the reservation by a specified time, or, Heaven forbid, do not show up at all.
The growing reliance on penalties opens up a new front in an ever-expanding war between shellshocked restaurant owners, who can experience no-show rates of 40 percent on a Saturday night, and outlaw diners who, in some cases, reserve tables at several restaurants, eat at one, and leave the other restaurants hanging.
Calls to 20 of New York's fancier restaurants revealed a variety of enforcement policies, ranging from the old-fashioned honor system to tough requirements for up-front money. The Union Square Cafe and Le Perigord, for example, simply take a telephone number and ask customers to confirm the reservation the day before. Other restaurants ask for a credit card number to hold a large-party reservation, but enforcement varies. Lespinasse takes a credit card number for parties of six or more but does not threaten any charge for a no-show. Montrachet takes a credit card number and will impose a $25-a-person penalty, but allows customers to wait until 4 P.M. to cancel a dinner reservation, or 11 A.M. to cancel lunch.
"It discourages people from making reservations at seven or eight restaurants and deciding at the last minute which one to go to," said John McFadden, the general manager of the River Cafe in Brooklyn, which takes a credit card number for parties of eight or more, with a $25 penalty for each diner. "It doesn't look good to have a large table in the middle of the room that doesn't get used."
Some restaurant owners say they use the credit card tactic purely as a psychological weapon, and do not really intend to impose the fee. Merely taking the number, they say, reduces the no-show rate.
But some restaurants want their money before the meal, and require a deposit of $200 or $300 before guaranteeing a reservation. Callers wanting a table for six or more at Le Bernardin receive a form by fax that asks for their name, address, telephone number, credit card number and signature. Callers must fill out the form and refax it to the restaurant, along with a photocopy of both sides of their credit card. A $200 charge is applied to the credit card and deducted from the bill for the meal. Diners who do not want to deal with a credit card can drop by the restaurant and leave a cash deposit.
Windows on the World, Palio and Les Celebrites also require a deposit for larger parties. Les Celebrites is particularly strict. It requires a $300 deposit for parties of seven or more, and reservations must be canceled at least three days in advance.
American Express has tested its guaranteed reservation concept for three years in two pilot programs involving 44 restaurants across the country, 11 of them in New York, including Aureole, Sign of the Dove and TriBeCa Grill. It is now making the program available to the more than 150,000 restaurants that accept its card. Although the company said it could not predict what the response would be, about half the New York restaurants in the test said they would sign up for the program.
The company zeroed in on large parties because an empty table of six or more causes the most economic damage and is the hardest to fill on short notice. The no-show charge shows up on the customer's monthly American Express bill. Unlike the airlines, which require documentation like a doctor's note before issuing a refund for an unused ticket, American Express has no formal policy on how restaurants should deal with diners who plead illness or an emergency.
Some diners shrug off the new requirement as a minor inconvenience or even welcome it as a way to get an iron grip on a top table, especially if it is out of town. Others rebel. "I've had people laugh in my face, scream at me, or simply say, 'I will not give you my credit card number,' " said Isma Pulaos, the reservations clerk at Aureole. "Most people are nice, though." Some restaurateurs say they suspect that the outbursts and the hang-ups come from diners who have been foiled in attempts to book multiple tables.
To punish or not to punish, that is the question, and it is a divisive one for restaurant owners. In its research, American Express found that owners split three ways when asked if they wanted a program that would let them impose charges on no-shows. One-third liked the idea, one-third hated it and another third wanted more information. At bottom, restaurants want to please, not to discipline, and the idea of slapping fines represents a cultural change that makes many owners queasy.
"Restaurants are not in the business of charging fees," said Lloyd M. Wirshba, the general manager for restaurants at American Express. "They are in the business of providing service and a fine dining experience."
"If I charged one of my customers $50 for a no-show, I'd never see them again," said Raymond Buckler, the maitre d'hotel at Felidia, who said the restaurant looked into the American Express program but decided not to sign up. "It's just not friendly."
American Express started its program after restaurateurs began asking for the kind of guarantees that hotels and car-rental agencies take for granted. In a survey of 1,200 restaurants in 1993, the company found that half reported a no-show problem. Of that number, 65 percent had an overall no-show rate of 10 percent, 15 percent had a rate of 20 percent to 30 percent, and 3 percent had a rate of 30 percent to 40 percent. The problem was most acute on Saturday night, with Friday night a close second.
Gordon Sinclair, the owner of Gordon restaurant in Chicago, had an epiphany about 10 years ago when he began adding up the cost of no-shows and found that the grand total was $900,000 a year, a figure that got him thinking, fast.
He made a change in the restaurant's procedure that underlines the curious moral status of a restaurant reservation, which is less than a contract but something more binding than "let's have lunch."
He instructed his receptionists to stop saying, "Please call us if you change your plans," and start saying, "Will you call us if you change your plans?" His no-show rate dropped from 30 percent to 10 percent. In other words, by asking a question and eliciting a response, he created a sense of obligation.
Ten percent still represents a lot of money, and the hard-core malefactors have proven difficult to root out. They will confirm, reconfirm and still not show. Hence, the American Express program. Under the plan, a restaurant agrees to put into effect the kind of record-keeping procedures that are standard at hotels and car-rental companies and that protect the card holder. Customers making a reservation for six or more people are told that they must use the American Express card and that if they cancel after a set time or do not show up, a per-person charge will appear on their monthly bill. Restaurants may charge either $10 or $25 a person, with a maximum of $300.
If the customer violates the agreement, the restaurant must send him a letter within 48 hours, stating that it intends to impose the agreed-upon penalty.
In January, 18 months into the pilot program, 10,000 reservations had been taken and only seven no-show penalties had been imposed. Although the program ran until May, Mr. Wirshba said the company stopped compiling data.
"For smaller parties, who are not guaranteed, we have a 15 to 20 percent no-show rate," said Henny Santo, an owner of the Sign of the Dove, which took part in the pilot. "For guaranteed reservations, we had a total of six no-shows in three years. The program brings the no-show rate down to zero, virtually. The downside is that it is very time-consuming on the restaurant's part."
American Express said the program, like the cruise missile, is intended to wipe out specific targets rather than wreak mass destruction.
"We believe that this is not going to be used for dinner for two on a Tuesday night, but on an as-needed basis in those instances where the no-show rate has been high, such as holidays and weekends," Mr. Wirshba said.
It may work out that way in most parts of the United States, but in New York, "as needed" means every day. Many of the New York restaurateurs who took part in the pilot program said they plan to use it routinely.
If parties of six require a deposit today, can parties of four be far behind? For the moment, it seems unlikely. With four diners, the trade-off between paper work and indemnity against a no-show becomes a different equation, largely because a popular restaurant can rely on walk-in business to fill an empty table for four. It has become quite common, however, for top restaurants to demand that diners call back and reconfirm the day before a reservation, and some call up diners themselves the day before.
For large parties, a new world looms, with a new etiquette. "Party of six? No problem. Would you like to apply for a reservation?"

HEADLINE: A Dissertation on Mr. Ed?;
New Scholarly Center to Study Pop Television Culture

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN

 BODY:
As a typically compulsive undergraduate at the University of Chicago, Bob Thompson used to allow himself just one half-hour of television viewing a week, on Sunday night. And no matter how hard he tried to watch PBS, he always succumbed to "CHiPS," the drama about California motorcycle cops starring Larry Wilcox and Erik Estrada.
This disturbed him. Why, Mr. Thompson, a budding political scientist, asked himself, do smart people love to watch dumb television shows? 
 From that query came a quixotic academic career. Now Dr. Robert J. Thompson, a 38-year-old Syracuse University professor, he is one of the nation's leading scholars in television studies, a relatively new and still formless discipline. This weekend, he will take charge of a new academic research center at the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse, to be christened the Center for the Study of Popular Television -- emphasis on the word "popular."
Television, even television that appeals to the lowest common denominator, can still be great art, Professor Thompson contends, a sort of visually enhanced form of literature. Shakespeare, as people are so often reminded, was a popular artist. Jazz, once dismissed as popular, is now recognized as a discipline worthy of serious study.
Indeed, in a statement announcing the creation of the research center, the dean of the Newhouse School, David Rubin, declares that it will "study television entertainment programs with the same care and passion as musicologists study Mozart and Ellington, or professors of English study Melville and Pynchon."
Poppycock, some other scholars say.
"There's a fallacy there, in assuming that the common run of literature is comparable to Melville, or that the musical norm is comparable to Mozart's work," said Mark Crispin Miller, a leading media scholar who is soon to leave Johns Hopkins University to join New York University. "Those were the greats, who stood out. In the Renaissance, you'd have a hard time finding a play that's even readable other than Shakespeare's plays."
While conceding that the best television programs merit academic attention, Professor Miller said Syracuse's emphasis on the word "popular" concerned him.
"The fact is that most TV drama is esthetically appalling, and most TV comedy is too," he said. "For the most part it's utterly derivative, a pale imitation of whatever seemed to sell six months ago."
Such attitudes drive Professor Thompson to become "even more zealous," as he put it, in defense of his research. He calls such criticism "belle-lettristic apartheid, much of it plain old-fashioned cultural elitism," mostly from people who have scant knowledge of popular television.
"Just because television is filled with bottom-line-oriented profits and is generated by 500 people's hands, we shouldn't be reduced to silence about it," he said.
Professor Thompson in fact admires Professor Miller's work. But he said he believed that enough academic research was being done on subjects like television news coverage; television's influence on politics, violent behavior or sexual mores, and the economic forces behind mass media. What is missing, he said, is the "art appreciation" aspect.
"It is tragic and in many ways dangerous that we are so ignorant as intellectuals about a medium that has such a profound effect on us," he said. "How we perceive art and storytelling is infected and affected by the television era. Look at any modern novel after the year 1960 -- look at Don DeLillo's new book -- and you can't help but see how much television has moved in."
Horace Newcomb, a communications professor at the University of Texas at Austin who was one of the first scholars in this field, as early as 1970, agreed.
"Popular television has been the central storytelling system of our time," he said. "To say it's not important to study that is like saying one shouldn't have studied Dickens or Scott Fitzgerald. I happen to think fiction is crucial to people's lives, and if they're experiencing it this way, or through literature or the stage or the big screen, all are equally deserving of study.
As for Professor Thompson's own research, his most recent book was "Television's Second Golden Age: From 'Hill Street Blues' to 'E.R.' " (Continuum Press, 1996); his next, due next year, is "Good TV: The 'St. Elsewhere' Story."
"I think 'St. Elsewhere' is probably the best show ever on American prime-time TV," Professor Thompson said, because of the intricacy of its writing.
After switching from political science, his undergraduate major, Professor Thompson earned a doctorate in film and television studies from Northwestern University. He taught there and at the State University of New York at Cortland before moving to the Newhouse School at Syracuse seven years ago.
Along the way, he became convinced that "there was enormous vacuum to be filled" in terms of "inventing the discipline of television studies as a serious academic pursuit."
His dream of creating a center for such work was endorsed by Dr. Rubin, the Newhouse School dean, who helped raise more than $430,000 to start the new center.
 
Encouraging Books About TV
In addition to being a locus for scholarly research and teaching, the center will encourage publication of books about television by the Syracuse University Press, expand Syracuse's collection of scripts and videos, create an academic journal on television and continue an oral history project that Syracuse lured away from the University of California at Los Angeles.
That archive attracted the bulk of the center's financing, $300,000 from the Steven H. and Alida Brill Scheuer Foundation. Mr. Scheuer wrote a series of television and video guidebooks and was the host of a public television program, "All About Television," in the 1970's and 80's.
His patronage in this case benefits David Marc, who had been compiling an oral history archive on television pioneers who were Jewish and how Jewish culture was reflected in television. At Syracuse, the project is being expanded to capture as many early television pioneers as possible. More than 70 interviews are already on file, from Steve Allen to Betty White.
The question persists as to whether, aside from the nostalgia value, these people and the shows they worked on deserve academic study.
"Every new creative medium gets dismissed," said Robert M. Batscha, the president of the Museum of Television and Radio in New York, , which opened a branch in Los Angeles last year. "Film was dismissed, photography was dismissed, modern art, modern theater -- all were dismissed at first. When the Museum of Modern Art began to look at this new art form, nobody understood it. It took a while before the museum began to educate people. Then MOMA and the Eastman House did the same with film."
But, said Dr. Batscha, who is a political scientist and communications scholar, many of the country's most creative young people now go into television. And he said he believed that this trend might feel threatening to "the establishment, to people who have dedicated their careers to other art forms."
A pillar of the establishment begs to disagree. Stephen H. Balch, the president of the tradition-minded National Academy of Scholars, said it would take 30 or 40 years before scholars know what television programs are worthy of academic study. "With art, particularly the art we study in the academy, we have greater confidence in its inherent greatness by the fact that much time has passed, and many people have sifted through it, and still the appreciation for it continues," he said.
 
A Familiar Part Of Their Lives
Unlike most other art forms, television for most of today's students is a familiar and integral part of their lives. Professor Thompson sees in that fact a potential educational benefit.
"When I was at Cortland, I taught a course in the history of television from Milton Berle to 'The Simpsons,' and you can't help talking about all kinds of American traditions that go into that," he said. "You talk about 'The Beverly Hillbillies' and 'Andy Griffith' and you get into the celebration of the rural in American life, the emphasis on nature, from Thoreau to Melville's noble savages to Emerson's Walden Pond. Invariably, students would come to me afterward and say, 'Where can I read this stuff?'
"It's a connection for them, using television to teach the liberal arts notion that human endeavors are all part of a great cultural conversation. We turned them into good old-fashioned, critical-thinking intellectuals better than many English or philosophy classes were doing on that campus, because in those classes, they never felt invited into the conversations."
Dr. Balch called that theory "dumbing the intellect down," a phrase he attributed to Daniel Patrick Moynihan. "Rather than bring the students up to the level where an educated person should be," he said, "we're bringing education down to their level, and filling it up with things that are already part and parcel of their daily life, instead of with new challenges."
And Professor Miller, who has written in praise of Hitchcock as well as Shakespeare, could not accept Professor Thompson's cultural continuum argument.
"You can find some sort of tradition for any piece of garbage that's out there, whether musical or cinematic or literary," he said. "Everything has forebears. But to claim any meaningful connection between 'The Beverly Hillbillies' and 'Walden' is just silly."
Dr. Batscha, of the Museum of Television and Radio, admittedly has a different bias. But he recalled that at the turn of the century teaching popular novels was considered silly in an academic tradition that emphasized the classics.
"You wouldn't think of teaching culture in the United States now without studying the novel, or films," he said. "And hopefully a few years from now you wouldn't think of studying 20th-century culture without studying television."

HEADLINE: Restrain Inflation Genie

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Robert Eisner (Op-Ed, Oct. 11) misses a major issue in regard to inflation: inflation psychology, the greatest danger. I am in the real estate and construction business, which is highly sensitive to interest rates. I would much rather that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, tinker with interest rates in quarter-point increments to keep the genie of inflation psychology firmly in the bottle than take any chance that it gets out and be forced to go back to the days of Paul Volcker, when the prime rate was allowed to go up to 21 percent to get inflation under control. 
 In spite of what Mr. Eisner says, there are inflationary pressures in the economy. You have only to look around in daily life to feel this -- go out to dinner, go to the movies, fill the gas tank, buy a home or rent an apartment.

HEADLINE: A Rain Forest Imperiled

 BODY:
The issue that most Americans identify with Brazil -- the destruction of the Amazon rain forest -- did not occupy a prominent role in the talks between President Clinton and Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The issue deserved better, though neither man is comfortable with the subject. Washington still subsidizes logging in America's temperate rain forests. Brazil has abandoned some of its worst policies in the Amazon, yet it is not enforcing its laws and seems oblivious to a range of new and insidious threats from timber and agricultural interests.
The state of the world's rain forests is particularly distressing now that global warming has again become a major international concern. Growing forests help absorb the gases that warm the atmosphere. Burning those forests, of course, adds to the problem. 
 More of Brazil is on fire right now than ever before. The fires are not as widespread as they are in Indonesia, where smoke has spread to neighboring nations, nor is commercial logging the main culprit. Brazil's fires are largely the handiwork of agricultural interests that clear land for cattle ranching, with a modest assist provided by subsistence farmers who engage in small-scale slash-and-burn tactics. This year, cities like Manaus that have gone unscathed in the past have been blanketed with smoke. Manaus has also reported a 40 percent increase in respiratory illnesses.
The fires are increasing despite Brazil's efforts in the past few years to protect the forest. The Government ended its ruinous subsidies to the cattle ranchers, and now requires that settlers keep 80 percent of their land forested. Brazil has also set aside about 20 percent of the forest as parks, protected areas and indigenous reserves.
But the ranchers keep on burning, and the laws are not enforced. Brazil's environmental protection agency has only about 80 enforcement officers in the whole of the Amazon. Worse, Brazil's courts have ruled that the agency does not have the authority to enforce the law, which means that it cannot even collect the fines it levies. A bill giving the agency authority to punish environmental criminals has passed the senate and is now before Brazil's lower house. It is a bill the Amazon obviously needs.
Tough enforcement is especially important now. There could be a major drought this year or next, leading to widespread fires, if the climate-altering weather pattern known as El Nino strikes as expected. A graver danger may come from industrial interests. President Cardoso favors cutting roads and blasting waterways through large swaths of the forest. This could provide a new transportation network for big farmers who want to clear land to grow soybeans for export to Europe.
New roads could also lead to increased logging. Already companies from Malaysia, China, Korea and other nations, many of which use clearcutting in Asia, are beginning to log part of the forest. As these companies pave roads deeper into the jungle, cattle ranchers may follow. The roads may make clearcutting economically viable and tempt Brazil to sell off the rain forest for hard currency.
Although a muscular environmental agency is Brazil's most pressing need, it is not the only one. If Brazil goes ahead with the plan to improve Amazon transportation, it must simultaneously address environmental concerns and earmark more land for conservation. A worthy program to set aside indigenous areas, which both preserves the forests and protects Indian tribes, is only half-completed. Brazil must finish the job, which would protect 10 percent more of the Amazon.
The country also needs to develop zoning laws for the forests and to adopt sustainable logging practices. More broadly, Brazil, like the United States and Asia's forested nations, must abandon the view that the rain forest is only a commodity to be exploited for private gain.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Foreign and Fed Buying Aids Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Treasury securities advanced yesterday as investors returned from a long holiday weekend to find that overseas bargain hunters had pushed up prices.
Gains were extended after the Federal Reserve entered the market, buying Treasuries on what is known as a coupon pass. And there was buying on relief that the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, did not sound more inflation warnings in a talk at the annual monetary conference of the Cato Institute in Washington. 
 "In fact," said Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif., "Mr. Greenspan was probably telling the markets a whole lot more last week, that he will raise rates, but that the timing was not clear. There was nothing market-moving in his speech today, only relief that he did not mention tight labor markets again, which produced a quick spike in bond prices."
A survey from last week taken by Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, showed no significant changes in Fed policy expectations despite Mr. Greenspan's warnings, according to Kim Rupert, an economist there.
"A tightening is still not generally expected until the Feb. 3 and 4 Federal Open Market Committee meeting," Ms. Rupert said. "A move at the Dec. 16 F.O.M.C. is still a close call, with about 58 percent expecting no tightening."
The 30-year bond gained 29/32, to a price of 100 9/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 6.35 percent, from 6.42 percent on Friday.
Bonds were also buoyed when the Fed entered the market to buy securities. The central bank bought $1.4 billion of securities with maturities that ran from November 2002 through August 2027, in a process commonly called a coupon pass, which permanently adds reserves to the banking system without a change in policy.
Citing speculation that today's retail sales report for September may suggest the economy is slowing, some analysts said the Fed could delay any rate increase a little longer. Some economists are expecting that retail sales to be unchanged, after gaining four-tenths of a percent in August.
Tomorrow the Government is to release the Consumer Price Index for September, with the report expected to show a gain of three-tenths of a percent excluding volatile food and energy costs.
Ms. Rupert said the data on retail sales should be friendly, but the Consumer Price Index could be ugly. "If retail sales are soft and the C.P.I. later in the week does not surprise, the market could see a relief rally," Ms. Rupert said, adding, however, "It is doubtful whether the highs reached the day of the employment report on Oct. 3 can be revisited anytime soon."
Results at the Treasury's weekly bill auction, which was held yesterday because Monday was a Federal holiday, were called good, with the rate for a three-month bill going to 4.98 percent from 4.93 percent last week. The six-month bill rate also climbed, to 5.12 percent from 5.01 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.741	97.412	Discounted Rate	4.98%	5.12%	Coupon Yield	5.11%	5.33%	High Price	98.744	97.422	Discounted Rate	4.97%	5.10%	Coupon Yield	5.10%	5.31%	Low Price	98.741	97.412	Discounted Rate	4.98%	5.12%	Coupon Yield	5.11%	5.33%	Accepted at low price	42%	39%	Total applied for	$59,262,120	$39,090,409	Accepted	$11,260,003	$11,144,989	Noncompetitive	$1,361,762	$1,157,159	

Both issues are dated Oct. 16. The three-month bills mature on Jan. 15 and the six-month on April 16.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Filing Off 4%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Personal bankruptcies fell in the third quarter as the result of an expanding economy and steady job growth.
The number of people filing for bankruptcy protection declined 4 percent, to 335,218, according to CDB Infotek of Santa Ana, Calif., which provides on-line access to records. In the second quarter, applications reached a high of 349,281. 
 "Since bankruptcies are a lagging indicator, we could see further declines," said Rick Rozar, CDB's president.
While the number fell, it was still up 9.7 percent from the third quarter of '96, CDB said.
In the 12 months ending on Sept. 30, bankruptcies declined the most in North Carolina, Iowa, Kentucky and Arkansas; they rose most in Utah, Maryland and New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Class Notes

BYLINE: By Ethan Bronner

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The concept of a new Middle East has taken such a thrashing in the past year or two that, when a glimmer of it appears, the natural tendency for many is a roll of the eyes. Lately, every time there is talk of the children of Abraham joining hands for a better future, someone blows himself up in a crowded market or bulldozers break ground on disputed land. Threats are voiced, guns are raised and hopes fade yet again.
But the eye rollers would benefit from sitting in on the weekly meeting of the energetic board of directors of what has been optimistically named the University of the Middle East. 
 At the meeting, typically held on Sundays around a supper table at an Italian restaurant in the North End of Boston, the skeptics would find Hala Taweel, the disarming sister-in-law of Yasir Arafat, breaking bread with Ron Rubin, an Israeli-American physicist. There are Camelia Anwar Sadat, daughter of the former President of Egypt Anwar Sadat, and Walid Chamoun, whose Maronite Christian family went to war to rid its native Lebanon of Mr. Arafat's forces in the 1970's, thereby helping begin a civil war.
At the meetings, the jokes fly, the camaraderie is easy.
The plan they share is this: to build, over the next 30 years, a university with campuses across the Middle East and North Africa to promote coexistence and economic development. The first branches would be in Israel, the Palestinian areas and probably Egypt. Students and faculty would be required to spend time at one another's campuses, bringing Israelis and Arabs, Christians and Muslims, into scholarly and social contact.
Elie Wiesel, the Nobel peace laureate, has written a letter endorsing the project, as has Lea Rabin, widow of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. Diplomats from Spain, Japan and Britain have expressed their governments' support.
Peace through education may sound quaint in the rough-and-tumble world of Middle Eastern politics, but to the participants it is the most natural thing in the world. Many of them first came into contact with their putative enemies on a university campus.
"I had never had any real contact with an Israeli until I came to the Kennedy School at Harvard and 18 of my fellow students were Israelis," recalled Ms. Taweel, 32, the president of the board and a doctoral candidate in higher educational administration at Boston College. Her sister, Suha, is married to Mr. Arafat. "Not only that, they were all military officers. By the end of the year, we became very good friends."
Mr. Rubin, 27, who came up with the idea for the university after Mr. Rabin's assassination, said he first met Palestinians and other Arabs while an undergraduate at Princeton and decided that an academic environment was ideal for breaking down traditional barriers.
The project, which operates out of donated offices here with donated furniture and equipment, has raised $50,000. The plan is to raise $500,000 and begin feasibility studies in three countries and a pilot summer course in Morocco or Egypt.
"We hope to begin real classes in five years," Mr. Rubin said.
If it all sounds a bit utopian, it might be worth listening to Kanan Makiya, an Iraqi dissident author in Cambridge and a supporter of the project, who said, "Peace in the Middle East, real peace, will come as an effort of the heart or it will not come at all."

HEADLINE: 3 More Brokerage Houses Post Income Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch & Company, the Bear Stearns Companies and Paine Webber Group Inc. yesterday became the latest big brokerage houses to report healthy quarterly earnings on the strength of the bull market and record merger activity.
They join Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company; Goldman, Sachs & Company; Lehman Brothers Holdings; Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., and Smith Barney in reporting large gains. 
 Merrill, the No. 2 securities firm behind Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, said profits rose 49 percent. No. 5 Bear Stearns said profits rose 49 percent and No. 6 Paine Webber said profits rose 41 percent.
The rising demand for stocks coupled with low interest rates have encouraged many companies to raise cash by selling both stocks and bonds -- businesses that earn investment banks big underwriting fees. In addition, global consolidation in many industries has helped generate significant revenues for Wall Street firms that provide advice on mergers and acquisitions.
Merrill Lynch earned $494 million, or $1.25 a share, in the third quarter ending Sept. 26, compared with $331 million, or 84 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year ago.
The results beat Wall Street expectations of $1.21 a share, according to a survey by I.B.E.S. International Inc. Nevertheless, Merrill's stock was down $1.44 at $75.56 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
Merrill said revenues after interest expenses rose to $3.9 billion from $3.1 billion. The company said it set revenue records in commission, investment banking and asset management fees.
Merrill was No. 1 in the United States in merger and acquisition deals completed, with 30 percent of the market, and No. 2 globally, with 20.3 percent, according to the Securities Data Company, which tracks the performance of Wall Street firms. Bear Stearns earned $161.6 million, or $1.11 a share, in its first fiscal quarter ending Sept. 26, compared with $108.8 million, or 72 cents a share, a year ago.
The results were in line with analysts' forecasts of $1.10 a share. Bear Stearns stock was down 25 cents at $44.50 on the Big Board.
The company said revenues after interest expenses rose to $996.1 million from $688.7 million, led by gains in underwritings, stock and bond trading, and fees from mergers and acquisition advice.
Paine Webber said quarterly profits rose to a record $112.8 million, or $1.11 a share, compared with $80.2 million, or 79 cents, a year ago.
The results exceeded analysts' forecasts of 87 cents a share. Paine Webber's stock was up $1.5625 at $50.75 a share on the Big Board.
Revenues after interest expenses rose 23 percent, to $1.08 billion from $883 million, led by gains in the firm's brokerage, trading, asset management and investment banking businesses.

G.M. Has Strong Profit, But Parts Unit Suffers
General Motors reported earnings above expectations, but the company's stock fell anyway as analysts focused on a deterioration in profitability at the auto parts division, Delphi Automotive Systems.
Delphi's profits were crimped as its customers, including the biggest, G.M., demanded lower prices. The results suggested that a planned spinoff of 20 percent of the unit might have to be delayed. Page D2. 

Another Weak Quarter for Kodak
Kodak, whose digital photography business continues to run up losses, said that its sales and earnings had declined for a second consecutive quarter. But the company had warned of the trouble, and its shares rose after the report. D2.
 
2 Phone Companies Are Spared
Sprint reported earnings below estimates, and Frontier, a smaller telecommunications company, said it would do so, too. Yet Sprint's stock soared, and Frontier's was unchanged. Why? Perhaps because both companies are now being judged more on their long-term potential and they persuaded Wall Street that they were on the right track. Market Place. D10.
 
Wall Street Pours It On
Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns and Paine Webber joined the list of big brokerage firms reporting double-digit percentage gains in earnings for the latest quarter. D6.
 
Stocks Mixed on Earnings News
Strong earnings from the brokerage houses and from banks helped blue-chip stocks rise. The Dow industrials finished 24.07 points higher at 8,096.29. But worries about earnings for technology companies pushed the Nasdaq composite down 9.33 points, to 1,732.79. D10.
 
As trading resumed after the Columbus Day holiday, bonds rose strongly, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury dropping to 6.35 percent from 6.42. D20.
 
Toyota Hybrid Car Is Ready
Toyota rolled out the first gasoline-electric hybrid car ready for market, beating its rivals to a complex technology that offers better mileage and can run more cleanly than regular gasoline engines. D20.
 
I.B.M. to Revamp Its PC Business
I.B.M. will restructure its personal computer operations and could lay off or transfer hundreds of employees as part of an effort to halt the sales erosion of the Aptiva brand, which faces increased competition. D21.
 
Zell Cruise Monopoly Avoids Veto
A provision in an appropriations bill giving a monopoly on the cruise business in the Hawaiian islands to a company controlled by Sam Zell, the billionaire investor, survived a line-item veto by President Clinton. D22.
 
Oil Falls as Gulf Tension Eases
Petroleum prices fell sharply for a second day on reduced tensions in the Persian Gulf, where fears of a United States-Iran military confrontation had helped the energy market rally last week. D17.
 
Dollar Higher vs. Yen
The dollar rose against the yen, helped by a rally in Treasury bonds, concern about the fragility of Japan's economy and remarks by an influential Japanese monetary official who said he was satisfied with current exchange rates despite the yen's slide this year. D17.
 
High-Technology Playthings
As the price of computer chips has plummeted, interactive toys -- like "virtual pets" housed in hand-held devices -- have grown more popular. The M.I.T. Media Lab and four toy and entertainment companies plan a five-year research project to design more such high-technology toys. D10.

HEADLINE: Moody's Warns That New York State's Budget Could Spawn Gigantic Deficits

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 14

 BODY:
A major Wall Street rating agency is warning that New York State's budget, with its commitments to deep tax cuts and big increases in school spending -- and what the agency sees as a risky reliance on a continued bull market -- is a prescription for enormous budget deficits in a few years.
The report by Moody's Investors Service echoes criticism already heard from State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, independent budget watchers like the Citizens Budget Commission, and others. But the warning carries particular weight coming from Moody's, whose judgments are closely watched in the financial markets. The report is to be released later this week. 
 Moody's did not change its credit rating for New York, the lowest for any state, and it predicted that the state's finances will remain stable for at least another year, and probably longer. In other words, things are likely to remain fine past November 1998, when Gov. George E. Pataki will stand for re-election.
But the report criticizes the $67.4 billion budget negotiated by the Governor and legislative leaders, and enacted in August, for making five-year commitments to phasing in tax cuts and broad new education programs, which together will cost the state more than $6 billion a year. The budget allowed lawmakers to go into an election year boasting of the politically popular cuts and programs, but most of the bill will not come due until 2001 and 2002.
The report asserts that the budget includes "deep backloaded tax cuts and multiyear spending obligations requiring future, unspecified spending cuts."
But administration officials insist that the budget will not result in a retreat from the long-term commitments or in serious program cuts. The Governor and his aides have often noted that, defying doubters' predictions, the state has been able since he was elected to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time.
"We've been getting this kind of criticism for three years," said Donna Arduin, first deputy budget director. She noted that the first two fiscal years under Mr. Pataki ended "not just with balanced budgets but with large surpluses."
But that has happened during the historic Wall Street boom, which has sent the state's personal income tax collections soaring. Moody's, like most other budget-watchers, argues that the state appears to be counting on a continued bull market, despite the historic volatility of financial markets and the possibility of a recession over the next five years.
"If this level of growth and prosperity continues," said Robert Kurtter, senior vice president of Moody's for state ratings, "it is possible for the state to grow its way out of the long-term budget gaps, but that's not a prudent thing to plan on."
The reliance on Wall Street is particularly risky, the report says, because the boom there has masked sluggishness in the underlying economy, with New York lagging well behind the rest of the country in job growth.
But Ms. Arduin insisted that the budget does not depend on a continued stock market boom to remain balanced.
Moody's also took issue with the budget for increasing spending more than 5 percent, much faster than inflation, after two years of relative restraint with Mr. Pataki in office, and for increasing New York's debt load, already the highest by far of any state.

HEADLINE: In Her Own Words

 BODY:

CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN
During a visit to the Summit Child Care Center yesterday, she spoke of her commitment to issues concerning women. 
 "Whether it's cutting taxes and getting rid of some business regulations that will allow, particularly, women and small businesses to thrive in the state and see our unemployment rate go down to 5.2 percent, or expanding our commitment to keeping our streets safe; expanding the stalking law so that women do not have to fear in their homes; taking out the statue of limitations on sexual assault cases; enhancing penalties for those who use date-rape drugs, to getting rid of drive-through deliveries and assuring that there is adequate research dollars for breast cancer research. Those are issues that are not just of interest to women, they are of interest to everyone in the state of New Jersey."

HEADLINE: Unions Flexing Muscles For McGreevey Campaign

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Hundreds of union members rallied at the foot of the State House steps today, cheering as their leaders vowed to unseat Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in what they say will be their largest political effort in decades.
An estimated 400 people, most of them state workers, cheered wildly as Mrs. Whitman's Democratic opponent, State Senator James E. McGreevey, took the stage. But the crowd's energy seemed to stem not so much from their support for Mr. McGreevey as their anger at Governor Whitman, a Republican who has cut the state work force by 3,300 jobs and hired private companies to replace some of those workers. 
 While several small labor unions have endorsed Mrs. Whitman, the spirited crowd today made it clear that it would be Mr. McGreevey who would soon benefit from the statewide unions' plan to run a coordinated "get out the vote" effort involving hundreds of labor volunteers and paid for with hundreds of thousands of dollars of union dues.
"The labor movement in this state has never been together like this before," said Charles Wowkanech, president of the state's A.F.L.-C.I.O. "And let me tell you something: On Nov. 4, we're going to have a Governor that the labor force supports."
While Mr. McGreevey basked in his labor support, Mrs. Whitman spent much of her day and evening courting women's votes. Tonight, 1,500 women paid $100 each to attend a fund-raiser at the East Brunswick Hilton. At the gala, the Governor recounted how she had delivered on her earlier promises to create jobs, cut taxes and make the streets safer.
"We've been trying to deliver on those promises," she said, "and we've been shattering the glass ceiling as we've been doing it."
Mrs. Whitman said that 37 percent of her political appointments were women. "I didn't appoint them because they were women," she said. "I appointed them because they were the best."
Earlier in the day, she went to a child-care center in Summit to highlight the endorsements she has received from women's political advocacy groups. She toured the center with United States Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican from Maine.
Jeanine LaRue, the founding president of the New Jersey Women's Summit, said, "In record numbers, this Governor has appointed women to cabinet positions, exploding the myth that it's difficult to find qualified women to perform in high-level positions in government." The Summit had endorsed Mrs. Whitman's opponent, Gov. Jim Florio, in 1993.
Mrs. Whitman also received the endorsement of the Medical Society of New Jersey. It was the first time the group had endorsed a candidate for Governor in its 231-year history.
Mr. McGreevey started his day with a fund-raiser in Philadelphia and a speech at a breakfast meeting with 100 Jewish leaders from across the state in Livingston, before heading to the labor rally in Trenton.
In recent years, labor unions in New Jersey and across the country have become increasingly active in political campaigns. Organized labor spent millions of dollars across the nation last year, hoping to help Democrats regain control of Congress. In New Jersey, for example, organized labor helped put Robert G. Torricelli, a Democrat, just over the top in his race against Richard A. Zimmer for United States Senate.
Already, the Communications Workers of America Local 1032, which represents 2,500 state transportation workers, has paid for radio ads attacking Mrs. Whitman for cutting back on the maintenance of state highways and for hiring a private company to count state-owned billboards.
Other radio ads are likely, union leaders said today. But they said that they could not afford to pay for television commercials and that most of their effort would go into organizing volunteers to run phone banks and get voters to the polls on Election Day. National labor organizations are also lending support to Mr. McGreevey's campaign.
"TV commercials won't win this thing," Mr. Wowkanech said. "Our strength is here today," he said, waving out toward the crowd. "What you will see on Nov. 4 is the best labor operation the state has ever known."
Not all union workers support Mr. McGreevey. On Monday, the former president of the state's A.F.L.-C.I.O., Charles H. Marciante, endorsed Mrs. Whitman. Mr. Marciante said today that the Governor had helped workers across the state by creating jobs, especially in southern New Jersey, where a new $330 million tunnel and road project will soon be built in Atlantic City. The project, which will be partly paid for with state funds, will provide access to planned casinos in the Marina district.
Mrs. Whitman has also been endorsed by several smaller unions representing thousands of law enforcement officers, nurses and construction workers across the state.
The Governor says her 30 percent cut in the state income tax rate has spurred the state's economic recovery and created thousands of jobs. Indeed, the state has its lowest unemployment rate in seven years and its job growth is now outpacing that of New York and Connecticut.
But many of the state's new jobs do not pay as much as the manufacturing jobs that were lost during the recession. And a recent Rutgers University study found that the average wages for most jobs in the state did not keep pace with inflation from 1990 to 1995.
When asked why he did not support the Governor, Jim Marketti, the president of Local 1032, responded with a question: "She created jobs? For who? Hamburger flippers?"

HEADLINE: Newark Hopes for Revival Far Beyond Arts Center

SERIES: DOWNTOWN GAMBLE: A special report.

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
Gloria F. Cohn, a widow from Middlesex County, N.J., has not ventured into this battle-scarred city for years. But she recently sent in $108 for tickets for herself and her granddaughter to a series of Sunday afternoon family dance programs and plays in the heart of downtown.
The lure is the new $180 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center, a glimmering glass-shelled structure that is opening on Oct. 18 on a formerly desolate renewal tract in sight of the towers of Manhattan, across the bleak industrial flats and the Hudson River. 
 In one of the country's great urban gambles, Newark is pinning a good part of its battered hopes for a comeback on the arts, specifically on this arklike complex of concert hall and theater, rehearsal space and food concessions. Planners hope it will set off a downtown commercial and residential revival in a city still struggling to recover from the shattering riots of 30 years ago.
"Those who said the performing arts center could never be built are now squabbling over tickets," said Lawrence P. Goldman, the center's president and guiding force, who came from the vice presidency of Carnegie Hall in 1989 to steer the project through the crucial last eight years of arduous conception and on-time construction.
Newark is hardly alone in seeking a salvation through the arts. With mixed results, dozens of cities, from New York with its emblematic Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, to San Jose, Calif., have built or are planning major arts projects in hopes of improving civic fortunes and polishing civic images. Every one of the nation's 50 largest cities, in fact, uses the arts to support community development, the National Endowment for the Arts recently reported.
But Newark may be asking more of the arts than anyplace else. There is little new besides the performing arts center to draw people like Ms. Cohn downtown, although 85,000 people commute here each day for jobs and higher education programs. The city continues to suffer from a reputation as a dangerous place of intractable problems where each succeeding mayoral administration seems to attract its own Federal and state investigations.
Yet the smooth completion of the project and extensive efforts to knit it into the fabric of the city have raised hopes that Newark, using the arts to create a critical mass to set off further development, may finally be turning around. Significantly, the effort is being pushed not only with city, state and Federal money, but also by a loyal band of hometown boosters, powerful philanthropists like Raymond G. Chambers, and corporate citizens like the Prudential Insurance Company of America, whose fortunes have been bound up with the city's for 120 years.
"A city doesn't function if it's open only eight hours a day," said Arthur F. Ryan, Prudential's chairman and chief executive officer.
 
The Audience
Attracting Crowds, By Careful Design
Perhaps the biggest unanswered question is whether the arts center's audiences will come in just for performances and then head home again or be enticed to linger and spend money. To improve the odds, the arts center, paneled by its architect, Barton Myers, in pearwood that glows warmly through the see-through facade, was situated to foment milling crowds, a bustle that planners say translates to safety.
The design does not rely on bridges, flyovers or tunnels to channel pedestrian flow; from the renovated 1,100-car underground parking garage beneath Military Park, patrons will have to ascend to the street and cross to the arts center. Inside, in broad and detailed ways, efforts were made to attract and appeal to a wide spectrum of patrons. Bathrooms were tiled in interpretations of African kente cloth patterns. Moneymaking catering areas were included: the first bat mitzvah service has already been booked, for $10,000, for a board member's daughter, in 1999.
A new 10-stop, $1 bus loop was created, linking the arts center to attractions like the Newark Museum, the Newark Public Library, Pennsylvania Station and restaurant-lined Ferry Street in the heavily Portuguese Ironbound district. Streets and highways were festooned with hundreds of directional signs to prevent what Mr. Goldman called " 'Bonfire of the Vanities' syndrome," the terror of being lost in an ominously derelict neighborhood.
"This is the big idea: to change the way people think about Newark," said Mr. Goldman, 51. "It's not the place where you get your car stolen; it's where you go to concerts."
The programming, too, was blended to the presumed tastes of a broadly diverse audience of 4.6 million New Jerseyans within 25 miles of Newark, the Portuguese of the Ironbound, suburban professionals and inner-city workers, blacks and whites, serious music lovers and schoolchildren. Classical stars booked for the premiere season include Jessye Norman, Midori, Yevgeny Kissin, Andre Watts, the Tokyo String Quartet, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.
The opening-night gala will feature the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, which is the center's resident company, the soprano Kathleen Battle, the American Ballet Theater and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Savion Glover, Chita Rivera and others. The program will be taped by PBS for a national "Great Performances" broadcast, perhaps in February. The debut concert of the New Jersey Symphony on Oct. 21 will also be taped by PBS for national broadcast later.
 
The Plans
Sharing Hopes And Burdens
Like projects in other cities around the country, this one began with a study of the needs of arts organizations, commissioned in 1986 by Gov. Thomas H. Kean. After considering suburban sites, consultants at C. W. Shaver & Company recommended Newark, a decision lobbied for by the new administration of Mayor Sharpe James. The original plan for the 12-acre downtown renewal site called for three arts buildings -- a concert hall, a theater and a smaller stage for dance -- as well as a hotel-office complex.
Instead, the project was reconfigured as one building containing a hall of up to 2,750 seats, named Prudential Hall for its largest donor, a 514-seat theater endowed by the Victoria Foundation, and rehearsal spaces, community rooms and reception areas.
Mr. Goldman has taken pains to announce that any effort to win contracts through political connections would be met by disqualifications. In fact, nothing has emerged to cast doubt on the propriety of any part of the project, no small victory, perhaps, in a city where the top officials have frequently been tainted by scandal.
Of the center's $180 million cost, the largest share, more than $100 million, came from the state, with the city giving $10 million, the Federal Government almost $5 million, and corporations, individuals and foundations contributing $20 million, $18 million and $15 million respectively. The $180 million includes $6 million of the first season's $20 million operating budget that is not covered by projected revenues from ticket sales, parking, concessions and gift shop purchases. The $20 million is the seventh largest arts center operating budget in the country.
A week before the opening, the center had sold nearly 91,500 individual and subscription tickets of the 350,000 available for the season through June, Mr. Goldman said, although not all the performances had yet been put on sale. The symphony in particular has benefited, with subscription sales nearly quadrupling to 10,000 from last year, when it performed in Symphony Hall, a former 1920's Shriners' temple on Broad Street in a frayed part of town.
Mayor James said the success stands to reason. "We have the best mousetrap, and when you build the best mousetrap, people will come," he said.
But others have their doubts. One persistent skeptic has been Msgr. William Linder, director of the New Community Corporation, a nonprofit public development effort that has built 3,000 units of housing in Newark since 1973. "It's taking a lot of resources," he said of the arts center, contending that the $180 million might have been better spent on neighborhoods and on the city's schools, which have been taken over by the state after persistently poor performance.
 
The City
Hoping the Glow Will Radiate
David Nasaw, chairman of the history department at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York in Manhattan and an expert on urban entertainment, said that whether the center fostered further development depended on its environment.
"What's around it?" he asked. "If nothing, nothing's going to happen."
For now, the landscape around the arts center is bleak, a vista of parking lots and yawning open tracts an uninspiring 10-minute walk from Pennsylvania Station and the Gateway Towers office complex that marks the very heart of downtown.
Still, Charles F. Cummings, assistant director for state outreach at the Newark Public Library, and the city historian, said: "I feel the electricity. I'm not a civic booster. I'm a historian, and I can tell the difference between truth and farce."
One truth, say city officials, is that crime is down, as elsewhere in the country. The drop in crime here has been 17 percent over the last two years, they said, adding that car theft, in which Newark long led the nation, has particularly plummeted in response to a police crackdown.
There have been some promising signs of downtown real estate activity, although some projects would probably have gone ahead anyway without the promise of the center. Within half a mile, at Broad and Bridge Streets, the city has committed itself to building a new $22 million minor league baseball stadium of 6,000 seats for its revived Newark Bears. Nearer by, Rutgers University recently broke ground for a new $55 million law school building.
Some long-empty landmark buildings may also be stirring to life. Miles Berger, a developer who began assembling a portfolio of venerable downtown properties before the arts center took form, said he planned to put a 200-car garage in the basement of the former Hahne's department store, dating from 1901, and remodel the upper four floors for retail, office and perhaps residential use.
"We already see what the art center can do here," he said, citing the excitement of a pre-opening street party. "Crowds like that haven't been in Newark on a Sunday in 30 years."
The challenge of reviving Newark becomes clear within blocks of the old commercial hub at Broad and Market Streets, itself a pentimento of urban decline. Along Broad Street, near the incongruously gilded dome of the Beaux-Arts City Hall, stands the shell of Newark Renaissance Mall, mired in bankruptcy and illusory as the 121-story building that its developer, Harry Grant, promised Newark more than a decade ago before dropping out of sight. Steel-shuttered liquor stores, furniture-for-credit outlets and storefront churches line the forlorn grid of streets off Springfield Avenue.
It was here, starting on July 12, 1967, that long simmering racial grievances boiled over at the sight of two white police officers dragging a black cabdriver into a Central Ward precinct house. For the next five days, rioters battled more than 6,000 National Guard troops and state police officers in one of the deadliest outbreaks in the nation's summer of violence. Twenty-six people died here, hundreds were injured and 1,500 were arrested before order was restored.
The psychic damage ran deep, a harsh blow for a once thriving city known for its industrial muscle and swinging jazz clubs. The population, which stood at just over 400,000 in 1967 dwindled over the years by almost 150,000, as blacks and whites decamped for suburbia. Today, Newark's population is about 58 percent black, according to city figures, and the fastest-growing ethnic group is Hispanic.
 
The Inspiration
Following the Lead Of Other Cities
For inspiration on renewal in recent years, Newark looked principally to Cleveland and Pittsburgh, two former industrial engines that had fallen into decline and cast their hopes on a cultural renaissance.
In Cleveland, the first American city to go bankrupt since the Depression, the downtown revival began slowly in the 1970's thanks to the Playhouse Square Foundation. It refurbished three 1920's theaters into a new performance center that soon drew other arts groups into its orbit, including, today, the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and the Great Lakes Science Center, as well as a Riviera of shops and cafes on the once dispiriting Cuyahoga River waterfront.
Pittsburgh, having suffered the decline of its steel industry, followed a similar trajectory, with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust kicking off a revival by purchasing an old movie palace. Converted into the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts, it became, in 1987, the $42 million home for the city's ballet, theater and opera companies.
Closer to home, the Brooklyn Academy of Music is shoring up its long-depressed Fort Greene neighborhood. For years, arts-savvy New Yorkers thronged to the academy's Next Wave productions, then streamed home again. Now, however, two fancy new restaurants are being planned, a shopping mall called Atlantic Center is flourishing, and a development corridor has begun to grow toward the Metrotech commercial complex about five blocks away in downtown Brooklyn.
Harvey Lichtenstein, the academy's president, said Newark might succeed faster, because "they have the whole city behind them."
His only advice, he said, is to be progressive and "establish an identity," not just present what others do. "Do things that bring in younger groups," he said. "Keep alive."
The regenerative power of arts projects has not been lost on other cities. But not all projects have been unmitigated successes.
"It fails when cities just declare an artificial art district," said Samina Quraeshi, former head of the design program of the National Endowment of the Arts and now a consultant in Boston.
What are Newark's chances?
"We Are Building It, They Will Come," read the T-shirts of construction workers putting the final touches on the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. But will they?
One market singled out is the thriving Portuguese community along Ferry Street in the rail-encircled district known as the Ironbound, south of the arts center. Planners hope that the new bus loop will bring patrons of the street's many Portuguese restaurants the half mile or so to the arts center, in part through ethnic programming like the Gulbenkian Orchestra of Portugal and the mournful Cape Verdean singer Cesaria Evora. But Licinio Cruz, a Portuguese lawyer and contractor is skeptical. "I don't know," he said. "Portuguese are not art center types."
Gloria Cohn, too, is taking a cautious approach. The 71-year-old widow from Monroe Township, N.J., said she had not had an opportunity to take the hour's drive to Newark in many years. When she and her granddaughter attend those Sunday-afternoon performances, "we may go in a little early and go to one of the restaurants on the premises," she said. "And then we'll probably go home right afterwards."
Emanuel S. Kan of Teaneck said, "I'll still go to New York for the plays." But he expects to spend plenty of time at the new center, he said. He not only bought tickets for six musical performances with his wife, Helen Karls-Ruher, but invested $10,000 in bonds that financed the center's construction. For Mr. Kan, 70, who is president of Olde Dutch International, a decorative housewares company in Saddle Brook, there are no compunctions about visiting Newark. The couple already dine regularly in the Ironbound.
Earl D. Shaw, a physics professor at the Rutgers-Newark campus, and his wife, Erin, a state employee, had no qualms about signing up with friends for a six-show dance series at $170. Mr. Shaw, 60, said he felt comfortable downtown and often met his wife after work for dinner in the Ironbound before returning to their home in Harding Township in Morris County.
"I am an emotional supporter of this project," Mr. Shaw said. "I have great hopes for Newark, and I am hoping the center will have the kind of success that Newark deserves and needs. The riots were 30 years ago. It's time to move beyond that."

HEADLINE: AIDS Experts Leave Journal After Studies Are Criticized

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
Two internationally recognized AIDS experts are resigning from The New England Journal of Medicine's editorial board over the content and handling of articles criticizing the ethics of Federally financed studies of AIDS treatments in third-world countries.
The countries seek a drug regimen less costly than those used in the United States to thwart transmission of the AIDS virus from mothers to infants. In trials involving more than 12,000 infected pregnant women in Africa, Thailand and the Dominican Republic, some women receive the drug AZT, which has worked in studies in the United States, while others receive dummy pills. 
 The journal's attack on the studies, which compares them to the infamous Tuskegee experiment, has led to wide discussion, including harsh criticism of the journal itself, and focuses attention on the role of the 25-member board and the two who are resigning in protest, Drs. David Ho and Catherine M. Wilfert. The two objected to not being consulted before publication of an attack on research that could save lives, and Dr. Ho worried that the attack itself could jeopardize future research on experimental AIDS vaccines.
Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, the journal's chief editor, said that the board's function was to give advice on broad issues and suggestions of authors for editorials and reviews, but that the board was not routinely consulted.
Dr. Ho, a virologist at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in Manhattan, and Dr. Wilfert, a pediatrician at Duke University in Durham, N.C., are the board's chief advisers on AIDS.
A third board member, Dr. Richard P. Wenzel, chairman of medicine at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, said in an interview that he agreed with much of Dr. Wilfert's criticism but was withholding a decision about resigning until after the issue was discussed at the board's annual meeting in December.
Drs. Ho and Wilfert said in separate interviews that they had resigned independently largely because the journal had not consulted them before publishing an editorial that likened the new experiments to the Tuskegee experiment, in which poor black men suffering from syphilis were left untreated.
Dr. Ho, Dr. Wilfert and others have taken issue with the Tuskegee comparison in part because the subjects in the AZT studies were told that some would get dummy pills. In the Tuskegee study the men were not told that penicillin had became available while the study was under way, and so did not know that effective treatment was being withheld.
A full-time staff of editors produces the weekly journal, but Dr. Ho said that "the reason you have an editorial board to help with policy is to get some input when you have major issues like this one, and that clearly did not take place."
In the editorial process, "it was clear that my role was not crucial," he said.
Dr. Ho said he was deeply concerned about how the critical editorial would affect the future of studies to evaluate experimental AIDS vaccines in developing countries.
Dr. Wilfert said she was resigning because the journal published the editorial and another critical article on Sept. 18 without presenting the other side.
Because her name was on the masthead, "it implied that I agreed with it when I didn't," she said.
"It is an error and bad policy" and "a grievous misuse of the journal's power," Dr. Wilfert said.
"Those are not decisions that a few people in the editorial office ought to feel comfortable with, because no one small group of persons, no matter who they are, can cover the waterfront well enough" in translating health policy and practice in developed countries to those in developing countries, Dr. Wilfert said.
Dr. Wilfert said she was resigning effective Dec. 31 in order to "vent my spleen" at the annual meeting. She said she feared that if she resigned sooner "the issue might not be discussed at the meeting."
The journal published a rebuttal two weeks after its attack. It was written by Dr. Harold Varmus, the head of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. David Satcher, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and would not have been printed so quickly had not Dr. Varmus received a leaked copy of the editorial before publication, those involved in the dispute said.
Dr. Marcia Angell, the journal's executive editor, wrote the editorial.
Dr. Wenzel said that if the authors of the critical articles "really knew the facts they would have done a better job."
Dr. Kassirer said he regretted Dr. Ho's and Dr. Wilfert's decisions to resign and was unaware of any similar resignations at the journal, which was founded in 1812.
The editorial board members, who have no set term, Dr. Kassirer said, are named by the chief editor, who can elect not to renew them as members and has done so.
Dr. Kassirer said that Dr. Wilfert "wanted to have prior consultation of the material in the journal, which is just not acceptable to me because prior consultation is not what the editorial board is for."
He said the journal intentionally did not strive to present all sides of an issue "because if you did you would end up with a kind of Talmudic discussion in which readers could end up having no particular view one way or the other and it would be rather boring."
Dr. Varmus, the National Institutes of Health director, said that "The New England Journal of Medicine is trying to attract more attention by making political, ethical, philosophical and economic statements that have traditionally not been in that journal in such an inflammatory way."
But he also said that "before you inflame the public and attract so much attention, you might want to ask experts on the editorial board what they think."
The Massachusetts Medical Society owns The New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Ronald A. Arky, a Harvard Medical School professor who heads the society's publications committee to which Dr. Kassirer reports, said he learned of the resignations last Friday.
"The committee will want to hear from the editor about the resignations" at their next meeting in early November, Dr. Arky said.

HEADLINE: Council Votes to Increase Fines Sharply for Excessive Noise

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
For New Yorkers who have long complained about noisy nightclubs, jackhammers on overtime, shrieking car alarms and howling dogs, the City Council offered a remedy yesterday that members said they hoped would provide more relief than even a good set of earplugs.
Calling their measure a quality-of-life victory that should lower the volume in many neighborhoods, Council members voted to double and triple the fines handed out to repeat offenders among the city's noisemakers. 
 A dog that will not stop barking could cost its owner up to $525, while the proprietor of a noisy bar could face a $24,000 fine after repeated violations of the city's noise code.
Bar and cabaret owners said the increased fines were onerous and could sound the death knell for many businesses. Some Council members opposed the measure, saying it was too broad and could result in unfair summonses.
But residents of some of New York's noisiest neighborhoods said it might provide a chance for them to get a good night's sleep. Rhonda Santamour, who lives on the Upper East Side, said there were nights when music from a bar across the street was so loud that "it's as if the drummer was in my living room up here on the seventh floor."
The bill, which Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is expected to sign, increases fines for repeated noise violations. The code covers noise offenses that range from barking dogs and cranked-up stereos to motorcycle exhaust pipes and thumping music from dance clubs.
Fines for first-time violators will remain the same, but for repeat offenders, the fine would double for a second violation and triple for a third or subsequent violation.
The law will continue to be enforced by inspectors from the Department of Environmental Protection and police officers, who respond to citizen complaints and measure noise levels with noise meters.
"New York City is never going to be a sleepy town where you hear the crickets chirping," said Councilman A. Gifford Miller, who introduced the bill and drafted it with the Department of Environmental Protection. "But I think we can make it a little quieter, a little saner."
Mr. Miller, who represents part of Manhattan's Upper East Side, said his office had fielded numerous complaints from residents who were fed up with noise from local bars and large heating and air-conditioning units that emit loud hums.
Mr. Miller said that many businesses consider the existing fines a cost of doing business but that he hoped the higher fines would encourage businesses to address complaints seriously and pay for necessary renovations to insulate neighbors from the noise.
Christine Pellicano, who in the last decade has watched her neighborhood at Second Avenue and 89th Street evolve from a relatively quiet residential area to a booming bar scene, applauded the bill.
Ms. Pellicano said she hoped that the higher fines would force bars to lower the volume and eventually defuse some of the rowdiness that spills onto the sidewalk.
"I don't think people really grasp the severity of this," she said. "We're not just saying 'shush!,' like we're in a library, because it's not just the noise that's a problem, it's the crowds that it generates and the kind of environment that it creates."
Mike Cafey, the manager of Kelly's Korner, a bar down the street from Ms. Pellicano's home, said the increased fines could shut down small businesses like his. "In order to keep people here and have a good time, you've got to have music," he said. "This is just going to kill business."
Members of the New York Nightlife Association, a coalition of about 50 licensed cabarets and music clubs, said they objected to the bill because it did not differentiate between clubs in residential areas and ones in manufacturing or commercial areas.
"We're not saying nightclubs should be exempt from noise codes," said Robert Bookman, the association's lawyer. "But there has to be a certain amount of tolerance to industries that are important to New York's economy. The city that never sleeps gets its name from licensed nightclubs."
Mark Linial, the owner of Reminisce Bar and Lounge at 73d Street and Second Avenue, said he feared that the new law would "give people a simple way to make a complaint about us even if the complaint has nothing to do with the noise level."
Ms. Santamour, who lives on 73d Street across from Reminisce, said that the bar's managers had been dismissive about her complaints and that she had filed a formal complaint with the city.
She said she had high hopes for the increased fines. "If the pocketbook is where it hurts, then that's what we have available to us," she said. "I think it's a great start."
Mr. Linial said he had spent more than $25,000 on soundproofing measures, like hanging a floating ceiling and installing insulated doors. "This law gives people who are out to hurt us, people who maybe just don't like the kind of people who come to our reggae parties, a new weapon," he said.
The noise code generally limits construction noise to daylight hours, except in emergency situations. It also specifies that burglar alarms must stop ringing after 15 minutes and car alarms should wail for no more than 5 minutes.
The Council voted, 44 to 4, for the higher fines, which will take effect 60 days after the Mayor holds a public hearing and signs the bill. The members who voted against the bill were Herbert E. Berman, Stephen DiBrienza, Una C. Clarke and Annette M. Robinson, all from Brooklyn.
Mr. Berman said he felt the bill was oppressive because it encompassed some situations that could not be helped, such as car alarms that sound off when the owners are not nearby.
"We can't guarantee people that their cars won't be broken into, but now we're going to punish people for trying to protect their cars," he said.
Ms. Robinson said she feared that selective enforcement would unfairly target businesses in her district, which includes Bedford Stuyvesant and Crown Heights.
Who determines what's excessive?" she said. "Standards sometimes can vary based on culture and I'm worried about inspectors or police officers who aren't familiar with the community practicing unequal distribution of the fines."
Randy M. Mastro, Deputy Mayor for Operations, said fears about uneven enforcement were unfounded. "This is an important quality-of-life issue and we intend to fairly, responsibly and comprehensively enforce the law throughout the city."

Surge in Growth Predicted for Europe

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
European economic growth will surge in 1998 to the fastest pace in nearly a decade, putting most European Union countries on course to adopt the planned common currency, the European Commission said yesterday. The forecast showed the economy of the 15-nation union expanding 3 percent next year, beating the 2.6 percent pace of the United States, according to its own predictions, for the first time since 1991.

HEADLINE: Teamsters' Union Staff Members Cite Pressure For Donations

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Several members of the teamsters' union told a Congressional subcommittee today that union officials engaged in an array of questionable tactics to help re-elect President Ron Carey, including pressuring union staff members to make donations to his campaign.
Three staff organizers for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters testified that they were pressured to give more than $1,000 each last year to the Carey campaign or face possible loss of their jobs. Describing another practice barred by Federal labor law, a teamsters' member from Texas said he saw a half-dozen staff organizers doing campaign work for Mr. Carey during their regular work hours. 
 Vincent R. Hickman, a staff member in the union's airline division, said he was asked to donate $100 a month. "I didn't appreciate being told how much I had to donate, but I didn't say anything because of the fear of retaliation, and of course I needed my job." he said.
Although accusations of improper fund-raising have swirled around the election of Mr. Carey almost from the moment he defeated James P. Hoffa, the statements by the three aides today mark the first time union members have testified publicly that they were pressured to donate to Mr. Carey's campaign. Labor experts said it was common for union officials to urge staff members to contribute to their campaigns. These experts noted that last year's teamsters' campaign was by far the most expensive in union history.
At the hearing of the oversight subcommittee of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Republican lawmakers sought to explore improprieties in last year's teamsters' election that went beyond the much-publicized diversion of money from the union's treasury into Mr. Carey's campaign.
For much of the hearing, Representative Peter Hoekstra, the Michigan Republican who heads the subcommittee, faulted the Federal Government for failing to adequately supervise the election, conducted with $17 million in Federal money.
The Government agreed to finance the 1996 election as part of its long-standing effort to make the teamsters' union more democratic and eliminate mob influence.
In August, a Federal election overseer ordered a new election because of improper fund-raising for Mr. Carey's campaign.
Nancy Coleman, a teamsters' spokeswoman, called the Congressional hearing an effort to discredit the labor movement. "This is a circus for anti-labor Republicans," she said. "I felt there was an unfounded understanding by these people that if they didn't give money, they'd be retaliated against. That's ridiculous, because none of these people have been retaliated against."
But Barbara Dusina, an organizer with the teamsters, asserted that she has not received a raise recently because she donated less to the Carey campaign than she had been asked. Ms. Dusina said she contributed $50 a month, even though she had been urged to give $100 a month as well as pay $250 for a fund-raiser and $150 for a Carey rally.
"There was an unspoken message that if any staff person did not contribute, they would be unemployed after a Carey victory," she said.
The union released a letter sent by Mr. Carey to Rep. Hoekstra, that said, "If these people say that they fear retaliation, they are not telling the truth -- and it calls into question the reliability of any information they could give your subcommittee."
Another subcommittee witness, Dane Passo, a Chicago truck driver, testified that he was was badly beaten by a Carey supporter who operates runs a large teamsters' local in Chicago. Mr. Passo faulted Mr. Carey for not removing that official from office. Teamsters' leaders said Mr. Carey was waiting for the official to exhaust appeals of his assault and battery conviction.
To end the four-and-a-half hour hearing, the committee interrogated the former supervisor of the teamsters' political action committee in an effort to prove that Mr. Carey knew about or cooperated in illegal fund-raising schemes. But the witness, Gregory Mullenholz, did not provide any solid proof of that.
Mr. Mullenholz, who said he was fired for cooperating with the F.B.I., an assertion denied by Mr. Carey's aides, said he found several of the union's donations to other groups suspicious. He said he questioned why the union contributed $475,000 to a get-out-the-vote drive by Citizen Action, a liberal grass-roots group, when shortly beforehand the union's political action committee borrowed $300,000 from a bank.
When three former Carey campaign aides pleaded guilty in court last month, they described a scheme in which the union gave money to Citizen Action and some of that group's donors contributed to the Carey campaign.
Mr. Mullenholz said he also questioned donations that the union made to Project Vote and the National Council of Senior Citizens, two groups that helped Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts in last year's Congressional elections. He said William Hamilton, the union's political director, had recommended those contributions, but Mr. Carey's executive assistant had rejected them.
Mr. Mullenholz said he understood that Mr. Hamilton then went directly to Mr. Carey to gain approval. Mr. Mullenholz stopped short of saying Mr. Carey was familiar with any scheme to contribute money to other groups in exchange for having their donors give to the Carey campaign.
Mr. Mullenholz testified that he saw notes that Mr. Hamilton sent to persuade Mr. Carey to donate to Project Vote and the senior citizens' group. But Mr. Mullenholz declined to say whether those notes showed that Mr. Carey had been informed of any improper scheme.
Denying any wrongdoing, Mr. Carey has said he was a victim of his aides' misdeeds. Mr. Hamilton has also denied any wrongdoing.

HEADLINE: U.S. Respects Brazil, Clinton Assures Latin Giant

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Oct. 14

 BODY:
President Clinton had a simple message for Brazil today, and he delivered it over and over, in several different ways: The United States takes this country seriously. Really. It doesn't want to dictate relations in the hemisphere, but just to do more business.
Appearing at a joint news conference here with the Brazilian President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Mr. Clinton tried repeatedly to dispel longstanding Brazilian suspicions of American attitudes. In answer to a Brazilian journalist's question, he said that he did not feel threatened by the emergence of Brazil as a hemispheric powerhouse. 
 "I actually support the emergence of countries to a greater role of influence and responsibilities, as long as they share our basic values," he said, citing commitments to democracy, open trade and environmental protection.
This is the first visit of his Presidency to Brazil, and Mr. Clinton appeared anxiious to play catch-up. He and his aides have repeatedly noted that the European Union is rushing in to capitalize on Brazil's economy.
But Mr. Clinton did not only play the supplicant. He gently nudged Brazil toward joining an effort to reduce greenhouse gases. As nations prepare for an international conference on global warming in December, a central dispute is whether developing countries should share the burden of cutting emissions when developed ones have enjoyed most of the benefits of profligately polluting.
Still, while he said that "we must all participate" in reducing such gases, Mr. Clinton emphasized that he did not expect Brazil's efforts to interfere with its economic growth. "The United States would never knowingly make any suggestion that would undermine the growth of Brazil or any other country," he said.
For his part, Mr. Cardoso repeatedly praised his relations with Mr. Clinton and Brazil's with the United States, updating the American saw about General Motors: "We feel what's good for Brazil is good for the United States, and what's good for the United States is good for Brazil as well."
But he made clear that Brazil would continue expanding trade with all comers, whether or not Mr. Clinton ultimately wins so-called fast-track authority from Congress to conduct trade negotiations. "If there is going to be this sort of a policy or not is the United States' problem," Mr. Cardoso said.
Not all Brazilians were as welcoming as Mr. Cardoso, however. A handful of protesters here pelted the President's limousine with manure.
Mr. Clinton, bowing to a point of Brazilian pride, made the clearest statement to date that the United States recognizes the importance of Mercosur, a regional trade bloc in which Brazil is the biggest member. "I support Mercosur," Mr. Clinton said, adding that any new free-trade zone would be "consistent with Mercosur and the leadership and role of Brazil."
Mr. Clinton said he expected Brazil to sell more to Europe. "I don't feel threatened by it, I just want to make sure we're fully competing," he said. "And if we don't fully compete, it will be our fault, not yours and Europe's." But he took a dig at the Europeans, noting that the United States had lower tariffs than the European Union.
The two leaders said today that, three years after Mr. Clinton won agreement from Latin American leaders for a hemispheric free trade zone by 2005, the two countries would finally begin negotiations toward that goal next year.
But Mr. Cardoso and other Brazilian officials indicated that they wished to move slowly in lowering some barriers to foreign competitors. "We are not prepared to go for a new round of tariff reduction commitments by 2000," said Pedro Malana, the Finance Minister.

HEADLINE: In War Against No-Shows, Restaurants Get Tougher

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
THEY call. They reserve. They don't come.
It's the saddest story in the restaurant business, but it's getting a new plot twist. 
 In coming months, diners all over the United States may find themselves paying for their sins. Like a date who's been stood up once too often, restaurant owners are getting tough with no-shows. Some demand a credit card number to secure reservations for tables of six or more. Others require a deposit of up to $300 and a signed agreement. Now, upping the ante, American Express is going nationwide with a pilot program designed to fight no-shows by dangling the threat of a charge, just like hotels and car-rental agencies.
The American Express initiative, called the Guaranteed Restaurant Reservations Program, allows restaurants to impose a penalty of $60 to $300 on diners who make a reservation for a party of six or more and then fail to cancel the reservation by a specified time, or, Heaven forbid, do not show up at all.
The growing reliance on penalties opens up a new front in an ever-expanding war between shellshocked restaurant owners, who can experience no-show rates of 40 percent on a Saturday night, and outlaw diners who, in some cases, reserve tables at several restaurants, eat at one, and leave the other restaurants hanging.
Calls to 20 of New York's fancier restaurants revealed a variety of enforcement policies, ranging from the old-fashioned honor system to tough requirements for up-front money. The Union Square Cafe and Le Perigord, for example, simply take a telephone number and ask customers to confirm the reservation the day before. Other restaurants ask for a credit card number to hold a large-party reservation, but enforcement varies. Lespinasse takes a credit card number for parties of six or more but does not threaten any charge for a no-show. Montrachet takes a credit card number and will impose a $25-a-person penalty, but allows customers to wait until 4 P.M. to cancel a dinner reservation, or 11 A.M. to cancel lunch.
"It discourages people from making reservations at seven or eight restaurants and deciding at the last minute which one to go to," said John McFadden, the general manager of the River Cafe in Brooklyn, which takes a credit card number for parties of eight or more, with a $25 penalty for each diner. "It doesn't look good to have a large table in the middle of the room that doesn't get used."
Some restaurant owners say they use the credit card tactic purely as a psychological weapon, and do not really intend to impose the fee. Merely taking the number, they say, reduces the no-show rate.
But some restaurants want their money before the meal, and require a deposit of $200 or $300 before guaranteeing a reservation. Callers wanting a table for six or more at Le Bernardin receive a form by fax that asks for their name, address, telephone number, credit card number and signature. Callers must fill out the form and refax it to the restaurant, along with a photocopy of both sides of their credit card. A $200 charge is applied to the credit card and deducted from the bill for the meal. Diners who do not want to deal with a credit card can drop by the restaurant and leave a cash deposit.
Windows on the World, Palio and Les Celebrites also require a deposit for larger parties. Les Celebrites is particularly strict. It requires a $300 deposit for parties of seven or more, and reservations must be canceled at least three days in advance.
American Express has tested its guaranteed reservation concept for three years in two pilot programs involving 44 restaurants across the country, 11 of them in New York, including Aureole, Sign of the Dove and TriBeCa Grill. It is now making the program available to the more than 150,000 restaurants that accept its card. Although the company said it could not predict what the response would be, about half the New York restaurants in the test said they would sign up for the program.
The company zeroed in on large parties because an empty table of six or more causes the most economic damage and is the hardest to fill on short notice. The no-show charge shows up on the customer's monthly American Express bill. Unlike the airlines, which require documentation like a doctor's note before issuing a refund for an unused ticket, American Express has no formal policy on how restaurants should deal with diners who plead illness or an emergency.
Some diners shrug off the new requirement as a minor inconvenience or even welcome it as a way to get an iron grip on a top table, especially if it is out of town. Others rebel. "I've had people laugh in my face, scream at me, or simply say, 'I will not give you my credit card number,' " said Isma Pulaos, the reservations clerk at Aureole. "Most people are nice, though." Some restaurateurs say they suspect that the outbursts and the hang-ups come from diners who have been foiled in attempts to book multiple tables.
To punish or not to punish, that is the question, and it is a divisive one for restaurant owners. In its research, American Express found that owners split three ways when asked if they wanted a program that would let them impose charges on no-shows. One-third liked the idea, one-third hated it and another third wanted more information. At bottom, restaurants want to please, not to discipline, and the idea of slapping fines represents a cultural change that makes many owners queasy.
"Restaurants are not in the business of charging fees," said Lloyd M. Wirshba, the general manager for restaurants at American Express. "They are in the business of providing service and a fine dining experience."
"If I charged one of my customers $50 for a no-show, I'd never see them again," said Raymond Buckler, the maitre d'hotel at Felidia, who said the restaurant looked into the American Express program but decided not to sign up. "It's just not friendly."
American Express started its program after restaurateurs began asking for the kind of guarantees that hotels and car-rental agencies take for granted. In a survey of 1,200 restaurants in 1993, the company found that half reported a no-show problem. Of that number, 65 percent had an overall no-show rate of 10 percent, 15 percent had a rate of 20 percent to 30 percent, and 3 percent had a rate of 30 percent to 40 percent. The problem was most acute on Saturday night, with Friday night a close second.
Gordon Sinclair, the owner of Gordon restaurant in Chicago, had an epiphany about 10 years ago when he began adding up the cost of no-shows and found that the grand total was $900,000 a year, a figure that got him thinking, fast.
He made a change in the restaurant's procedure that underlines the curious moral status of a restaurant reservation, which is less than a contract but something more binding than "let's have lunch."
He instructed his receptionists to stop saying, "Please call us if you change your plans," and start saying, "Will you call us if you change your plans?" His no-show rate dropped from 30 percent to 10 percent. In other words, by asking a question and eliciting a response, he created a sense of obligation.
Ten percent still represents a lot of money, and the hard-core malefactors have proven difficult to root out. They will confirm, reconfirm and still not show. Hence, the American Express program. Under the plan, a restaurant agrees to put into effect the kind of record-keeping procedures that are standard at hotels and car-rental companies and that protect the card holder. Customers making a reservation for six or more people are told that they must use the American Express card and that if they cancel after a set time or do not show up, a per-person charge will appear on their monthly bill. Restaurants may charge either $10 or $25 a person, with a maximum of $300.
If the customer violates the agreement, the restaurant must send him a letter within 48 hours, stating that it intends to impose the agreed-upon penalty.
In January, 18 months into the pilot program, 10,000 reservations had been taken and only seven no-show penalties had been imposed. Although the program ran until May, Mr. Wirshba said the company stopped compiling data.
"For smaller parties, who are not guaranteed, we have a 15 to 20 percent no-show rate," said Henny Santo, an owner of the Sign of the Dove, which took part in the pilot. "For guaranteed reservations, we had a total of six no-shows in three years. The program brings the no-show rate down to zero, virtually. The downside is that it is very time-consuming on the restaurant's part."
American Express said the program, like the cruise missile, is intended to wipe out specific targets rather than wreak mass destruction.
"We believe that this is not going to be used for dinner for two on a Tuesday night, but on an as-needed basis in those instances where the no-show rate has been high, such as holidays and weekends," Mr. Wirshba said.
It may work out that way in most parts of the United States, but in New York, "as needed" means every day. Many of the New York restaurateurs who took part in the pilot program said they plan to use it routinely.
If parties of six require a deposit today, can parties of four be far behind? For the moment, it seems unlikely. With four diners, the trade-off between paper work and indemnity against a no-show becomes a different equation, largely because a popular restaurant can rely on walk-in business to fill an empty table for four. It has become quite common, however, for top restaurants to demand that diners call back and reconfirm the day before a reservation, and some call up diners themselves the day before.
For large parties, a new world looms, with a new etiquette. "Party of six? No problem. Would you like to apply for a reservation?"

HEADLINE: A Dissertation on Mr. Ed?;
New Scholarly Center to Study Pop Television Culture

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN By LAWRIE MIFFLIN

 BODY:
As a typically compulsive undergraduate at the University of Chicago, Bob Thompson used to allow himself just one half-hour of television viewing a week, on Sunday night. And no matter how hard he tried to watch PBS, he always succumbed to "CHiPS," the drama about California motorcycle cops starring Larry Wilcox and Erik Estrada.
This disturbed him. Why, Mr. Thompson, a budding political scientist, asked himself, do smart people love to watch dumb television shows? 
 From that query came a quixotic academic career. Now Dr. Robert J. Thompson, a 38-year-old Syracuse University professor, he is one of the nation's leading scholars in television studies, a relatively new and still formless discipline. This weekend, he will take charge of a new academic research center at the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse, to be christened the Center for the Study of Popular Television -- emphasis on the word "popular."
Television, even television that appeals to the lowest common denominator, can still be great art, Professor Thompson contends, a sort of visually enhanced form of literature. Shakespeare, as people are so often reminded, was a popular artist. Jazz, once dismissed as popular, is now recognized as a discipline worthy of serious study.
Indeed, in a statement announcing the creation of the research center, the dean of the Newhouse School, David Rubin, declares that it will "study television entertainment programs with the same care and passion as musicologists study Mozart and Ellington, or professors of English study Melville and Pynchon."
Poppycock, some other scholars say.
"There's a fallacy there, in assuming that the common run of literature is comparable to Melville, or that the musical norm is comparable to Mozart's work," said Mark Crispin Miller, a leading media scholar who is soon to leave Johns Hopkins University to join New York University. "Those were the greats, who stood out. In the Renaissance, you'd have a hard time finding a play that's even readable other than Shakespeare's plays."
While conceding that the best television programs merit academic attention, Professor Miller said Syracuse's emphasis on the word "popular" concerned him.
"The fact is that most TV drama is esthetically appalling, and most TV comedy is too," he said. "For the most part it's utterly derivative, a pale imitation of whatever seemed to sell six months ago."
Such attitudes drive Professor Thompson to become "even more zealous," as he put it, in defense of his research. He calls such criticism "belle-lettristic apartheid, much of it plain old-fashioned cultural elitism," mostly from people who have scant knowledge of popular television.
"Just because television is filled with bottom-line-oriented profits and is generated by 500 people's hands, we shouldn't be reduced to silence about it," he said.
Professor Thompson in fact admires Professor Miller's work. But he said he believed that enough academic research was being done on subjects like television news coverage; television's influence on politics, violent behavior or sexual mores, and the economic forces behind mass media. What is missing, he said, is the "art appreciation" aspect.
"It is tragic and in many ways dangerous that we are so ignorant as intellectuals about a medium that has such a profound effect on us," he said. "How we perceive art and storytelling is infected and affected by the television era. Look at any modern novel after the year 1960 -- look at Don DeLillo's new book -- and you can't help but see how much television has moved in."
Horace Newcomb, a communications professor at the University of Texas at Austin who was one of the first scholars in this field, as early as 1970, agreed.
"Popular television has been the central storytelling system of our time," he said. "To say it's not important to study that is like saying one shouldn't have studied Dickens or Scott Fitzgerald. I happen to think fiction is crucial to people's lives, and if they're experiencing it this way, or through literature or the stage or the big screen, all are equally deserving of study.
As for Professor Thompson's own research, his most recent book was "Television's Second Golden Age: From 'Hill Street Blues' to 'E.R.' " (Continuum Press, 1996); his next, due next year, is "Good TV: The 'St. Elsewhere' Story."
"I think 'St. Elsewhere' is probably the best show ever on American prime-time TV," Professor Thompson said, because of the intricacy of its writing.
After switching from political science, his undergraduate major, Professor Thompson earned a doctorate in film and television studies from Northwestern University. He taught there and at the State University of New York at Cortland before moving to the Newhouse School at Syracuse seven years ago.
Along the way, he became convinced that "there was enormous vacuum to be filled" in terms of "inventing the discipline of television studies as a serious academic pursuit."
His dream of creating a center for such work was endorsed by Dr. Rubin, the Newhouse School dean, who helped raise more than $430,000 to start the new center.
 
Encouraging Books About TV
In addition to being a locus for scholarly research and teaching, the center will encourage publication of books about television by the Syracuse University Press, expand Syracuse's collection of scripts and videos, create an academic journal on television and continue an oral history project that Syracuse lured away from the University of California at Los Angeles.
That archive attracted the bulk of the center's financing, $300,000 from the Steven H. and Alida Brill Scheuer Foundation. Mr. Scheuer wrote a series of television and video guidebooks and was the host of a public television program, "All About Television," in the 1970's and 80's.
His patronage in this case benefits David Marc, who had been compiling an oral history archive on television pioneers who were Jewish and how Jewish culture was reflected in television. At Syracuse, the project is being expanded to capture as many early television pioneers as possible. More than 70 interviews are already on file, from Steve Allen to Betty White.
The question persists as to whether, aside from the nostalgia value, these people and the shows they worked on deserve academic study.
"Every new creative medium gets dismissed," said Robert M. Batscha, the president of the Museum of Television and Radio in New York, , which opened a branch in Los Angeles last year. "Film was dismissed, photography was dismissed, modern art, modern theater -- all were dismissed at first. When the Museum of Modern Art began to look at this new art form, nobody understood it. It took a while before the museum began to educate people. Then MOMA and the Eastman House did the same with film."
But, said Dr. Batscha, who is a political scientist and communications scholar, many of the country's most creative young people now go into television. And he said he believed that this trend might feel threatening to "the establishment, to people who have dedicated their careers to other art forms."
A pillar of the establishment begs to disagree. Stephen H. Balch, the president of the tradition-minded National Academy of Scholars, said it would take 30 or 40 years before scholars know what television programs are worthy of academic study. "With art, particularly the art we study in the academy, we have greater confidence in its inherent greatness by the fact that much time has passed, and many people have sifted through it, and still the appreciation for it continues," he said.
 
A Familiar Part Of Their Lives
Unlike most other art forms, television for most of today's students is a familiar and integral part of their lives. Professor Thompson sees in that fact a potential educational benefit.
"When I was at Cortland, I taught a course in the history of television from Milton Berle to 'The Simpsons,' and you can't help talking about all kinds of American traditions that go into that," he said. "You talk about 'The Beverly Hillbillies' and 'Andy Griffith' and you get into the celebration of the rural in American life, the emphasis on nature, from Thoreau to Melville's noble savages to Emerson's Walden Pond. Invariably, students would come to me afterward and say, 'Where can I read this stuff?'
"It's a connection for them, using television to teach the liberal arts notion that human endeavors are all part of a great cultural conversation. We turned them into good old-fashioned, critical-thinking intellectuals better than many English or philosophy classes were doing on that campus, because in those classes, they never felt invited into the conversations."
Dr. Balch called that theory "dumbing the intellect down," a phrase he attributed to Daniel Patrick Moynihan. "Rather than bring the students up to the level where an educated person should be," he said, "we're bringing education down to their level, and filling it up with things that are already part and parcel of their daily life, instead of with new challenges."
And Professor Miller, who has written in praise of Hitchcock as well as Shakespeare, could not accept Professor Thompson's cultural continuum argument.
"You can find some sort of tradition for any piece of garbage that's out there, whether musical or cinematic or literary," he said. "Everything has forebears. But to claim any meaningful connection between 'The Beverly Hillbillies' and 'Walden' is just silly."
Dr. Batscha, of the Museum of Television and Radio, admittedly has a different bias. But he recalled that at the turn of the century teaching popular novels was considered silly in an academic tradition that emphasized the classics.
"You wouldn't think of teaching culture in the United States now without studying the novel, or films," he said. "And hopefully a few years from now you wouldn't think of studying 20th-century culture without studying television."

HEADLINE: Restrain Inflation Genie

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Robert Eisner (Op-Ed, Oct. 11) misses a major issue in regard to inflation: inflation psychology, the greatest danger. I am in the real estate and construction business, which is highly sensitive to interest rates. I would much rather that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, tinker with interest rates in quarter-point increments to keep the genie of inflation psychology firmly in the bottle than take any chance that it gets out and be forced to go back to the days of Paul Volcker, when the prime rate was allowed to go up to 21 percent to get inflation under control. 
 In spite of what Mr. Eisner says, there are inflationary pressures in the economy. You have only to look around in daily life to feel this -- go out to dinner, go to the movies, fill the gas tank, buy a home or rent an apartment.

HEADLINE: Give Judges a Raise

 BODY:

To the Editor:
An Oct. 11 news article on President Clinton's veto of the late-term abortion measure included a one-sentence paragraph on his approval of a spending bill that will permit members of Congress to receive a long-overdue 2.3 percent cost-of-living adjustment raise for next year. 
 Federal judges are the only Government employees who have not been granted a COLA for 1998. This is a result of an obscure law commonly known as Section 140, which requires Congress to vote to grant judges a COLA.
If Section 140 is not repealed, judges will be denied a COLA for the fifth consecutive year. Congress should repeal this unfair provision.

HEADLINE: A Rain Forest Imperiled

 BODY:
The issue that most Americans identify with Brazil -- the destruction of the Amazon rain forest -- did not occupy a prominent role in the talks between President Clinton and Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The issue deserved better, though neither man is comfortable with the subject. Washington still subsidizes logging in America's temperate rain forests. Brazil has abandoned some of its worst policies in the Amazon, yet it is not enforcing its laws and seems oblivious to a range of new and insidious threats from timber and agricultural interests.
The state of the world's rain forests is particularly distressing now that global warming has again become a major international concern. Growing forests help absorb the gases that warm the atmosphere. Burning those forests, of course, adds to the problem. 
 More of Brazil is on fire right now than ever before. The fires are not as widespread as they are in Indonesia, where smoke has spread to neighboring nations, nor is commercial logging the main culprit. Brazil's fires are largely the handiwork of agricultural interests that clear land for cattle ranching, with a modest assist provided by subsistence farmers who engage in small-scale slash-and-burn tactics. This year, cities like Manaus that have gone unscathed in the past have been blanketed with smoke. Manaus has also reported a 40 percent increase in respiratory illnesses.
The fires are increasing despite Brazil's efforts in the past few years to protect the forest. The Government ended its ruinous subsidies to the cattle ranchers, and now requires that settlers keep 80 percent of their land forested. Brazil has also set aside about 20 percent of the forest as parks, protected areas and indigenous reserves.
But the ranchers keep on burning, and the laws are not enforced. Brazil's environmental protection agency has only about 80 enforcement officers in the whole of the Amazon. Worse, Brazil's courts have ruled that the agency does not have the authority to enforce the law, which means that it cannot even collect the fines it levies. A bill giving the agency authority to punish environmental criminals has passed the senate and is now before Brazil's lower house. It is a bill the Amazon obviously needs.
Tough enforcement is especially important now. There could be a major drought this year or next, leading to widespread fires, if the climate-altering weather pattern known as El Nino strikes as expected. A graver danger may come from industrial interests. President Cardoso favors cutting roads and blasting waterways through large swaths of the forest. This could provide a new transportation network for big farmers who want to clear land to grow soybeans for export to Europe.
New roads could also lead to increased logging. Already companies from Malaysia, China, Korea and other nations, many of which use clearcutting in Asia, are beginning to log part of the forest. As these companies pave roads deeper into the jungle, cattle ranchers may follow. The roads may make clearcutting economically viable and tempt Brazil to sell off the rain forest for hard currency.
Although a muscular environmental agency is Brazil's most pressing need, it is not the only one. If Brazil goes ahead with the plan to improve Amazon transportation, it must simultaneously address environmental concerns and earmark more land for conservation. A worthy program to set aside indigenous areas, which both preserves the forests and protects Indian tribes, is only half-completed. Brazil must finish the job, which would protect 10 percent more of the Amazon.
The country also needs to develop zoning laws for the forests and to adopt sustainable logging practices. More broadly, Brazil, like the United States and Asia's forested nations, must abandon the view that the rain forest is only a commodity to be exploited for private gain.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Foreign and Fed Buying Aids Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Treasury securities advanced yesterday as investors returned from a long holiday weekend to find that overseas bargain hunters had pushed up prices.
Gains were extended after the Federal Reserve entered the market, buying Treasuries on what is known as a coupon pass. And there was buying on relief that the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, did not sound more inflation warnings in a talk at the annual monetary conference of the Cato Institute in Washington. 
 "In fact," said Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif., "Mr. Greenspan was probably telling the markets a whole lot more last week, that he will raise rates, but that the timing was not clear. There was nothing market-moving in his speech today, only relief that he did not mention tight labor markets again, which produced a quick spike in bond prices."
A survey from last week taken by Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, showed no significant changes in Fed policy expectations despite Mr. Greenspan's warnings, according to Kim Rupert, an economist there.
"A tightening is still not generally expected until the Feb. 3 and 4 Federal Open Market Committee meeting," Ms. Rupert said. "A move at the Dec. 16 F.O.M.C. is still a close call, with about 58 percent expecting no tightening."
The 30-year bond gained 29/32, to a price of 100 9/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 6.35 percent, from 6.42 percent on Friday.
Bonds were also buoyed when the Fed entered the market to buy securities. The central bank bought $1.4 billion of securities with maturities that ran from November 2002 through August 2027, in a process commonly called a coupon pass, which permanently adds reserves to the banking system without a change in policy.
Citing speculation that today's retail sales report for September may suggest the economy is slowing, some analysts said the Fed could delay any rate increase a little longer. Some economists are expecting that retail sales to be unchanged, after gaining four-tenths of a percent in August.
Tomorrow the Government is to release the Consumer Price Index for September, with the report expected to show a gain of three-tenths of a percent excluding volatile food and energy costs.
Ms. Rupert said the data on retail sales should be friendly, but the Consumer Price Index could be ugly. "If retail sales are soft and the C.P.I. later in the week does not surprise, the market could see a relief rally," Ms. Rupert said, adding, however, "It is doubtful whether the highs reached the day of the employment report on Oct. 3 can be revisited anytime soon."
Results at the Treasury's weekly bill auction, which was held yesterday because Monday was a Federal holiday, were called good, with the rate for a three-month bill going to 4.98 percent from 4.93 percent last week. The six-month bill rate also climbed, to 5.12 percent from 5.01 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.741	97.412	Discounted Rate	4.98%	5.12%	Coupon Yield	5.11%	5.33%	High Price	98.744	97.422	Discounted Rate	4.97%	5.10%	Coupon Yield	5.10%	5.31%	Low Price	98.741	97.412	Discounted Rate	4.98%	5.12%	Coupon Yield	5.11%	5.33%	Accepted at low price	42%	39%	Total applied for	$59,262,120	$39,090,409	Accepted	$11,260,003	$11,144,989	Noncompetitive	$1,361,762	$1,157,159	

Both issues are dated Oct. 16. The three-month bills mature on Jan. 15 and the six-month on April 16.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Filing Off 4%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Personal bankruptcies fell in the third quarter as the result of an expanding economy and steady job growth.
The number of people filing for bankruptcy protection declined 4 percent, to 335,218, according to CDB Infotek of Santa Ana, Calif., which provides on-line access to records. In the second quarter, applications reached a high of 349,281. 
 "Since bankruptcies are a lagging indicator, we could see further declines," said Rick Rozar, CDB's president.
While the number fell, it was still up 9.7 percent from the third quarter of '96, CDB said.
In the 12 months ending on Sept. 30, bankruptcies declined the most in North Carolina, Iowa, Kentucky and Arkansas; they rose most in Utah, Maryland and New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Class Notes

BYLINE: By Ethan Bronner By Ethan Bronner

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The concept of a new Middle East has taken such a thrashing in the past year or two that, when a glimmer of it appears, the natural tendency for many is a roll of the eyes. Lately, every time there is talk of the children of Abraham joining hands for a better future, someone blows himself up in a crowded market or bulldozers break ground on disputed land. Threats are voiced, guns are raised and hopes fade yet again.
But the eye rollers would benefit from sitting in on the weekly meeting of the energetic board of directors of what has been optimistically named the University of the Middle East. 
 At the meeting, typically held on Sundays around a supper table at an Italian restaurant in the North End of Boston, the skeptics would find Hala Taweel, the disarming sister-in-law of Yasir Arafat, breaking bread with Ron Rubin, an Israeli-American physicist. There are Camelia Anwar Sadat, daughter of the former President of Egypt Anwar Sadat, and Walid Chamoun, whose Maronite Christian family went to war to rid its native Lebanon of Mr. Arafat's forces in the 1970's, thereby helping begin a civil war.
At the meetings, the jokes fly, the camaraderie is easy.
The plan they share is this: to build, over the next 30 years, a university with campuses across the Middle East and North Africa to promote coexistence and economic development. The first branches would be in Israel, the Palestinian areas and probably Egypt. Students and faculty would be required to spend time at one another's campuses, bringing Israelis and Arabs, Christians and Muslims, into scholarly and social contact.
Elie Wiesel, the Nobel peace laureate, has written a letter endorsing the project, as has Lea Rabin, widow of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. Diplomats from Spain, Japan and Britain have expressed their governments' support.
Peace through education may sound quaint in the rough-and-tumble world of Middle Eastern politics, but to the participants it is the most natural thing in the world. Many of them first came into contact with their putative enemies on a university campus.
"I had never had any real contact with an Israeli until I came to the Kennedy School at Harvard and 18 of my fellow students were Israelis," recalled Ms. Taweel, 32, the president of the board and a doctoral candidate in higher educational administration at Boston College. Her sister, Suha, is married to Mr. Arafat. "Not only that, they were all military officers. By the end of the year, we became very good friends."
Mr. Rubin, 27, who came up with the idea for the university after Mr. Rabin's assassination, said he first met Palestinians and other Arabs while an undergraduate at Princeton and decided that an academic environment was ideal for breaking down traditional barriers.
The project, which operates out of donated offices here with donated furniture and equipment, has raised $50,000. The plan is to raise $500,000 and begin feasibility studies in three countries and a pilot summer course in Morocco or Egypt.
"We hope to begin real classes in five years," Mr. Rubin said.
If it all sounds a bit utopian, it might be worth listening to Kanan Makiya, an Iraqi dissident author in Cambridge and a supporter of the project, who said, "Peace in the Middle East, real peace, will come as an effort of the heart or it will not come at all."

HEADLINE: 3 More Brokerage Houses Post Income Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch & Company, the Bear Stearns Companies and Paine Webber Group Inc. yesterday became the latest big brokerage houses to report healthy quarterly earnings on the strength of the bull market and record merger activity.
They join Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company; Goldman, Sachs & Company; Lehman Brothers Holdings; Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., and Smith Barney in reporting large gains. 
 Merrill, the No. 2 securities firm behind Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, said profits rose 49 percent. No. 5 Bear Stearns said profits rose 49 percent and No. 6 Paine Webber said profits rose 41 percent.
The rising demand for stocks coupled with low interest rates have encouraged many companies to raise cash by selling both stocks and bonds -- businesses that earn investment banks big underwriting fees. In addition, global consolidation in many industries has helped generate significant revenues for Wall Street firms that provide advice on mergers and acquisitions.
Merrill Lynch earned $494 million, or $1.25 a share, in the third quarter ending Sept. 26, compared with $331 million, or 84 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year ago.
The results beat Wall Street expectations of $1.21 a share, according to a survey by I.B.E.S. International Inc. Nevertheless, Merrill's stock was down $1.44 at $75.56 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
Merrill said revenues after interest expenses rose to $3.9 billion from $3.1 billion. The company said it set revenue records in commission, investment banking and asset management fees.
Merrill was No. 1 in the United States in merger and acquisition deals completed, with 30 percent of the market, and No. 2 globally, with 20.3 percent, according to the Securities Data Company, which tracks the performance of Wall Street firms. Bear Stearns earned $161.6 million, or $1.11 a share, in its first fiscal quarter ending Sept. 26, compared with $108.8 million, or 72 cents a share, a year ago.
The results were in line with analysts' forecasts of $1.10 a share. Bear Stearns stock was down 25 cents at $44.50 on the Big Board.
The company said revenues after interest expenses rose to $996.1 million from $688.7 million, led by gains in underwritings, stock and bond trading, and fees from mergers and acquisition advice.
Paine Webber said quarterly profits rose to a record $112.8 million, or $1.11 a share, compared with $80.2 million, or 79 cents, a year ago.
The results exceeded analysts' forecasts of 87 cents a share. Paine Webber's stock was up $1.5625 at $50.75 a share on the Big Board.
Revenues after interest expenses rose 23 percent, to $1.08 billion from $883 million, led by gains in the firm's brokerage, trading, asset management and investment banking businesses.

HEADLINE: 2 Get Nobel for a Formula at the Heart of Options Trading

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Two North American scholars won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science yesterday for work that enables investors to price accurately their bets on the future, a breakthrough that has helped power the explosive growth in financial markets since the 1970's and plays a profound role in the economics of everyday life.
Robert C. Merton of the Harvard Business School and Myron S. Scholes, a Canadian-born professor emeritus at the Stanford Business School, will share the $1 million award for helping devise a mathematical formula that provided the answer to a simple but seemingly insurmountable problem confronting Wall Street: how to measure the worth of an option. 
 Their solution helped lay the basis of today's vast global options marketplace, where the trading affects everyone with a stake in the financial markets, from employees who receive stock options as part of their pay to mutual fund investors who use options to hedge interest-rate risk.
An option is a type of investment that allows, but does not require, an investor to buy an asset, like stocks or bonds or wheat or pork bellies, at a prearranged price during a preset period of time.
Until 1973, when Mr. Merton and Mr. Scholes published their analysis, it was extremely difficult to assess all the variables that could affect the price of an option. Their work overcame that difficulty, which had limited the growth of the options markets.
"Such rapid and widespread application of a theoretical result was new to economics," the prize committee wrote. "Nowadays, thousands of traders and investors use the formula every day" -- making it easy for businesses and individuals to hedge risks in the incredibly complex world of modern finance.
 The announcement of the Nobel in economics, which has been awarded annually by the Bank of Sweden since 1969, excites the academic community, but usually ignites little genuine enthusiasm on Wall Street. Not so this year. "I'm thrilled," said William Brodsky, chairman of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which owes a large part of its growth to the Nobel winners. "This Nobel not only recognizes Merton and Scholes's accomplishments, it underscores the importance of options in the world of finance."
The analysis the two worked out has been successfully applied not only to pricing options but also to numerous other "derivative" securities, so named because their value is determined by fluctuations in the value of other assets.
Using derivatives is now a common way to redistribute the risks of doing business. Although in recent years derivatives have been associated with some financial disasters -- they played a role in the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., and the demise of Barings, Britain's oldest investment bank -- derivatives are widely regarded as beneficial.
Farmers, for example, use derivatives when they sell crops on the futures markets even before the planting has been finished. By locking in a price, they protect themselves if prices fall, although they also give up the chance of a windfall if prices surge. By the same token, grain dealers, bakeries and other big purchasers often buy grain futures to hedge against the risk of rising crop prices.
 But what is the real worth of, say, an option to buy 100 shares of Intel at $105 each before next April or the right to borrow 400 million French francs at 9 percent by next Tuesday?
By the early 1960's, a handful of economists had both an interest in the puzzle and the advanced mathematical tools to solve it.
"We knew the answer was there, and that someone was going to find it," recalled Paul Samuelson, an economist at M.I.T. who later won a Nobel for work in other areas of economics.
 The breakthrough came from three researchers, each under the age of 30 -- and one not even an economist. Fischer Black, a mathematician with Arthur D. Little consultants in Boston, discovered that an acquaintance, Mr. Scholes, then a professor of finance at M.I.T., was also fascinated by the question of options value. They enlisted the help of an assistant to Professor Samuelson at M.I.T., Mr. Merton, who is the son of the famous Columbia University sociologist Robert K. Merton.
 Together they devised a mathematical formula, known as the Black-Scholes model, that took into account a variety of variables.
Mr. Black and Mr. Scholes had considerable difficulty finding a publisher. Their paper languished for three years before the prestigious Journal of Political Economy printed it in 1973. Mr. Merton walked an easier path, but only because he was a friend of the editor of the new Bell Journal of Economics. "Finance just wasn't part of the economics mainstream," Mr. Merton recalled in an interview yesterday.
 The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the first devoted to options trading, opened just as the Black-Scholes theory was published. Although complicated, the computation involved could be easily -- and virtually instantly -- done on the pocket calculators that were just becoming popular.
 Soon traders were valuing options on the floor of the exchange, punching half a dozen numbers into electronic calculators hard-wired with the formula. This not only meant quicker and more accurate pricing, it also increased the volume of options markets and reduced the cost of using options.
 Mr. Black and Mr. Scholes became so highly regarded at the exchange that when they visited, traders would give them a standing ovation.
Thanks to extensions suggested by Mr. Merton, uses for the formula have been found in virtually every nook and cranny of finance.
Mr. Merton, who earned his Ph.D. from M.I.T in 1970, taught there until 1988, when he moved to the Harvard Business School. The Nobel caps a long career in helping to transform corporate finance from a backwater to the hot zone of economics. "Bob Merton is the Isaac Newton of his field," Mr. Samuelson said.
 In 1973, Mr. Scholes went back to teach at the University of Chicago Business School, where he had earned his Ph.D. In 1983 he moved on to the Stanford Business School, where he taught until retirement in 1996. That was hardly the end of his career, though. He and Mr. Merton are principals in Long Term Financial Management, the immensely successful multibillion-dollar private investment fund formed by John Meriwether when he broke with his partners at Salomon Brothers.
"These guys can do finance both ways: high theory, or down and dirty," Stephen Ross, an economist at the Yale School of Management, said of the new Nobel recipients.
And Peter L. Bernstein, a consultant to institutional investors and a historian of the securities industry, said yesterday, "All I can say is: What took the Nobel committee so long?"
 Mr. Merton said he had no particular plans for the $500,000 that he will receive at a ceremony on Dec. 10.
"It's all been a blast," he said. "My only regret is that Fischer Black isn't here to share the prize." Mr. Black, a partner in Goldman, Sachs and a former president of the American Economic Association, died in 1995 at the age of 57.

For centuries, market traders relied on instinct and gut feeling to decide how much to pay today for something whose value depends on an uncertain future; an example would be an option contract, which confers the right to buy or sell a security or commodity at a set price for a set time. But economists who tried to develop mathematical methods for valuing options struggled vainly until three young researchers -- Fischer Black, Robert C. Merton and Myron S. Scholes -- hit upon a formula in the late 1960's that substantially solved the problem. Their big breakthrough came in realizing the role played by volatility.
 
The algebra looks complex, but the concept is straightforward. Most of the hard work comes in determining what expected means.
 
In the form above, the formula gives the value today of a call option, represented by the letter C. A call option is the right to buy a stock at a set price called the strike price (L) before a fixed future date called the maturity (time to maturity is represented as t). The letter d stands for a combination of the formula's other variables; it relates movements in the stock price to movements in the option's value.
 
The formula assigns a higher value to the option if today's share price (S) is high, if the share price is very volatile (s, the price's standard deviation) and interest rates in general are high (r is the risk-free return available on Treasuries). Similarly, the longer the time to maturity, the lower the strike price, and the greater the likelihood that the option will be worth more at maturity (N is the normal distribution function).
 
The method is now so commonplace that pocket calculators are available with the formula built in: A trader or investor can punch in S, N, L, r and t and price an option contract in seconds. With minor variations, the formula can also be used to price many things whose value depends on events yet to come, like other kinds of options, futures, derivatives, and insurance policies.

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Seeks Peace Force to Dampen the Brazzaville Flames

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 14

 BODY:
With a sudden intensification of civil war in the Congo Republic threatening to engulf several West African nations in a regional conflict, Secretary General Kofi Annan asked the Security Council tonight to impose sanctions on the country and to prepare to send a peacekeeping force there.
He described the Congo Republic as a battlefield on which Angolan troops with tanks, soldiers from the neighboring Congo, formerly Zaire, and various mercenary armies were all involved. The battle began earlier this year with a rivalry between current and past presidents. 
 The Congo Republic's capital, Brazzaville, lies across the river from Kinshasa, the capital of Congo.
Shells have been falling on Kinshasa for more than a week, with more falling as the Brazzaville presidential palace came under attack in the last 24 hours. In effect, diplomats said today, President Laurent Kabila of Congo, facing rebellion in the eastern part of the country, now has a war on two fronts.
In what diplomats described as a spirited two-hour meeting with the Council, Mr. Annan asked for the authority to send an advance team of about 160 military experts to set up a headquarters in Libreville, Gabon, to prepare for action in the Congo Republic, where the United Nations has been trying to broker a cease-fire with the help of the Gabonese President, Omar Bongo.
Mr. Annan met resistance from only the United States, officials said after the meeting. Under an agreement with Congress, the Clinton Administration must notify legislators 15 days before a mission and can delay Security Council action indefinitely.
Mr. Annan challenged the United States not to block this mission as it has been blocking other peacekeeping plans in Africa in recent years, rendering the United Nations powerless in a series of crises.
"Given the urgency of the situation, I hope the agreement of Washington will be forthcoming," Mr. Annan said. "I don't think anyone would want to be responsible for holding back international action in this difficult situation."
Mr. Annan said that according to letters he received today from the Brazzaville and Kinshasa Governments and information from independent sources, it appeared that Angolan troops had seized two southern towns in Congo Republic and were involved in fighting in the capital.
Diplomats said there are credible reports that President Kabila of Congo has sent hundreds of troops across to the neighboring country. The Congo Republic Government asserted today that there were at least 1,000 Angolans also involved in the war.
The war in Congo Republic began in June, when forces loyal to President Pascal Lissouba surrounded the home of the political rival and former president, Gen. Denis Sassou-Nguesso. In recent weeks, the fighting has increased in intensity, with General Sassou-Nguesso fighting back, apparently with Angola's help.
Today, Secretary General Annan, a Ghanaian, said the expanding war was a serious threat to peace in west-central Africa. "Given the involvement of neighboring troops, given the possibility that this will spill over to other countries in the region," he said, "if we do not act to put pressure on them and show action, it may be much worse later on."
If the members act, it would be the first peacekeeping operation that the council approved in the past two years.

HEADLINE: Moody's Warns That New York State's Budget Could Spawn Gigantic Deficits

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 14

 BODY:
A major Wall Street rating agency is warning that New York State's budget, with its commitments to deep tax cuts and big increases in school spending -- and what the agency sees as a risky reliance on a continued bull market -- is a prescription for enormous budget deficits in a few years.
The report by Moody's Investors Service echoes criticism already heard from State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, independent budget watchers like the Citizens Budget Commission, and others. But the warning carries particular weight coming from Moody's, whose judgments are closely watched in the financial markets. The report is to be released later this week. 
 Moody's did not change its credit rating for New York, the lowest for any state, and it predicted that the state's finances will remain stable for at least another year, and probably longer. In other words, things are likely to remain fine past November 1998, when Gov. George E. Pataki will stand for re-election.
But the report criticizes the $67.4 billion budget negotiated by the Governor and legislative leaders, and enacted in August, for making five-year commitments to phasing in tax cuts and broad new education programs, which together will cost the state more than $6 billion a year. The budget allowed lawmakers to go into an election year boasting of the politically popular cuts and programs, but most of the bill will not come due until 2001 and 2002.
The report asserts that the budget includes "deep backloaded tax cuts and multiyear spending obligations requiring future, unspecified spending cuts."
But administration officials insist that the budget will not result in a retreat from the long-term commitments or in serious program cuts. The Governor and his aides have often noted that, defying doubters' predictions, the state has been able since he was elected to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time.
"We've been getting this kind of criticism for three years," said Donna Arduin, first deputy budget director. She noted that the first two fiscal years under Mr. Pataki ended "not just with balanced budgets but with large surpluses."
But that has happened during the historic Wall Street boom, which has sent the state's personal income tax collections soaring. Moody's, like most other budget-watchers, argues that the state appears to be counting on a continued bull market, despite the historic volatility of financial markets and the possibility of a recession over the next five years.
"If this level of growth and prosperity continues," said Robert Kurtter, senior vice president of Moody's for state ratings, "it is possible for the state to grow its way out of the long-term budget gaps, but that's not a prudent thing to plan on."
The reliance on Wall Street is particularly risky, the report says, because the boom there has masked sluggishness in the underlying economy, with New York lagging well behind the rest of the country in job growth.
But Ms. Arduin insisted that the budget does not depend on a continued stock market boom to remain balanced.
Moody's also took issue with the budget for increasing spending more than 5 percent, much faster than inflation, after two years of relative restraint with Mr. Pataki in office, and for increasing New York's debt load, already the highest by far of any state.

HEADLINE: University for Working Adults Shatters Mold

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER By ETHAN BRONNER

DATELINE: PHOENIX

 BODY:
Just off the shimmering asphalt ribbons of Interstate 10, minutes from the Phoenix airport, in a zone of windshield and transport companies, sits a set of brick office buildings that contains what many view as the biggest challenge to higher education in the United States today.
The name on the unassuming structures, the University of Phoenix, suggests a local college. But, like its setting, that is deceptive. 
 With 40,000 students, the University of Phoenix has grown into the largest private university in the nation, galloping ahead of such powerhouses as New York University and the University of Southern California.
But more significantly, it has done so using a new model consonant with the times, turning itself into a kind of H.M.O. of education: It is run as a for-profit business, paying taxes rather than accepting public subsidies; it rents space rather than buying buildings for its makeshift campuses across a dozen states; and its courses are standardized in shrink-wrap packages.
Phoenix has also chosen to do something else unusual. It accepts no one under the age of 23 and only those gainfully employed. Since 45 percent of higher-education students are 24 or older, Phoenix is tapping into an exploding and lucrative portion of a $200 billion higher-education market where costs have been widely seen as out of control.
"This is a very significant time in higher education," said Timothy J. McDonough, vice president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. "Adult learning is skyrocketing. People don't understand that there is a market out there. Phoenix has grasped that very well."
It is unlikely that the Phoenix model will soon dominate higher education since there will long be a place for residential institutions for 18- to 22- year-olds where instruction is blended with socialization. But there is little doubt that Phoenix's practices, like keeping virtually no full-time faculty and stocking no libraries, are spreading and are a source of great worry to many colleges that benefit from tax subsidies yet still struggle financially.
"I was asked to speak at Rutgers recently about what we do and the response among the assembled faculty was telling," said Laura Palmer Noone, vice president for academic affairs at the University of Phoenix. "The reaction was divided into three groups. A few found what we do exciting, a second group dismissed us as a passing fad, and the last group looked at me like I was the antichrist, spelling the doom of life as they know it."
The University of Phoenix, which has been accredited for 20 years, is not a place to discover the eternal verities of the Western tradition. It offers B.A.'s and M.A.'s, mostly in business and in fields like information technology, health and education. While it is a leader in distance education, meaning course work over the Internet, most of its classes involve working professionals teaching other working professionals in classrooms.
Phoenix sets itself apart with its unwavering corporate orientation. Its advocates say that when, in the 1970's, the nation's economy began a shift to one based on information, corporations came to universities asking for help in updating and retraining employees but that the universities were slow to respond.
Many companies took matters into their own hands, setting up corporate universities of which there are now some 1,200. But none of them are accredited: they cannot offer degrees. The University of Phoenix, whose regional accreditation is accepted nationally, has therefore been able to sell itself as the best of both worlds.
Some 75 percent of Phoenix students are at least partly reimbursed by their companies for tuition, which, at about $6,500 a year, is somewhat higher than public universities but lower than most private ones. Classes are limited to 15 to 20 students, and there is a great deal of work in small groups.
Some of this has recently been going on at other universities as the need for income from adult students has become more pressing. But most extension programs tend to be institutional stepchildren. At Phoenix, it is all the university does.
"When I was looking around to get my M.B.A. in 1992, Arizona State did not offer evening classes the way the University of Phoenix did," said Ike Schneider of Alliant Food Service in Phoenix, who got his master of business administration there with an emphasis in technology management. "I went one evening a week, worked in small groups and was very satisfied."
The university is the creation of John G. Sperling, 76, a restless, plain-talking contrarian. Born to a Missouri sharecropping couple, Mr. Sperling discovered books while at sea as a merchant marine, returned to college in Oregon and ultimately earned a doctorate in economic history from Cambridge University in England. He started an academic career only to find it stifling.
While teaching at San Jose State University in the late 1960's, Mr. Sperling became involved in a project on juvenile delinquency, in which he brought teachers and police officers to campus for courses.
"We worked with them in small groups," he recalled in an interview, "and since these were adults with little patience for lectures, the instructors had to act more as facilitators than traditional professors. The students had a great deal to offer not only to one another but to the instructor. The students loved it and asked if they could turn the seminars into vehicles for obtaining B.A.'s and M.A.'s."
By 1973, Mr. Sperling had 2,500 paying students at several universities. But the regional accrediting body accused him of running a diploma mill and shut him down.
He moved to Phoenix which falls under a different regional accrediting body and started over, gaining accreditation within five years.
The University of Phoenix has functioned largely in the West and Southwest. But that began changing rapidly after the December 1994 public offering of shares of its parent company, the Apollo Group, on the Nasdaq exchange. Started at $2 a share, it is today trading at over $40. As a result, Mr. Sperling, as Apollo's chairman and chief executive, is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
Driven by Mr. Sperling's vision of a national for-profit university, Phoenix campuses have recently opened in Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Oregon and Washington.
"We're moving inexorably eastward," Mr. Sperling said. "As you go east, the barriers against outside universities get higher until you get to New York, where they are nearly insurmountable. But we'll overcome them, too."
Last summer, after a lobbying campaign, Apollo persuaded the Pennsylvania Legislature to revoke its ban on for-profit universities. It will soon apply for licensing in the state.
"Other institutions perceive them as aggressive, in-your-face," said Dr. Steven Crow, executive director of the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the North-Central Association of Colleges and Schools, the Chicago group that has accredited Phoenix since 1978.
"They are also not very collegial, bashing traditional education," Dr. Crow said. "They move into places real fast and real hard, and all of a sudden everyone is trying to maintain a niche."
Sometimes that can backfire. In Michigan last year, the University of Phoenix asked the Ford Motor Company for space in its training quarters.
Peter Stockmann, who runs the quarters, said he was happy to rent to Phoenix as he had done to other companies. But within a few months, he said, advertisements run in the area made it look as if the university was being sponsored by Ford, rather than simply renting space from it.
Ford executives felt used, Mr. Stockmann said, and severed the relationship.
The head of Phoenix in Michigan, Sarah Serra, said there had been no effort to imply a relationship that did not exist.
The contretemps does not seem to have hurt Phoenix's expansion in Michigan, where it has nearly 2,000 students after only 18 months. In Florida, the university has found quick success partly because the population growth of the state has overburdened state universities unable to handle the demand.
The evidence around the country and a visit to several classes suggest that while Phoenix may not be a beacon of scholarship or a leader in community service, it takes its product -- adult education intended to serve corporations -- seriously. Students seem satisfied and instructors return frequently.
Dr. Crow, the accrediting officer, said that traditional criteria for judging universities, like the percentage of full-time faculty members, the breadth of its libraries and the number of seat hours per course for students, might be outdated, especially for institutions that cater to working adults.
All of which pleases Phoenix officials who have even begun acquiring a touch of academic credibility by bringing on board a few more traditional academics.
One such professor is Jorge Klor de Alva, an anthropologist and philosopher who left a professorship at Princeton University for an endowed chair at the University of California at Berkeley and is now leaving there to become a vice president at Apollo.
Dr. Klor de Alva said it was not money but a new frontier that drew him to Apollo.
"Academia is a calling, a closed system," Dr. Klor de Alva said. "But at Apollo we are seeking to address real needs in the real world. We're erasing the moment in life when you either make it as a student or you don't. This is a second-chance outfit geared to an expanding world economy. Right now there are not many second chances offered out there. The University of Phoenix is at the very center of a new frontier of redefining higher education. And I think it is unstoppable. The genie is out of the bottle."

During a visit to the Summit Child Care Center yesterday, she spoke of her commitment to issues concerning women. 
 "Whether it's cutting taxes and getting rid of some business regulations that will allow, particularly, women and small businesses to thrive in the state and see our unemployment rate go down to 5.2 percent, or expanding our commitment to keeping our streets safe; expanding the stalking law so that women do not have to fear in their homes; taking out the statue of limitations on sexual assault cases; enhancing penalties for those who use date-rape drugs, to getting rid of drive-through deliveries and assuring that there is adequate research dollars for breast cancer research. Those are issues that are not just of interest to women, they are of interest to everyone in the state of New Jersey."

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN By MELODY PETERSEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Hundreds of union members rallied at the foot of the State House steps today, cheering as their leaders vowed to unseat Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in what they say will be their largest political effort in decades.
An estimated 400 people, most of them state workers, cheered wildly as Mrs. Whitman's Democratic opponent, State Senator James E. McGreevey, took the stage. But the crowd's energy seemed to stem not so much from their support for Mr. McGreevey as their anger at Governor Whitman, a Republican who has cut the state work force by 3,300 jobs and hired private companies to replace some of those workers. 
 While several small labor unions have endorsed Mrs. Whitman, the spirited crowd today made it clear that it would be Mr. McGreevey who would soon benefit from the statewide unions' plan to run a coordinated "get out the vote" effort involving hundreds of labor volunteers and paid for with hundreds of thousands of dollars of union dues.
"The labor movement in this state has never been together like this before," said Charles Wowkanech, president of the state's A.F.L.-C.I.O. "And let me tell you something: On Nov. 4, we're going to have a Governor that the labor force supports."
While Mr. McGreevey basked in his labor support, Mrs. Whitman spent much of her day and evening courting women's votes. Tonight, 1,500 women paid $100 each to attend a fund-raiser at the East Brunswick Hilton. At the gala, the Governor recounted how she had delivered on her earlier promises to create jobs, cut taxes and make the streets safer.
"We've been trying to deliver on those promises," she said, "and we've been shattering the glass ceiling as we've been doing it."
Mrs. Whitman said that 37 percent of her political appointments were women. "I didn't appoint them because they were women," she said. "I appointed them because they were the best."
Earlier in the day, she went to a child-care center in Summit to highlight the endorsements she has received from women's political advocacy groups. She toured the center with United States Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican from Maine.
Jeanine LaRue, the founding president of the New Jersey Women's Summit, said, "In record numbers, this Governor has appointed women to cabinet positions, exploding the myth that it's difficult to find qualified women to perform in high-level positions in government." The Summit had endorsed Mrs. Whitman's opponent, Gov. Jim Florio, in 1993.
Mrs. Whitman also received the endorsement of the Medical Society of New Jersey. It was the first time the group had endorsed a candidate for Governor in its 231-year history.
Mr. McGreevey started his day with a fund-raiser in Philadelphia and a speech at a breakfast meeting with 100 Jewish leaders from across the state in Livingston, before heading to the labor rally in Trenton.
In recent years, labor unions in New Jersey and across the country have become increasingly active in political campaigns. Organized labor spent millions of dollars across the nation last year, hoping to help Democrats regain control of Congress. In New Jersey, for example, organized labor helped put Robert G. Torricelli, a Democrat, just over the top in his race against Richard A. Zimmer for United States Senate.
Already, the Communications Workers of America Local 1032, which represents 2,500 state transportation workers, has paid for radio ads attacking Mrs. Whitman for cutting back on the maintenance of state highways and for hiring a private company to count state-owned billboards.
Other radio ads are likely, union leaders said today. But they said that they could not afford to pay for television commercials and that most of their effort would go into organizing volunteers to run phone banks and get voters to the polls on Election Day. National labor organizations are also lending support to Mr. McGreevey's campaign.
"TV commercials won't win this thing," Mr. Wowkanech said. "Our strength is here today," he said, waving out toward the crowd. "What you will see on Nov. 4 is the best labor operation the state has ever known."
Not all union workers support Mr. McGreevey. On Monday, the former president of the state's A.F.L.-C.I.O., Charles H. Marciante, endorsed Mrs. Whitman. Mr. Marciante said today that the Governor had helped workers across the state by creating jobs, especially in southern New Jersey, where a new $330 million tunnel and road project will soon be built in Atlantic City. The project, which will be partly paid for with state funds, will provide access to planned casinos in the Marina district.
Mrs. Whitman has also been endorsed by several smaller unions representing thousands of law enforcement officers, nurses and construction workers across the state.
The Governor says her 30 percent cut in the state income tax rate has spurred the state's economic recovery and created thousands of jobs. Indeed, the state has its lowest unemployment rate in seven years and its job growth is now outpacing that of New York and Connecticut.
But many of the state's new jobs do not pay as much as the manufacturing jobs that were lost during the recession. And a recent Rutgers University study found that the average wages for most jobs in the state did not keep pace with inflation from 1990 to 1995.
When asked why he did not support the Governor, Jim Marketti, the president of Local 1032, responded with a question: "She created jobs? For who? Hamburger flippers?"

HEADLINE: Newark Hopes for Revival Far Beyond Arts Center

SERIES: DOWNTOWN GAMBLE: A special report.

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
Gloria F. Cohn, a widow from Middlesex County, N.J., has not ventured into this battle-scarred city for years. But she recently sent in $108 for tickets for herself and her granddaughter to a series of Sunday afternoon family dance programs and plays in the heart of downtown.
The lure is the new $180 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center, a glimmering glass-shelled structure that is opening on Oct. 18 on a formerly desolate renewal tract in sight of the towers of Manhattan, across the bleak industrial flats and the Hudson River. 
 In one of the country's great urban gambles, Newark is pinning a good part of its battered hopes for a comeback on the arts, specifically on this arklike complex of concert hall and theater, rehearsal space and food concessions. Planners hope it will set off a downtown commercial and residential revival in a city still struggling to recover from the shattering riots of 30 years ago.
"Those who said the performing arts center could never be built are now squabbling over tickets," said Lawrence P. Goldman, the center's president and guiding force, who came from the vice presidency of Carnegie Hall in 1989 to steer the project through the crucial last eight years of arduous conception and on-time construction.
Newark is hardly alone in seeking a salvation through the arts. With mixed results, dozens of cities, from New York with its emblematic Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, to San Jose, Calif., have built or are planning major arts projects in hopes of improving civic fortunes and polishing civic images. Every one of the nation's 50 largest cities, in fact, uses the arts to support community development, the National Endowment for the Arts recently reported.
But Newark may be asking more of the arts than anyplace else. There is little new besides the performing arts center to draw people like Ms. Cohn downtown, although 85,000 people commute here each day for jobs and higher education programs. The city continues to suffer from a reputation as a dangerous place of intractable problems where each succeeding mayoral administration seems to attract its own Federal and state investigations.
Yet the smooth completion of the project and extensive efforts to knit it into the fabric of the city have raised hopes that Newark, using the arts to create a critical mass to set off further development, may finally be turning around. Significantly, the effort is being pushed not only with city, state and Federal money, but also by a loyal band of hometown boosters, powerful philanthropists like Raymond G. Chambers, and corporate citizens like the Prudential Insurance Company of America, whose fortunes have been bound up with the city's for 120 years.
"A city doesn't function if it's open only eight hours a day," said Arthur F. Ryan, Prudential's chairman and chief executive officer.
 
The Audience
Attracting Crowds, By Careful Design
Perhaps the biggest unanswered question is whether the arts center's audiences will come in just for performances and then head home again or be enticed to linger and spend money. To improve the odds, the arts center, paneled by its architect, Barton Myers, in pearwood that glows warmly through the see-through facade, was situated to foment milling crowds, a bustle that planners say translates to safety.
The design does not rely on bridges, flyovers or tunnels to channel pedestrian flow; from the renovated 1,100-car underground parking garage beneath Military Park, patrons will have to ascend to the street and cross to the arts center. Inside, in broad and detailed ways, efforts were made to attract and appeal to a wide spectrum of patrons. Bathrooms were tiled in interpretations of African kente cloth patterns. Moneymaking catering areas were included: the first bat mitzvah service has already been booked, for $10,000, for a board member's daughter, in 1999.
A new 10-stop, $1 bus loop was created, linking the arts center to attractions like the Newark Museum, the Newark Public Library, Pennsylvania Station and restaurant-lined Ferry Street in the heavily Portuguese Ironbound district. Streets and highways were festooned with hundreds of directional signs to prevent what Mr. Goldman called " 'Bonfire of the Vanities' syndrome," the terror of being lost in an ominously derelict neighborhood.
"This is the big idea: to change the way people think about Newark," said Mr. Goldman, 51. "It's not the place where you get your car stolen; it's where you go to concerts."
The programming, too, was blended to the presumed tastes of a broadly diverse audience of 4.6 million New Jerseyans within 25 miles of Newark, the Portuguese of the Ironbound, suburban professionals and inner-city workers, blacks and whites, serious music lovers and schoolchildren. Classical stars booked for the premiere season include Jessye Norman, Midori, Yevgeny Kissin, Andre Watts, the Tokyo String Quartet, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.
The opening-night gala will feature the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, which is the center's resident company, the soprano Kathleen Battle, the American Ballet Theater and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Savion Glover, Chita Rivera and others. The program will be taped by PBS for a national "Great Performances" broadcast, perhaps in February. The debut concert of the New Jersey Symphony on Oct. 21 will also be taped by PBS for national broadcast later.
 
The Plans
Sharing Hopes And Burdens
Like projects in other cities around the country, this one began with a study of the needs of arts organizations, commissioned in 1986 by Gov. Thomas H. Kean. After considering suburban sites, consultants at C. W. Shaver & Company recommended Newark, a decision lobbied for by the new administration of Mayor Sharpe James. The original plan for the 12-acre downtown renewal site called for three arts buildings -- a concert hall, a theater and a smaller stage for dance -- as well as a hotel-office complex.
Instead, the project was reconfigured as one building containing a hall of up to 2,750 seats, named Prudential Hall for its largest donor, a 514-seat theater endowed by the Victoria Foundation, and rehearsal spaces, community rooms and reception areas.
Mr. Goldman has taken pains to announce that any effort to win contracts through political connections would be met by disqualifications. In fact, nothing has emerged to cast doubt on the propriety of any part of the project, no small victory, perhaps, in a city where the top officials have frequently been tainted by scandal.
Of the center's $180 million cost, the largest share, more than $100 million, came from the state, with the city giving $10 million, the Federal Government almost $5 million, and corporations, individuals and foundations contributing $20 million, $18 million and $15 million respectively. The $180 million includes $6 million of the first season's $20 million operating budget that is not covered by projected revenues from ticket sales, parking, concessions and gift shop purchases. The $20 million is the seventh largest arts center operating budget in the country.
A week before the opening, the center had sold nearly 91,500 individual and subscription tickets of the 350,000 available for the season through June, Mr. Goldman said, although not all the performances had yet been put on sale. The symphony in particular has benefited, with subscription sales nearly quadrupling to 10,000 from last year, when it performed in Symphony Hall, a former 1920's Shriners' temple on Broad Street in a frayed part of town.
Mayor James said the success stands to reason. "We have the best mousetrap, and when you build the best mousetrap, people will come," he said.
But others have their doubts. One persistent skeptic has been Msgr. William Linder, director of the New Community Corporation, a nonprofit public development effort that has built 3,000 units of housing in Newark since 1973. "It's taking a lot of resources," he said of the arts center, contending that the $180 million might have been better spent on neighborhoods and on the city's schools, which have been taken over by the state after persistently poor performance.
 
The City
Hoping the Glow Will Radiate
David Nasaw, chairman of the history department at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York in Manhattan and an expert on urban entertainment, said that whether the center fostered further development depended on its environment.
"What's around it?" he asked. "If nothing, nothing's going to happen."
For now, the landscape around the arts center is bleak, a vista of parking lots and yawning open tracts an uninspiring 10-minute walk from Pennsylvania Station and the Gateway Towers office complex that marks the very heart of downtown.
Still, Charles F. Cummings, assistant director for state outreach at the Newark Public Library, and the city historian, said: "I feel the electricity. I'm not a civic booster. I'm a historian, and I can tell the difference between truth and farce."
One truth, say city officials, is that crime is down, as elsewhere in the country. The drop in crime here has been 17 percent over the last two years, they said, adding that car theft, in which Newark long led the nation, has particularly plummeted in response to a police crackdown.
There have been some promising signs of downtown real estate activity, although some projects would probably have gone ahead anyway without the promise of the center. Within half a mile, at Broad and Bridge Streets, the city has committed itself to building a new $22 million minor league baseball stadium of 6,000 seats for its revived Newark Bears. Nearer by, Rutgers University recently broke ground for a new $55 million law school building.
Some long-empty landmark buildings may also be stirring to life. Miles Berger, a developer who began assembling a portfolio of venerable downtown properties before the arts center took form, said he planned to put a 200-car garage in the basement of the former Hahne's department store, dating from 1901, and remodel the upper four floors for retail, office and perhaps residential use.
"We already see what the art center can do here," he said, citing the excitement of a pre-opening street party. "Crowds like that haven't been in Newark on a Sunday in 30 years."
The challenge of reviving Newark becomes clear within blocks of the old commercial hub at Broad and Market Streets, itself a pentimento of urban decline. Along Broad Street, near the incongruously gilded dome of the Beaux-Arts City Hall, stands the shell of Newark Renaissance Mall, mired in bankruptcy and illusory as the 121-story building that its developer, Harry Grant, promised Newark more than a decade ago before dropping out of sight. Steel-shuttered liquor stores, furniture-for-credit outlets and storefront churches line the forlorn grid of streets off Springfield Avenue.
It was here, starting on July 12, 1967, that long simmering racial grievances boiled over at the sight of two white police officers dragging a black cabdriver into a Central Ward precinct house. For the next five days, rioters battled more than 6,000 National Guard troops and state police officers in one of the deadliest outbreaks in the nation's summer of violence. Twenty-six people died here, hundreds were injured and 1,500 were arrested before order was restored.
The psychic damage ran deep, a harsh blow for a once thriving city known for its industrial muscle and swinging jazz clubs. The population, which stood at just over 400,000 in 1967 dwindled over the years by almost 150,000, as blacks and whites decamped for suburbia. Today, Newark's population is about 58 percent black, according to city figures, and the fastest-growing ethnic group is Hispanic.
 
The Inspiration
Following the Lead Of Other Cities
For inspiration on renewal in recent years, Newark looked principally to Cleveland and Pittsburgh, two former industrial engines that had fallen into decline and cast their hopes on a cultural renaissance.
In Cleveland, the first American city to go bankrupt since the Depression, the downtown revival began slowly in the 1970's thanks to the Playhouse Square Foundation. It refurbished three 1920's theaters into a new performance center that soon drew other arts groups into its orbit, including, today, the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and the Great Lakes Science Center, as well as a Riviera of shops and cafes on the once dispiriting Cuyahoga River waterfront.
Pittsburgh, having suffered the decline of its steel industry, followed a similar trajectory, with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust kicking off a revival by purchasing an old movie palace. Converted into the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts, it became, in 1987, the $42 million home for the city's ballet, theater and opera companies.
Closer to home, the Brooklyn Academy of Music is shoring up its long-depressed Fort Greene neighborhood. For years, arts-savvy New Yorkers thronged to the academy's Next Wave productions, then streamed home again. Now, however, two fancy new restaurants are being planned, a shopping mall called Atlantic Center is flourishing, and a development corridor has begun to grow toward the Metrotech commercial complex about five blocks away in downtown Brooklyn.
Harvey Lichtenstein, the academy's president, said Newark might succeed faster, because "they have the whole city behind them."
His only advice, he said, is to be progressive and "establish an identity," not just present what others do. "Do things that bring in younger groups," he said. "Keep alive."
The regenerative power of arts projects has not been lost on other cities. But not all projects have been unmitigated successes.
"It fails when cities just declare an artificial art district," said Samina Quraeshi, former head of the design program of the National Endowment of the Arts and now a consultant in Boston.
What are Newark's chances?
"We Are Building It, They Will Come," read the T-shirts of construction workers putting the final touches on the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. But will they?
One market singled out is the thriving Portuguese community along Ferry Street in the rail-encircled district known as the Ironbound, south of the arts center. Planners hope that the new bus loop will bring patrons of the street's many Portuguese restaurants the half mile or so to the arts center, in part through ethnic programming like the Gulbenkian Orchestra of Portugal and the mournful Cape Verdean singer Cesaria Evora. But Licinio Cruz, a Portuguese lawyer and contractor is skeptical. "I don't know," he said. "Portuguese are not art center types."
Gloria Cohn, too, is taking a cautious approach. The 71-year-old widow from Monroe Township, N.J., said she had not had an opportunity to take the hour's drive to Newark in many years. When she and her granddaughter attend those Sunday-afternoon performances, "we may go in a little early and go to one of the restaurants on the premises," she said. "And then we'll probably go home right afterwards."
Emanuel S. Kan of Teaneck said, "I'll still go to New York for the plays." But he expects to spend plenty of time at the new center, he said. He not only bought tickets for six musical performances with his wife, Helen Karls-Ruher, but invested $10,000 in bonds that financed the center's construction. For Mr. Kan, 70, who is president of Olde Dutch International, a decorative housewares company in Saddle Brook, there are no compunctions about visiting Newark. The couple already dine regularly in the Ironbound.
Earl D. Shaw, a physics professor at the Rutgers-Newark campus, and his wife, Erin, a state employee, had no qualms about signing up with friends for a six-show dance series at $170. Mr. Shaw, 60, said he felt comfortable downtown and often met his wife after work for dinner in the Ironbound before returning to their home in Harding Township in Morris County.
"I am an emotional supporter of this project," Mr. Shaw said. "I have great hopes for Newark, and I am hoping the center will have the kind of success that Newark deserves and needs. The riots were 30 years ago. It's time to move beyond that."

HEADLINE: AIDS Experts Leave Journal After Studies Are Criticized

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
Two internationally recognized AIDS experts are resigning from The New England Journal of Medicine's editorial board over the content and handling of articles criticizing the ethics of Federally financed studies of AIDS treatments in third-world countries.
The countries seek a drug regimen less costly than those used in the United States to thwart transmission of the AIDS virus from mothers to infants. In trials involving more than 12,000 infected pregnant women in Africa, Thailand and the Dominican Republic, some women receive the drug AZT, which has worked in studies in the United States, while others receive dummy pills. 
 The journal's attack on the studies, which compares them to the infamous Tuskegee experiment, has led to wide discussion, including harsh criticism of the journal itself, and focuses attention on the role of the 25-member board and the two who are resigning in protest, Drs. David Ho and Catherine M. Wilfert. The two objected to not being consulted before publication of an attack on research that could save lives, and Dr. Ho worried that the attack itself could jeopardize future research on experimental AIDS vaccines.
Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, the journal's chief editor, said that the board's function was to give advice on broad issues and suggestions of authors for editorials and reviews, but that the board was not routinely consulted.
Dr. Ho, a virologist at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in Manhattan, and Dr. Wilfert, a pediatrician at Duke University in Durham, N.C., are the board's chief advisers on AIDS.
A third board member, Dr. Richard P. Wenzel, chairman of medicine at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, said in an interview that he agreed with much of Dr. Wilfert's criticism but was withholding a decision about resigning until after the issue was discussed at the board's annual meeting in December.
Drs. Ho and Wilfert said in separate interviews that they had resigned independently largely because the journal had not consulted them before publishing an editorial that likened the new experiments to the Tuskegee experiment, in which poor black men suffering from syphilis were left untreated.
Dr. Ho, Dr. Wilfert and others have taken issue with the Tuskegee comparison in part because the subjects in the AZT studies were told that some would get dummy pills. In the Tuskegee study the men were not told that penicillin had became available while the study was under way, and so did not know that effective treatment was being withheld.
A full-time staff of editors produces the weekly journal, but Dr. Ho said that "the reason you have an editorial board to help with policy is to get some input when you have major issues like this one, and that clearly did not take place."
In the editorial process, "it was clear that my role was not crucial," he said.
Dr. Ho said he was deeply concerned about how the critical editorial would affect the future of studies to evaluate experimental AIDS vaccines in developing countries.
Dr. Wilfert said she was resigning because the journal published the editorial and another critical article on Sept. 18 without presenting the other side.
Because her name was on the masthead, "it implied that I agreed with it when I didn't," she said.
"It is an error and bad policy" and "a grievous misuse of the journal's power," Dr. Wilfert said.
"Those are not decisions that a few people in the editorial office ought to feel comfortable with, because no one small group of persons, no matter who they are, can cover the waterfront well enough" in translating health policy and practice in developed countries to those in developing countries, Dr. Wilfert said.
Dr. Wilfert said she was resigning effective Dec. 31 in order to "vent my spleen" at the annual meeting. She said she feared that if she resigned sooner "the issue might not be discussed at the meeting."
The journal published a rebuttal two weeks after its attack. It was written by Dr. Harold Varmus, the head of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. David Satcher, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and would not have been printed so quickly had not Dr. Varmus received a leaked copy of the editorial before publication, those involved in the dispute said.
Dr. Marcia Angell, the journal's executive editor, wrote the editorial.
Dr. Wenzel said that if the authors of the critical articles "really knew the facts they would have done a better job."
Dr. Kassirer said he regretted Dr. Ho's and Dr. Wilfert's decisions to resign and was unaware of any similar resignations at the journal, which was founded in 1812.
The editorial board members, who have no set term, Dr. Kassirer said, are named by the chief editor, who can elect not to renew them as members and has done so.
Dr. Kassirer said that Dr. Wilfert "wanted to have prior consultation of the material in the journal, which is just not acceptable to me because prior consultation is not what the editorial board is for."
He said the journal intentionally did not strive to present all sides of an issue "because if you did you would end up with a kind of Talmudic discussion in which readers could end up having no particular view one way or the other and it would be rather boring."
Dr. Varmus, the National Institutes of Health director, said that "The New England Journal of Medicine is trying to attract more attention by making political, ethical, philosophical and economic statements that have traditionally not been in that journal in such an inflammatory way."
But he also said that "before you inflame the public and attract so much attention, you might want to ask experts on the editorial board what they think."
The Massachusetts Medical Society owns The New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Ronald A. Arky, a Harvard Medical School professor who heads the society's publications committee to which Dr. Kassirer reports, said he learned of the resignations last Friday.
"The committee will want to hear from the editor about the resignations" at their next meeting in early November, Dr. Arky said.

HEADLINE: Council Votes to Increase Fines Sharply for Excessive Noise

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
For New Yorkers who have long complained about noisy nightclubs, jackhammers on overtime, shrieking car alarms and howling dogs, the City Council offered a remedy yesterday that members said they hoped would provide more relief than even a good set of earplugs.
Calling their measure a quality-of-life victory that should lower the volume in many neighborhoods, Council members voted to double and triple the fines handed out to repeat offenders among the city's noisemakers. 
 A dog that will not stop barking could cost its owner up to $525, while the proprietor of a noisy bar could face a $24,000 fine after repeated violations of the city's noise code.
Bar and cabaret owners said the increased fines were onerous and could sound the death knell for many businesses. Some Council members opposed the measure, saying it was too broad and could result in unfair summonses.
But residents of some of New York's noisiest neighborhoods said it might provide a chance for them to get a good night's sleep. Rhonda Santamour, who lives on the Upper East Side, said there were nights when music from a bar across the street was so loud that "it's as if the drummer was in my living room up here on the seventh floor."
The bill, which Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is expected to sign, increases fines for repeated noise violations. The code covers noise offenses that range from barking dogs and cranked-up stereos to motorcycle exhaust pipes and thumping music from dance clubs.
Fines for first-time violators will remain the same, but for repeat offenders, the fine would double for a second violation and triple for a third or subsequent violation.
The law will continue to be enforced by inspectors from the Department of Environmental Protection and police officers, who respond to citizen complaints and measure noise levels with noise meters.
"New York City is never going to be a sleepy town where you hear the crickets chirping," said Councilman A. Gifford Miller, who introduced the bill and drafted it with the Department of Environmental Protection. "But I think we can make it a little quieter, a little saner."
Mr. Miller, who represents part of Manhattan's Upper East Side, said his office had fielded numerous complaints from residents who were fed up with noise from local bars and large heating and air-conditioning units that emit loud hums.
Mr. Miller said that many businesses consider the existing fines a cost of doing business but that he hoped the higher fines would encourage businesses to address complaints seriously and pay for necessary renovations to insulate neighbors from the noise.
Christine Pellicano, who in the last decade has watched her neighborhood at Second Avenue and 89th Street evolve from a relatively quiet residential area to a booming bar scene, applauded the bill.
Ms. Pellicano said she hoped that the higher fines would force bars to lower the volume and eventually defuse some of the rowdiness that spills onto the sidewalk.
"I don't think people really grasp the severity of this," she said. "We're not just saying 'shush!,' like we're in a library, because it's not just the noise that's a problem, it's the crowds that it generates and the kind of environment that it creates."
Mike Cafey, the manager of Kelly's Korner, a bar down the street from Ms. Pellicano's home, said the increased fines could shut down small businesses like his. "In order to keep people here and have a good time, you've got to have music," he said. "This is just going to kill business."
Members of the New York Nightlife Association, a coalition of about 50 licensed cabarets and music clubs, said they objected to the bill because it did not differentiate between clubs in residential areas and ones in manufacturing or commercial areas.
"We're not saying nightclubs should be exempt from noise codes," said Robert Bookman, the association's lawyer. "But there has to be a certain amount of tolerance to industries that are important to New York's economy. The city that never sleeps gets its name from licensed nightclubs."
Mark Linial, the owner of Reminisce Bar and Lounge at 73d Street and Second Avenue, said he feared that the new law would "give people a simple way to make a complaint about us even if the complaint has nothing to do with the noise level."
Ms. Santamour, who lives on 73d Street across from Reminisce, said that the bar's managers had been dismissive about her complaints and that she had filed a formal complaint with the city.
She said she had high hopes for the increased fines. "If the pocketbook is where it hurts, then that's what we have available to us," she said. "I think it's a great start."
Mr. Linial said he had spent more than $25,000 on soundproofing measures, like hanging a floating ceiling and installing insulated doors. "This law gives people who are out to hurt us, people who maybe just don't like the kind of people who come to our reggae parties, a new weapon," he said.
The noise code generally limits construction noise to daylight hours, except in emergency situations. It also specifies that burglar alarms must stop ringing after 15 minutes and car alarms should wail for no more than 5 minutes.
The Council voted, 44 to 4, for the higher fines, which will take effect 60 days after the Mayor holds a public hearing and signs the bill. The members who voted against the bill were Herbert E. Berman, Stephen DiBrienza, Una C. Clarke and Annette M. Robinson, all from Brooklyn.
Mr. Berman said he felt the bill was oppressive because it encompassed some situations that could not be helped, such as car alarms that sound off when the owners are not nearby.
"We can't guarantee people that their cars won't be broken into, but now we're going to punish people for trying to protect their cars," he said.
Ms. Robinson said she feared that selective enforcement would unfairly target businesses in her district, which includes Bedford Stuyvesant and Crown Heights.
Who determines what's excessive?" she said. "Standards sometimes can vary based on culture and I'm worried about inspectors or police officers who aren't familiar with the community practicing unequal distribution of the fines."
Randy M. Mastro, Deputy Mayor for Operations, said fears about uneven enforcement were unfounded. "This is an important quality-of-life issue and we intend to fairly, responsibly and comprehensively enforce the law throughout the city."

The City Council voted yesterday to double and triple fines for repeated violations of the city's noise law. These are the ranges of fines for first, second and third offenses. Fines within each range are at the discretion of the investigator.

Surge in Growth Predicted for Europe

BYLINE: Bloomberg News Bloomberg News

 BODY:
European economic growth will surge in 1998 to the fastest pace in nearly a decade, putting most European Union countries on course to adopt the planned common currency, the European Commission said yesterday. The forecast showed the economy of the 15-nation union expanding 3 percent next year, beating the 2.6 percent pace of the United States, according to its own predictions, for the first time since 1991.

HEADLINE: Teamsters' Union Staff Members Cite Pressure For Donations

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Several members of the teamsters' union told a Congressional subcommittee today that union officials engaged in an array of questionable tactics to help re-elect President Ron Carey, including pressuring union staff members to make donations to his campaign.
Three staff organizers for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters testified that they were pressured to give more than $1,000 each last year to the Carey campaign or face possible loss of their jobs. Describing another practice barred by Federal labor law, a teamsters' member from Texas said he saw a half-dozen staff organizers doing campaign work for Mr. Carey during their regular work hours. 
 Vincent R. Hickman, a staff member in the union's airline division, said he was asked to donate $100 a month. "I didn't appreciate being told how much I had to donate, but I didn't say anything because of the fear of retaliation, and of course I needed my job." he said.
Although accusations of improper fund-raising have swirled around the election of Mr. Carey almost from the moment he defeated James P. Hoffa, the statements by the three aides today mark the first time union members have testified publicly that they were pressured to donate to Mr. Carey's campaign. Labor experts said it was common for union officials to urge staff members to contribute to their campaigns. These experts noted that last year's teamsters' campaign was by far the most expensive in union history.
At the hearing of the oversight subcommittee of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Republican lawmakers sought to explore improprieties in last year's teamsters' election that went beyond the much-publicized diversion of money from the union's treasury into Mr. Carey's campaign.
For much of the hearing, Representative Peter Hoekstra, the Michigan Republican who heads the subcommittee, faulted the Federal Government for failing to adequately supervise the election, conducted with $17 million in Federal money.
The Government agreed to finance the 1996 election as part of its long-standing effort to make the teamsters' union more democratic and eliminate mob influence.
In August, a Federal election overseer ordered a new election because of improper fund-raising for Mr. Carey's campaign.
Nancy Coleman, a teamsters' spokeswoman, called the Congressional hearing an effort to discredit the labor movement. "This is a circus for anti-labor Republicans," she said. "I felt there was an unfounded understanding by these people that if they didn't give money, they'd be retaliated against. That's ridiculous, because none of these people have been retaliated against."
But Barbara Dusina, an organizer with the teamsters, asserted that she has not received a raise recently because she donated less to the Carey campaign than she had been asked. Ms. Dusina said she contributed $50 a month, even though she had been urged to give $100 a month as well as pay $250 for a fund-raiser and $150 for a Carey rally.
"There was an unspoken message that if any staff person did not contribute, they would be unemployed after a Carey victory," she said.
The union released a letter sent by Mr. Carey to Rep. Hoekstra, that said, "If these people say that they fear retaliation, they are not telling the truth -- and it calls into question the reliability of any information they could give your subcommittee."
Another subcommittee witness, Dane Passo, a Chicago truck driver, testified that he was was badly beaten by a Carey supporter who operates runs a large teamsters' local in Chicago. Mr. Passo faulted Mr. Carey for not removing that official from office. Teamsters' leaders said Mr. Carey was waiting for the official to exhaust appeals of his assault and battery conviction.
To end the four-and-a-half hour hearing, the committee interrogated the former supervisor of the teamsters' political action committee in an effort to prove that Mr. Carey knew about or cooperated in illegal fund-raising schemes. But the witness, Gregory Mullenholz, did not provide any solid proof of that.
Mr. Mullenholz, who said he was fired for cooperating with the F.B.I., an assertion denied by Mr. Carey's aides, said he found several of the union's donations to other groups suspicious. He said he questioned why the union contributed $475,000 to a get-out-the-vote drive by Citizen Action, a liberal grass-roots group, when shortly beforehand the union's political action committee borrowed $300,000 from a bank.
When three former Carey campaign aides pleaded guilty in court last month, they described a scheme in which the union gave money to Citizen Action and some of that group's donors contributed to the Carey campaign.
Mr. Mullenholz said he also questioned donations that the union made to Project Vote and the National Council of Senior Citizens, two groups that helped Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts in last year's Congressional elections. He said William Hamilton, the union's political director, had recommended those contributions, but Mr. Carey's executive assistant had rejected them.
Mr. Mullenholz said he understood that Mr. Hamilton then went directly to Mr. Carey to gain approval. Mr. Mullenholz stopped short of saying Mr. Carey was familiar with any scheme to contribute money to other groups in exchange for having their donors give to the Carey campaign.
Mr. Mullenholz testified that he saw notes that Mr. Hamilton sent to persuade Mr. Carey to donate to Project Vote and the senior citizens' group. But Mr. Mullenholz declined to say whether those notes showed that Mr. Carey had been informed of any improper scheme.
Denying any wrongdoing, Mr. Carey has said he was a victim of his aides' misdeeds. Mr. Hamilton has also denied any wrongdoing.

HEADLINE: U.S. Respects Brazil, Clinton Assures Latin Giant

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Oct. 14

 BODY:
President Clinton had a simple message for Brazil today, and he delivered it over and over, in several different ways: The United States takes this country seriously. Really. It doesn't want to dictate relations in the hemisphere, but just to do more business.
Appearing at a joint news conference here with the Brazilian President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Mr. Clinton tried repeatedly to dispel longstanding Brazilian suspicions of American attitudes. In answer to a Brazilian journalist's question, he said that he did not feel threatened by the emergence of Brazil as a hemispheric powerhouse. 
 "I actually support the emergence of countries to a greater role of influence and responsibilities, as long as they share our basic values," he said, citing commitments to democracy, open trade and environmental protection.
This is the first visit of his Presidency to Brazil, and Mr. Clinton appeared anxiious to play catch-up. He and his aides have repeatedly noted that the European Union is rushing in to capitalize on Brazil's economy.
But Mr. Clinton did not only play the supplicant. He gently nudged Brazil toward joining an effort to reduce greenhouse gases. As nations prepare for an international conference on global warming in December, a central dispute is whether developing countries should share the burden of cutting emissions when developed ones have enjoyed most of the benefits of profligately polluting.
Still, while he said that "we must all participate" in reducing such gases, Mr. Clinton emphasized that he did not expect Brazil's efforts to interfere with its economic growth. "The United States would never knowingly make any suggestion that would undermine the growth of Brazil or any other country," he said.
For his part, Mr. Cardoso repeatedly praised his relations with Mr. Clinton and Brazil's with the United States, updating the American saw about General Motors: "We feel what's good for Brazil is good for the United States, and what's good for the United States is good for Brazil as well."
But he made clear that Brazil would continue expanding trade with all comers, whether or not Mr. Clinton ultimately wins so-called fast-track authority from Congress to conduct trade negotiations. "If there is going to be this sort of a policy or not is the United States' problem," Mr. Cardoso said.
Not all Brazilians were as welcoming as Mr. Cardoso, however. A handful of protesters here pelted the President's limousine with manure.
Mr. Clinton, bowing to a point of Brazilian pride, made the clearest statement to date that the United States recognizes the importance of Mercosur, a regional trade bloc in which Brazil is the biggest member. "I support Mercosur," Mr. Clinton said, adding that any new free-trade zone would be "consistent with Mercosur and the leadership and role of Brazil."
Mr. Clinton said he expected Brazil to sell more to Europe. "I don't feel threatened by it, I just want to make sure we're fully competing," he said. "And if we don't fully compete, it will be our fault, not yours and Europe's." But he took a dig at the Europeans, noting that the United States had lower tariffs than the European Union.
The two leaders said today that, three years after Mr. Clinton won agreement from Latin American leaders for a hemispheric free trade zone by 2005, the two countries would finally begin negotiations toward that goal next year.
But Mr. Cardoso and other Brazilian officials indicated that they wished to move slowly in lowering some barriers to foreign competitors. "We are not prepared to go for a new round of tariff reduction commitments by 2000," said Pedro Malana, the Finance Minister.

HEADLINE: University for Working Adults Shatters Mold

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

DATELINE: PHOENIX

 BODY:
Just off the shimmering asphalt ribbons of Interstate 10, minutes from the Phoenix airport, in a zone of windshield and transport companies, sits a set of brick office buildings that contains what many view as the biggest challenge to higher education in the United States today.
The name on the unassuming structures, the University of Phoenix, suggests a local college. But, like its setting, that is deceptive. 
 With 40,000 students, the University of Phoenix has grown into the largest private university in the nation, galloping ahead of such powerhouses as New York University and the University of Southern California.
But more significantly, it has done so using a new model consonant with the times, turning itself into a kind of H.M.O. of education: It is run as a for-profit business, paying taxes rather than accepting public subsidies; it rents space rather than buying buildings for its makeshift campuses across a dozen states; and its courses are standardized in shrink-wrap packages.
Phoenix has also chosen to do something else unusual. It accepts no one under the age of 23 and only those gainfully employed. Since 45 percent of higher-education students are 24 or older, Phoenix is tapping into an exploding and lucrative portion of a $200 billion higher-education market where costs have been widely seen as out of control.
"This is a very significant time in higher education," said Timothy J. McDonough, vice president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. "Adult learning is skyrocketing. People don't understand that there is a market out there. Phoenix has grasped that very well."
It is unlikely that the Phoenix model will soon dominate higher education since there will long be a place for residential institutions for 18- to 22- year-olds where instruction is blended with socialization. But there is little doubt that Phoenix's practices, like keeping virtually no full-time faculty and stocking no libraries, are spreading and are a source of great worry to many colleges that benefit from tax subsidies yet still struggle financially.
"I was asked to speak at Rutgers recently about what we do and the response among the assembled faculty was telling," said Laura Palmer Noone, vice president for academic affairs at the University of Phoenix. "The reaction was divided into three groups. A few found what we do exciting, a second group dismissed us as a passing fad, and the last group looked at me like I was the antichrist, spelling the doom of life as they know it."
The University of Phoenix, which has been accredited for 20 years, is not a place to discover the eternal verities of the Western tradition. It offers B.A.'s and M.A.'s, mostly in business and in fields like information technology, health and education. While it is a leader in distance education, meaning course work over the Internet, most of its classes involve working professionals teaching other working professionals in classrooms.
Phoenix sets itself apart with its unwavering corporate orientation. Its advocates say that when, in the 1970's, the nation's economy began a shift to one based on information, corporations came to universities asking for help in updating and retraining employees but that the universities were slow to respond.
Many companies took matters into their own hands, setting up corporate universities of which there are now some 1,200. But none of them are accredited: they cannot offer degrees. The University of Phoenix, whose regional accreditation is accepted nationally, has therefore been able to sell itself as the best of both worlds.
Some 75 percent of Phoenix students are at least partly reimbursed by their companies for tuition, which, at about $6,500 a year, is somewhat higher than public universities but lower than most private ones. Classes are limited to 15 to 20 students, and there is a great deal of work in small groups.
Some of this has recently been going on at other universities as the need for income from adult students has become more pressing. But most extension programs tend to be institutional stepchildren. At Phoenix, it is all the university does.
"When I was looking around to get my M.B.A. in 1992, Arizona State did not offer evening classes the way the University of Phoenix did," said Ike Schneider of Alliant Food Service in Phoenix, who got his master of business administration there with an emphasis in technology management. "I went one evening a week, worked in small groups and was very satisfied."
The university is the creation of John G. Sperling, 76, a restless, plain-talking contrarian. Born to a Missouri sharecropping couple, Mr. Sperling discovered books while at sea as a merchant marine, returned to college in Oregon and ultimately earned a doctorate in economic history from Cambridge University in England. He started an academic career only to find it stifling.
While teaching at San Jose State University in the late 1960's, Mr. Sperling became involved in a project on juvenile delinquency, in which he brought teachers and police officers to campus for courses.
"We worked with them in small groups," he recalled in an interview, "and since these were adults with little patience for lectures, the instructors had to act more as facilitators than traditional professors. The students had a great deal to offer not only to one another but to the instructor. The students loved it and asked if they could turn the seminars into vehicles for obtaining B.A.'s and M.A.'s."
By 1973, Mr. Sperling had 2,500 paying students at several universities. But the regional accrediting body accused him of running a diploma mill and shut him down.
He moved to Phoenix which falls under a different regional accrediting body and started over, gaining accreditation within five years.
The University of Phoenix has functioned largely in the West and Southwest. But that began changing rapidly after the December 1994 public offering of shares of its parent company, the Apollo Group, on the Nasdaq exchange. Started at $2 a share, it is today trading at over $40. As a result, Mr. Sperling, as Apollo's chairman and chief executive, is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
Driven by Mr. Sperling's vision of a national for-profit university, Phoenix campuses have recently opened in Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Oregon and Washington.
"We're moving inexorably eastward," Mr. Sperling said. "As you go east, the barriers against outside universities get higher until you get to New York, where they are nearly insurmountable. But we'll overcome them, too."
Last summer, after a lobbying campaign, Apollo persuaded the Pennsylvania Legislature to revoke its ban on for-profit universities. It will soon apply for licensing in the state.
"Other institutions perceive them as aggressive, in-your-face," said Dr. Steven Crow, executive director of the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the North-Central Association of Colleges and Schools, the Chicago group that has accredited Phoenix since 1978.
"They are also not very collegial, bashing traditional education," Dr. Crow said. "They move into places real fast and real hard, and all of a sudden everyone is trying to maintain a niche."
Sometimes that can backfire. In Michigan last year, the University of Phoenix asked the Ford Motor Company for space in its training quarters.
Peter Stockmann, who runs the quarters, said he was happy to rent to Phoenix as he had done to other companies. But within a few months, he said, advertisements run in the area made it look as if the university was being sponsored by Ford, rather than simply renting space from it.
Ford executives felt used, Mr. Stockmann said, and severed the relationship.
The head of Phoenix in Michigan, Sarah Serra, said there had been no effort to imply a relationship that did not exist.
The contretemps does not seem to have hurt Phoenix's expansion in Michigan, where it has nearly 2,000 students after only 18 months. In Florida, the university has found quick success partly because the population growth of the state has overburdened state universities unable to handle the demand.
The evidence around the country and a visit to several classes suggest that while Phoenix may not be a beacon of scholarship or a leader in community service, it takes its product -- adult education intended to serve corporations -- seriously. Students seem satisfied and instructors return frequently.
Dr. Crow, the accrediting officer, said that traditional criteria for judging universities, like the percentage of full-time faculty members, the breadth of its libraries and the number of seat hours per course for students, might be outdated, especially for institutions that cater to working adults.
All of which pleases Phoenix officials who have even begun acquiring a touch of academic credibility by bringing on board a few more traditional academics.
One such professor is Jorge Klor de Alva, an anthropologist and philosopher who left a professorship at Princeton University for an endowed chair at the University of California at Berkeley and is now leaving there to become a vice president at Apollo.
Dr. Klor de Alva said it was not money but a new frontier that drew him to Apollo.
"Academia is a calling, a closed system," Dr. Klor de Alva said. "But at Apollo we are seeking to address real needs in the real world. We're erasing the moment in life when you either make it as a student or you don't. This is a second-chance outfit geared to an expanding world economy. Right now there are not many second chances offered out there. The University of Phoenix is at the very center of a new frontier of redefining higher education. And I think it is unstoppable. The genie is out of the bottle."

HEADLINE: 2 Get Nobel for a Formula at the Heart of Options Trading

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Two North American scholars won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science yesterday for work that enables investors to price accurately their bets on the future, a breakthrough that has helped power the explosive growth in financial markets since the 1970's and plays a profound role in the economics of everyday life.
Robert C. Merton of the Harvard Business School and Myron S. Scholes, a Canadian-born professor emeritus at the Stanford Business School, will share the $1 million award for helping devise a mathematical formula that provided the answer to a simple but seemingly insurmountable problem confronting Wall Street: how to measure the worth of an option. 
 Their solution helped lay the basis of today's vast global options marketplace, where the trading affects everyone with a stake in the financial markets, from employees who receive stock options as part of their pay to mutual fund investors who use options to hedge interest-rate risk.
An option is a type of investment that allows, but does not require, an investor to buy an asset, like stocks or bonds or wheat or pork bellies, at a prearranged price during a preset period of time.
Until 1973, when Mr. Merton and Mr. Scholes published their analysis, it was extremely difficult to assess all the variables that could affect the price of an option. Their work overcame that difficulty, which had limited the growth of the options markets.
"Such rapid and widespread application of a theoretical result was new to economics," the prize committee wrote. "Nowadays, thousands of traders and investors use the formula every day" -- making it easy for businesses and individuals to hedge risks in the incredibly complex world of modern finance.
The announcement of the Nobel in economics, which has been awarded annually by the Bank of Sweden since 1969, excites the academic community, but usually ignites little genuine enthusiasm on Wall Street. Not so this year. "I'm thrilled," said William Brodsky, chairman of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which owes a large part of its growth to the Nobel winners. "This Nobel not only recognizes Merton and Scholes's accomplishments, it underscores the importance of options in the world of finance."
The analysis the two worked out has been successfully applied not only to pricing options but also to numerous other "derivative" securities, so named because their value is determined by fluctuations in the value of other assets.
Using derivatives is now a common way to redistribute the risks of doing business. Although in recent years derivatives have been associated with some financial disasters -- they played a role in the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., and the demise of Barings, Britain's oldest investment bank -- derivatives are widely regarded as beneficial.
Farmers, for example, use derivatives when they sell crops on the futures markets even before the planting has been finished. By locking in a price, they protect themselves if prices fall, although they also give up the chance of a windfall if prices surge. By the same token, grain dealers, bakeries and other big purchasers often buy grain futures to hedge against the risk of rising crop prices.
But what is the real worth of, say, an option to buy 100 shares of Intel at $105 each before next April or the right to borrow 400 million French francs at 9 percent by next Tuesday?
By the early 1960's, a handful of economists had both an interest in the puzzle and the advanced mathematical tools to solve it.
"We knew the answer was there, and that someone was going to find it," recalled Paul Samuelson, an economist at M.I.T. who later won a Nobel for work in other areas of economics.
The breakthrough came from three researchers, each under the age of 30 -- and one not even an economist. Fischer Black, a mathematician with Arthur D. Little consultants in Boston, discovered that an acquaintance, Mr. Scholes, then a professor of finance at M.I.T., was also fascinated by the question of options value. They enlisted the help of an assistant to Professor Samuelson at M.I.T., Mr. Merton, who is the son of the famous Columbia University sociologist Robert K. Merton.
Together they devised a mathematical formula, known as the Black-Scholes model, that took into account a variety of variables.
Mr. Black and Mr. Scholes had considerable difficulty finding a publisher. Their paper languished for three years before the prestigious Journal of Political Economy printed it in 1973. Mr. Merton walked an easier path, but only because he was a friend of the editor of the new Bell Journal of Economics. "Finance just wasn't part of the economics mainstream," Mr. Merton recalled in an interview yesterday.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the first devoted to options trading, opened just as the Black-Scholes theory was published. Although complicated, the computation involved could be easily -- and virtually instantly -- done on the pocket calculators that were just becoming popular.
Soon traders were valuing options on the floor of the exchange, punching half a dozen numbers into electronic calculators hard-wired with the formula. This not only meant quicker and more accurate pricing, it also increased the volume of options markets and reduced the cost of using options.
Mr. Black and Mr. Scholes became so highly regarded at the exchange that when they visited, traders would give them a standing ovation.
Thanks to extensions suggested by Mr. Merton, uses for the formula have been found in virtually every nook and cranny of finance.
Mr. Merton, who earned his Ph.D. from M.I.T in 1970, taught there until 1988, when he moved to the Harvard Business School. The Nobel caps a long career in helping to transform corporate finance from a backwater to the hot zone of economics. "Bob Merton is the Isaac Newton of his field," Mr. Samuelson said.
In 1973, Mr. Scholes went back to teach at the University of Chicago Business School, where he had earned his Ph.D. In 1983 he moved on to the Stanford Business School, where he taught until retirement in 1996. That was hardly the end of his career, though. He and Mr. Merton are principals in Long Term Financial Management, the immensely successful multibillion-dollar private investment fund formed by John Meriwether when he broke with his partners at Salomon Brothers.
"These guys can do finance both ways: high theory, or down and dirty," Stephen Ross, an economist at the Yale School of Management, said of the new Nobel recipients.
And Peter L. Bernstein, a consultant to institutional investors and a historian of the securities industry, said yesterday, "All I can say is: What took the Nobel committee so long?"
Mr. Merton said he had no particular plans for the $500,000 that he will receive at a ceremony on Dec. 10.
"It's all been a blast," he said. "My only regret is that Fischer Black isn't here to share the prize." Mr. Black, a partner in Goldman, Sachs and a former president of the American Economic Association, died in 1995 at the age of 57.

Chart: "How to Price a Hunch"
For centuries, market traders relied on instinct and gut feeling to decide how much to pay today for something whose value depends on an uncertain future; an example would be an option contract, which confers the right to buy or sell a security or commodity at a set price for a set time. But economists who tried to develop mathematical methods for valuing options struggled vainly until three young researchers -- Fischer Black, Robert C. Merton and Myron S. Scholes -- hit upon a formula in the late 1960's that substantially solved the problem. Their big breakthrough came in realizing the role played by volatility.
 
The algebra looks complex, but the concept is straightforward. Most of the hard work comes in determining what expected means.
 
In the form above, the formula gives the value today of a call option, represented by the letter C. A call option is the right to buy a stock at a set price called the strike price (L) before a fixed future date called the maturity (time to maturity is represented as t). The letter d stands for a combination of the formula's other variables; it relates movements in the stock price to movements in the option's value.
 
The formula assigns a higher value to the option if today's share price (S) is high, if the share price is very volatile (s, the price's standard deviation) and interest rates in general are high (r is the risk-free return available on Treasuries). Similarly, the longer the time to maturity, the lower the strike price, and the greater the likelihood that the option will be worth more at maturity (N is the normal distribution function).
 
The method is now so commonplace that pocket calculators are available with the formula built in: A trader or investor can punch in S, N, L, r and t and price an option contract in seconds. With minor variations, the formula can also be used to price many things whose value depends on events yet to come, like other kinds of options, futures, derivatives, and insurance policies.

HEADLINE: Havana's Day-Glo Dreams of Old Glory

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

 BODY:
AS A CLASH of cultures and ideologies, few experiences compare with that of rounding a corner in the heart of Old Havana, its crumbling baroque buildings adorned with the exhortations of Fidel Castro or Che Guevara, and coming face to face with a gleaming 1955 Thunderbird that looks as if it had just been driven off the lot. Chevrolets, Buicks, Cadillacs, Fords, Chryslers -- all the automotive relics of the Eisenhower era seem to have found a lasting home in the most resolutely anti-American society in the Western Hemisphere.
Not that these are the only cars on Cuba's streets. In reality, they are vastly outnumbered by the boxy Lada and Volga sedans that embody three decades of "socialist solidarity" with Moscow. There are new cars, too, mostly Japanese and belonging to the tour agencies and rental companies catering to tourists. But something about the plumage of a vintage American car -- that chrome, those fins and brilliant colors -- seems especially alluring to tropical tastes. 
 Like so many of the other contradictions of Cuban life, the presence of these vehicles is largely a result of politics. After Mr. Castro took Cuba down the Communist path nearly 40 years ago, the United States retaliated with an economic embargo that made it impossible for Cubans to indulge their craving for American goods. Mr. Castro abolished most manifestations of a consumer society. But out of sheer necessity American cars were allowed to linger, regardless of how gaudy they might be.
In Cuba's case, necessity has proved to be the mother of invention. Though a showroom for luxury imported cars has opened on Havana's main seafront promenade, the vast majority of Cubans have been forced to get around by bicycle ever since the Government declared a "special period" of austerity after the Soviet Union collapsed and oil supplies dried up. So anyone lucky enough to still own an automobile, some of which are handed down like heirlooms, had better take very good care of it.
That task is probably more delight than drudgery for most owners of vintage American cars, who spend hours applying waxes and polishes, basking in the praise and admiration of passersby. Others brag of the hours they spend searching for spare parts on the black market or trying to find an ingenious mechanic who can contrive a replacement. And some, when prompted, will even reminisce about a time when their cars were new, and life itself seemed brighter and as inviting as an open highway.

HEADLINE: Moods of 5 Decades, Color by Color

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
HENRY Ford wouldn't get away with telling customers today what he did in the early days of the Model T: they could buy any color -- as long as it was black.
American car buyers demand wider choices today, and if they don't see the color they want, they won't buy the car. 
 In a study conducted last spring by the polling firm of Yankelovich Partners, nearly a third of those questioned said they would switch vehicle brands if they couldn't get the color they wanted. In another survey, conducted by an auto maker, nearly half the respondents said they would switch cars if they couldn't find their first color choice.
"When we ask people the most important factors in their purchase, they mention resale value, quality, reliability," said Alan Eggly of the Ford Motor Company's color-and-trim design department. "Color ranks around 20th on their list. But when they talk about their vehicles, they talk about their red Mustang or their white Lincoln Town Car. They'll wait to get the color they want in a vehicle."
Color has probably always been important to car buyers. The trouble was, for many years the choices were pretty drab, like gray and off-white. That changed in the 1950's, when a technological breakthrough created a pure, durable white, which led to the proliferation of two-toned cars, like white with pink, turquoise or baby blue.
Current events and the mood of the nation strongly affect car color choices.
For instance, green, with yellow hues, became a favorite color during the Vietnam War. It re-emerged in the early 90's as the United States grappled with a recession and corporate downsizing.
Green, a symbol of harmony, counteracts emotional stress, said Robert Dailey, the automotive color and styling manager for Du Pont. That company, which sells paints and fabrics to auto makers and textiles for home furnishings and apparel, has studied color trends for 45 years.
"In distressing times, people have a need to look to nature for a calming effect to offset events like the Vietnam War," Mr. Dailey said.
"Over the years, we have found designer fashion is a key indicator of consumer trends, like car colors," Mr. Dailey noted. In fact, clothes dictate car colors that will appear four years from now, the average time it takes to develop a new car.
What's the prediction for the car color of 2000? "We'll see an evolution of what's out there now," Mr. Dailey said.
New earth tones, like gold, copper, bronze and brown, will be popular. Breakthroughs in pigment technology will deliver browns in the next century with the "depth and inner life of mahogany," Mr. Eggly said.
He also predicted a resurgence of classic navy blue. "Ask Americans what their favorite color is, and many will say blue," he said.

HEADLINE: Computers Take a Byte Out of the Design Process

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: AUBURN HILLS, Mich.

 BODY:
SLAM the hood. Slam the hood. Slam the hood. Silently.
Sitting before a glowing screen hooked to a basement full of Cray supercomputers, a Chrysler engineer designing the new Concorde sedan ran dozens of simulations of that simple act. He was trying to create a car hood that would fit to a hair's breadth -- and stay that way. 
 It is not the kind of detail that jumps off a showroom floor. But it is an example of how the world's largest manufacturing industry is being transformed, part by part, by what is now known as paperless engineering.
The Chrysler Corporation's two newest sedans, the 1998 Dodge Intrepid and the Chrysler Concorde, which arrive in showrooms this fall, share the distinction of being the first fully digital cars -- that is, designed and engineered entirely on computer. Competitors are only a mouse-click behind. Soon, the auto industry will be pumping out digital cars and trucks by the millions.
Experts in and outside Detroit say digital vehicles herald a new era in manufacturing, in which better cars can be designed faster and cheaper. "You're taking knowledge that traditionally has been embedded in mechanical things and making it much more easily transferable," said Marco Iansiti, an associate professor of technology at Harvard Business School. "The paperless cars are an example of a trend that I think is bigger than steamships."
Thomas C. Gale used to be one of Chrysler's most innovative designers, but is now the executive vice president for product development. Mr. Gale said the higher standards established by computers mean that everything is so much more exacting. He added that sometimes in the past "we'd get the parts back, and we didn't even recognize them."
The essential shapes and styles of cars are still born on sketchbooks or in watercolors. But at Chrysler, the cars now gestate in mathematical equations spooled out by computers at the Chrysler Technology Center in the company's headquarters here in this Detroit suburb.
Designers hand off their three-dimensional work to mechanical engineers, who can then open a car's virtual hood and design what is needed underneath -- not just the engine and radiator but every hose and screw. When the car is ready to be built, the same computer programs can be used to design the giant machines that stamp steel into doors and trunks and roofs.
Computers are helping engineers choose the best designs for the car as well as for its parts. For instance, the complicated and time-consuming process of designing engines historically meant that no more than five could be thoroughly tested before one was chosen for a new model. But advanced computer simulation programs allowed engineers to run through 1,500 designs for the Intrepid and Concorde engines; perform on-screen tests that normally must wait for physical models to be built, and choose the best engines from a wider field.
THE process was repeated with the 5,000 and more separate parts, then with the connections between them.
Years before any physical models of the new cars were built, Mr. Gale and other Chrysler executives watched simulated light play off colorful, three-dimensional models of the new sedans rotating on the computer screen. "You had to keep saying to yourself, 'This really doesn't exist,' " Mr. Gale said.
Robert M. Trecapelli, a Chrysler research engineer who worked on the new cars, said, "We actually build the entire vehicle on the computer before we make it."
The hundreds of people who designed everything from the engine to the taillights updated their designs instantly in a 3-D computer model that other designers used as if sharing a single blueprint.
"It is almost like a living, breathing entity -- the digital vehicle -- you watch it change," Mr. Trecapelli said.
Engineers argue that a car becomes more reliable when each of its thousands of parts is slightly better designed and connects more smoothly to the next part. Take the Concorde's hood. Each time a car hood is slammed shut, it can change shape slightly, bending by a few microns.
Car engineers have got a pretty good idea of how steel reacts to that stress. In the past, if a problem developed once production was under way, they could correct it, more or less, by adjusting the hulking machines that stamp out hoods.
But the Concorde's designers wanted to make its hood out of aluminum to save on weight and improve fuel economy and they wanted a fit that was better than pretty good. Yet they weren't sure how aluminum would bend.
The computer simulation allowed them to watch the metal bend dozens of times, and then allowed them to work backward -- "reverse engineering" -- to keep out unwanted bends.
The 3-D programs even allow engineers to watch a sheet of steel be virtually cut and pressed in the innards of giant factory stamping machines, before the machines are actually built. Using this software, engineers can anticipate and correct real-life problems on screen, thereby avoiding costly changes after the machines are built.
Chrysler said the faster design processes shaved eight months off the development of the Intrepid and Concorde, saving the company about $80 million.
Ford and General Motors, along with Toyota, Honda, BMW and other large auto makers, already sketch designs for new cars and trucks on computer. Many also use computers to design stamping machines, presses and other large pieces of factory equipment. The largest companies are now requiring suppliers to link their computers with the car manufacturers' to design auto parts that fit precisely and allow the performance of the entire car to be accurately simulated.
FORD used extensive computer-assisted design and engineering programs to build a small car called the Puma, which went on sale in Europe in July. But, unlike Chrysler's new cars, the Puma used many components developed for other Ford models that were not engineered on screen.
Ford is far along in developing computer models that measure the effects of auto crashes, which the company hopes will replace many costly Government-required crash tests. The company now spends between $350,000 and $550,000 to crash a hand-built prototype. But it costs about $200 to run a computer-simulated crash test, a tab expected to drop to $10 in three years.
The General Motors Corporation won't have a digital car until the turn of the century. But it will soon use computers so that designers in say, Detroit and Tokyo, can hand off work for round-the-clock development of the same car.
Not everyone is sold on computers, however. "The computer isn't necessarily always the best way," said Jerry P. Hirshberg, the president of Nissan Design International, the American design arm of Nissan. "Not quite as much is possible on a computer as is possible in your mind." Mr. Hirschberg worries that computerized design will result in too many cars that are wonderfully efficient but boring.
"I fear the downside of the computer as a creative crutch, rather than a really helpful pencil with a good memory," he said. But he added that the best designers would continue to find inspiration off-screen -- with chalk and clay and metal and balsa wood.
But even Mr. Hirshberg admits that computers have their place. "I'm designing cars halfway around the world," he said. "The computer makes that all possible at the speed of light."

HEADLINE: Pollution Record Is Far From Black

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
JUST AS every car has a tailpipe, the internal combustion engine under every hood is a pollution machine. But in some ways the American car has been getting strikingly cleaner over the years, while in other ways its environmental record remains troublesome.
That's because some pollutants are tightly controlled, as when the Federal Government required catalytic converters, or when the recipe for gasoline was rewritten to reduce harmful emissions. Other pollutants, however, have gone mostly unregulated, notably carbon dioxide, which is the inevitable byproduct of burning gasoline. 
 Emissions of carbon dioxide go up as fuel use increases. This gas then traps the heat of the sun like a blanket and warms the planet -- the so-called greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide emissions from cars will only decrease if people drive less or use more efficient cars. But the Government has not tightened fuel-efficiency standards for years. And consumers have been buying more sporty trucks and other gas guzzlers and have been driving them farther.
But during the same period, since the 1970's, the Government has repeatedly tightened the limits on emissions of unhealthy pollutants like carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides (a main ingredient in smog). A car built in the mid-1990's produces about one-tenth the pollution per mile traveled as one built two decades ago. And there are new inspection rules that force drivers to keep their cars well-tuned.
There is one large unknown in predicting how much pollution cars will cause in the years to come: How long will the increase in driving last? People cannot expand the time they spend behind the wheel indefinitely. And if there is a significant increase in fuel prices, either through taxation or a shortage, driving could decline abruptly, taking pollution down with it.

The Clean Air Act of 1970 imposed tight controls on certain types of emissions but left others unregulated. As a result, progress in cutting pollution has been uneven. Graphs show regulated and unregulated emissions from 1970 to 1995.
 
America's fleet of cars is more fuel efficient now because of another set of regulations; trucks are not covered by the rules, but have been made somewhat more efficient. The steady increase in the number of miles Americans drive, however, have swamped such improvements driving up overall gas consumption. Graphs show fuel economy, total miles traveled each year and total fuel consumption for America's fleet of vehicles, from 1970 to 1995.

HEADLINE: Movies Were Better, and So Were the Skid Marks

BYLINE: By JEFF MacGREGOR; Jeff MacGregor is a writer living in Manhattan.

 BODY:
FOR a 13-year-old American boy riding around town in a poorly carbureted Volkswagen Squareback, the chase scene in "Bullitt" was an epiphany, a worshipful awakening to the glorious transcendence of speed and anarchy and appetite. Its potboiler complications and existential antiheroism were lost on me, but the glass-packed V8 exhaust obbligato of genuine Detroit iron was like music. I remember liking the turtlenecks, too.
By 1968, the year of "Bullitt," I had already seen a thousand other actors driving a thousand other cars in a thousand other movies. They drove fast or they drove far or they drove funny, but they never drove like they meant it. Hotshoe Steve McQueen and his Ford Mustang GT fastback, rumbling bayward down the face of San Francisco as choreographed by the director Peter Yates, certainly changed that. 
 A chase scene is a storytelling imperative as old as Moses. When automobiles and moving pictures came along a hundred years ago, the wedding of our century's dominant technologies produced the car chase, a cinematic hybrid we have been refining ever since.
The earliest examples are mostly lost to us, victims of volatile nitrate film stock and the economy of forgetfulness. Stay up late enough though, and between infomercials for Abdominizers or Holistic Prostate Reduction Systems, you'll probably find snippets of our first generation of cars on film.
The best of these revel in our always ambivalent relationship to mechanization. Movie cars were mostly amiable (if mule-stubborn), but prone to instantaneous and nearly molecular disintegration. A Model T in a Mack Sennett comedy could shake itself like a wet spaniel, then drive away on its rims and good intentions. A chase was played largely for laughs way back when, and the undercranked, hyperkinetic Keystone Kops spent more time running after their cars than they did riding in them.
Our ideas, fears and fantasies of "The Car" weren't fixed yet either, hadn't been narrowed by familiarity or contempt. In "Sherlock Jr." (1924), Buster Keaton deadpanned his way up and down a sun-shot and dusty La Brea Avenue on the handlebars of a riderless motorcycle until he caught up with a driverless touring car that, once he put the top up, became a rudderless sailboat. The freewheeling brilliance of invention like that is matched only by the balletic stunt work it took to make it happen.
The 30's and 40's offered little in the way of that kind of novelty. The effervescence of the comic pursuit (Laurel and Hardy notwithstanding) gave way to the grim routines of the gangster chase, in which evil men wearing sharkskin suits and dark fedoras clung to the running boards of monstrous Packards while they were tommy-gunning hatless G-men in their honest tweeds.
Around this same time began a more widespread use of rear-projection process shots. These allowed the studios to shoot automotive sequences indoors against a filmed background. It was cheap and fast, and savings in location expenses were substantial. Degrading reality in the pursuit of money is what Hollywood does, after all, and for years, the standard auto shot was often a fedora head framed in a skeletonized car interior, both rocking pacifically in the gentle mitts of two off-camera stagehands.
Through the postwar years, into the 50's and 60's, there was more of the same, albeit with fewer and fewer hats.
Elvis chasing Ann-Margret in his streamliner fanjet bubble-top coupe, or James Dean being chased by the demons of suburban adolescent angst were about as good as things got. Even James Bond was a desultory driver back then; smoothly outrunning Smersh with one hand on the wheel, checking the DB5 glove box for his jar of cocktail onions with the other. It all looked pretty fake to me.
When "Bullitt" crashed into theaters, though, the effect was riveting. A return to the risks and realities of location shooting, married to technologies of smaller cameras and mounts, it was an ideal synthesis of traditions and experimentation. It also proved that a chase must be integral to the story: about running from, or to, something.
Three years later, to the delight of moviegoers and auto insurance executives everywhere, "The French Connection" was released, and I was granted a learner's permit. What Steve McQueen started, Gene Hackman was happy to finish. His 1971 chase under the elevated train tracks of Brooklyn was my graduate seminar in the quantum mechanics of driving, proving as it did that matter can be converted directly into energy if you just give it enough gas.
For the next few years, I corroborated his findings at every opportunity, using the family's groaning Econokarton as a kind of personal particle accelerator. Scientific curiosity aside, if we'd had a cooler car, I'd probably still be in prison.
In those days, I was the most malevolent flying object in the galaxy, a turtlenecked suburban bad boy with a full tank of gas, an eight-track recording of "Radar Love" and a movie-inspired fantasy life that began at the end of our driveway.
Since then, movie car chases have been made a commonplace, deadened by their lower-case repetitions on television, made superfluous by high-concept, computer-generated intergalactic tong wars and rendered unbearable by seriatim "Smokey" sequels.
The completely forgettable blockbuster summer of 1997, during which we saw spaceships and ocean liners and planes (lots of planes) chasing only box-office receipts, makes me wonder if today's 16-year-olds go to bed dreaming of becoming flight attendants or cruise directors.
If that's the case, we're all a lot safer, I think. But perhaps a little poorer, too.

HEADLINE: For Russians, to Own a Car Is to Fix a Car, Again and Again

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
AFTER a year in which American correspondents, including this one, have written endlessly and obsessively about the many horrifying flaws of the Russian space station Mir, we ought to be fair and also tell you this: Nobody in this country pays the slightest attention to the troubles of the Mir.
It's not that Russians are callous toward their heroic cosmonauts. It's not even that people here are too preoccupied with their own problems to worry about the cosmos. It's just that things in Russia break every day, and every day somebody fixes them. There is no society on earth that falls apart so often or is more adept at gluing itself back together. 
 "Why do these malfunctions happen?" Vladimir Solovyov, Mir's mission control director, responded in exasperation to a recent question about the string of problems the space station has faced this year. "Do you know why your car breaks down? It's hard to say what the reason might be."
Actually, in Russia that's not really true. Cars may be the essential accessory for any adult American, but they are intimate apparel in Russia, particularly for men. (Women are too busy working, raising families, trying to keep their husbands alive and in all other ways keeping the nation in one lumbering piece.)
Russian men are by nature and necessity incredible mechanics. And they are deeply in love with movement -- which, even more than in America, symbolizes not just economic independence, but the type of personal freedom that even 10 years ago could hardly have been imagined by anyone except the communist elite.
For a person who has spent his life standing in dark lines to ride on overcrowded trolleys, there is just no freedom like the freedom of going where you want when you want. The new rich in Russia -- with their armor-plated Mercedeses, Chevrolet Blazers, smoke-colored windows and bodyguards -- get most of the press and all the attention. But normal people are far more visible on the road.
"My car means everything to me," said Vladimir Potanov, a Moscow lawyer who finds it so pleasant driving to work each day in his brand-new Volvo that he doesn't even mind the crippling traffic in a city whose automotive population has grown from about 400,000 to more than 2.5 million in the last decade. Many of those cars are new and flashy -- an enormous number of Mercedeses were sold here last year -- but most were 20-year-old clunkers that had sat rusting in lots and garages for years. As with so much of life in Russia now, if you have it, you can finally flaunt it.
"When I am in the car, I am doing exactly what I want to do," Mr. Potanov said. "And I am doing it on my own schedule. I almost can't wait for something to go wrong with the thing because I know it will be easy to fix."
During the war in Chechnya, Russian tanks broke down so often that at least one person who knew how to fix a carburetor was placed inside each tank. It was almost impossible to drive down any road on the way to Grozny without seeing the central symbol of today's Russian army: a young man doubled over the engine of a truck or a tank.
This is not simply an urban or a military phenomenon. I was once about 10 miles from a tiny village in central Russia when a priest whom I had interviewed offered to drive me back to the house where I was staying. I was greatly relieved because walking would have been the only alternative. Then we discovered that the priest's brother had taken the priest's jacket by mistake and, with it, the keys to the pickup truck. The priest shrugged and started to rip pieces of metal paneling out of the steering column. Within minutes, he had hot-wired the car, and we were on our way.
Of course, some of this is survival instinct. Few Russians can afford to pay a mechanic to fix a car. (They save that money to bribe inspectors so that badly broken automobiles can pass muster.) The difference between knowing how to change spark plugs and not knowing is often the difference between driving and taking the slow train.
"You find pretty quickly that most of these repairs are simple enough," Mr. Potanov said. His previous car was a Russian-made Lada, which lasted a decade. "Why pay for something you can do yourself?"
But Russia's emerging car culture isn't just about making do. It's about being proud of making do. The Russian health care system is often derided for good reason -- it's a mess. Yet a good Russian surgeon can take a hot plate, boil water and sterilize instruments on it and operate without a flaw. I have seen it happen. Same with the much-maligned Aeroflot pilots. They are handy and fully qualified. It's the metal they fly around in that has the problems.
So the Russian love of cars -- many surveys list them as the first thing a man with money would buy -- is not hard to understand. This is a bunch of people delighted with the fact that they can actually make something work. In Russia, it would be hard to overstate how exciting that is.

HEADLINE: Get Ready for the Past: Beetles, Hot Rods and Fins

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
A DECADE after trying to persuade the world that their cars were not your father's Oldsmobile, auto makers from around the world have decided that the past is way cool.
Some cars are recreations of classic shapes, like the Plymouth Prowler, which is a modern version of a 1950's-era hot rod. In other cars, the retro rage appears in subtle touches, like round analog clocks on dashboards. Volkswagen is even bringing back the Beetle in the spring. 
 Some here say they believe the retro designs are part of the wave of nostalgia sweeping across consumer culture.
"It is just a trend that we're walking through right now -- I think that accounts for their liking of retro furniture, retro architecture and even in some cases retro clothing," said Jack Telnack, the vice president of design for the Ford Motor Company. "I guess some people would rather live in the past."
Some blame the baby boom generation looking back wistfully on its youth. Others say the glance backward is prompted by the onset of a new century. Whatever the reasons, old styles are reappearing.
In addition to the Prowler, which went on sale this summer and is offered only in an outrageous shade of purple, there is the Dodge Viper, which recalls the venerable Shelby Cobra race cars.
And many of the latest luxury cars are backward-looking in less obvious ways. The Jaguar XK8 is reminiscent of the Jaguar E-type of the 60's and early 70's. The Mercedes SLK roadster takes its cues from the Mercedes SL line of classic roadsters, and the Porsche Boxster is meant to remind car lovers of the Porsche 550 Spyder race cars of the 50's.
But the new Beetle is expected to really tap into the retro craze, and the former Beetle has been around long enough to find its way into the memory of several generations. The first one was sold in the United States in 1949, and by the 70's it was so popular it starred in a movie called "The Love Bug" and later a television show.
The new Beetle is perhaps the most direct attempt to recapture the past, at least as far as the exterior goes. Look at it from the side, and you'll see the three familiar intersecting circles -- the two fenders and the arch of the roof. But underneath the ladybug shape, much has changed.
THE AIR-COOLED engine, housed in the rear of the old Bugs, is now water-cooled, and it has been uprooted and moved to the front of the car. The Beetle now has front-wheel-drive and is considerably larger than the tiny Beetles of the past -- which were once best known for posing a challenge to college students intent on cramming as many people as possible inside one.
Despite its retro look, the Bug is an up-to-date car with all the latest safety features, including side air bags. And it will carry Volkswagen's reliable engine, the modern kind that seldom breaks, but is hard for shade-tree mechanics to repair.
Some people may be disappointed by that fact, since the old version -- underpowered, cheap and easy to fix -- created a sort of love-hate relationship with its owner. A Beetle often became more like a pet or a member of the family, not just a mode of transportation.
Some believe the 1999 Beetle will be appealing because it is so different from all the look-alike sedans on the road. The Beetle and other retro cars are also enticing because they recall an era when cars were more like rolling sculptures, not bland exercises in wind resistance.
Car buyers "were getting a little bit tired of the wind-tunnel shapes -- very logical shapes which will work very well" in terms of aerodynamics and fuel economy, said Charles W. O. Ellwood, the director of Volkswagen's design center in Simi Valley, Calif.
HOWEVER groovy the new Beetle's shape, past Bug buyers might be put off by the price. While Volkswagen is keeping the exact amount under wraps, the Beetle is expected to cost $15,000 to $18,000 -- less than the average price for a new car, but expensive relative to what people remember paying for their Beetles in the past. Indeed, the price might be all the more shocking because everyone somehow seemed to buy used Beetles, not new ones.
But the Beetle -- the best-selling car of all time with 21.3 million sold -- has earned a soft spot in the hearts of those who have owned a model in the decades since it was first manufacturere in 1938.
Later, The New York Times described the car as a "beetle," and the name stuck.
"It is an icon," Mr. Ellwood said.

HEADLINE: Nouvelle Detroit? Global Growth Brings Changes at Home

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
PEOPLE around the world think they know what Detroit is like. The common mental picture is of a huge, dirty city of factories where burly men labor on assembly lines, turning steel skeletons into gigantic cars and trucks. This industrial reputation has spread so widely that some street vendors in Europe do a brisk business in T-shirts with scenes of machinery and the city's name in huge letters on them.
Yet that gritty image is dated. Many auto factories closed in the 1980's, never to reopen, while others have been renovated to use the latest technology and fewer workers. New factories were opened in the South to avoid powerful unions, or overseas. 
 The Detroit area is slowly changing from an auto manufacturing center into a white-collar capital of immense global business empires. And as the American auto industry expands, its culture and the culture of Detroit are changing, too.
It is hard to overstate the sheer size of the American auto industry -- or, these days, its reach. General Motors and the Ford Motor Company are now the world's two largest companies in sales and in share of global economic output. Both are building new factories in fast-growing markets like China and Poland, while simply renovating factories at home to stay competitive in the stagnant United States market. Even Chrysler, a runt by Detroit standards, but still five times the size of the Microsoft Corporation in sales, is expanding rapidly in Brazil.
The current international expansions are not entirely new. The Big Three had huge operations in Europe and shipped cars to East Asia and Latin America during the 50's and 60's, before retrenching in their struggles for survival from the late 70's through the early 90's. But the auto makers are now moving into far more countries, with more daily contact between executives in the home office and in the field.
Detroit remains an insular, racially divided city where almost any criticism of automobiles represents a serious social gaffe, but it is showing signs of becoming cosmopolitan. Just as houses in affluent Washington suburbs change hands every few years as diplomats come and go, palatial homes in wealthy Detroit suburbs like Grosse Pointe, Birmingham and Bloomfield Hills are occupied by a constant parade of executives rotating on foreign assignments. While many managers still prefer to vacation at fishing cabins in northern Michigan, some are beginning to take holidays overseas. Even Detroit's restaurants are improving, with a more eclectic cuisine slowly crowding out steak with gravy.
With hundreds of managers shuttling to places like Bangkok, Shanghai and Sao Paulo, Brazil, business meetings and cocktail parties in Detroit are turning into informal geography lessons. "When I first arrived here, and I said I was born and raised in Chile, they would say, 'Where is that?' " said Dario Verdugo, Chrysler's business development executive for Latin America, who came to Detroit in 1969. "Now people say, 'I understand they're doing pretty well with a market-driven economy.' "
Even the tone toward foreign rivals has changed. Lee A. Iacocca vehemently criticized Japanese competitors during a speech here in 1992, before he retired as chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation. "They say all of our problems are our fault -- that's like blaming our Army and our Navy for Pearl Harbor because they weren't ready," Mr. Iacocca said, drawing cheers from a hall full of local business executives.
TODAY, Mr. Iacocca is in a partnership with the Kwang Yang Motor Company of Taiwan to develop and market electric scooters. A new generation of auto executives here talks about East Asia, particularly China, as a potential market, not a threat. And the number of Japanese citizens living in the Detroit region has soared to 4,000 as dozens of Japanese auto-parts companies have opened offices here, seeking contracts from the Big Three. Saturday classes for children of Japanese managers draw 967 students, compared with 221 a decade ago.
Takanori Sonoda, Honda's chief representative in Detroit, recalled the animosity on his first trip to the city in 1987. "I was sitting at a bar in the Omni Hotel," he said. "One of the old guys came to me and said, 'You guys are buying up our country.' "
But while working here for the last three years, he has not encountered any hostility, said Mr. Sonoda, whose children attend public school in the suburb where he lives. "They are really enjoying their life, and there is no discriminatory attitude at all."
Over the last decade in particular, jokes and slurs about foreigners and minorities have become socially unacceptable, said Gerald Meyers, the former chairman of the American Motors Corporation. "The ethnic jokes are gone, the racial hatred has either gone underground or been fried out -- it just isn't accepted as a valid attitude any longer," he said. "In the locker room, there's nobody talking about 'the foreign automobile people.' "
But while race relations have been improving in the auto industry and in Detroit, they are still more acrimonious than elsewhere. The Justice Department continues to file more housing discrimination lawsuits in the nearly all-white Detroit suburbs than anywhere else in the country. There are virtually no blacks -- or women, for that matter -- among the leaders of the Big Three auto makers. And only last winter did the favorite country club of auto executives agree, after considerable controversy, to admit its second and third black members.
Longstanding racial tensions between Detroit, the nation's largest black-majority city, and its nearly all-white suburbs have hurt the metropolitan region's cultural life. Remarkably few suburbanites travel downtown to take advantage of the city's cultural treasures, survivors from Detroit's glory days before the 1967 riots and the 1973 oil crisis. It's possible on a Sunday morning to find a parking spot on the street in front of the Detroit Institute of Arts, the nation's fifth-largest art museum. Tickets are easy to get to the Detroit Symphony and the Detroit Opera, which occupies a magnificent, recently renovated hall. (An important addition to the cultural scene here was the opening last spring of the huge Museum of African American History, which has drawn large crowds so far.)
The auto makers' difficulties in hiring the brightest from East Coast and West Coast business schools have prompted them to donate heftily to the arts and try to revive downtown Detroit. The Chrysler Corporation, which gave little money during its years of financial troubles, has been particularly generous lately. G.M. decided last year to move its headquarters from midtown Detroit to the skycraper Renaissance Center skyscraper downtown, instead of to the suburbs.
SOME civic leaders remain worried that suburban residents lack the enthusiasm and commitment to downtown Detroit. "Culturally, it's still a brackish backwater," Mr. Meyers said.
Because foreign nationals still make up no more than 1 percent of the managers here, the perspective remains very American. "Things are very often seen from what I would call a North American view," said Jean Mallebay-Vacqueur, a Chrysler engineer who grew up in former French colonies in West Africa and came here in 1979. "There may not be a recognition of how powerful China is becoming, or India."
Yet, with time, even this might change. In the late 70's, "if you were hearing someone speaking French, you were likely to be walking with the person," Mr. Mallebay-Vacqueur said. Now, "people are not very fluent, but much better than they were 20 years ago."

HEADLINE: Three Guesses: The Fuel of the Future Will be Gas, Gas or Gas

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NEARLY 20 years after the last gas crisis, auto makers are finally confident that they can produce cars that are durable, reliable and powered by something cleaner than gasoline.
But don't expect to drive them. For a tangle of commercial and economic reasons, the fuel of the future still appears to be plain old unleaded regular. 
 The most fervent wishes of policy makers, engineers, environmentalists and businesses ranging from corn growers to drillers for natural gas all seem to have been washed away by the continuing tide of cheap gasoline. The best that they can hope for, many years from now, is cars that use gasoline in a different way, perhaps in combination with an electric motor.
The first hurdle for those who want to use substitutes like ethanol, methanol or natural gas is finding a pump. Government officials, industry executives and other experts refer to "the chicken or the egg" problem -- that a fueling system will not exist without a large customer base --, and no one will buy such cars until a system is set up. For private use, a vehicle is not going to be popular unless it runs on gasoline.
In California, where clean-air regulations have sparked remarkable technical progress, refiners and car manufacturers have cooperated to change both the fuel and the cars so that nearly all the pollution standards can be met on gasoline.
In the long term, some auto makers are putting money into fuel cells, a NASA invention that makes current directly from hydrogen-rich fuel. Others are working on hybrids, a combination of a small internal-combustion engine and an electric engine. In a hybrid, a gasoline engine, slightly larger than a go-cart's, charges batteries for electric motors that turn the wheels.
There are simpler solutions, but they have not caught on. Consider natural gas, which requires less refinery work than gasoline does and is already widely distributed around the continental United States, where it is produced in abundance. It is also much easier to burn cleanly than gasoline.
But it doesn't sell. Amoco, which has the largest natural gas reserves among the major oil companies, built 37 fueling stations, basically compressors that would fill a tank to the required pressure, at a cost of $250,000 to $300,000 each. The company has closed all but 4 and will shut the remainder as soon as contracts expire.
"We truly were acting in economic good faith toward our part of the chicken or the egg evolution," said Neal Geary, a company spokesman. But each pump sold only about the equivalent of 20 gallons a day. None of the pumps came close to doing enough business to repay its installation cost, and only one pump came close to paying the cost of maintaining it -- the one in Atlanta during the 1996 Olympics, when natural-gas vehicles were brought in for show.
"The average-Joe passenger car just isn't ready," Mr. Geary said. The tanks are still bulky, the range is still shorter and the continuing low price of gasoline provides no incentive to switch. Amoco sold natural gas at a discount of about 30 percent compared with gasoline. But the company figured that for a vehicle that used the natural gas equivalent of 1,000 gallons of gasoline a year -- about double the national average -- the annual savings would be only about $300, and the cost of converting the vehicle to run on gas could cost up to $4,000.
Chrysler was producing a natural gas version of its Dodge Ram pickup truck until the end of last year, when its tank supplier went out of business; the company is still looking for a new supplier. Ford has had more success, with six natural-gas vehicles in its 1998 model year, including the Crown Victoria. And in August, for the first time, a natural-gas Crown Vic entered service as a New York City taxi. Many cities are running big fleets of buses on natural gas.
Liquid fuels also have drawbacks. Methanol exacts less of a range penalty than natural gas but has even less of a cost advantage. It is not widely available, either.
"We've been pretty discouraged with the acceptance of methanol vehicles," said Ross P. Witschonke, the Ford Motor Company's director of technical affairs for a joint Government-industry "Next Generation Vehicle" project.
ETHANOL, made from corn, is also hard to find. According to the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition in Jefferson City, Mo., there are just 35 service stations that sell ethanol, and they average only about 2,000 gallons a month each. (A big station sells hundreds of thousands of gallons of gasoline a month.)
Fords plans to build 250,000 cars, mini-vans and pickup trucks in a four-year period that can run on ethanol mixtures. Mr. Witschonke conceded that it is an "open question" how many of them will actually do so. But thanks to a paradoxical provision of Federal law, the vehicles can be a boon to the company even if the vehicles never touch a drop. The law, meant to reduce the demand for gasoline, allows Ford to sell more cars with poor fuel economy for each "flexible fuel" vehicle it sells.
The great success in alternative-fuel vehicles is propane. According to the Energy Department, about 386,000 alternative-fuel vehicles are in use in the United States, and 71 percent of those use propane. But propane is a bit like oil because domestic supplies are limited, in contrast with natural gas or electricity, which can be produced in vast quantities.
For cleanliness and efficiency, electric vehicles have a clear edge. The utility plants that convert coal, gas or oil into electricity tend to be far cleaner than any under-the-hood power plant. (When used in the car, electricity is completely clean.)
The Northeast Sustainable Energy Association in Greenfield, Mass., which conducts an annual electric car race, ran a 348-mile course this year, using two Toyota RAV4's and two Geo Metros, each in a gasoline and an electric version. The electric Toyota got the equivalent of 39 miles per gallon versus 16 in the gasoline version; the electric Geo Metro got 59 miles per gallon versus 32 for the gasoline version.
But for now, the appeal of electric vehicles is limited by their price. In California, General Motors is leasing its two-seater EV1 for $399 a month, the same price it charges for a Cadillac Catera.
Engineers say, though, that existing electric cars may be a technological warm-up act for a hybrid, a vehicle that runs on electricity and a liquid fuel, probably using the liquid to make the current.
IN an ordinary car, the power plant must operate at many different engine speeds, giving adequate efficiency and acceptable emissions at all levels. And the engine must be big enough for quick starts, even if the average power demand is much lower.
In a hybrid, a small engine can run in a narrow range of r.p.m.'s, where it is designed to be clean and efficient. Connected to an electric generator, it dumps excess energy into the batteries until they are full. Then it shuts down, which is infinitely cleaner and more efficient than idling.
But such an engine has double the parts -- and possibilities for failure -- than the engine of an existing car.
At the Frankfurt Auto Show in Germany last month, two companies displayed cars that use fuel cells, devices that make electric current without combustion. Fuel cells mix oxygen from the air and hydrogen from any available source to make water; that chemical reaction generates electricity. Utility companies are working to make giant fuel cells commercially productive.
Daimler-Benz put electric motors and a fuel cell in the body of a Mercedes-Benz A-Class, its new subcompact. It gets the hydrogen it needs from methanol carried on board.
Mercedes is working with Ballard Power Systems, a Canadian company that has built several fuel-cell-powered buses, to make fuel cells for cars. The two companies are investing $325 million in the technology.
The Frankfurt show also exhibited Toyota's fuel-cell-powered RAV4, which ran on hydrogen derived from methanol as well.
Although not shown at Frankfurt, Chrysler is developing a "proof of concept vehicle" powered by a fuel cell that gets its hydrogen from gasoline. This is harder and less efficient than using methanol, but gasoline is universally available.
"If we could start with a clean slate and not have a gasoline industry, we wouldn't be looking at gasoline," said Christopher Borroni-Bird, Chrysler's program manager. "We have to look at the world the way it is."

HEADLINE: Ford or Honda, New or Used, He Wants to Sell It

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

 BODY:
IF every car salesman, especially every used-car salesman, were honest, sensitive, patient, fair, tactful and caring, then Wayne Huizenga's whole plan to revolutionize the $700 billion business of buying cars wouldn't stand a chance.
But as a founder of the Autonation chain of used-car marts and the nation's largest seller of new cars as well, Mr. Huizenga (pronounced HI-zing-uh) is betting that the chance to buy a car with no haggling will have limitless appeal. 
 Fixing the car sales business could prove far more complicated than building WMX, the nation's largest trash hauler, and Blockbuster, the largest video-store chain, which is how Mr. Huizenga earned most of his billion-dollar-plus fortune.
While executives at his Republic Industries holding company admit they are still learning how to steer their new business, Mr. Huizenga has roared off at 90 miles an hour. In just one year of operation, he has built 15 Autonation used-car marts from scratch with lots the size of six Manhattan blocks, while buying 200 new car dealerships and the National and Alamo rental agencies.
His vision: beyond the factory gates, link together every aspect of the auto business, new or used -- selling, buying, leasing, financing, renting, repairing -- in ways that bring untold benefits to consumers and untold profits to him.
Many in Detroit cheer the prospect of more efficient distribution and improved service. But some auto makers, long used to telling dealers what cars to sell and on what terms, fear the rise of the first dealer powerful enough to challenge them.
By the end of 1999, Mr. Huizenga plans to have a presence in the nation's 50 largest markets with 90 Autonations, each surrounded by clusters of new-car dealers, which will operate under their own names. His full-speed approach may be a product of character, but it's also an effort to beat out other new, publicly traded companies bent on expansion.
"We want to have the best Ford dealer and the best Chevy dealer and the best Toyota dealer in every market," he said during a recent interview at a penthouse office suite here.
Mr. Huizenga says that through volume and corporate ownership, he can trim $1,000 -- in advertising, inventory and interest charges, reconditioning costs and the like -- off the cost of the average used car.
He has hired a manager from the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., to bring assembly-line techniques to the refurbishing of used cars. At a reconditioning center near here, cars are routed to about half a dozen different lines, depending on how much body work they require, with other lines for mechanical repairs. Fixing up cars so they don't need return trips to reconditioning centers is among the lessons his company is still learning, Mr. Huizenga said.
At age 59, H. Wayne Huizenga, who founded his empire with a single garbage truck, remains burly and determined.
In South Florida, he already possesses the visibility Ted Turner has in Atlanta or Donald J. Trump has in New York, largely because he owns three professional sports teams here: the Florida Marlins, the Florida Panthers and the Miami Dolphins.
To most challenges, he has blunt and ready answers. An eventual recession? "That's when the strong get stronger," he said, his narrow, blue eyes narrowing further. "There would be a lot of dealers that want to sell."
Efforts by Toyota and now Honda to curb his purchases of their dealers? "The bigger, more sophisticated manufacturers recognize that this is an advantage to them," he said, describing how closer ties to dealers like him can help auto makers know which models to produce.
But changing car dealer culture will take more than money. For one, Mr. Huizenga's company will have to teach salespeople, called "sales guides," a new language.
"We don't want to call it a 'lot' and a 'deal,' " said Lynn Fernandez, a manager at the first Autonation, near Fort Lauderdale. "It's an 'outdoor display area' and a 'transaction.' You're not an 'up,' as in 'next up,' you're a 'guest.' "
The showroom includes a snack bar and a shop with auto supplies and Autonation shirts and caps. Shoppers can leave their children in a monitored playroom, then scan the inventory on touch-screen computers. They can print out a page of data, including a picture and location for each car, then roam the outdoor display area by themselves or with a sales guide in a golf cart.
Greg Meurrens and Yolanda Ramos were peeking inside a late-model Toyota Tacoma and other light trucks when a salesman -- make that a sales guide -- rolled by on a cart. "Need some help?" he asked. When they shook their heads, he rolled on.
At other dealerships, Mr. Muerrens said, "they're on top of you." He bent his knees and clawed the air to imitate a wild, hungry animal. "Here they ask. You can think before you say anything."
But the more he thought, the less certain he became about buying: "$26,490?" he asked, looking at the sticker in the Tacoma's window. "That's a lot of money."
"For the year and model, you could probably get it cheaper," Ms. Ramos said. "That's why I would want to try to bargain."
 OTHERS who were beginning their hunt for a car at Autonation were far from sure it would end there. Frank and Helen Bonfiglio printed out sheet after sheet to find reasonably priced midsized cars for a daughter in New Paltz, N.Y.
"This is a good place to start," Ms. Bonfiglio said. "You can get a sense of what the inventory is, what prices would be." But the Bonfiglios said they might send their printouts to their daughter, and let her shop in her own town.
In taking the used-car business corporate, Mr. Huizenga's leading rival accuses him of imitating.
"They've been doing this for about nine months, and we've been doing it for six years," said W. Austin Ligon, the president of Circuit City's Carmax used-car chain.
Carmax offers services comparable to Autonation's, but with lower prices, Mr. Ligon said, citing Wall Street studies to support him. Since the first Carmax opened in 1993, the chain has doubled in size annually, to 17 by the end of this year, as fast as staff members can be trained, Mr. Ligon added.
Instead of becoming the Wal-Mart of the car market, Mr. Ligon predicted that Mr. Huizenga would become the Robert Campeau, whose flamboyant, and hellbent, purchases of the nation's major retailers a decade ago ended up in bankruptcy courts.
Mr. Huizenga points out that his company's finances remain strong and disagrees that Carmax is beating him on price, especially considering Autonation's refurbishing and other services. "When we put $400, $500 or $600 into a car, it's a different car," he said. "You could charge a little extra, if you could explain it to the consumer." He says his plans for linking the industry's elements are far broader than Carmax's. As an example, he said trade-ins at his new-car dealerships would give him a better supply of used cars than Carmax could find.
If Autonation aims to reinvent used-car sales, Mr. Huizenga's new-car dealers are more traditional. The Maroone (pronounced ma-ROON-ee) Auto Plaza that he bought, along with Michael Maroone's other South Florida dealerships for $216.7 million in February, looks like a couple of airport terminals linked by a long, four-level garage. Maroone ranks first in the nation in sales of Isuzus, and at least third in Dodges, fourth in General Motors over all and fifth in Chevrolets, with several other divisions selling a variety of vehicles, even garbage trucks.
Sales people at the dealership attribute their success to long-term relationships. They frequently make as many as 30 calls a day to achieve the 8 to 10 required contacts from computer-generated lists of past customers who might be ready for new cars, current customers who came to shop but didn't buy or recent customers who might appreciate the follow-up.
 MR. Huizenga wants Maroone and his other new-car dealers to introduce no-haggle pricing. Otherwise, he regards the Maroone operations as so exemplary that he has chosen Mr. Maroone to run his company's new- and used-car sales.
Though they are far from unanimous, industry experts said Mr. Huizenga could at least provide a jolt to an industry much in need of one. "It will be the first time someone has put all the pieces of the business together," said Martin L. Anderson, who teaches management at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. "He will be able to cut a lot of costs out of the system and offer a lot more choice."
These, Mr. Huizenga affirmed, are his long-term goals. His short-term advice is embodied in the way he says goodbye. His parting words are "Buy a car."

HEADLINE: A Bucolic Nightmare: Gridlock in Suburbia

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: CORTLANDT, N.Y.

 BODY:
AT 7:20 on a misty workday morning, like soldiers mustering at dawn reveille, commuters in this suburb 45 miles north of New York City assembled in long snaking lines leading to a Y-shaped intersection.
The cars inched along the narrow, tree-lined roads, with 20 or so squirting ahead from each arm of the Y as the light went through its cycle, only to stack up at the next light, just 200 yards ahead. "If you don't get here by 7, it takes a half-hour to go four miles," said Kathy Goldstein, an accountant who has stoically driven the route for six years. The light changed, and she crawled on her way -- not to the metropolis to the south, but to her job 40 miles east, in the satellite city of Stamford, Conn. 
 In an informal survey of several dozen of her fellow commuters, no one was headed into the heart of the region, New York City. They all lived and worked in the periphery, in what urban planners call "edge city."
This congestion scene is the same in suburban fringes of big cities coast to coast. A new kind of traffic jam has emerged that bears little resemblance to the stereotype of the twice-daily tide of cars and trucks stewing in their own exhaust on the Santa Monica Freeway or on the New Jersey Turnpike.
Every morning and evening -- and increasingly in the middle of the day -- an overloaded network of small local roads clogs with traffic as commuters, shoppers, truckers and other drivers try to crisscross a landscape of dispersed neighborhoods, shopping centers and office parks.
The crush is a fundamental consequence of millions of workers and jobs migrating in recent decades from urban downtowns to outlying regions, drawn by cheaper housing and the prospect of a patch of lawn.
Suburb-to-suburb commutes have quadrupled since 1960, now accounting for 44 percent of all commuting in the United States, according to a 1996 study by Alan E. Pisarski, a transportation consultant for the Eno Transportation Foundation, an independent consulting firm in Virginia.
In essence, suburban sprawl has created something that might be called "suburban crawl" -- a chronic, creeping congestion.
This widespread slowdown is costing tens of billions of dollars in lost productivity annually, economists say, as workers, goods and materials are delayed, although it is hard to obtain firm estimates because the phenomenon is so dispersed.
Even worse, transportation experts say this traffic is likely to be far more difficult to untangle than the old-fashioned highway backup.
While travel into city centers can be eased potentially by trains, buses and other ways, planners are not finding simple solutions to moving people around the periphery efficiently. And this traffic problem is growing far faster than congestion on city-bound highways.
All told, 13 million out of the 19 million new jobs born in the United States between 1980 and 1990 were in the suburbs. "If anything, that trend is growing," Mr. Pisarski said. "The organizations move where the people are and where the pool of skills is. But, of course, as things get crowded, then the people move out farther."
The cycle repeats, and the traffic grows and spreads.
Despite half-hearted efforts in some regions to organize car pools or other alternatives, almost all these new suburban jobs have been filled by people who drive to work alone. With gasoline nearly as cheap as it has been in years, there is little incentive to change. Partly as a result, the number of trips made on public transportation in the United States declined by more than 10 percent during the 1980's.
The problem extends to the exurbs, regions that had been rural but are now growing more populated by people who work in the suburbs and want cheaper housing.
"We've created places where the only option is the automobile," said Jeffrey A. Zupan, a senior transportation analyst at the Regional Plan Association, a private group that has for decades studied long-term environmental and transportation issues around New York City.
Complicating the congestion are unpredictable driving patterns created by people who, pressed for time, combine chores into extended trips. On the way to or from work, a typical suburban commuter is very likely to drop a child at a day-care center, pick up groceries or stop at a bank or a gas station, each time exiting or entering the flow of traffic from a side street or a parking lot, resulting in what transportation engineers call interference. Or what drivers call a stop-and-start nightmare.
 THE OVERBURDENED roads, designed for a fraction of the traffic they are now bearing, are crumbling prematurely, causing new delays as "Road Work Ahead" signs sprout.
Transportation engineers see some hope for improvement in simple acts like reducing the number of places where cars can enter busy suburban arteries.
For example, adjacent shopping malls could be linked by side roads so that cars do not repeatedly exit and enter major streets, said William L. Schwartz, a transportation planner at Cambridge Systematics, a Massachusetts consulting firm. Another weak spot is officials' slow responses to traffic accidents or breakdowns that block streets, with a small disruption often leading to extensive delays, Mr. Schwartz said.
But re-engineering malls or cleaning up accidents is outside the purview of state and local transportation departments, and so these aspects of the congestion problem rarely get the necessary attention or money.
Improving the timing of traffic signals and using sensors embedded in roads to monitor buildups can help, Mr. Schwartz noted, but too often these innovations are overlooked in favor of the usual response -- lay more blacktop.
Other ways "to nibble at the problem," Mr. Zupan said, include reviving the suburban downtowns that have shriveled in the face of Wal-Marts and movie multiplexes. He added that the increase in flexible work hours and telecommuting could help.
Nevertheless, the fundamental shape of suburbia is the major challenge. The sprawling geography encompasses many counties, towns or villages, each with separate governments and transportation bureaucracies -- and agendas. Mr. Zupan said that a result is "one small office building after another, each with its own parking lot, separated by a quarter-mile, with no bus possible. This is the biggest single evil in perpetuating the suburbs."
It may still be possible for a region to shift toward the old model of focal points for living, shopping and working, Mr. Zupan said, raising the chances that buses or light-rail lines could be attractive and profitable. Eventually, the old system of transportation spokes leading into a city hub could be combined with a rim around the perimeter.
"It sounds like heresy," he said, "but suburban centers may end up part of the solution instead of the problem."
Others are not as optimistic. Timothy Lomax, a research engineer at the Texas Transportation Institute in College Station, run by Texas A & M University, compiles an annual congestion index, which has shown no signs of the trend easing. Mr. Lomax said that creating urban-style hubs might end up driving people farther out, to a new frontier of settlement and long-distance commutes. "It's not clear you can have your cake and eat it, too," Mr. Lomax said.
In the traffic trenches are people like Richard A. Peters, a planner for the New York State Department of Transportation. At his Poughkeepsie office, 70 miles north of New York City, Mr. Peters laid out a map showing several dozen suburban traffic bottlenecks he was trying to fix in the seven counties of the lower Hudson River Valley.
 PURPLE and red squiggles and dashes represented roads or intersections where the "vehicle hours of delay per mile" -- kind of a driver's pain index -- was off the scale.
Here and there around the region, Mr. Peters said, commuters were being enticed to take buses or ride in van pools. But at a growing number of spots, he said, "there's really not much we can do." Many roads can not be widened. Neighborhoods and jobs are spread out. Mass transit can nibble only at the edges of the problem.
And people seem willing to endure remarkable daily marathons to achieve the dream of a decent house and a good job -- no matter how many miles apart those two goals might be.
When Mr. Peters and other transportation experts attended a meeting with some of the region's suburban commuters last summer, they were startled at how much traffic people were willing to withstand, he said.
"You do everything you can, except knock drivers over the head and throw them on a bus," Mr. Peters said. "It's hard to get people to change."

Common problems for suburban drivers: 1. Too many buildings with their own entrances; 2. Slow response to breakdowns and accidents; 3. Overuse, which leads to frequent road repairs.

HEADLINE: How G.I. Joe's Little Jeep Grew Into a Yuppie Hunk

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
IN THE beginning, there was the jeep: Spartan transportation based on the tough "general purpose" vehicles that jarred and jolted the Allies to victory in World War II. But like some alien life form introduced into a poorly defended environment, sport utility vehicles have evolved and multiplied, crowding out indigenous species.
Three-ton monsters like the Lincoln Navigator and GMC Suburban rumble through the asphalt jungles, intimidating lower-caste people movers. Pared down "mini-sport utes" like the Subaru Forester and the Honda CR-V dart from lane to lane, symbols of freedom in a world choked by traffic and dentist appointments. Medium-size sport utilities, veterans of the S.U.V. revolution, including the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Land Rover Discovery, proclaim that today's 40-somethings have nothing in common with their Oldsmobile-driving fathers except a love of eight-cylinder engines, plush leather and a pillowy ride. 
 Much ado about what Keith Martin, the publisher of Sports Car Market magazine, dismisses as "mini-vans with nose jobs." Perhaps. But there's something about S.U.V.'s that inspires flights of pop sociology. Besides, the phenomenon really does mark a new direction for the industry that Henry Ford and Alfred Sloan built.
Make that new directions.
For one thing, S.U.V.'s symbolize the latest stage in the transformation of cars from transportation to fashion statements. "The baby boomers discovered health clubs and plastic surgeons," said Christopher W. Cedergren, the president of Nextrend, a California marketing research company. "Buying S.U.V.'s to match their Timberlands and 501 Levis fits a vain and image-conscious generation."
The S.U.V.'s also mark the victory of time and marketing over any lingering anxiety from the oil crises of the 1970's. "S.U.V.'s are Enemy No. 1 to energy conservation," lamented Bill Magavern, the director of Critical Mass, an arm of Public Citizen.
Most important, surely, they have given America's largest industry a fresh lease on life. Never mind that drivers under the age of 60 have deserted Cadillac and Lincoln for Mercedes and Lexus. Never mind that the Big Three must sell subcompact cars at a loss to induce Americans to drive them. Chevy Tahoes, Ford Expeditions, Jeep Wranglers and their ilk earn enough to cover the United Automobile Workers' still-generous wages, with plenty left over for shareholder dividends. "One hundred percent of Detroit's profits now come from trucklike vehicles," reckoned David B. Healy, an analyst for Burnham Securities.
The origins of the S.U.V. craze go back to the 1970's, when the California youth culture discovered that new pickup trucks could be had for the price of used Pontiacs. Put a cover on the back, along with some rudimentary seats, and voila: the sport utility vehicle, ready to boogie.
In the 1980's, the truck evolved as fashionable transportation along twin paths: the mini-van and S.U.V. When suburbia began to rebel against the mini-van image, Detroit was ready with a bevy of macho boxes that would never be mistaken for a Chrysler Town & Country.
No need to give up the space of a van to shed the soccer-mom label, auto makers explained. Buy an armor-clad, four-wheel-drive S.U.V., perfect for running the Baja or (infinitely more likely) hauling cartons of Huggies home from Costco. Better yet, buy a nine-passenger hulk like the Suburban and, in the words of a General Motors copywriter, "subdue the road through sheer size and strength."
Have you grown accustomed to the captain's chairs, cup holders and numerous small luxuries that turned mini-vans into scaled-down Winnebagos? Real men can use a comfortable seat, too. And for just $37 more each month (after an initial $995 "capital cost reduction"), the factory will be happy to add leather, dual air-conditioning controls and a compact disk changer.
Federal fuel economy standards, which put Detroit at a nearly fatal disadvantage against Japanese auto makers in the early 1980's, now began to work in the American industry's favor. The average mileage of each company fleet of cars must top a legal minimum. So to sell high-margin gas guzzlers, G.M. and Ford must use discounts to persuade often-reluctant consumers to buy Cavaliers and Escorts with raspy four-cylinder engines.
But sport utility vehicles hardly existed when the fuel economy laws were passed. They were lumped with light trucks, with separate standards set at the discretion of the Federal bureaucrats rather than cast in legal concrete. The current light-truck standard is just 20.7 miles per gallon -- 6.8 m.p.g. less than the car standard.
That has made it kosher to sell as many midsize S.U.V.'s, like the Jeep Grand Cherokee, GMC Jimmy and Ford Explorer, as Detroit could churn out. And it opened the door to the really big wheels, like the Expedition, which barely manages 15 m.p.g.
 THERE IS more than regulation and its twists, though, behind the Detroit renaissance led by S.U.V.'s. Both standard and full-size sport utilities are built on truck frames, and they share many other components with their truck counterparts.
But the Japanese sell very few full-size trucks in America, in part because imported trucks face a 25 percent tariff and in part because they do not mass-produce the V8 engines needed to power 5,000-pound road hogs. "It's an enormous barrier to entry," said David M. Garrity, an auto industry analyst for Smith Barney.
While car companies are loath to disclose profits on a model-by-model basis, the difference between the dealer invoice and the cost of manufacturing an extra Ford Expedition runs between $10,000 and $15,000. By comparison, The Detroit News estimates that the markup on a Dodge Neon is just $2,500, which probably translates into a loss when the associated overhead is included.
That's not the whole story. The fastest-growing S.U.V. segment is mini-sport utilities. Small models like the Suzuki Sidekick and Chevy (previously Geo) Tracker have been around for a while. Sales exploded, though, with the arrival of the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester, all of which ride like cars because they are built from compact-car components.
The Big Three may yet join the fray. "We're looking at a number of car platforms," said Dave Hansen, the category director for the Chevrolet Truck division.
But not with enthusiasm. Detroit cannot match Japan's costs on small vehicles; those low costs allow Honda to assemble a four-wheel-drive truck around the guts of a Civic and make oodles of money on a sticker price of $20,000. Nor can Detroit afford to cannibalize sales of the small, fuel-efficient cars that permit it to sell luxury cars.
The one segment of the S.U.V. market where Nissan, Toyota, Chrysler, G.M., Ford, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, Honda and Land Rover all do battle is in the middle. But even here, demand has remained sufficiently ahead of capacity to sustain generous markups. According to The Detroit News, Chrysler's net on the hugely successful Grand Cherokee is reported to run $9,000 a copy.
The prospects for the next few years, then, are for a mutually profitable standoff in which Detroit waxes fat on big S.U.V.'s and leaves mini-sport utes to Japan. Neither fuel economy nor safety issues -- a 5,600-pound Navigator can do a lot of damage when it plows into a 2,000-pound Toyota Tercel -- seem likely to spoil the party. But "it would be naive for us to assume that the business will last indefinitely," Mr. Hansen argued.
Indeed, straws already in the wind suggest how the good times will ebb.
Mercedes-Benz is producing the most sophisticated midsize S.U.V. ever and has priced it to compete with the Grand Cherokee, Explorer, Mitsubishi Montero and assorted company. Lexus is about to pull a similar trick with an S.U.V. built on the platform of a Camry. Subaru, Audi, Volvo and (soon) Volkswagen all make four-wheel-drive station wagons, which raise the bar on comfort and handling and can be trimmed to look as tough as trucks.
 BY THE same token, Chrysler is introducing the Dodge Durango, a less expensive if somewhat smaller truck alternative to the Suburban and the Navigator. And Toyota, the world's most efficient car producer, is also expected to make the investment in engine and chassis capacity needed to produce a full-size S.U.V. in America.
So, sooner rather than later, Detroit and Japan will have to cut prices. Or, more likely in view of consumers' apparent desire to treat S.U.V.'s as status symbols, they will have to add costly nontruck features, like four-wheel independent suspensions.
Surely the greatest threat, though, to the reign of the sport utility vehicle is the inherently fickle nature of fashion. Few city or suburb dwellers buy S.U.V.'s for their off-road abilities. Nor, as the novelist Richard Ford sarcastically put it in an op-ed piece in The New York Times, do many buy the cavernous boxes to haul "several sets of bagpipes or a pair of Scottish deerhounds."
Mr. Cedergren, the Nextrend president, said, "Americans make up all sorts of excuses -- they like sitting up high, they want all-wheel-drive for bad weather.
"But they really want S.U.V.'s for one reason," he went on. "They're cool."
And what's cool today is unlikely to be cool much longer.

HEADLINE: Big, Bigger, Biggest: Rolling Reports From Across the Country;
Four-Wheel Ice Follies

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
"IT could snow any time" an electronic message board has blinked since late September on Interstate 70, at the point where the plains meet the mountains.
As Colorado's main east-west highway climbs into the Rockies, it becomes the Main Street for the state's ski areas from Loveland to Vail. It also becomes an icy, double-diamond race course, scary to this driver at least, steeled after six years of negotiating the lunging traffic of Rio de Janeiro. 
 Colorado car dealers say the state has the highest per-capita number of sport utility vehicles of any state in this country. But in this kingdom of four-wheel drive vehicles (not including trucks), many drivers, either transplants from California or suburbanites who rarely see mud on their radials, do not understand that four-wheel drive offers no protection against a downhill skid.
In reality, drivers of 4-by-4's on I-70 charge easily over snow and ice on their way up to the Continental Divide, but coming down the other side, they slide in a way that looks pretty only on the slopes. Indeed, two tons of out-of-control steel is an ugly sight.
The perception that 4-by-4 drivers are lulled into a false sense of security was confirmed by a Denver Post study published in December 1995, which found four-wheel drives were more likely than normal passenger cars to cause crashes on Colorado's portion of I-70. That year, the newspaper studied all accidents reported on I-70 from Kansas to Utah during March, traditionally the region's snowiest month. Of 513 reported accidents, 43 percent, or 223, involved utility vehicles. In contrast, Colorado car dealers estimated that these vehicles accounted for fewer than one-quarter of all sales.
With Denver's economic boom, highways are clogged, and the problem seems fated to worsen.
Since 1980, the number of vehicles registered in the Denver metropolitan region has increased by 50 percent, to 2 million. During that time, the number of vehicles crossing the Continental Divide on I-70 has doubled, to about 9 million vehicles this year. Seizing a chance, the airport near Vail doubled its flights last winter, allowing skiers to fly over the Divide.

HEADLINE: Auto Makers See Nothing but Trouble in a Warmer World

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR more than a decade, the auto industry has pretty much got what it wanted in this town. Tighter fuel standards? Forget about it. New safety standards? Small potatoes only, please.
But suddenly, Detroit is finding a new reason to worry about Washington: global warming. Industry officials say there is no greater threat to the American auto industry than a concerted worldwide push to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, the suspected culprits in long-term global climate change. 
 Asked to rank the industry's major policy and regulatory concerns over the next few years, a senior representative of the Big Three answered, "Global warming is No.1, and everything else is very far behind."
No, Congress has not slipped out of Republican hands, and the Sierra Club's lobbyists are still outnumbered on K Street. But Mike Stanton, the chief Washington lobbyist for the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, said the industry is watching with great trepidation as officials debate the Government's position on a proposed global climate-change treaty.
With a prod from Vice President Gore, who sounded an early alarm about possible global warming, the Administration is expected to endorse some form of binding international emissions standards when representatives of 180 nations gather in December in Kyoto, Japan, for a conference on global climate change.
It is not surprising then, that when the President met with the chief executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler at the White House earlier this month to discuss trade policies, what he heard instead were complaints about emissions control.
The Kyoto conference will lay the road map for the next five years on how the world begins to cope with carbon emissions and their effect on climate and health.
The proposal that frightens auto makers most is one that will impose strict emissions standards on the developed nations but exempt the developing world, where the growth in greenhouse gas emissions is expected to be much more rapid.
Carbon dioxide occurs naturally in the atmosphere, but it is also emitted by cars, factories and the burning of carbon-based fuels like oil, coal and wood. Levels of this and other greenhouse gases are rising and thought to be warming the planet by trapping sunlight that otherwise would be reflected back into space. The automobile is a chief source of these gases. To environmental advocates, it is also one of the easiest to control.
"The reason they think it's such a threat is that the biggest single step we can take to prevent it is making our car go farther on a gallon of gas," said Dan Becker, the director of the Sierra Club's global warming and energy program. "So we are advocating higher-mileage cars."
Mr. Becker said a car that gets 27.5 miles a gallon produces 38 tons of carbon dioxide gas over a 10-year lifetime. A 45-mile-per-gallon car emits 23 tons.
That is what worries auto makers. One of their least-favorite pieces of legislation over the last 20 years is the law imposing corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE standards, forcing them to sell two or three economy cars for every low-mileage, high-profit car they produce.
THERE is no known way to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of gasoline. Mr. Stanton said there are only two ways to reduce such emissions: drive less or drive in cars that burn less gas. That means either raising gasoline prices, imposing transportation-control measures like car pooling or alternate-day driving, or raising CAFE standards.
Each of these steps would impose huge costs on the industry -- and thus car buyers -- with uncertain benefits, Mr. Stanton said.
"The truth of the matter is there are lots of questions on the science of global warming," he said. "We don't think the state of knowledge justifies spending $200 billion to $300 billion a year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels."
Mr. Becker scoffed. "The industry has shown an unwillingness to improve economy without CAFE standards," he said. "Our conclusion is that we can't rely on the environmental views of Detroit to improve the global warming pollution picture."
The Republican Congress has twice barred the Administration from taking steps to increase fuel efficiency standards.
While the possibility of new fuel-economy rules is the industry's major concern, there are several other significant issues before Congress and the regulatory agencies.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is about to rule on consumer requests to disable air bags in cars, vans and light trucks. The agency is expected to approve on-off switches for passenger air bags that would address concerns for the safety of children, the elderly and short adults.
Views are mixed within the industry, with Ford and General Motors preparing to install on-off switches for customers who ask for them, while Chrysler, Honda and others are reluctant to offer the choice of disengaging the life-saving devices.
All auto makers agree that the preferable solution to the few cases of fatal air-bag deployment is not deactivation, but "smart" air bags with sensors that can reduce the explosive power of the bag when a seat is occupied by a child or a small adult. But auto makers are uncertain customers would be willing to pay the extra cost, about $250 a vehicle.
Another issue is international trade, which is splitting auto makers and their unions, who are shoulder to shoulder against radical steps on global warming.
"Trade liberalization has contributed greatly to the strong performance of the United States economy," said Shirley Zebroski, a senior Washington representative for G.M. "Our focus remains on getting improved access throughout the world for our products."
The United Automobile Workers and other unions are skeptical about President Clinton's call for "fast-track" authority to negotiate trade agreements. They say that such deals encourage American manufacturers to build plants overseas to take advantage of lower wages and looser environmental standards.
Also on Congress's auto agenda this fall is renewal of the nation's transportation financing program, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, better known as Istea. Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, introduced the six-year, $145 billion bill in September, saying it would assure the quality and safety of the nation's roads into the next century.
MR. CHAFEE said he expected the auto makers' support in getting the bill through Congress, despite the fact that it contains a number of safety and environmental provisions that will cost the industry money.
"There's plenty in it for the auto companies," the Senator said. "Literally billions of dollars are going to be spent making our roads even better and maintaining them, which is terribly important to them."
In summing up the political climate for the auto industry, David Cole, the director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan, calls it a "mixed bag."
"The Republicans are much more friendly to market-based approaches, rather than command and control from Washington," Mr. Cole said. "For labor and the Democrats, their issue is jobs. Then there are the big regional differences, the Midwest where the plants are and the Northeast, where the pollution is.
"When you look at nitty-gritty," he said, "it cuts across both parties pretty evenly."

HEADLINE: A Show House That Smiles? Eh Bien!

BYLINE: By MITCHELL OWENS 

 BODY:
IT is impossible to climb the stairs of the 1997 French Designer Showhouse and not imagine that you have stepped into a three-dimensional version of a brain-teaser cartoon for Sunday-bored children.
Remember, this is a show house, so what is wrong with this picture? Con-Tact paper posing as bird's-eye maple. Place mats turned into lampshades. Terrazzo floor tiles on a kitchen counter top, and Corian, that ubiquitous counter material from Du Pont, transformed into Mondrian-mosaic walls. And what about that bed in Jane Victor's and Jennifer Ellenberg's fifth-floor aerie, a steel platform eerily suspended by industrial-strength cables like something out of "2001: A Space Odyssey"? 
 The French Designer Showhouse, running today through Nov. 16, is not the typical show house. Mind you, it is not the most influential showcase for interior design in the country. That is firmly the preserve of the annual Kips Bay show house, renowned for grand rooms by august professionals. But if Kips Bay is the Metropolitan Opera, its French rival, which has appeared in New York every two years since 1989, is BAM: provocative and contrary.
The trompe l'oeil finishes alone tell the story. Unlike the laborious fool-the-eye surfaces that have been a show house cliche, the "tortoise shell" pilasters in Odile de Schietere's dining room are not trying to fool anyone. Though wonderfully executed, their essential humbleness is front and center: quarter-inch wood boards casually tacked into place. This straightforward application gives Ms. de Schietere's room -- where a wrinkly, rudely nailed canvas floor cloth cuts the Russian neo-classical chairs and marble-top consoles down to size -- an appealingly temporary, degage air, like a party tent pitched for just one night. It is a neat trick, and more important, an apt symbol for a show house that is perhaps the most innovative in America, where fantasy and accessibility come together in one tidy inspirational package.
First, an explanation. The title of the show house, held this year in an 1878 town house at 49 East 67th Street (between Madison and Park Avenues), is somewhat misleading. Of the 20 designers and 17 artisans, only 3 -- Jacques Grange, Odette Boulenger and Paul Mathieu -- live and work in France. The rest are Americans, though some are French-born. The cultural designation of the show house derives largely from the name of its beneficiary: the American Hospital of Paris Foundation. But then there is the invention that the word "French" implies. These designers seem well aware that a majority of show house visitors never hire decorators -- magazines, not show houses, attract more new clients -- and so they have tried nothing blatantly commercial. Which means no chintz, no antiques with stellar provenance, no robber-baron grandeur. Instead, the designers have had fun, offering settings, details and solutions that ought to remind decorators and clients alike that the designer worth hiring is the one with a nimble mind, not just a business card.
In fact, two participating designers, Mr. Grange and Nancy Corzine, have stocked their rooms with furniture that visitors can actually go out and buy. The salon by the celebrated Mr. Grange has woven straw walls and billowing curtains of moss-green and cherry-red silk taffeta, with eclectic chairs, tables and sofas that he designed for the John Widdicomb company of Grand Rapids, Mich. And Ms. Corzine's ground-floor space -- cool, beige and vaguely 1940's -- is a showcase for her new upholstered pieces and case goods (available to designers and decorators at her Third Avenue showroom).
What these shopper-friendly settings mean to the rarefied genre of decorator show houses will cause serious debate in some circles, outrage in others. But the ramparts have been breached: merchandising in show houses is here. Get used to it.
Fortunately, the ideas outnumber the product plugs. Saddled with an outmoded, age-battered kitchen? "Paint, paint, paint," Jamie Drake said. "Short of demolition, it's the only solution." On the ceiling, walls and metal cabinets of the kitchen and breakfast area, Mr. Drake applied an icy pastel he called "angora sweater blue" -- Benjamin Moore's No. 792 -- transforming the dreary space into something sleek and modern for a few hundred dollars.
The breakfast area's awkwardly placed street-front windows were masked with a floor-to-ceiling curtain and, Mr. Drake proudly explained, the recessed fluorescent lights glow behind Coretex panels of milky corrugated plastic that cost $3 each at places like Home Depot.
High style through the sensitive use of bargain goods is a motif. The gridlike wainscoting in Christopher Coleman's bathroom and dressing room is made of white strips of wood and squares of mirror from a hardware store. To block the dispiriting view of a construction site from the balcony off the sleek Lucite-and-oak bedroom designed by Jeanne-Aelia Desparmet-Hart, the artisans Philippe Soule and Donna Gutkin of Escabelle Design created a sculpture-cum-shield of autumn leaves glued to undulating frosted Lucite.
"Before, it was like a tomb," Jean-Pierre Dovat said of his cellar-level room, which encloses an L-shaped pool. He vanquished the claustrophobic effects of the long, low, narrow room with cleverly angled mirrors -- along the walls as well as underwater -- and then used Con-Tact adhesive paper to give the changing room's sliding door and handrail the look of bird's-eye maple.
"If you use them properly, in the right way, cheap things can be so beautiful," Mr. Dovat said. He also came up with the show house's best example of inspired recycling. Matchstick place mats from Gracious Home, bent into wide U shapes and lined with white paper, were turned into shades for the pool area's garish crystal light fixtures.
Other staples of late 1960's and early 70's decor -- silver Mylar, layer-cake banquettes, massive Lucite -- are ubiquitous. The Gucci-and-Furstenberg wrap-dress revival has much to answer for here. The glossy brown hall by Myles Scott Harlan and Douglas Wilson, with its Lucite banister and stair treads encased in stainless steel, recalled such period night spots as Regine's.
"Not all cheap things are bad," said Robert Couturier, a designer whose flamboyant impishness conceals a scholar's knowledge of 18th-century French decoration and architecture. Which explains why his room, a great salon tented with black-and-white cotton printed with iguanas and artichokes, contains wonders of every economic origin: a Louis XIV sofa in worn silk velvet flanked by flea-market tables topped with Bakelite; a folk-art bird sculpture made of buttons with African statues; a grand Roman Catholic reliquary alongside 1940's lawn chairs by Jean Royere. For the floor, Mr. Couturier created an area rug with copies of 18th-century maps of Paris covered with a Plexiglas sheet.
A big mix, but, Mr. Couturier said, that's how people live today. "Haphazard is the most fulfilling kind of decor," he said, plopping down on the sofa and looking alarmed as it slid a few inches on the Plexiglas.
"If you like something, then that is enough for it to be in your life," he continued, quickly regaining his composure. "That is the thread that holds your things together."

HEADLINE: Orchestras Welcome Corporate Overtures;
Concerts Raise Funds, and Questions

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Usually, when shareholders leave the annual meeting of RPM Inc. in Cleveland, they are clutching five-gallon buckets filled with samples of Rust-Oleum, Mar-Hyde windshield cleaner, Chemspec carpet cleaner and other products from the company's industrial repertory.
Tomorrow, they will be getting a different treat: a serenade from the Cleveland Orchestra, hired for $100,000 to mark the company's 50th anniversary. "My goodness," said David W. Smith, president of the American Society of Corporate Secretaries, whose members are generally responsible for organizing annual meetings. "It's quite amazing. I've never heard of any company doing that before." Nor have other corporate experts. 
 But RPM, whose sales and earnings have been climbing for a half-century, is in a jubilant mood. "There isn't another publicly owned manufacturing company that's had 50 consecutive years like that," said Thomas C. Sullivan, the chief executive. "So we thought we must celebrate. And why not with the Cleveland Orchestra?" More than 4,000 of the company's shareholders have R.S.V.P.'d yes, quadruple the usual attendance.
RPM's concert, an hourlong performance of works by Tchaikovsky, presents an intriguing opportunity for the nation's financially precarious orchestras, not to mention a painless way for corporations to support the arts, because the costs of annual meetings are fully tax-deductible.
The Cleveland's gig for RPM is also a musical milestone because of the audience. Many orchestras accept and even solicit the occasional private engagement, but they are usually hired to play for high-profile listeners at formal charity benefits or meetings of public policy groups like the International Monetary Fund or the National Governors' Conference. RPM's concert has a more populist cast, more brown suit than black-tie.
The Cleveland Orchestra "doesn't need to beg for money," said Charles S. Olton, president of the American Symphony Orchestra League. "The more interesting aspect is the social purpose of carrying music to people who might not come into your concert hall. If they see you in one place, they might be more likely to come to the concert hall."
But these private concerts also raise questions. The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, for example, recently performed for the Promise Keepers, the evangelical Christian men's movement whose rally on the National Mall on Oct. 4 was described by many people who oppose its agenda as having a conservative Republican tinge, though its leaders deny any political motives.
Generally, orchestra officials said, their organizations have no set policy about who they will or will not play for; they make decisions on a case-by-case basis. The Atlanta Symphony's general manager, George Alexsovich, compared the situation to a newspaper's accepting advertising, which does not imply an endorsement of the product.
As for the Promise Keepers, he noted that many orchestras, including the Atlanta, play for various religious groups. In any case, no official of the orchestras questioned recalled having turned anyone down if an invitation meshed with their concert schedules.
Private concerts are part of a mounting commercialism that has crept into many corners of the arts world, raising concern in some quarters. Over the years, museums and arts organizations have become increasingly reliant on corporate dollars, through partnerships, awards programs and events underwritten by sponsors.
Twenty-five years ago, for example, Philip Morris began giving grants to dance, reaching a total of more than $25 million to companies like American Ballet Theater and Dance Theater of Harlem and to the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In 1995, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum announced a five-year, $5 million partnership with Hugo Boss, easing its budget and putting the German men's wear company in the spotlight.
 
'It Makes Good Business Sense'
No question, private concerts make a lot of sense for orchestras. Though their financial status has improved with the economy, and bankruptcy filings are yesterday's news, nearly 40 percent of the nation's orchestras still operate in the red, according to the symphony league.
"I don't know of an orchestra in the country that wouldn't sell a service if they are available," said Mr. Alexsovich, who has worked for a half-dozen orchestras. "It makes good business sense," he said, since all or most of the fee can go directly to the orchestra's bottom line.
Typically, an orchestra contracts with musicians for a set number of so-called services, said J. Thomas Bacchetti, an orchestra consultant based in Atlanta. These services, averaging about eight a week, can be concerts or rehearsals. If an orchestra does not use up all eight on its own, it can schedule a private concert without adding to payroll costs. "So you do make some money from it," Mr. Bacchetti said.
Orchestras try to fill in blanks in their schedule with out-of-town engagements or with "runout concerts," in which they are hired by arts organizations in nearby communities to give what are essentially public performances. Private concerts come next. Sometimes, orchestras will even pay musicians for services beyond those required by their contract to take a job, although the profit is lower.
All of the orchestras questioned offered examples of their own private concerts or, like the Philadelphia Orchestra, said they would consider them.
"We don't have much time for them," said Deborah Borda, the executive director of the New York Philharmonic, which accepts one private concert a year. "But when we do them, we want complete artistic control of the program. And then the basic rule is that we consider it a way to raise money." The philharmonic charges a little more than $100,000.
The Boston Symphony, too, performs privately about once a year, for a negotiable charge in the "low six figures," said Mark Volpe, the managing director. (The symphony's sister organization, the Boston Pops, plays perhaps 20 times a year for private groups, about half in front of business-related audiences.)
At the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Vanessa Moss, a vice president, said that her orchestra regularly performed at benefits, but did a few private concerts for conventions or business groups. "We might have done three in the last five years," she said, for a charge of $100,000 and up.
As for the Atlanta, which charges a fee that varies from $15,000 to $50,000 for a concert, the orchestra played at the opening ceremonies of the 1996 Olympic Games, as well as for the Promise Keepers.
 
Special Place In the Community
The Cleveland Orchestra, which also performs for benefits and high-toned private groups a few times a year, seems to be the only one that was called for duty by people outside the black-tie set. That, city residents said, is a reflection of its position in the community. In recent years, for example, it has played concerts for the employees of B. F. Goodrich and of Society Corporation (renamed Keycorp after a merger).
RPM was partly inspired by a gala concert celebrating the 125th anniversary of The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 1991 at which the Cleveland Orchestra performed. RPM also considered other ways to celebrate its anniversary, including a theater production at the Cleveland Playhouse and commissioning some music for recording by the Cleveland Chamber Orchestra.
The Cleveland Orchestra won out because of its prestige, Mr. Sullivan said. Though RPM has never underwritten any of the orchestra's concerts, the orchestra's donor list shows that it contributed between $10,000 and $15,000 to the orchestra last year, and that James A. Karman, the company's president, is a trustee of the orchestra who contributed between $15,000 and $20,000 last year. Mr. Karman, who joined the orchestra's board in 1992, is the founding chairman of its corporate council.
Mr. Sullivan, RPM's chief executive, called the concert idea a classic, especially since the $100,000 cost has been offset by scheduling the company's annual meeting of managers from around the world at the same time and by eliminating the annual bucket of samples. "We had a few shareholders call in and complain about that," he said.
But they seem to be in the minority. Shareholders are traveling to Cleveland for the concert "from 30 states, from Maine to Alaska," Mr. Sullivan said.
 
Reserving A Bigger Hall
RPM was surprised by the response. Originally, it had rented Severance Hall, the orchestra's home, along with three satellite areas that would receive a video feed, for a total of 2,800 seats. But that plan was quickly outgrown, and two weeks ago, RPM rented Cleveland State University's convocation hall, which seats 13,000. At the time, the arena was reserved for a recruiting event by the university's basketball team, which agreed to postpone it.
As a result, at around 5 P.M. tomorrow, the orchestra will play four pieces: the Polonaise from "Eugene Onegin," excerpts from "Swan Lake," the overture from "Romeo and Juliet" and "Marche Slav," Op. 31, under the baton of the resident conductor, Jahja Ling. (Christoph von Dohnanyi, the music director, is in Paris, rehearsing the opera "Hansel and Gretel.")
"We chose the composer, Tchaikovsky, because I love him," Mr. Sullivan said. "And they chose the program. We'd be very foolish to presume to tell the Cleveland Orchestra what to play."
If the current enthusiasm is a guide, there will be calls from shareholders for an encore. But it remains to be seen whether or not RPM will inspire other companies to follow its lead.
"I don't think it'll be a trend," said Mr. Smith of the corporate secretaries' group, "though it very much depends on the C.E.O. The trend is to keep annual meetings lean, to go through the business boom, boom, boom. But this is an anniversary, and therein lies the difference."

HEADLINE: Must-Have Label

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE 

 BODY:
BUYERS of handmade imported rugs are used to petting the plush, appraising the pattern and checking the dimensions. But not until now have so many buyers been inspecting a rug's flip side, searching out a little tag that says the rug was made without child labor.
With the new ban on imports of goods made by children in bondage, signed by President Clinton last Friday, it has become the latest must-have label. 
 "Our customers are really aware," said Kimberley Aylward, the spokeswoman for Garnet Hill, a mail-order catalogue that sells $1 million in imported rugs each year. "They want assurances even before they place an order that no kids were involved."
Accurate numbers do not exist for the number of children working in servitude in the making of rugs in South Asia, said Darlene Atkins, the public policy coordinator at the Child Labor Coalition in Washington. Estimates range from 300,000 to one million, the latter figure provided by the South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude. Most of the children working in the rug industry are in India and Pakistan, Ms. Atkins said.
Although Congress passed the new law, it did not appropriate any additional money for the Custom Service to monitor imports or track violators. Retailers and manufacturers in the imported carpet business, estimated at $1.3 billion a year, are aware of the risk to their image in selling items made by children and are looking for ways to market their awareness to concerned customers. These range from self-monitoring -- Ikea and Pottery Barn are among the stores that hire agents to inspect looms periodically -- to labeling programs, of debatable efficacy, that monitor production and use the fees they collect to set up schools.
Frank Hagemann, a policy analyst at the International Labor Organization in Geneva, said that the number of rug manufacturers signed up for programs worldwide is too small to measure. But "awareness is increasing rapidly," he said. Five years ago, he pointed out, there were no programs at all.
Right now, the most visible marketing tool is labeling. The international labor group says six labeling programs currently operate in India, Germany, Switzerland, Brazil and the United States. The two largest programs are Rugmark and Kaleen.
Rugmark, an international nonprofit organization that has enlisted 145 manufacturers from India and Nepal, monitors production and uses fees paid to it to finance three schools in Nepal and India. Kaleen, which is promoted by the Government of India in collaboration with the carpet industry, requires that every exporter contribute 0.25 percent of the export price of each rug to the program and register every loom in return for the Kaleen label. The money raised is used for schools.
Only the winsome, smiley-face Rugmark label certifies that products are made without child labor. "We guarantee to the public that we have done a thorough inspection," said Terrence Collingsworth, the general counsel to the International Labor Rights Fund in Washington and a member of the Rugmark board, adding, "if you want to sell rugs in the United States, you're going to need some kind of certificate."
Ike Timianko, the owner of the Central Carpet in Manhattan, said: "If I don't see a tag, I don't buy the rug. My customers want to know."
But effective monitoring remains the biggest snag. Critics say that any retailer offering a blanket guarantee is being naive -- at best -- given the workload of inspectors.
Rugmark, despite its $1 million budget, has only 18 inspectors who are supposed to make surprise visits to 18,636 looms. Kaleen turns the work of monitoring looms at 2,400 carpet export houses over to an independent Indian research organization with 18 inspectors.
"Labeling programs are futile," said Chris Walter, the project director at Cultural Survival, a nonprofit human-rights organization in Boston. "Labels can and will be bought."
Elliott Schrage, an adjunct professor at Columbia University's business school who has helped coordinate an effort by the sports equipment industry to stop using children to stitch soccer balls in Pakistan, says that passing laws and affixing labels may not be the best way to help exploited children. "Without a video camera on every loom in every home where rugs are made," he said, "there's no way you can know if children were involved."
James Tufenkian, an American rug manufacturer who employs some 6,000 weavers in Nepal and who is a board member at Rugmark, says that while Rugmark's heart is "100 percent in the right place, it's difficult to know what's really going on when production is so spread out in the weavers' homes."
Dan Hodges, the president of Pande Cameron & Company, a Manhattan importer of rugs from India, contends that all labeling programs are vulnerable to corruption. He said that opportunities are abundant for inspectors to demand bribes in return for lying about the involvement of children.
Ikea does not place any tags on its rugs because "we would have to have people out there all the time watching, and without that, we cannot make a real guarantee," said Marianne Barner, a manager at Ikea headquarters in Almhult, Sweden. She added that the Ikea chain pays another company to make random visits to looms.
At Pottery Barn, "our position is that child labor is an issue that we cannot afford to be associated with," said Patrick Connolly, a vice president. Some Kaleen rugs are evident in its stores, but he said, "Our goal is not to get a label on every rug but to make sure there has been no illegal use of children."
ABC Carpet and Home in Manhattan, with annual sales volumes in rugs of $60 million, has so far refused to affix any labels to the rugs they manufacture in South Asia. It employs 6 inspectors for 1,000 looms.
"The tags are a joke," says Graham Head, managing director at ABC. "The only ones profiting from them are the makers of the tags themselves."
THE new law specifically bans imports by children in bondage, estimated at $100 million worth of goods each year, for the most part rugs and carpets. ABC claims that not enough of a distinction has been made between bonded, or indentured labor, which all agree is intolerable, and cottage labor, where a group of people, often related and perhaps including children, all contribute to piece-work production. IKEA, for example, favors banning all children having any role in the making of the carpets they sell. Making a distinction between family work and bonded labor, said Ms. Barner, is too complicated. "We say 'No child, period,' " she said.
Mr. Head of ABC Carpet and many others say the impact of such blanket prohibitions go against the natural rhythms of rural-based economies and could be damaging if they don't offer children the all-important alternative of an education. "If you want to really tackle the problems of poor countries, don't take away one of the only forms of income they have," said Mr. Head.
Mr. Walter agrees. "Just not working doesn't solve anything," he said. "In a single family some of the children may be working so that others can go to school."
Referring to cottage industries, Mr. Walter and many observers are sensitive to the issues of Western values applied to foreign cultures. "I see it as an issue of cultural domination," said Carol Bier, curator of Eastern Hemisphere collections at the Textile Museum in Washington. "In many cultures the economies are very different from our own, many are family-based and the set-ups are very different from documentable child abuse. Rug weaving is one of the most perfect examples of a sustainable economy in developing countries. In Turkey virtually every living room will have a loom in it.
" There is pride and delight felt by the whole family with their rugs," she added, noting that a child well-versed in the art of weaving often has a highly sophisticated grasp of complicated mathematics. "To ban all that could have a devastating effect."
With time, the mounting concern of consumers may be seasoned with a commitment to programs that really help children. With cottage labor so important to the survival of developing economies, Mr. Hodges, the Manhattan rug importer, said, "I just hope the new ban leaves plenty of room for exceptions."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Weaker on Hint Of Another German Rate Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the mark on speculation that German interest rates might rise sooner than rates in the United States.
While an unexpected gain in American retail sales fanned talk that the Federal Reserve might raise rates as soon as next month, German central bankers are dropping hints that they might follow up last week's rise in a money market rate with another increase. "German rates will probably rise before ours do," said Bill Bertha, foreign-exchange manager at Mellon Bank in Boston. "And as far as magnitude is concerned, it's all in Germany's court." 
 The mark got help late in New York trading after the Bundesbank's chief economist, Otmar Issing, said that central bankers were concerned about rising prices in Germany. "We need to be hawkish on inflation," Mr. Issing said in a speech in Paris. "Our decision of last Thursday was directed at that." Traders took the comment as a signal that the bank might raise the securities repurchase rate again soon, and bought marks.
Mr. Issing's remark heightened speculation on Tuesday after a Bundesbank council member, Helmut Hesse, said the bank would "review interest rates every two weeks," a reminder that it could increase lending rates at any point.
The mark was also helped when the Russian Parliament postponed a confidence vote on Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin's Cabinet. Turmoil in Russia weighs on the mark as Germany is Russia's largest trading partner and a big lender.
The dollar was held back against the yen as trade concerns offset expectations of continued weakness in the Japanese economy.
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.7475 marks, down from 1.7523 on Tuesday. It fell to 121.16 yen from 121.65. The British pound rose to $1.6239 from $1.6207.
In other currency trading, the Indonesian rupiah tumbled as much as 2.8 percent against the dollar on worries that the Government would not reach agreement with the International Monetary Fund on conditions for an assistance package to restore confidence in the economy.
The Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit also tumbled on concerns that those countries' governments would not take the right steps to revive their ailing economies.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Palladium and Platinum Rise In Concern on Russian Supply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Palladium and platinum prices rose sharply yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid persistent concern that Russia would sharply reduce shipments to Western users in coming months, causing a scramble for industrial metals.
On other markets, corn prices rose as commercial users rushed to lock in prices on the expectation of tight supplies in coming weeks. 
 Russia and Japan are set in early December to begin negotiating contracts for shipments in 1998 of palladium and platinum, which are used in jewelry, cars, computers and other electronics. Russia is the largest producer of palladium, accounting for about 70 percent of the world's supply, and is the second-largest producer of platinum behind South Africa. Japan is the world's largest user of the metals.
There are fears that internal political and economic turmoil within Russia will again cause shipping delays, much like those that held up transportation of the metals for seven months earlier this year, sending prices rocketing to 12-year highs.
Many in the market expect that there will be glitches in the talks, said David Rinehimer, an analyst with Smith Barney Inc., who noted that prices had remained high despite recent shipments from Russia to meet current demand. "Russian exports might not much exceed the levels that we had this year, which are very low," he said.
Palladium for December delivery rose $6, to $215.45 an ounce, the highest since early August on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and closing in on 12-year highs. January platinum rose $6.70, to $439.90 an ounce.
Corn futures prices rose on the Chicago Board of Trade as users took advantage of the recent price declines to buy heavily.
World demand for the United States crop could reach record levels this year, causing a 9.312-billion-bushel crop, the third largest on record, to dwindle rapidly. Some buyers believe now is the best time to buy before prices rocket higher, analysts said.
The concern about supply helped overcome selling pressure tied to forecasts for nearly perfect harvesting weather over the next week in the Midwest. December corn rose 4.25 cents, to $2.90 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Little Travel Agency That Could;
Rosenbluth's Key to Growth Is Corporate Business

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
When Rosenbluth International opened an office in Atlanta 12 years ago, it heralded its arrival with a billboard proclaiming, "Rosenbluth has landed!"
"We landed all right -- with a thud," said Hal F. Rosenbluth, the 45-year-old chairman of the giant travel services company. "As far as I know, nobody in Atlanta knew or cared what Rosenbluth was." 
 Not many Atlantans know even today, nor many Philadelphians, for that matter, though Rosenbluth has been here for more than a century, giving it seniority over such other home-grown institutions as the Eagles football team and Tastykakes.
Indeed, Rosenbluth is the travel agency the public hasn't heard of -- and that has turned out to be just fine. Faced with yawns in the streets of Atlanta and elsewhere, the company redoubled its efforts in the nation's executive suites. Putting together one of the most high-tech reservation and pricing systems in the industry, it worked hard to attract corporate customers with promises of big savings and smooth service. The effort has paid off: still relatively obscure, Rosenbluth is thriving as a travel agent to big business -- with clients like DuPont, Wal-Mart Stores, Nike and Chevron -- and pretty much ceding the leisure market to the rest of the industry.
Rosenbluth's corporate focus and cutting-edge information systems have paid off in another way as well. The company has managed to ride serenely above the changes roiling many other agencies. These include changes wrought by reduced airline commissions, by travelers making end runs around agents by booking through the Internet and with E-mail -- and by the need for better equipment to keep up with the Rosenbluths of the world.
From a handful of offices in Philadelphia 20 years ago, Rosenbluth is now in 46 states. But in recent years it has also become a power abroad, with operations in 43 countries, from Chile to China. Its 1996 gross sales of $2.5 billion in the United States tied it with BTI Americas for third place in Travel Weekly's ranking of travel agencies, behind only American Express ($9.1 billion) and Carlson Wagonlit Travel ($3.2 billion). Its worldwide sales last year totaled $3 billion, and this year the privately held Rosenbluth is projecting revenues of $3.5 billion.
Few of Rosenbluth's 1,260 offices are walk-in operations -- almost 98 percent of the company's revenue derives from managing the travel needs of its 1,500 or so corporate clients, which include some smaller businesses and a number of law firms. Its advertising budget, a paltry $150,000 this year, is directed not at consumers but at executives and corporate travel managers who read trade publications.
Rosenbluth says it has a client retention rate well over 90 percent. But it still suffers the occasional defection, losing the Pittsburgh Pirates and the General Electric Company, among others. And as big as it now is, it continues to cast itself as the scrappy upstart -- as its icon, it has held on to the salmon, battling its way upstream against the odds.
Mr. Rosenbluth periodically invites thousands of employees to get-togethers that resemble a blend of pep rally, corporate retreat and revival meeting. At one such gathering in the Pennsylvania Convention Center here two months ago, and with American Express and Carlson Wagonlit clearly in mind, he told a cheering crowd of 4,500, "None of our competitors thought we could build a global company so fast and so focused." Quickly warming to the subject, he added: "You know why they didn't believe we could do it? Because they knew they couldn't do it themselves."
Not quite, said Travis Tanner, the chief executive of Carlson Wagonlit, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "They have one office in London; we have 45 in the U.K.," he said. "Having an office in a market doesn't make you global -- geographical dispersal makes you global."
Mr. Tanner also said that when G.E. put its travel account up for bids in 1992, after having been with Rosenbluth for almost two decades, it asked bidders to submit outlines of their vision of the travel agency of the future. "They chose us," Mr. Tanner said, "because they thought we were the best strategic partner to take them where they wanted to go."
Truly global or not, Rosenbluth has come a long, long way from its beginnings in 1892, when Marcus Rosenbluth, the founding great-grandfather, hit on the idea of charging European immigrants $50 for steamship passage to New York and transportation from Ellis Island to Philadelphia.
The agency stayed close to home for three generations, booking the usual range of cruises and plane trips for customers, until Hal Rosenbluth became president in 1985.
An admittedly indifferent student at the University of Miami, Mr. Rosenbluth joined the agency after graduation in 1974 and began working his way up the family corporate ladder.
But in 1978, the year airlines were deregulated, he wandered into the area where reservation agents were working on the company's few corporate accounts, which represented just $5 million or so in bookings. In that pre-computer era, booking flights meant having to talk on two telephones at once, one with the client, the other with the airline, while also writing orders and putting them into slots on a lazy susan to be delivered as tickets the next day.
Impressed by the agents' esprit de corps, Mr. Rosenbluth pulled up a chair, picked up a phone -- and remained there for several years.
"After a couple of days," he said, "I demoted myself from vice president to reservations agent and went into business travel full time."
Landing the Bethlehem Steel account in 1982 allowed Rosenbluth to add an office in Allentown, Pa., and signing up DuPont in 1985 gave it a national presence.
But the key to Rosenbluth's success was a mastery of computers. After buying its own mainframe, it developed a reservation data system that listed flights by price, thus enabling the company to guarantee corporate travel managers the lowest fare on every route.
Next, it promised to reduce corporate travel budgets in return for fees from clients instead of commissions from airlines. Then, as its technological sophistication grew, it demonstrated how airlines could increase revenues by lowering fares to Rosenbluth clients on certain routes, in return for the clients' guarantee to fill more seats on those routes.
Since then, the technology department, which now accounts for one-fifth of the 500 employees here at world headquarters, has turned out an array of software wizardry.
This includes an on-line reservations system that allows travelers to book flights, hotels and rental cars from their personal computers, using a list of options that ranks the best deal for the company and insures compliance with corporate policy on costs and other travel concerns. Another program enables employees to submit expense reports using a company's existing E-mail network.
What's more, management says, Rosenbluth is the only travel company that links all of its offices electronically through the same information system, an advantage, it insists, that guarantees seamless, consistent service.
For much of the last year, the company has added new business at the rate of $3 million a day, including almost $100 million in revenues from such big new customers as the News Corporation, Nike Europe, USX's Marathon Oil, Gateway 2000, the University of California at Los Angeles, the Rock-Tenn Company and the Canadian National Railway.
By opening an office at the London headquarters of Western Geophysical, the Houston-based provider of services to the oil industry, Rosenbluth said it was able to save its client more than $109,000 in the first quarter of this year alone. It did so through negotiated fares and a careful analysis of where it would be most economical to purchase tickets, based in part on such factors as currency fluctuations, local price controls and a constant shuffling between American and British fare tables.
Just this year, Rosenbluth opened offices in Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Germany, India and Switzerland, and in December it will open an office in Vienna to service its $40 million account with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Rosenbluth owns and manages the agencies in 25 countries, and has forged partnerships in 18 others -- mostly countries that prohibit foreign ownership. In the United Arab Emirates, it has a partnership with the Kanoo Group of Bahrain, a diversified company with operations throughout the Persian Gulf region. Its alliances with Government-owned partners in China, where it has agreed to open offices in more than a dozen cities, have already made it the biggest travel company in Shanghai and will soon make it the biggest in Beijing.
Given the company's current size and reach, it is somewhat surprising to hear Mr. Rosenbluth say that there is still a future for mom-and-pop travel agencies. (His own mom, Frances, and pop, Harold, who remains co-chairman with his cousin, Eugene Block, still work at the company, as does his sister, Amy. His brother, Lee M., is president of Rosenbluth Vacations, a separate company that concentrates on the leisure business and has annual sales in excess of $90 million.)
Small agencies have "an opportunity to use their expertise in travel, including making house calls and acting as consultants," Hal Rosenbluth said, toward the end of a recent long day. "But they'll probably have to have tickets and such processed by somebody else."
Before a visitor could ask if "somebody else" meant him, Mr. Rosenbluth said he was thinking about taking the company public. It would make it easier to expand, he said.
Then he excused himself. There was an urgent phone call to take, and final preparations to attend to for a trip the next day. The chairman of obscure Rosenbluth International was going to sail down the Amazon, then visit his offices in Brazil and Argentina. There wasn't going to be a company billboard in sight.

With clients like DuPont, Wal-Mart, Nike and Chevron, Rosenbluth International has built its travel business -- and its reputation -- by catering to industry and ignoring the leisure market. It also has developed a corporate culture where employees (er, associates) speak a different language.

HEADLINE: An Arts Center for New Jersey

 BODY:
The New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark will open on Saturday to expectations that will be a challenge to meet. No development can single-handedly restore life to Newark's downtown, but this $180 million facility -- financed with state and Federal money and more than $50 million in private contributions -- offers more promise than many past urban renewal efforts.
The Performing Arts Center will be home to the New Jersey Symphony and several New Jersey-based theater and dance companies. The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater will also be a resident affiliate. The inaugural season will present dozens of the world's great artists in classical music and jazz, as well as performances of ballet, contemporary dance, world music, opera and plays. The point is not to duplicate Lincoln Center, but to offer a compelling and convenient alternative, especially for residents of New Jersey who might prefer not to cross the Hudson. 
 The idea of putting a grand arts facility in the middle of Newark's desolate downtown seemed hopelessly optimistic when it was first proposed by Gov. Thomas Kean a decade ago. Poverty, crime and middle-class flight after the 1967 riots made Newark a forbidding place.
Yet it was not an illogical choice. The city is accessible from highways, rail lines and Newark Airport. Several higher-education institutions are based there, making the creation of a cultural district possible. More than four million people live in the surrounding New Jersey suburbs, providing a huge potential audience.
Ten years of work and the support of three Governors, the state's largest corporations, private philanthropists and local political leaders have now made that vision a reality. The Performing Arts Center's leaders have faith in the power of art to heal a troubled community and confidence that easy parking and good shows will bring suburbanites back.
From the beginning the project was meant to be more than just a beautiful building. Part of its mission is to be an arts education mecca for the whole state. The center will run workshops for teachers, a schooltime theater series, a dance academy, after-school training for young musicians and arts camps to serve thousands of students from the city and its suburbs. Another of its announced purposes is to be a catalyst for commercial and residential development. That will take longer to achieve and is more problematic, although new arts developments in cities such as Cleveland and Pittsburgh have in fact encouraged development by attracting visitors day and night.
The streets around the center have been repaved. The old Military Park garage across the street has been renovated. Signs to the center on all the nearby highways are in place. The gleaming structure, housing the 2,750-seat Prudential Hall and the 514-seat Victoria Theater, already dominates the corridor between downtown and the Passaic River waterfront. But the success of this hugely ambitious venture will be apparent only when platoons of school buses line the streets by day and audiences fill the sidewalks at night.

HEADLINE: Home Mortgage Defaults Are Still Rising in Region

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Signals abound in the New York metropolitan region that the economy has heated up, especially in the last year. One indicator, however, still looks like the bad old days of the recession and appears to be getting worse: more homeowners in the region are defaulting on their mortgages than at any time since at least the late 1970's, and in higher numbers than in the rest of the nation.
Through the first six months of this year, Connecticut had the second highest percentage in the nation of its total household mortgages in foreclosure, according to the most recent figures from the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. New Jersey ranked third. New York State was fourth. Only California was higher than Connecticut. 
 But economists and bankers say the numbers do not suggest an economic downturn so much as a new rhythm. One reason, they say, is that walking away from debt through bankruptcy, which often goes hand in hand with foreclosure, has lost much of its stigma in recent years.
In the three states in the region -- and in much of California -- home prices in many areas have never recovered the heights reached in the late 1980's. People who might have struggled on for years in hope of recapturing some equity in their homes have given up.
The economic recovery in the region has also been uneven, leaving some pockets in all three states -- the Hartford area, parts of upstate New York, and the rural southern areas of New Jersey in particular -- in continued economic stress.
And bankers admit that they are not trying as hard to keep people in their homes. The ambitious programs begun in the early 1990's to help people through tough times and to keep banks from being overwhelmed by repossessed property have been quietly shelved. The recent rise in foreclosures, unless it continues and worsens, does not justify reviving programs that were costly to run and were created to solve a one-time crisis, bankers say.
"We're at a permanently higher level," said Dorothea E. Brennan, senior vice president for residential lending at People's Bank in Bridgeport, Conn. "There will always be a certain level of foreclosures that in our past did not exist. There's been a change in attitude, a change in the marketplace and a change in the fundamental economic decisions that people are making."
A Westchester County family, for example, bought a home in the late 1980's at the cusp of the market. The home's value plummeted soon after in the recession. The husband was laid off. Now he is working again, but the home is still worth about $30,000 less than the couple paid for it and spent on improvements. Their lawyer, Barry G. Bell, said he would probably advise them to pull the plug. "In some cases, you must counsel them to stop beating a dead horse and let it go," he said.
Through the mid-1990's, the old rhythm held: foreclosures fell steadily as the region worked through the effects of the recession earlier in the decade. Then, about three years ago, foreclosures began rising again, even as the pace of economic recovery, measured by things like job creation and unemployment, improved.
In Connecticut and New York, the percentage of properties in foreclosure was higher in the middle of this year than at any period during the recession, or any period since the Mortgage Bankers Association began tracking such foreclosure numbers in 1979. New Jersey's foreclosure rate has not returned to its recession-era levels, which peaked in 1992 at 2.44 percent of all loans -- about one in 40 properties in the state -- but it has climbed from its post-recession low point, set in late 1995.
Some analysts say this is all just hard-nosed self-interest at work. If a homeowner has no equity in a house, meaning that the selling price on the market would be less than the amount owed on the mortgage, then throwing one's family into personal bankruptcy is not a sign of household stress but of cunning. That is a more common scenario in the New York region and in California than elsewhere in the nation because of the sharp run-up in prices a decade ago and the bear market that followed.
"It's actually the rational choice," said Asieh Mansour, an economist at Standard & Poor's DRI, an economic research concern.
In the Northeast, in particular, housing has been more closely linked to bankruptcy than elsewhere in country. A survey of 50,000 debtors who had filed for bankruptcy in 1996 and 1997, released earlier this year by Visa U.S.A., said a higher proportion of people in the Northeast than anywhere else in the country identified foreclosure as the "last straw" that led to their bankruptcy filing.
Ms. Brennan at People's Bank said that for about five years, from the onset of the recession in the late 1980's until about 1995, the No. 1 causes for foreclosure were economic, especially a lost job. But in the last year, some old, historically important social causes for foreclosure have re-emerged. Divorce and its consequences, she said, have once again become the most commonly cited reason why payments can no longer be made. And the pain and economic hardship of those cases is often as great as ever.
Melitta Strebel was in Germany, settling her family's affairs after the death of her father and going through a long-distance divorce when she got a mortgage foreclosure notice last year. She was able to refinance the loan and save her property in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., and another piece of land in upstate New York, but just barely, she said.
"It was more than a nightmare," she said. "When someone is trying to take your property away, the pressure is so tremendous that you feel helpless. You do not know where to turn."
But the figures from the Mortgage Bankers Association show that while more properties may be in foreclosure in the region than elsewhere, the percentage of people who are behind on their payments -- an indicator of future foreclosures -- has significantly improved.
New York and New Jersey are still above the national average of about one in 25 mortgages having a payment overdue by 30 days or more, but they are nowhere near the worst performers -- Mississippi holds that distinction. And Connecticut had a better on-time payment rate than the country as a whole through the first half of this year.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Increased 0.3% in September

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Shoppers increased spending for the fourth straight month in September, but much of the gain appeared to reflect higher automobile prices and masked sales declines at clothing and department stores, Government figures showed today.
Analysts said the three-tenths of 1 percent increase in September retail sales reported by the Commerce Department, combined with upward revisions for July and August, portrayed an economy that clearly was decelerating. "As the third quarter progressed, things were slowing down," said L. Douglas Lee of HSBC Securities in Washington. "And I think the fourth quarter will be a slower quarter than the third." 
 But the data still surpassed expectations and helped send a slight chill through the financial markets, which have been especially edgy about any hint of inflationary pressure since Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, spoke last week about "unsustainable" economic growth. Retail sales account for one-third of national output.
Nor did the markets take much comfort when the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, in a possible harbinger of broader trends, reported declines in its September indexes of regional manufacturing activity and prices. Interest rates climbed along a broad front in the bond market and stock prices closed moderately lower.
The rise in consumer spending last month was the slimmest of the string of gains that began in June and was suppressed by big declines at department stores and apparel stores. These outlets were said to suffer from unseasonably warm weather that curbed demand for autumn clothes. Some analysts also said sales fell because potential shoppers were absorbed in television coverage of the death and funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales.
"September is iffy" in terms of consumer demand, said Raymond A. Worseck, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "There was some softening."
Automotive dealers posted a six-tenths of 1 percent revenue increase last month, a result seemingly at odds with earlier reports that dealers sold fewer vehicles. But analysts accounted for the discrepancy by citing a jump in prices, which showed up in the Producer Price Index.
Among other categories of durable goods -- those intended to last at least three years -- merchants selling furniture and other equipment for the home also enjoyed a six-tenths of 1 percent sales increase while those whose business is building materials, hardware, garden supplies or mobile homes endured a five-tenths of 1 percent decline.
For nondurables, there were advances of 1.4 percent at food stores, eight-tenths of 1 percent at drugstores and -- owing much to higher prices -- 1.5 percent at gasoline service stations.
These were largely offset, however, by declines of seven-tenths of 1 percent at stores selling apparel and accessories, four-tenths of 1 percent at restaurants and bars and six-tenths of 1 percent at department stores and other outlets that sell general merchandise.
As for revisions, the July advance is now put at 1.2 percent instead of the nine-tenths of 1 percent previously reported while August now shows a six-tenths of 1 percent gain instead of four-tenths of 1 percent.
"Over all, these data indicate that consumer spending during the third quarter was relatively healthy but has slowed more recently," Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said in an advisory to clients.
Last month's sales total of $215.5 billion, seasonally adjusted, was 5.2 percent above that of September 1996 but this was without any allowance for inflation, which at the consumer level has run a bit above 2 percent over the last year.

HEADLINE: Metro Matters;
Bond Act Has Unsafe School As a Backdrop

BYLINE: BY ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
THERE are few better arguments for spending more on school construction than the brief, unhappy life of Public School 141.
District 6 in Washington Heights was so desperate for space that it built a new elementary school in an old dry-cleaning plant. Since the school was evacuated last week, after levels of perchloroethylene that exceeded state guidelines were found, its 500 students have been shuffled from one overcrowded classroom to another in a system with no space for error. 
 At the same time, there are few better arguments against simply spending more money on school construction than the debacle of P.S. 141.
As the school's short, expensive history has been investigated, one egregious error after another has been exposed, starting with the initial decision to place a school on a potential Superfund site. Neither the Board of Education, which approved the project, nor the School Construction Authority, which is supposed to keep an eye on the board, appears to have heeded strong indications that the project was plagued by incompetence, exorbitant costs and potential conflicts of interest.
So what's a voter to do? On Election Day, New Yorkers will get a chance to approve or reject a bond issue that would allocate $2.4 billion for school construction and rehabilitation throughout the state.
The bond act's stated purpose is to address just the kinds of health and safety problems so painfully dramatized by P.S. 141. But it offers few details to suggest that this new money will be spent any more effectively than the old. Indeed, it offers no details whatsoever.
WHENEVER bond issues come before voters, something that happens about once every two years courtesy of New York's never-met-a-debt-it-didn't-like Legislature, only the briefest and generally most incomprehensible description appears on the ballot. But usually behind these enigmatic descriptions stand fairly specific plans about how the money will ultimately be spent.
In the case of School Facility Health and Safety Bond Act of 1997, however, no such plan exists.
The Legislature, in a final rush to pass a budget after four months of delay, threw together the bond act mainly as a way to end a political impasse. In the bill authorizing it to be placed on the ballot, there is only the vaguest description of what sort of projects the bond might support or, perhaps just as significantly, what the criteria would be for choosing them. From its language, one can just as easily imagine bond money being used to purchase computers in Scarsdale or repair boilers in Buffalo as to build classroom space in Queens.
Of the last 10 bond acts to come before New Yorkers, only one, according the city's Independent Budget Office, was as short on details as this year's. Voters rejected that one, the Economic Action Program of 1977, by a margin of 3 to 2.
CRITICS have many compelling arguments why such a vaguely defined bond act is a bad idea. For one thing, they argue that the funds will go to districts with the most political clout rather than those with the most pressing needs. For another, they worry that bond money will be devoted to projects that would have otherwise been financed with local money, thereby simply shifting costs rather than increasing education spending.
The bond act was conceived as a way to improve the desperate condition of many New York City schools. Its main backer was Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Democrat of Manhattan, who insisted on it as the price of his support for a property tax cut favored by the Governor and a business tax cut favored by the State Senate.
But critics say the city will be hard pressed to spend its share of the money, thought to be $1 billion, effectively. Whatever construction money the city gets, they point out, will still be funneled through the same group that created P.S. 141.
"For every school that is improved by the proceeds of the bond act," said Cindy Green, vice president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group that has come out against the bond, "another will fall into disrepair."
Its supporters, meanwhile, acknowledge the hazards of such an open-ended bond, but argue that the need is pressing enough to justify the risk. If voters don't seize this opportunity, they say, they may not get another one. And whatever errors may have been made in creating P.S. 141, those children still need a school.
"The Board of Education is certainly not a model of managerial success," conceded Robert R. Kiley, president of the New York City Chamber of Commerce, which favors the bond act. But, he said, "you've got to fight for that $1 billion while it's out there."

HEADLINE: Stocks Lower, With the Dow Falling 38.31

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Stock prices moved modestly lower yesterday in light trading on weak demand for technology issues and rising interest rates in the bond market.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 38.31 points to close at 8,057.98, and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index lost 4.56 points, to 965.72. 
 Broader indexes also suffered. The Nasdaq composite index fell 9.42 points, to 1,723.37, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller company issues lost 1.23 points, to 462.74.
"It was just a choppy day," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at John Hancock Funds in Boston. "It's the kind of day where stocks and bonds react to individual pieces of news."
Much of the day's activity came in the technology sector, which was weakened after Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker, reported slightly disappointing earnings results after the close of trading on Tuesday.
Investors, some of whom react quickly to an earnings report, buying or selling shares of companies in the same sector on the belief that they will post similar results, sacked Intel yesterday, along with a host of other semiconductor issues.
Intel fell 5 1/8 points, to 86 11/16, and Motorola Inc. -- another semiconductor issue -- was down 2 1/16, to 70 1/2. In fact, four-fifths of the issues in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index lost ground yesterday, as the index fell 1.2 percent.
The market was also weakened by a rise in interest rates, which came after the Government reported yesterday that retail sales rose three-tenths of 1 percent in September, more than the expected two-tenths of 1 percent. The Government also revised upward retail sales figures from July and August, making investors a little more nervous that inflationary pressure could be building.
As a result, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.39 percent, from 6.35 on Tuesday.
Hank Herrmann, the chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan., said that even though the market had the strength to go higher, the late year surge that he had expected to erupt as bonuses and extra cash flowed into the market, might be tempered both by rising interest rates and the heightened fears that developed after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned last week that inflation could be on the horizon.
"We were thinking it would be a positive tape through the end of the year," Mr. Herrmann said. "But that just got sidetracked because of Greenspan, who put a little scare into the market. So the market will be a lot choppier."
Despite yesterday's setbacks, several analysts said that the market might easily bounce back when better earnings reports are released. Yesterday, for instance, Dell Computer and Compaq -- two of the best- performing issues of the year -- rose sharply. Compaq is expected to release third-quarter earnings today.
Dell rose 3 7/8, to 102 7/8; the company's shares are up 287 percent this year, and Compaq soared 3 5/8, to 77 1/4. For the year, shares of Compaq are up 158 percent.
Transportation issues also soared yesterday, led by airline stocks. The Dow Jones Transportation Index, up 49 percent this year, rose 1.3 percent yesterday, led by shares of the UAL Corporation, up 5 7/16, to 99 13/16, and Delta Air Lines, up 2 5/16, to 106 15/16.
Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, 20 lost ground yesterday, led by I.B.M., which fell 1 5/8, to 101 3/4, and Eastman Kodak, which fell 1 7/16, to 62 15/16, one day after the company reported disappointing earnings.
For the last two months, the Dow has languished. Although there have been some sharp rises and falls, the blue-chip average has actually moved very little. In early August, the Dow closed at a record 8,259.31. Yesterday, the Dow closed 2.4 percent below that level.
But Mr. Freedman at John Hancock said there was little reason for worry. The market could pick up steam in the last few months, and even if it does not, the gains this year have been tremendous. The Dow is up 25 percent.
"I think most investors would be happy with the kinds of returns they've had this year, if they can keep them," he said. "There's no catalyst to drive the market dramatically higher, but there's also no catalyst to drive it dramatically lower either."

Bond Prices Falter a Bit On Sales Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities slipped yesterday after a Commerce Department report indicated that retail sales last month were stronger than expected. The prospect of new corporate supply later this week also weighed a bit on the market.
Investors feared that the surprisingly strong retail data -- a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent over all, and two-tenths of 1 percent excluding autos -- could be a precursor of inflation that might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates. Traders were nervously awaiting today's release of the Consumer Price Index to see if it brings a similar surprise. 
 The risk of an unfriendly price index caused investors to seek a higher return yesterday, spurring the selloff. Traders see a potential for a relief rally if the consumer report comes in as expected: a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent for both the overall number and the core rate.
The 30-year bond fell 16/32, to a price of 99 25/32 yesterday; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 6.39 percent, from 6.35 percent on Tuesday.
Issuance of corporate debt, which competes with Treasuries for investor capital, also affected the market in a number of ways. Often securities firms involved in underwriting these corporate issues sometimes sell Treasury securities as a hedge until the deal is complete. That created some selling pressure yesterday, mostly in the shorter maturities.
"Today's retail report does little to reduce the chances of Fed tightening before year-end," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities.
"U.S. retail sales remained firm in September despite early indications of a spending lull," Ms. Cooper said. She noted that in addition to the September rise, "the two prior periods were revised higher, confirming that consumption was robust for the third quarter as a whole at a 5 percent annual rate."
The core gain of two-tenths of 1 percent that excluded auto sales was close to expectations. Sales were bolstered by outsized gains in food stores and service stations, where higher gas prices caused the rise.
"Consumer spending in the third quarter was even stronger than initially estimated, but the growth will not be sustained in the current quarter," Kenneth J. McCarthy, who heads the Economic Intelligence Company, an economic consulting and forecasting firm, said.
"If we view consumer spending over a longer time frame, the pattern is one of steady, but not excessive, growth," Mr. McCarthy said. "Compared to a year ago, retail sales in September were up 5.3 percent, and sales growth has averaged between 4 percent and 6 percent for most of the past two years. Given a 1.5 percent inflation rate for consumer goods, that means that inflation-adjusted retail sales are running at annual growth rates of between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent -- healthy, but not excessive."
Still, Mr. McCarthy said that the Fed would watch the strength in retail sales closely, even if it is not enough to prompt an immediate tightening. Strong retail sales growth in January and February prompted the Fed to raise the Federal funds rate. But Mr. McCarthy expects the economy to slow on its own.
Not all the news was stacked against the bond market. Ms. Cooper noted that the first results for October suggest that spending is tapering off. The Johnson Redbook weekly retail survey showed a decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the first week of October, and auto sales in the first 10 days of the month also trailed levels of a year ago.
Separately, the Atlanta Fed's index of national business activity eased in September to a reading of 9.0 from 15.8. And while new orders shot up, production moderated and all inflation components eased.
Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said that prior to the retail-sales report people had come into the market aggressively long, mistakenly anticipating a rather benign number.
"Many of those long quickly reversed those positions," Mr. Regan said, "sending the market down to the lower trading bands that lasted most of the day."
He said that with more data coming this week, last week's bullish tone had been very much modified. He expects the new trading range for the yield on the 30-year bond at between 6.30 percent and 6.45 percent.

HEADLINE: Malaysian Premier Sees Jews Behind Nation's Money Crisis

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Confronted with an economic crisis that has taken this rapidly developing nation by surprise, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has unleashed a series of verbal attacks on everyone from Jews to currency traders to unidentified "sinister powers."
"Many people say that I often shoot from the hip," he said last Thursday in what seemed to be a light-hearted mood. "Some say I'm a loose cannon. Perhaps they are right." 
 But he did not stop there. The next day, addressing a rally of predominantly Muslim villagers, he suggested that Malaysia's troubles might be the result of a Jewish "agenda" to weaken the economy of this country of about 20 million people.
"We may suspect that they have an agenda, but we do not want to accuse," Dr. Mahathir, who has made anti-Jewish statements in the past, was quoted as saying by the official Bernama news agency. "And incidentally we are Muslims, and the Jews are not happy to see the Muslims progress. The Jews robbed the Palestinians of everything, but in Malaysia they could not do so, hence they do this, depress the ringgit."
The Malaysian currency has lost up to 30 percent of its value in recent weeks, part of a regional epidemic that has also seen a sharp decline in the Thai baht, the Philippine peso and the Indonesian rupiah.
The currency crisis, accompanied by a sudden volatility in stock markets, has thrown the region's thriving economies off balance. Thailand and Indonesia have called on the International Monetary Fund for help.
Of all the regional leaders, Dr. Mahathir has been the loudest in voicing his frustration at this sudden burst of the bubble. His statements seem only to have heightened the air of crisis here.
At a World Bank seminar in Hong Kong last month, he accused the American financier George Soros of single-handedly causing the fall of the ringgit. Mr. Soros responded by calling Dr. Mahathir "a menace to his own country" and saying, "He is using me as a scapegoat to cover up his own failure."
The Malaysian leader then startled the gathering of financiers with a suggestion that currency trading be outlawed as "unnecessary, unproductive and immoral."
In recent days he has leveled attacks on the Western press and on "modern sinister powers" that have "pressured our currency to make us poor again."
His continuing aggressiveness has begun to arouse concern among some Malaysians and foreigners that the architect of Malaysia's prosperity might be putting his own achievements at risk.
In the face of criticism, Dr. Mahathir acted over the weekend to soften his statement about Jews, saying he had only been repeating what he had "been told by certain people."
But the damage had been done, and the backlash continued this week.
"Once again, Prime Minister Mahathir has shown himself to be a classic anti-Semite," said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, a city Dr. Mahathir recently visited in his campaign to attract high-technology investment.
Criticism also came from Australia, a country with which the Prime Minister has had an on-again, off-again war of words.
"Dr. Mahathir sounds as out of control as his currency," said Diane Shteinman, president of the Executive Council of Australia Jewry.

HEADLINE: A Coastal War Flares Over a Supertrawler

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: GLOUCESTER, Mass., Oct. 14

 BODY:
It has been nigh on a generation, some in this salt-scented town say, since so many fishing folk from Maine to New Jersey were last so united in a single cause.
Back in the 1970's, the cause was a law that pushed hundreds of gigantic, foreign-owned factory trawlers out of a zone extending 200 miles from American shores, away from the Georges Bank areas once considered the richest fishing grounds in the world. 
 Now the target is only a single factory trawler: the Atlantic Star. And she is American-built and 51 percent American-owned.
In towns like Gloucester, where old seagoing dynasties have been battered by the ravaging of fish stocks that was brought on by overcatching and pollution, the dominant theme seems to have become, Let us not repeat our mistakes.
"None of the fishermen wanted this thing, from Gloucester to Maine to Rhode Island to New Jersey," Joe Sinagra, a 43-year-old fisherman here who has been going to sea since he was 6, said of the Atlantic Star. "The whole damned New England fisheries was against it."
Indeed, her owner's plans for the 369-foot Atlantic Star to begin hunting herring and mackerel on Georges Bank have sparked such vehement opposition from potential competitors, fishing groups, environmentalists and politicians that the issue has reached all the way to Congress.
Any week now, possibly any day, Congressional aides say, the Senate is to pass a measure similar to one that has already sailed through the House, placing a one-year moratorium, at a minimum, on trawlers the size of the Atlantic Star.
The Senate measure, sponsored by Senators Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, and John Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrats of Massachusetts, would forbid boats of more than 165 feet or 3,000 horsepower to fish for herring and mackerel until a plan to manage herring fishing is put into place by regional fishing authorities next year. At present, there are no limits on herring catches.
Sponsors of the measures in both houses maintain that lessons must be learned from the overfishing of the past and that the supertrawler could hammer the herring and mackerel stocks, now abundant.
Environmentalists say such supertrawlers, some able to catch 500,000 pounds of fish in one tow of the net, are contributing perilously to a global overfishing crisis. More than 50 American factory trawlers are now operating, primarily in the Bering Sea, and hundreds of their foreign counterparts, barred from American waters, work around the globe.
Here in Gloucester, home of some of the strongest resistance to the Atlantic Star, the proposed Federal moratorium is cause for rejoicing among a coalition of fishermen, their wives, seafood sellers, Greenpeace campaigners and even clergy, all joined in the ad hoc Gloucester Initiatives to fight the big trawler and her owner's plans to build a freezer plant at the state fish pier here.
"We haven't had a critical mass of people come together like this before," said one coalition member, Al King, a Gloucester lobster dealer. "They came together because herring is of prime importance to every fishery," serving both as natural prey to many other species and as bait.
To the Gloucester coalition, the central issue is "sustainable fishing," which, its members say, requires making sure that limits are in place, in time, to keep herring fishing viable.
"Factory trawlers and sustainable fishing just do not mix," said Steve Parkes, a seafood processor here.
While everyone in Gloucester agrees that fish stocks should be kept vibrant, however, not everyone sees the Atlantic Star as a great menace.
Vito Calomo, executive director of the Fisheries Commission of Gloucester, says he would never want to see a fleet of factory trawlers back devouring the fish of Georges Bank. But he thinks the Atlantic Star, as the only supertrawler allowed in -- she already has her permit from regional fishing authorities -- could provide useful research on herring stocks and much-needed fishing and shore jobs as well.
Gloucester's Mayor, Bruce Tobey, believed at first that the Atlantic Star and the shoreside plant her owners have proposed could help Gloucester enter the international herring market.
But, he said, "the notion got run up a flagpole, and it did not withstand scrutiny."
"The history is so strong," the Mayor added, referring to townspeople's fears that just as herring and mackerel stocks are finally showing signs of a powerful recovery, they will be overfished again.
One American co-owner of the Atlantic Star, Mike Love, a longtime Maine fisherman, says it is not so much history that is strong as economic interests that compete with his.
The complaints presented publicly about the supertrawler have focused mainly on the environment, but as Mr. Love sees it, 10 or so of his competitors, mainly in Rhode Island and New Jersey, got the opposition going.
"They got the environmental gun and aimed it our way and supplied the spark and stood back and covered their ears," he said.
In reality, he said, boats small enough to escape the legislation's ban -- of 155 feet in length, say -- can catch more fish in a day than the Atlantic Star; they simply bring their catch to shore for freezing rather than doing it on board.
"What's going on here," Mr. Love declared, "is competitors saying, 'O.K., we put you out of business, and now we can build an unlimited number of shore plants and 155-foot boats,' " along with "a few Congress people who get a chance to grab a headline that they're saving the fish. That's how it works."
He said he and his partners, which include a Dutch company, Parlevliet & Van der Plas, as minority owner, were "exploring all of our legal options."
About $40 million has been invested in the Atlantic Star project, Mr. Love said. The ship is now in Norway being outfitted with refrigeration equipment suitable for herring and mackerel. It was originally built as an ocean incinerator but was never used for that purpose.
Perhaps the most powerful argument Mr. Love has on his side is that American fishing authorities have said, in so many words, that herring and mackerel stocks have reached record levels and that they are, in fishing parlance, "underutilized" -- as in, "Go get 'em, boys."
Further, fishing in American waters is far more regulated now than it used to be, he added. A system of local and regional councils oversees it, created by the Magnuson Act of 1976, which changed many of the ground rules for American fishing. Limits on catches of most species are now far more stringent.
But members of the Gloucester Initiatives like Niaz Dorry, the Greenpeace coordinator here, question whether the stocks are as abundant as often-uncertain scientists maintain. These advocates are pushing for an entirely new paradigm of fishing, one in which regulators would concentrate on creating habitats where fish as a whole can thrive rather than simply setting quotas on single species.
"I always joke that it takes an ecosystem to raise a fish," Ms. Dorry said.
And some of the bigger optimists in Gloucester believe that the coalition could presage a new era in which such a sophisticated approach will be encouraged, one in which a new breed of fisherman, more focused on the long term, might replace the every-man-for-himself breed of the past.
"There's no question that people are so much wiser now," said Joe Garland, who for decades has been a Gloucester historian of the fishing industry.
That such concerted opposition to the Atlantic Star should come from Gloucester, Mr. Garland said, is notable.
"It shows there is a real sea change going," he said. "It really is a sign of hope."

HEADLINE: In Brazil, Clinton Urges the Rich to Share Gains of Free Trade

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Trying to reassure the poor in Brazil and the Democrats in Congress about his hopes for free trade, President Clinton visited a school and sports complex in a slum here today to issue a stark warning about the potential social damage of open markets.
"It is wrong for only a few to reap the benefits of the wonderful changes going on while the many remain mired in poverty," Mr. Clinton said. "That is a betrayal of our values of individual integrity and equal opportunity." 
 On his first trip through Latin America, President Clinton has been advocating a sort of enlightened capitalism, under which businesses, recognizing that increased wages and improved education are in their interests, would work with governments to make good on what he calls the "social compact."
As he seeks increased power from Congress to negotiate trade deals, Mr. Clinton is mindful of Democrats' concerns that, in the hemispheric free-trade zone he longs for, American wages could fall while working and environmental conditions in Latin America could deteriorate.
In a speech this morning to the American Chamber of Commerce and other business people in Sao Paulo, Mr. Clinton took on such fears by urging his audience to help "bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots."
"The age-old curse of Latin America -- the constant undercurrent of all advanced economies of the last 20 years -- has got to be dealt with more seriously not only by government, but by people in the private sector working in partnership with government," he said. "We have to give everyone who will work for it a place in the future we are trying to build."
Borrowing the language of those who oppose increasing his freedom to negotiate trade treaties, Mr. Clinton said he believed in "insisting on worker protection so that trade enhances working conditions and living standards instead of undermining them."
Mr. Clinton's aides have complained that reporters have paid more attention to the fund-raising investigations back home than to Mr. Clinton's arguments for freer trade. But in his airport greetings, speeches and toasts, Mr. Clinton has doggedly pounded away at his case on trade.
This afternoon Mr. Clinton illustrated his argument for public-private partnerships with his visit to the Mangueira school, which offers schooling, sports training and health care to 2,000 children. The school has benefited from the support of Pele, the soccer star and Brazilian Minister of Sports, who also spoke here today. But it has also benefited from hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Xerox Corporation.
At the school, Mr. Clinton delivered an unusually explicit corporate plug. "Xerox is a good citizen of Brazil and a good citizen of the United States," he said.
Indeed, the event seemed at times like a rally for Xerox. Hundreds of children wore pink or white gym shirts advertising Xerox, and an English-language banner in easy camera range of the President's podium proclaimed: "Ten years ago Xerox believed in this dream."
The school may fit Mr. Clinton's vision for the new economy, but it is an isolated example in this country of 160 million. As Mr. Clinton's critics on trade are quick to point out, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's reform-minded President, has barely dented the rampant corruption and disparities of wealth here, or mitigated labor conditions that constitute virtual slavery in some parts of the country.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A new look at why the U.S. outdoes Europe in job creation.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IN 1994, Paul Krugman, an economist at M.I.T., concluded that "growing U.S. inequality and growing European unemployment are different sides of the same coin."
The issue has only sharpened since then: America's ability to employ millions of unskilled workers -- and thereby reduce unemployment to less than half the rate in Europe without causing inflation -- is widely attributed to competitive (meaning wretched) low-end wages. But Alan Krueger, a labor economist at Princeton University who never misses a chance to debunk conventional wisdom, wonders whether economists have been too quick to buy the latest dismal science. 
 His fresh examination of "the U.S. employment miracle," written with Jorn-Steffen Pischke of M.I.T. and available (at www.nber.org) as National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 6146, is no defense of rigid European labor policies. But it does suggest that the success of the Great American Jobs Machine has as much to do with the vitality of small and medium-size business as it does with low wages.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that unemployment in France reached 12.6 percent in September, almost triple the United States rate. Germany (9.7 percent) and Sweden (10.5 percent) weren't much better. Spain tops the dishonor role with 19.9 percent unemployment -- a rate not seen in America since Franklin D. Roosevelt was in office.
The standard explanation is that minimum wages, which exceed $10 an hour in affluent Northern Europe when social insurance taxes are included, deter employment of the inexperienced and unskilled. If the minimum wage does not scare off employers, powerful unions do.
Outside of Britain and the Netherlands, free-market-minded politicians despair of breaking labor market rigidity, and for good reason. The majority, who are employed, are unwilling to accept pay cuts for full employment. The substantial minority who are shut out have been pacified with generous welfare checks and free public services ranging from high-quality child care to pensions at age 60.
But Mr. Krueger and Mr. Pischke point out that the evidence linking regulation to unemployment is weaker than the common-sense appeal of the hypothesis. Until the 1970's, unemployment was generally lower in Europe than in America, they note, despite far tougher labor market restrictions. Besides, unemployment among highly educated European workers, whose compensation is less likely to be regulated, has risen roughly in proportion to unemployment at the bottom.
By the same token, the two economists argue there is scant -- and contradictory -- evidence that the American labor market adjusts to changes in the supply of workers by raising and lowering wages. Unskilled wages were, as expected, depressed by the flood of baby boomers into jobs in the 1970's. But the "baby bust" of the late 1980's, which many economists expected would elevate wages, actually coincided with a steep decline in low-end compensation.
This does not mean that America could eradicate poverty the Northern European way, raising minimum wages, mandating health insurance and giving unions the legal tools to organize skeptical workers. But Mr. Krueger is not convinced that the key to full employment in Europe is American-style labor policy. Indeed, he conjectures that a different strength of American capitalism helps explain job growth.
In Europe, he suggests, jobs are created from the top down as big business and big government mobilize scarce capital and expand production capacity. In America, where virtually all employment growth in recent decades has come from small and medium-size service businesses, the key to expansion has been individual enterprise.
Do Europeans lack entrepreneurial skills? Entrepreneurs certainly aren't honored in classrooms or glorified in the media the way they are in America.
More tangibly, Mr. Krueger says, American entrepreneurs face lower hurdles. Shops and other small businesses are less likely to be hemmed in by regulations -- zoning, licensing, hours of operation -- designed for the most part in Europe to guarantee incumbents a comfortable living. Venture capital is easier to obtain in America for small businesses. Banks and specialty lenders in America are more likely to provide credit for businesses with strong track records.
The hypothesis -- Mr. Krueger more modestly labels it a conjecture -- is good and bad news.
On the one hand, there may be softer variations on the American capitalist model that generate higher employment and stable prices without shredding the safety net. On the other, individual initiative is not so easily grafted onto old corporatist welfare states. "Shedding regulation might not get Europe where it needs to go," Mr. Krueger concludes.

HEADLINE: When Sex Is Just a Matter of Fact;
To High School Students, Free Condoms Seem Normal, Not Debatable

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
On some days, Kelly Bunkley, a prim 17-year-old, slips into the health-resource room at Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn, where she quietly asks for a free condom.
She says her visits to the room on the second floor, where condoms are kept locked in a file cabinet, give her a powerful weapon she can pass along to help a former schoolmate avoid AIDS. "I tell her that she has to be careful," said Kelly, a senior who just last year watched another friend, an energetic young man from her neighborhood in East New York, dying of AIDS in a hospital bed. "I tell her to wait." 
 At Murrow High School, where Kelly is among 4,100 students in a building that fills an entire city block, students have been getting free condoms since 1991. Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez started the program then throughout the system as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS, but it was so vigorously denounced by opponents as promoting adolescent promiscuity that it contributed to his ouster about two years later.
In fact, condoms and AIDS education have been the subjects of vociferous debate in New York and across the country, dividing parents and educators along philosophical, political and religious lines. Opponents' fears of increased promiscuity were countered by a recent publicized study by New York University researchers finding that free condoms did not increase sexual activity but did increase the use of condoms.
At Murrow High, though, there is virtually no rancor on the topic, students say. The general view among dozens of students interviewed was that it makes sense to deal with such matters in the place where they go every day to learn about life.
The students were in elementary school when Chancellor Fernandez first proposed the free condom program, and have never been in a high school without having access to free condoms. To some of them, the program is as normal as milk in the cafeteria, and about as likely to be the subject of debate. They say that such questions as whether the program contributes to promiscuity are misguided, and that the attitude behind the question fails to reflect the realities of high school life.
Free condoms are part of a broader high school program that includes six lessons of AIDS education each year. In contrast to the often sharp tones of adult advocates or critics of the program, the students at Murrow say it creates barely a ripple there.
Asked about the free condoms, Shauna Ling-Choung, a 16-year-old student, said: "We know it's there. We know how to get it. But we don't discuss it that often. It just doesn't come up."
On a recent afternoon at Murrow High, in a wide corridor where cliques of students gathered to flirt, read and kill time during free periods, Sabrina Mendola, a junior, described the school condom program as "a good thing." She would not say whether she was sexually active, but she did say she knew of at least four students who have obtained condoms through the program.
"They had no money, and if they didn't get condoms from school, they would have had unprotected sex," said Sabrina, a 16-year-old from Sheepshead Bay. "Thank God for the school's having it. It's a learning center. Where else are the kids going to learn if their parents don't talk to them?"
Shauna, sitting next to her, chimed in: "You can't prevent teen-agers from having sex, no matter what you preach." She said she could think of at least seven students who had requested condoms at school. "If students are having sex, they might as well do it the safe way," she said. "It's a way for schools to show that they actually care."
Murrow High, in Midwood in central Brooklyn, is regarded as one of the top public high schools in the city. It sends more than 90 percent of its graduates to college and draws students from across the borough to magnet courses in communications and drama. But the students are ordinary teen-agers, and the school population roughly reflects Brooklyn's racial, ethnic and economic composition.
There is a Russian club, a Middle Eastern culture club, a Jewish heritage club, two Chinese groups, a Korean club and an African Renaissance Coalition that includes blacks who are native-born, Caribbean and African. There are also groups for Roman Catholics, nonsmokers and gay and lesbian students.
Last week, in the bare asphalt courtyard of the school, where students play handball and a few roguish teen-agers sneak a smoke underneath the rumbling, elevated D train, a group of boys discussed condoms and sex. One teen-ager said he did not use condoms because they spoiled his pleasure. But Tony Romano, 17 and one of the handball crowd, said firmly that he had consistently used condoms in the two months he had been having sex. He doesn't use the ones they hand out at school, though, he said, because he heard a rumor that they are shoddy. (They are donated by the maker of Trojan condoms.)
"That's what people say; they're cheap and defective," Tony said, shrugging his shoulders. "But if schools want to do it, it doesn't bother me. Schools are like your mother. They take care of you. They teach you. They feed you. They are looking out after you."
Not far away from the discussion in the courtyard, Daniel Goldberger, 16 years old, stood with his own gaggle of friends, many of whom have a creative bent. He is preoccupied these days with after-school rehearsals for two plays, "Oliver" and "The Importance of Being Earnest."
Daniel said that he was a bit annoyed when students didn't seem to understand the consequences of unprotected sex, but that he didn't want to lecture them, ad nauseam, like a grown-up. His own uncle, a man in his early 30's, died of AIDS several years ago.
"I feel like when you have a family member or even a friend who has died, you tend to be more aware of the AIDS virus," said Daniel, who is a member of the school's H.I.V.-AIDS awareness club, which raises money for charity and does volunteer work in hospitals. "You're not as oblivious to it. You realize, like wow, it could happen to you."
Daniel said many students at Murrow High were curious about AIDS, but he said teen-agers seemed to think they are invincible until their own lives have been touched. His views echo the New York University study's finding that 91 percent of the city's high school students believe they are either "not at all likely" or "unlikely" to get H.I.V. in the next five years.
"It's not a reality for a lot of people," Daniel said. "We're still young. We're going through a lot of changes. Right now, we're still learning a lot of things."
When Murrow High formally opened in 1974, Saul Bruckner, who has been its principal since then, used an allusion to "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" when he compared his new school to a tree that would bear "healthy fruit." The other day, Mr. Bruckner said with a touch of exasperation that providing condoms to youths was not exactly what he had in mind. He admitted that he started the required condom program only grudgingly. He said he thought it bizarre that schools could hand out condoms but not Tylenol.
In the resource room, Room 285F, the drab beige walls are covered with AIDS awareness posters. Leaflets on subjects like the benefits of abstinence and H.I.V. prevention are neatly stacked. A schedule of the hours when specific teachers are available is posted outside the door.
Michelle Lieberman, an English teacher who received training through the Board of Education to become an H.I.V.-AIDS resource teacher, said she received from one to 10 condom requests in the one hour a week she staffs the room.
Unlike the students, Ms. Lieberman says she knows well that the program is troubling to many people. "It's extremely controversial," she said. "It's a hot topic right now because where does the school draw the line between being a social institution and an educational institution? But if we don't move toward becoming more of a social institution, we are going to lose our kids to various possible diseases and to pregnancy."
Students have to state their identification numbers in order to get condoms, and if their parents have refused permission, the teachers have to refuse them. Fewer than 2 percent of parents citywide exercise that option, according to the New York University study.
Ms. Lieberman said students were given three condoms and a slip of paper explaining how to use them. She occasionally gives demonstration lessons, using fingers, if students ask for them.
"I tell them to not use it more than once," she said.
In a class where students work on writing for the Scholastic Assessment Tests and college-level vocabulary, Jamie Smerina, a junior, said recently that many of her girlfriends in Bay Ridge became "un-virgins" between the ninth and 10th grades. Jamie said she had been upset to learn that a particularly close friend who lived down the block was one of them.
"We had this bond," she said. "We used to say, 'We're never going to do it.' I had to hear from somebody else that she did it. I confronted her and she said yes. She said she was pressured into it. I guess she was afraid to tell me. We don't talk anymore."
As a 16-year-old, Jamie said, pressure to have intercourse is intense, but she plans to abstain anyway. "My mother would beat the hell out of me," she said.
Jamie is not opposed to free condoms at school, but she has mixed feelings about the school's role. She said discussions about sexuality and condoms should start at home, not school. "For me, it's so strong at home," she said.

HEADLINE: Likely Cause of Yonkers Tanker Fire Was Pointed Out in '89

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: YONKERS, Oct. 15

 BODY:
The deadly inferno that closed one of the busiest highway links to New York City a week ago after a car hit a gasoline tanker appears to have been caused by a preventable problem pinpointed in 1989 by Federal transportation officials and warned of by the New York City Fire Department in 1994.
The problem occurs when small amounts of gasoline or other hazardous cargo sit in unprotected pipes tucked under the belly of tanker trucks, which carry more than 100 billion gallons of gasoline to service stations around the country each year. 
 In collisions, these pipes, which are used to fill and empty the tank, can break and release their contents -- even if the main tank is not punctured.
In 1989, the Transportation Department published a new regulation aimed at eliminating the problem in tankers hauling hazardous liquids. It proposed either protecting the pipes with metal shields or flushing the liquid. But the petroleum industry said the risk was too small to justify the cost of such measures for gasoline, and the Transportation Department granted an exemption.
A Brooklyn company has said it has a system that would flush the pipes at a cost of $2,500 per truck.
Fatal fires from such a release are rare, according to Federal transportation statistics. But that worst-case scenario appears to be what unfolded when a car struck the right side of a gasoline tanker in an underpass beneath the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway here, investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and the Yonkers Police Department said.
Kenneth Suydam, the lead investigator for the safety board, said that many tests must be run on the wreckage before final conclusions were drawn, and that other factors might have played a role. But the police and Federal officials said there were few other explanations for how an initial small fire, probably fed by the contents of the broken pipes on the truck's belly, grew into a destructive pillar of flame shortly after midnight last Thursday.
The driver of the car, Dr. Alessio Matera, died of burns and smoke inhalation, the Westchester County Medical Examiner said. The truck driver, Frank Gangone, tried to rescue Dr. Matera, but was driven back by rising flames, said Lieut. Thomas LaGala of the Yonkers police.
The highway remained closed today as workers prepared to install a temporary bridge to replace an overpass that buckled in the intense heat of the fire.
The crash and fire in Yonkers, and the possibility that the fire was preventable, renewed debate today over safety regulations for gasoline tankers.
William Feehan, the First Deputy Commissioner of the New York City Fire Department, said that the department had pressed the Federal Government for nearly a decade to keep its own, stricter standard for fuel trucks within New York City limits, but that the city was defeated in Federal Court, with the Federal rule taking precedence. "It's a very crowded urban area here," Mr. Feehan said. "We still think we know more about what's safe than the bureaucrats in Washington."
In 1994, the department sent a letter to Federico F. Pena, who was then Secretary of Transportation, warning that the design of the large gasoline tankers posed a serious fire risk.
Mr. Feehan said the Yonkers fire fortunately happened "in the middle of the night, under a bridge." He added, "That guy could've been delivering gasoline to a gas station on Avenue A and Second Street and turned over in Little Italy or something and the results would have been catastrophic."
Senior Transportation Department officials and representatives of the petroleum and trucking industries defended the existing standard, saying that more than 50,000 truckloads of gasoline move on American roads every day and that fewer than a dozen people die in incidents involving the tankers in a typical year.
The kind of incident that may have led to the blaze in Yonkers is even rarer, said Alan I. Roberts, the associate administrator for hazardous materials safety at the Research and Special Programs Administration, a branch of the Transportation Department.
"You're talking about tens of millions of trips made without facing this consequence," he said. "We're certainly not happy about it, but we need to take into account the costs of what we would do relative to the benefit."
For example, flushing the pipes would involve an extra few minutes for each delivery, adding considerably to the cost of transporting fuel, he said.
At the heart of the ongoing debate is the design of the long, cylindrical aluminum tankers that are a familiar sight on the roads. The tanker that caught fire, owned by Mystic Bulk Carriers Inc. of Astoria, Queens, is one of tens of thousands of similar vehicles.
Catastrophic accidents involving these rigs mainly occur when a tanker rolls over or strikes a barrier like a bridge abutment at high speed, according to Federal transportation statistics.
Even so, when the Department of Transportation was updating its regulations for tankers in 1989, hazardous materials experts at the agency's Research and Special Programs Administration identified the piping system on the underside as a vulnerable spot.
The vulnerability evolved in the early 1970's, after passage of the Clean Air Act ended the old industry practice of loading gasoline or other contents from the top of a tanker and emptying them from the bottom, according to Transportation Department documents. Ever since, tankers have been both loaded and unloaded through the same pipes leading from the bottom of the tank, to prevent the buildup and escape of polluting vapors.
In 1989, the Department of Transportation said that after a tanker was filled, up to 50 gallons of the loaded material often remained trapped in pipes tucked along the belly of the vehicle. In a collision, the unprotected pipes could break, releasing their contents. If the load was hazardous or flammable, this would create an "unnecessary risk" of fire or other calamity, transportation officials reported in the Federal Register.
The Transportation Department issued its rule, with the exemption for gasoline haulers.
Shortly afterward, under pressure from the petroleum industry and other businesses, the rule was further restricted so that it applied only to the most poisonous or corrosive substances carried in tankers, according to Transportation Department officials.
Donal Vierimaa, vice president for engineering at the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association, an industry group, said the shift in loading techniques that filled the pipes and created the potential problem also helped solve other problems. It cleaned the air, made loading safer for truckers by eliminating the need to climb on top of a 12-foot-tall tanker, and allowed fuel depots and gas stations to standardize their equipment, he said.
"It's a matter, like most things, of balancing the pros and cons," Mr. Vierimaa said.
Several years ago, a company in Brooklyn, Cargo Tank Concepts Ltd., demonstrated for the American Petroleum Institute a patented device that can flush the contents of a tanker's pipes up into the tank, eliminating the hazard at a cost of about $2,500 per truck, said Ron Andenmatten, the company's president. But once the Federal rule on the pipes was relaxed, there was little incentive to adopt the new technology, he said.
Over all, the petroleum industry has said it sees no need to spend money on a new system. Michael Shanahan, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, which represents several hundred petroleum companies, said that no alternatives had emerged that would make sense economically or would measurably cut risks in an industry that is already very safe.

GRAPHIC: Diagram: "Tankers: A Hidden Weakness"
The explosion of a gasoline tanker last Thursday under a Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway overpass in Yonkers may have been caused by spilled fuel from pipes that broke away from the tank at impact.
 
1. Before a full gasoline tanker has unloaded its cargo, up to 50 gallons of fuel can be trapped in the pipes connecting the tank to the fuel hoses.
 
2. In an accident, the pipes break off from the tank valve to prevent the fuel tank from rupturing and exploding. But this can allow trapped fuel inside the pipes to spill and ignite.
 
Diagram illustrates the weakness.

HEADLINE: On Russian-Iranian Oil Deal, U.S. Sanctions May Backfire

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
In the next few weeks the Clinton Administration will face the first test of its willingness to make good on a threat to punish foreign companies that invest in Iran.
But the State Department is not exactly leaping at the chance to teach a lesson to Russia's premier private company, Gazprom, for a $2 billion deal with French and Malaysian companies to pump natural gas off the Iranian coast. 
 Instead, officials are discovering anew that imposing sanctions on foreign companies that defy American policy -- in this case by doing business with a country that supports terrorism -- raises numerous unforeseeable problems.
The issue is not whether Washington can stop the investment in Iran. That is clearly beyond its reach. Instead, it is whether Gazprom should be allowed to raise $1 billion in world financial markets, including the United States, next month -- money that will go right into the company's coffers just as it is preparing to write the Iranians a fat check.
But stopping that deal threatens to unravel delicate negotiations with European allies over United States sanctions policy, and to interfere with Washington's efforts to stabilize the rickety Russian economy. And, to make matters worse, it could also mean going up against one of President Clinton's biggest financial supporters in last year's campaign: Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The Wall Street firm, whose former co-chairman is Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, is underwriting the Gazprom bond offering. The company fought long and hard to get Gazprom's business, and many European investment houses would dance with glee if Washington were to get in Goldman's way.
Even Stuart Eizenstat, the Undersecretary of State for economic affairs, concedes that if the United States tried to aim at Iran, the bullet would ricochet everywhere.
"This is a matter which has important implications for our policy to deter Iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction and supporting terrorism," he said today. But it quickly becomes enmeshed, he added, in "our broader relationship with our European allies, the Russian Government and the Government of Malaysia," to say nothing of the impact on Wall Street. The origins of the current diplomatic morass are relatively simple. When Conoco Inc. attempted to invest in an Iranian oil field two years ago, the Clinton Administration stepped in, issuing an order barring American companies from major investments in Iran as long as Teheran sponsored terrorism and was attempting to acquire nuclear weapons. Then France's Total swept in and signed the deal Conoco was forced to abandon.
The outrage in Congress over Total's action led to the passage last year of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act. Like the Helms-Burton Act, which is aimed at companies investing in Cuba, the law laid out sanctions that the President can impose against foreign firms that invest more than $20 million in Iran's oil and gas industries, its main source of revenue.
They range from minor punishments -- cutting off low-cost loans through the Government's Export-Import Bank -- to far nastier sanctions, including cutting off American bank loans exceeding $10 million, in an effort to make sure that companies flouting the investment ban in Iran do not raise their funds in America. Until now, the law has never been tested.
But two weeks ago, Total announced that it was teaming up with Gazprom and Malaysia's state-owned oil firm, Petronas, in the $2 billion project in Iran.
It was an important step: Iran's proven gas reserves represent about 15 percent of the world's total, second only to Russia's reserves.
"Clearly, this is a big test for us," one senior Administration official said recently. "If Total and its partners get away with it, every non-American energy firm on the globe is going to race in after them."
The Administration's reaction was deliberately muted. Mr. Eizenstat -- fully aware of the explosive nature of any sanctions threat in Europe -- said that the State Department would take time to "gather all the facts" on the gas deal.
Others hinted that sanctions might be waived if France and the other countries made other commitments to fight Iranian terrorism. A team of experts was sent to Paris, Moscow and Kuala Lumpur.
Meanwhile the Iranians declared that the gas field will earn them $450 billion over the next 30 years, and said that the contract with Total, the lead partner, went into effect Oct. 7.
The State Department's caution is understandable: If it acted quickly against any of the three firms, it would almost certainly sink the delicate negotiations with Europe over sanctions on companies that invest in Cuba. Today's deadline for those negotiations to conclude passed with no agreement.
But now the $1 billion bond offering seems likely to force the State Department's hand. The transaction is Gazprom's first venture into the world's capital markets with a major bond issue, though it has sold its stock on markets around the world and borrowed from Western banks.
Goldman says the $1 billion it is raising is for "general purposes," chiefly a major pipeline project already under way in Russia. But clearly, any cash the company can raise frees up money it can invest in Iran.
While Goldman will say nothing publicly about the debt offering, a company official said that "this is a very important deal for us," and that Goldman's lawyers believe that the bond offering does not violate the Iran-Libya sanctions act, which makes no specific mention of debt offerings.
"We are assuming it is not going to be an issue," the official said.
The author of the sanctions act, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, says he plans to make it an issue. To his mind, he said today through a spokesman, the law is intended to "prevent foreign firms that trade with Iran from obtaining funding in American financial markets."
"I will be holding hearings in the Senate Banking Committee on Gazprom's debt offering soon," said Mr. D'Amato, the committee chairman.
The political complications of this deal are not eased by the fact that Gazprom is hardly an ordinary company. Not only is it the most powerful corporation in Russia, it was once headed by Russia's Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. He and his family are thought to be major shareholders, but their exact role is a mystery. It did not help that Mr. Chernomyrdin apparently made no mention of the Iran investment last month when he met Vice President Al Gore in Moscow, in one of a series of discussions to promote Russia's conversion to a market economy.
Any step to interfere with Gazprom's access to world capital markets would constitute a major setback to American participation in that effort, and would undoubtedly anger the Prime Minister.
For its part, Gazprom has no intention of backing down. The company has said repeatedly that it would ignore American "threats" and declared that the financial losses incurred by breaking its deal with Iran "would be greater than those incurred by sanctions against us."
For Goldman, however, the controversy could be costly. Even if the United States did not attempt to block the debt offering, it could create enough uncertainties about possible sanctions that investors would be scared off -- meaning that the bond may have to be offered at a higher interest rate. Administration officials have made it clear they would not be upset by that outcome.
The bond will be convertible into American depository receipts, which would allow American investors to purchase the equiavlent of Gazprom stock.
The issue is also a delicate one for Mr. Rubin. In one other major issue involving Goldman, he recused himself. The sanctions question is primarily an issue for the State Department, but whenever a question of high finance and foreign policy rises to the White House, Mr. Rubin is usually central to the discussion.
Mr. Rubin's spokesman, Howard Schloss, noted today that while the Treasury Secretary still has a financial interest in Goldman, it is held in a blind trust. The trust is arranged so that Mr. Rubin can neither profit nor lose from changes in the value of his interest in the partnership, Mr. Schloss said.

GTE Joins Chase for MCI With $28 Billion Cash Bid
GTE added its name to the list -- it now stands at three -- of companies pursuing MCI in the richest takeover battle in American history, making an unsolicited offer of $28 billion in cash.
MCI, which already has an agreement to be acquired by British Telecom for $19 billion in cash and stock, and which is studying an all-stock offer of $30 billion from a smaller telecommunications company, Worldcom, said only that its board planned to meet again soon to weigh its options. Page A1. 

Sales Rose in September
Retail sales rose last month but the gain partly reflected higher automobile prices, Commerce Department figures showed. Though the increase was unexpected and sent inflationary chills through the securities markets, economists said it did not alter their view that the economy was decelerating. D4.
 
Treasury securities prices slipped on the report, and the prospect of new corporate issues, which compete with Treasuries for investors' money, also weighed on the market. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.39 percent from 6.35. D17.
 
Stock prices were pushed down by the rising interest rates and by weak demand for technology issues. The Dow industrials fell 38.31 points, to 8,057.98. D10.
 
Time Warner Cheers Investors
Time Warner reported strong gains in its third-quarter results, sending a message to investors that the company's core businesses were healthy and reassuring them that it had gotten religion and was rigorously monitoring its spending. In response, they sent Time Warner's stock up to an all-time high. Market Place. D10.
 
Sun Expands Microsoft Suit
Sun Microsystems made additional charges in its lawsuit against Microsoft over the Java programming language, and both sides, jockeying for position, made public the contract that they are disputing. D2.
 
Lucent to Add Networking Company
Lucent Technologies said that it would buy Livingston Enterprises for $650 million in stock, adding a new arm to its aggressive move into computer networking. D7.
 
Bre-X Suit Is Allowed to Proceed
A Canadian court permitted a shareholder lawsuit to proceed against officials of Bre-X Minerals to reclaim profits they made by selling shares before the company collapsed in a gold-discovery fraud earlier this year. D22.
 
Complications in Sanctions Threat
The State Department is not exactly leaping at the chance to seek sanctions against Gazprom of Russia over its plan to invest in Iran with French and Malaysian partners. Among other complications, doing so could mean going up against one of President Clinton's biggest financial supporters: Goldman, Sachs, which is underwriting a $1 billion bond offering by Gazprom. A1.
 
High Court Hears G.M. Case
In a product liability case against General Motors, the Supreme Court is exploring the question of whether the courts of one state must always honor judgments from another state, even when they conflict with the first state's laws. The question centers on an expert witness in the case, a former G.M. engineer who had testified against the company in similar situations in other states. A25.
 
A Big Competitor Unites Fishermen
Fishermen from Maine to New Jersey are protesting plans for a big new factory trawler to start looking for herring and mackerel. The issue has made its way to Congress, and the Senate, as the House already has, is expected to pass a measure that would place a moratorium on trawlers the size of the new one, the Atlantic Star.

President Pascal Lissouba of the Congo Republic was forced to flee from Brazzaville as forces loyal to a former Marxist dictator, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, marched into the city, backed by tanks and troops from Angola. Mr. Lissouba, who was elected in 1992, sought the help of other African countries but was outmaneuvered in the four-month civil war in the oil-rich country. A10
 
Denial From Sri Lankan Rebels
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam denied any involvement in the truck bomb that killed 18 people and injured more than 100 others, including seven Americans, in Colombo. But Sri Lankan officials and Western diplomats said the bomb, which ended a 15-month lull in a bombing campaign, bore "all the hallmarks" of past actions by the group, which seeks an independent state in the northern part of the country. A10
 
Former Vichy Officer Testifies

The center handles planes for New York's three major airports. A1
 
Crash Linked to Safety Problem
The traffic accident that closed one of the busiest highway links to New York City a week ago after a car hit a gasoline tanker appears to have been caused by unprotected external pipes on trucks, a problem pinpointed in 1989 by Federal transportation officials and warned of by the New York City Fire Department in 1994.

HEADLINE: WHAT ABOUT MISSISSIPPI?: A special report.;
Welfare Law Weighs Heavy In Delta, Where Jobs Are Few

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: GREENVILLE, Miss.

 BODY:
While President Clinton has flatly declared "the debate is over -- we know now that welfare reform works," the hard-luck counties of the Mississippi Delta show the difficulties that can emerge when tough laws collide with a weak economy.
The welfare rolls have fallen sharply across this 200-mile stretch of cotton fields and catfish farms, as they have in most of the country. But with unemployment rates hovering at 10 percent or more, many of those leaving the rolls are failing to find jobs. Indeed, during one recent period, the families dropped for violating the new work rules outnumbered those placed in jobs by a margin of nearly two to one. 
 And the penalties in Mississippi are the nation's toughest. Those who miss appointments or decline work assignments surrender not only their entire cash grant, but all their family's food stamps and the medical insurance of adults. Across the Delta, mothers dropped from the welfare rolls are now turning to relatives, boyfriends or other Federal programs -- most notably disability payments -- or traveling long distances in search of work.
Maggie Miller lost her benefits and moved in with her sister, raising the number of children in the two-bedroom house to 15. Patricia Watson worked a day at a distant catfish-processing plant but quit after returning home to discover that her baby-sitter could not find her 6-year-old daughter.
Curley Barron threw up her hands and returned her niece and nephew to foster care. Busy caring for her ailing mother, she refused to join a work program and therefore lost the $435 in cash and food stamps she was receiving for the children's monthly support.
It was scenarios like these in places like this that critics of last year's landmark law feared. The landmark measure ended a 61-year-old guarantee of Federal aid and transferred money and authority to the states. While some states might make good use of their autonomy, the critics said, said, others would prove unwilling or unable to construct safety nets of their own. Mindful of this state's many last-place rankings on socioeconomic scales, they summarized their fears with a frequent refrain: "What about Mississippi?"
The same could be asked of other states, particularly in the South, that combine high poverty rates with low spending. But the poverty here has historically run highest, and the spending levels lowest. Mississippi's Republican Governor, Kirk Fordice, is known for the vehemence of his anti-government views. And with black families making up more than 80 percent of the caseload, the welfare reductions inevitably remind critics of the state's difficult racial past.
For all its unique regional features, the Mississippi Delta -- the poorest region in the poorest state -- may offer broader lessons for the nation's great welfare experiment.
Though many states are boasting of early success in a robust economy, they could find themselves in related struggles should their job markets falter.
Mississippi officials blame the old system for letting joblessness and teen-age parenthood become a subculture's norm, especially in the Delta, and almost everyone agrees that the program needed to change. Officials here say the tough new rules now properly discourage those who do not really need the help.
And not all the state is down-in-the-mouth like the Delta. The Gulf Coast and Tupelo are booming, and the statewide unemployment rate has averaged just 5.6 percent this year, only slightly higher than the national rate of 5.3 percent.
Mississippi also boasts a bureaucratic advantage over other states, like Arkansas and Louisiana, that are trying to put the welfare poor to work in rural, depressed areas. Unlike its neighbors, Mississippi has run experimental programs for several years, accumulating what officials call a wealth of important lessons.
Even in the Delta some women say the new work rules gave them the push they needed to find employment. "I thought it was going to be hard, but it wasn't," said Felicia Fields, 22, the new receptionist at Cunningham's Insurance in Greenville, who landed her position after a few weeks in a job-search class.
Still, the difficulty of converting "work" from a slogan to a program is particularly evident in a region like this, where jobs and child care are scarce, education levels are low, distances are great, and public transportation does not exist. Though the new watchword is self-sufficiency, the region's plantation economy was originally built on the opposite premise. Hugely profitable to a handful of white planters, it rested on a subjugated army of black sharecroppers kept dependent by design.
A poverty belt this large would prove vexing under any circumstances. But Mississippi's program also receives the nation's smallest Federal investment. The annual Federal subsidy of about $2,100 per family is just over half the national average of $4,100. And it is less than a third of the $7,200 per family taken in by the nation's most heavily subsidized state, Wisconsin. That is because under the new Federal program, called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Federal subsidies are tied to past state spending levels, and Mississippi's have been the nation's lowest. The state offers a mother with two children just $120 a month.
Donald R. Taylor, executive director of the state's Department of Human Services, said the program has all the money it needs. The Federal grant, though less than what other states receive, actually represents a per capita increase over what Mississippi has received in the past.
Mr. Taylor said the real problem resides with "the old system, which told the poor, 'We know you're not capable of making it; here are a few crumbs.' " After decades of policy failure, he said, "the problems we have stem more from behavioral poverty than material poverty."
But he speaks more cautiously about the 11 Delta counties, which account for a quarter of the state's caseload. He warns that some of the 8,000 welfare families there may just have to move to places that have jobs. "If you've seen 'The Grapes of Wrath,' that's what it was all about," he said. "But you've got some people in rural Mississippi who are tied to the land, and I can understand their reluctance."
"That area's going to be our biggest problem," he said.
 
The Experiment
Starting Strong, Losing Steam
Mississippi began its welfare experiment in the fall of 1995, operating a trial program called Work First in six counties. The program, run with Federal permission, placed about 7,000 recipients in job-search classes. It offered substantial subsidies to businesses that hired them. And it withheld benefits from recipients who did not attend the classes or accept offers of employment.
About 42 percent of the participants found jobs. But only half of those -- or 21 percent of the total -- were still working after the program's 15th month. "The retention rate is a huge problem," said Bill Brister, a researcher at Millsaps College in Jackson, who evaluated the program.
Meanwhile, penalty rates were high. About 19 percent violated the rules and lost all cash and food stamps. (Most had their benefits restored within two months, after complying with the program's rules.) That is, almost as many people temporarily lost their benefits as landed and kept jobs.
And that ratio worsened as the program went on. That was especially the case in Greenville and surrounding Washington County, the only Delta county in the experiment. In the fifth quarter of the program, 72 families landed jobs, while 130 lost their benefits.
Larry Temple, the state official who ran the Work First program, attributed the fall-off to an autumn economic decline. "That's deer-hunting season -- nobody's hiring then," he said. But the flagging results could also suggest that the program, having placed the most job-ready clients, might not succeed with the more troubled clients still on the rolls.
Mr. Temple, who recently took a top job with the Texas welfare program, describes the Mississippi experiment as "wildly successful," especially in reducing caseloads. The rolls in the Work First counties fell 19 percent in the first year, compared with 6 percent in the rest of the state, and new applications in the Work First counties fell by a remarkable 65 percent.
Pointing to those numbers, Mr. Temple said the burden of meeting a work requirement leads people to explore other options.
"For the first time in many years, we're getting down to a legitimate caseload," he said.
But he also acknowledged that people who land jobs "are not staying on to the degree we'd like." To address that problem, Mississippi has no longer provides job-placement services itself but hires private companies through competitive bids. And it pays them their full fee only if a client stays at work for six months.
The experiment ended last year with the passage of the Federal law giving new authority to the states. Given Mississippi's political climate, its detractors feared the state would lead a "race to the bottom" characterized by dwindling support of the poor. Mr. Fordice's distrust of government programs seems pronounced even by Mississippi standards, and he has a penchant for the provocative move.
He staged an upset victory in 1991 in part by running a stark anti-welfare commercial. He once threatened to call out the National Guard if the United States Supreme Court ruled the state's universities were illegally segregated. And he wore a necktie bearing a confederate flag to a recent hearing on minority set-asides.
So far, though, the critics' fears have been only half-realized. Mr. Fordice has essentially adhered to the outline set by Work First: with few exceptions, recipients must spend 35 hours a week in a job-search class or a work program, or face the loss of all their benefits. That alone makes the program one of the nation's toughest. But sobered by some of the lessons from Work First, the state did not take several steps that could have made it tougher still.
With Mississippi's economy strong, for instance, officials did not reduce state spending as critics feared they would. And, significantly, they did not shorten the Federal time limit, which restricts most recipients to five years of lifetime aid.
In a 1995 interview, Mr. Fordice insisted that two years would be "the absolute outside limit" the state would allow. But Mr. Temple said the experiment showed, "you can't get to everybody in that short a period -- that was a great lesson learned."
 
The Delta
A Long History Of Difficult Times
When it comes to the Delta, the state may need all the time it can get. The region has been suffering high rates of joblessness for at least a half-century, since farm mechanization displaced many thousands of uneducated laborers. They escaped in droves to the industrial cities of the North, leaving behind a string of impoverished hamlets. The poverty rate of 41 percent is nearly three times the national average, and nine of the region's 11 counties rank among the nation's 50 poorest.
Frank Howell, a researcher at Mississippi State University, recently examined the job prospects of welfare recipients in the five-county area surrounding Greenville, the Delta's most populous town. He projected the development of one new job for every 254 families leaving the rolls. "There's just a very bleak economic outlook," Mr. Howell said.
Still the rolls have shrunk under the tough new rules. In Washington County, they have fallen 26 percent in the last year alone, despite an average unemployment rate of 9.7 percent. And the pattern holds true for the five contiguous counties, where the unemployment rate has averaged 13.2 percent but caseloads have fallen by a fifth.
Many of the jobs that do exist are distant and difficult. Of the 27 Greenville women placed in jobs last month, 10 went to a single catfish plant, Springwater Farms, in Eudora, Ark. To get there, recipients make an hour-long commute on a school bus that leaves Greenville at 6:30 each morning.
Arriving at the plant, they don hairnets, earplugs and steel-lined safety gloves to work along the clattering saws and conveyer belts that process 100,000 catfish a day. Noting that turnover runs more than 300 percent a year, Donald Taylor, the plant's comptroller, acknowledged the unappealing nature of the minimum-wage work. "You work in the cold, you work in the wet -- and of course you're around guts," he said.
But Mr. Taylor, who also hires welfare recipients from Arkansas and Louisiana, praised the Mississippi program for withholding benefits from those who quit. "If they can go back to Uncle Sam, you can't keep them in the plant," he said.
To raise the prospects of welfare clients, the state is offering deep subsidies to businesses. Employers pay just $1 an hour for the first six months, while the state provides $4.15 to bring clients up to the minimum wage. (The subsidy comes in part from money that would have gone toward welfare and food stamps.)
But the results have so far have proved disappointing. Of the 1,299 Work First clients in Washington County, only 61 got subsidized jobs and just 15 kept them -- about 1 percent of the caseload. Many employers remain reluctant to deal with welfare recipients, and with unemployment rates so high, they can afford to be choosy.
Kevin Cunningham was wary about hiring Felicia Fields even at $1 an hour. Mr. Cunningham is a gregarious Greenville insurance agent with a tie clip shaped like a golf club. "This could be stereotyping on my part," he said, but he worried her friends might say, "Hey, Felicia works up there at Cunningham's office -- she knows where the cash drawer is." And when Ms. Fields, who is black, arrived for work, Mr. Cunningham, who is white, said he warned her that "business language isn't Ebonics."
The comment points at the racial and class tensions that the work program must confront. Almost all the Delta's recipients are black, and most businesses are run by whites. In the case of Mr. Cunningham, he was reassured when he learned that Ms. Fields played the piano in church. And Ms. Fields said that working for Mr. Cunningham was "not as bad as dealing with the church people." The $190.46 she earns each week is more than twice the $309 package of welfare and food stamps she used to receive each month.
"And I can say I earned this money," she said.
 
The Penalties
Habits and Duties Collide With Rules
Ms. Fields represents one of the region's easier cases: she has a high school diploma, just one child and a mother willing to baby-sit. Maggie Miller had eight children by six men, no diploma, no work history and no interest in the work program. She lost her check and moved in with her sister, Debbie, who is unmarried, pregnant and has seven children of her own.
Now Debbie Miller, 37, supports the combined family with $324 in food stamps, $484 in Supplemental Security Income for a disabled daughter, and $744 in Social Security benefits for two sons whose father has died. Plus, she added, "I got a man -- somebody's helping me with the kids."
Barbara Petty, another difficult client, took a more promising step. Notorious in the Greenville office for her disdain for the work program, Ms. Petty, 34, buried her caseworker with medical excuses and complaints, and even appealed to her congressman. Finally, she just gave up, and surrendered the $96 she received each month for one of her children.
"It was just too much hassle to go through," Ms. Petty said, especially when her two other children received a total of $968 a month in supplemental security payments.
But then Ms. Petty did something that surprised even herself: she got a job, providing adult day care to an ailing man. "I wasn't looking for a job," she said. "But with all those hassles with the welfare, I started asking people, 'Do you need any help?' "
Mr. Temple, the former Mississippi official, points to cases like Ms. Petty's in arguing that the penalties are a key to making the program work. "They are tough," he said. "But they are for people who are absolutely refusing to go to work to feed their children."
But circumstances often fall into a gray zone. The attempt to work can sometimes conflict with the attempt to be a good parent, especially for single mothers traveling long distances with uncertain child care and transportation. The state is promising to reimburse recipients for their child care expenses. But many women still find baby-sitters unavailable or undependable during the hours they need.
Among those referred to the Springwater catfish plant was Patricia Watson, a 34-year-old divorced woman who adopted her niece, Jasmine, at birth. Since Ms. Watson had to catch the 6:30 bus, she entrusted a teen-age relative to take 6-year-old Jasmine to school and watch her afterward. When Ms. Watson returned late in the afternoon, the teen-ager had not even realized the child was missing. "I was scared to death," Ms. Watson said. "I said, 'Oh, Lord, somebody's walked off with my baby!' "
Ms. Watson began a house-by-house search, and discovered her daughter a half-hour later, playing with a friend down the block. She quit the plant, lost her welfare benefits and is relying on her mother for now.
A lost check brought more immediate upheaval to the family of Curley Barron. She was already caring for a mother with emphysema and a brother with a rare bone disease when she took in her brother's two children last year. The children -- James, 9, and Joel, 7 -- had been placed in foster care after their mother developed a drug habit.
Ms. Barron, 44, began receiving $435 in cash and food stamps for the children's support. She was incensed when she received a notice last spring saying she would have to perform 35 hours a week of community service to maintain her benefits. "The kids were a ward of the state -- they weren't mine," she said. "So I don't feel like I should have to go out and work for free, just for food stamps." Plus, Ms. Barron said, "I'm not going to neglect my mother."
Saying she could not support the children without the state aid, Ms. Barron returned them to foster care, where they are costing the state $510 a month -- more than the cash and food stamps Ms. Barron received. She cannot qualify for payments as a foster parent unless she completes a licensing course. "It doesn't make any sense at all," she said. "I'm going to take care of them better than some stranger."
 
The Outlook
In One Small Town, Future Holds Little
Pessimism about the Delta's prospects runs especially deep in Glendora, 90 minutes east of Greenville. The town made a cameo appearance in civil rights history as the place where a black teen-ager, Emmett Till, was beaten in 1955 after he was accused of whistling at a white woman. He was then killed, and his body was thrown in the Tallahatchie River.
"Not much has changed, except for the worse," grumbles the mayor, Johnny Thomas, speaking of the town's shrinking economy. Of the town's 88 households, Mr. Thomas speculates that all but three receive public assistance at some time of the year. Industry is all but nonexistent in Tallahatchie County, and the nearest place hiring is a poultry plant in Water Valley, about 70 miles away. Even by the standards of the region, "Tallahatchie's a challenge," said Jean-Marie Hill, who runs the state's job-placement program in the Delta. Mr. Thomas's main hope for the town now resides with a quixotic plan to build a plant that would slaughter and process goats.
On a recent afternoon, he assembled a half-dozen residents who had lost their benefits after declining work assignments in distant towns. One had moved in with a boyfriend. Another was getting food packages from a private agency. A third was living on her children's disability checks, after turning down a night job in a neighboring county.
Among those dropped from the rolls this year was Carrie Ann Bridges, a 26-year-old mother of four. "She had been cut off cause she wasn't working," said her father, Elijah Bridges. "She had to get a job." She found one on the second shift at the Water Valley plant, sharing the round-trip drive of three hours with her aunt, Geneva Bridges. The two were driving home after midnight in July when Carrie Ann fell asleep and drove into a ditch, killing them both.
Accidents happen everywhere, of course. But the long, late-night commute highlights the added challenges that work programs face in a region starved for jobs. Mr. Bridges now receives $72 each in Social Security payments for his daughter's four children, whose ages range from 11 to 1. A genial man who supports himself with seasonal work at a cotton gin, Mr. Bridges agreed the old welfare system needed to change. But he also warned, "some people really need the help."

At a news conference at City Hall, about the importance of the tax cuts approved during his tenure. 
 "We have changed the agenda of the city, and it is not the only reason, but it is one of the reasons why the city is going through an economic recovery and revival, and it is one of the reasons why we have been able to take the loss of 320,000 jobs under Dinkins and replace it with a gain of 170,000. But there is a long way to go. We have only made up for some of the enormous damage done during the Dinkins administration to the job base of the city."
 
RUTH W. MESSINGER
At a rally last night with the Rev. Al Sharpton at the Guy R. Brewer Democratic Club in St. Albans, Queens.
"I want to thank Al Sharpton for the issues that he raised during the campaign. Now he has raised lots of issues as an activist and advocate and public speaker and as a minister over 20 years. But in this Democratic primary campaign, Reverend Sharpton talked over and over again about the importance of jobs, about the need to pay attention to our young people and about the challenge that this city faces in ending police brutality. And he was over and over again on those issues, in our forums and in our debates, eloquent and passionate. I also want to thank him for the way in which he conducted himself during this primary campaign. It was because of the conduct of that campaign, because of our joint refusal to start picking fights with each other, that we are able to create a unified Democratic Party."

Finance Deal Luring Company to Bronx

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In a small victory in New York City's efforts to stem the decline of manufacturing jobs, a food processing company that fled Queens for New Jersey in 1993 is expected to accept a package of financial incentives to move back to the city, this time to the Bronx.
The company, the Paradise Products Corporation, which processes olives, cherries and other specialty foods, is to meet today with the city's Industrial Development Authority to complete an agreement in which Paradise would receive $5.6 million in tax-exempt financing to buy a large warehouse in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx and convert it to a processing plant. 
 The company, based in Hawthorne, N.J., would complete the renovation and move all its 45 employees to the Bronx plant sometime next year, according to Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Commission. The company would be required to hire at least 60 more workers in the Bronx over the next three years.
David Lax, the company's founder and chief executive officer, said yesterday that Paradise had moved to New Jersey because it had outgrown its plant in Jamaica, Queens, and wanted a site in an area with less crime. The company's growth forced it to seek an even larger plant over the last year, he said. It chose the Bronx because of its access to rail connections and interstate highways, and improvements in security that have accompanied the city's lower crime rate, Mr. Lax said.

HEADLINE: Messinger And Sharpton Show Warmth At a Rally

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Ruth W. Messinger and the Rev. Al Sharpton campaigned together enthusiastically last night at a rally at a Democratic clubhouse in Queens. Mr. Sharpton gave Ms. Messinger a rousing endorsement and she praised him in return, saying that because of Mr. Sharpton, "We are able to create a unified Democratic party."
In contrast to their rather stiff appearances together at two churches in Manhattan and Queens on Sunday, during which Mr. Sharpton seemed to measure his remarks even as he was endorsing Ms. Messinger, the former competitors for the Democratic mayoral nomination showed only warmth toward each other last night. 
 They also loudly voiced their disdain for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican, much as they had done during their primary debates when they directed attacks at the incumbent instead of one another. But Mr. Sharpton went further, saying at one point, "It's not just voting against Giuliani; it's voting for someone."
Ms. Messinger and Mr. Sharpton arrived separately at the rally at the Guy R. Brewer United Democratic Club in St. Albans. But they entered the hall together, and Mr. Sharpton, in a gesture of courtesy, extended an arm directing Ms. Messinger to walk ahead of him down an aisle to their seats next to each other on the dais.
Mr. Sharpton, called on by City Councilman Archie Spigner, a leader of the club, to introduce Ms. Messinger, quickly began an angry attack on Democrats who had defected to support Mr. Giuliani. One such Democrat, Representative Floyd H. Flake, who was not at the rally, has an office across from the Brewer Club on Linden Boulevard.
"It is a serious matter to me," Mr. Sharpton said, "when we are faced with the last municipal election of the century and there are those in certain pockets of this city that for personal reasons and, in my judgment, personal gain have decided to abandon the principles that we have fought for all of this century. This is not just about party or race. This is about what you believe in and this about who you are. Who you support and what you support defines who you are."
Mr. Sharpton again rejected suggestions that his endorsement of Ms. Messinger on Sunday had been half-hearted. "They said, 'Well, why don't you all come down the aisle of the church together?' I said, 'We are forming a political alliance; we are not getting married.' "
After the rally, Mr. Sharpton said that he had waited until last night to expound on his support for Ms. Messinger's candidacy because "it would have been a mockery of the church," adding that, "If I had done that Sunday, others would have said I am politicizing the pulpit."
While Ms. Messinger needs the backing of Mr. Sharpton's supporters, she has faced questions from Jewish voters about her ties to him. At a Jewish forum on Monday, she defended her unwillingness to denounce Mr. Sharpton, who has been accused of straining relations between blacks and Jews.
Mr. Sharpton used the rally last night to offer his strongest words yet in support of Ms. Messinger. "For 20 years, Ruth Messinger has been consistent on issues that are important," he said. He also pledged to campaign for her, beginning Monday, at "two subway stops a day."
He closed saying: "I grew up in a single-parent home, so I know when we would get in trouble we'd go to our mother, because sometimes, the woman, the mother was all we had. This city is in trouble. We look to a mother, a grandmother who will be the first woman Mayor of the City of New York."
Ms. Messinger, clearly energized by Mr. Sharpton's address, gave a lively version of her stump speech, pushing education as her top priority. She also talked about reducing unemployment and fighting police brutality. Her remarks, too, were met with loud applause.
Outside, Mr. Sharpton responded coyly when asked whether he would run for Congress against Representative Edolphus Towns of Brooklyn, one of the Democrats who endorsed Mr. Giuliani. At first, he pretended not to hear the question, then said, "Well, I do live in that district."
Before leaving, Mr. Sharpton poked his head in Ms. Messinger's van and told her, "I don't want them to say that I didn't say good night."

HEADLINE: Mercedes-Benz Grows By Adding Smallness

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: STUTTGART, Germany

 BODY:
THE three-pointed star of Daimler-Benz stood for land, air and sea when it was introduced in 1909, a symbol of the German company's interests in cars, planes and ships. Since then, it has become an emblem for other things: riches, refinement, reliability and the steep price tag on a secondhand Mercedes. Of course, the star has adorned taxis and trucks as well as the contemporary conveyances of popes, kings, playboys and Balkan strongmen. But a belching Mercedes cab in Istanbul never impinged much on the image. Mercedes is to cars what Cartier is to jewelry.
So, standing beneath the steep, vine-clad hills that surround this southern German town, in the midst of the sprawling Mercedes headquarters, it is a surprise to see several small, squat, wedge-shaped vehicles nosing around with the famous star emblazoned on their grills. 
 The first impression is of a bad joke, an insidious Fiat- or Renault-led invasion of high-class motoring's inner sanctum. The upstart is short -- almost two feet less than a subcompact; it stands oddly, high off the road, because it is based on a new engineeering concept -- passengers on top, the works underneath. And its color schemes and idiot-proof, minimalist dashboard are painfully trendy. The vehicle has strong claims to originality but stands squarely at the antipode of Mercedes elegance. Viewed from almost any angle, it is graceless.
This little machine with the chutzpah to call itself a Mercedes is the new A-Class, which the company is introducing this year only in Europe. It appears to break new and perhaps treacherous ground in the leveraging of trademarks by doing something akin to attaching a Jaguar emblem to a Mini. "The car is quite unnecessarily ugly," said Chris Will, an auto analyst at Lehman Brothers in London. "If you, as a man, drove down a trendy London street, say the King's Road, in an A-Class, don't you think people would laugh at you?"
Mercedes is ready to take that risk. Indeed, risk taking has abruptly become the preferred approach of the most buttoned-down of auto makers. In the last five years, Mercedes has embarked on a startling diversification of both its range and image that has led it to forsake the shibboleth of "made in Germany" and the well-trodden ground of luxury sedans.
It has built factories in America and Brazil; produced a new sport utility vehicle, the M-Class, at its $300 million Alabama plant; replaced the 16-year-old rectangular headlight housings on its classic E-Class with four protuberant oval eyes that give the model a new edge; introduced an uncompromisingly sporty SLK roadster with a retractable hard roof; readied a new two-seater "smart car" for the harried urban commuter who wants low gas consumption and easy parking and, not least, invented the A-Class. All this for an investment conservatively estimated at $10 billion.
"Lexus and Infiniti taught us a tough lesson in the early 1990's," said Jurgen Hubbert, the head of the passenger-car division and a member of the board of Daimler-Benz. "A lesson in value-for-money and not resting on your laurels. We saw that if we went on as before, we'd soon be dead, the next Rolls-Royce. So we decided to defend ourselves by going on the offensive."
That offensive rested on a simple analysis. Mercedes was focusing almost exclusively on the premium-car segment, which was stagnating, increasingly contested by newcomers like Lexus and, in the United States, shifting rapidly toward sport utility vehicles. Mercedes was thus confined to about 8 percent of the 40-million-car world market -- the part that starts with a global price tag of $25,000 -- even as it offered cars that new tastes and Japanese competitiveness challenged. Moreover, the company was building its cars in a single country, Germany, whose labor costs are still among the highest in the world.
The shake-up that Mr. Hubbert pushed through involved the classic turnaround methods of cost cutting and job reductions. Mercedes now produces 645,000 cars a year with 80,000 employees, compared with 581,000 cars in 1991 using 100,000 employees. But the changes went much further.
They involved a shift in culture: accepting the notion that Mercedes had to widen its client base by building small cars for the first time, taking on the American "sport ute" challenge and making automobiles outside Germany that conformed to the legendary Mercedes standards. The simultaneous emergence onto the market this fall of the M-Class, built in rural Vance, Ala., and the A-Class, built in Germany but soon to be manufactured in Brazil, is a measure of how far the company has traveled.
To illustrate the change in culture, Mr. Hubbert went to his closet, pulled out a green sweatshirt with his name, Jurgen, printed on it and held it over his impeccable double-breasted suit. He keeps the sweatshirt in the closet, he explained, so he doesn't forget it when he goes to Alabama.
At the American factory, which produced its first M-Class vehicle in February, the dress codes and formal divisions between management levels that characterize German business are anathema. When in Vance, Mr. Hubbert eases out of his suits and cruises the factory in his sweatshirt.
"Of course, if I went around in this thing here, people would think I'm crazy," he said. "But we've tried to bring some of the American management culture to Germany, the sense that we are all in this together, that we all have the responsibility of bringing the company to a strong position with the right products and the right productivity." So, the Stuttgart plant's three canteens -- one for workers, one for middle management and one for top management -- were replaced by a self-service cafeteria for everyone.
In Alabama, the careful selection of a mixed German-American management team, the training of many new employees in Stuttgart and the painstaking inculcation of Mercedes values have so far produced a surprising harmony. Mercedes has found it likes the freewheeling culture. Approval of the plant by the state's Governor, James E. Folsom Jr., took five months in 1993, whereas a similar project might have taken years to get going in Germany's tightly regulated environment. Detroit is not about to move south, but a cottage industry of suppliers has already brought something new to deepest Dixie.
The made-in-America Mercedes M-Class "all-activity vehicle" went on sale last month for about $35,000. For now, production capacity is about 70,000 vehicles annually -- of which about 40 percent will be exported to Europe -- and demand is already overwhelming.
WHERE the design of the A-Class is at best controversial, that of the M-Class is strong and sleek, neatly combining understated elegance with the off-road machismo that even the most staid buyers seem to want in their sport utilities. An economical V6 engine, a spacious interior, an innovative traction-control system that brings power to the right place when one or several wheels are spinning and that relatively low price tag plus the Mercedes star all seem to insure that market winners like the Ford Explorer and the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited get a run for their money.
The Mercedes revolution has so far produced generally favorable results. Helped by its productivity gains and recently by a stronger dollar, which means its German-produced cars are cheaper in America, Mercedes has responded successfully to the Japanese challenge. While Lexus and Infiniti sales fell last year in the United States, Mercedes increased its American sales in 1996 to 90,844 from 76,752 in 1995.
Like Audi and its archrival BMW, referred to in Stuttgart only as "our competition in Munich," Mercedes has successfully given German engineering and styling a new competitive edge, while the cachet of Japanese luxury cars has faded. John Lawson, an auto analyst at Salomon Brothers in London, expects Mercedes to show an operating profit of about $1.9 billion this year, compared with $1.5 billion in 1996. The crisis that prompted the upheaval at Mercedes already seems fairly distant.
Still, the true test lies ahead. In essence, Mercedes has made a bet that, even over time, its image will not be compromised by the presence of the three-pointed star on a subcompact car and the introduction of production operations throughout the world. BMW has responded very differently to the same challenges Mercedes faced, and some analysts prefer its approach. By buying the Rover Group of Britain in 1994, BMW acquired the most famous of all sport utilities, the Land Rover, and perhaps the strongest trademark for a subcompact car, the Mini.
"BMW has widened its footprint in the car market, but without sullying its principal brand," said Mr. Will of Lehman Brothers. "The risk for Mercedes is that they're going to have some guy with his S-Class waiting for service behind a student with an A-Class. That's not going to make the S-Class clientele very happy."
The initial response to the A-Class has, however, been enthusiastic. Mercedes has already received 70,000 orders for the car, and the clients are mostly new ones -- only 20 percent currently own a Mercedes -- suggesting that the company may lure a new generation of buyers.
Mercedes has successfully marketed the car's new "sandwich-floor concept" -- a space-saving and safety-enhancing device that puts a lot of parts in a "basement" of the body. As a result, the engine is not pushed into the interior in the event of a front-end crash, but slides back into the chamber beneath the interior's floor.
As small as it appears, the car's interior is only four millimeters shorter than that of the C-Class (once known as the Baby Benz). It also has 72 different seat variations. Such features have allowed Mercedes to boast that the A-Class is a city car, a family car, a station wagon and a mini-van rolled into one. Priced at about $17,000 for the basic model, the A-Class is only marginally more expensive than the Volkswagen Golf. Hedging its bets, as it has with the M-Class, Mercedes plans to produce only about 200,000 units a year.
BUT the question remains: Does the initial wave of buyers represent a mad, ephemeral rush by people who haven't been able to afford a Mercedes until now? Or will the A-Class, as Mr. Hubbert insists, "prove itself a true Mercedes for its comfort and its driveability" that the company may eventually bring to the American market?
Those questions may take several years to answer. What is clear now is that the Mercedes subcompact is a strange creation. Its doors give a nice Mercedes-like thunk, and the ease with which the seats fold or are removed is remarkable. The car's engineers are obviously fiendishly ingenious. To drive it, however, is to feel perched in the midst of a raised fishbowl, one that accelerates niftily and holds the road well, but whose claim to that three-pointed star on the grill seems more than a little tenuous.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 17, 1997, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, an article in the special Cars section yesterday about Mercedes-Benz omitted a final passage. The last sentence, about the maker's subcompact, should have read: "To drive it, however, is to feel perched in the midst of a raised fishbowl, one that accelerates niftily and holds the road well, but whose claim to that three-pointed star on the grille seems more than a little tenuous."

HEADLINE: Few Buy Autos on the Web, but Many Start Their Research There

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
WHEN Rod Bowles and his wife, Mary Terwiske, of New Market, N.H., decided it was time to replace their 1982 Pontiac Bonneville station wagon with 140,000 miles, they sat right down and logged onto the Internet.
"We used the Internet to research our car purchase because we lead busy lives," Mr. Bowles said. "It allowed us the freedom to do our research at our convenience, often at night. We found lots of objective and subjective information available at our pace and in the privacy of our home. We shopped price and product of all vehicles and models." 
 It also allowed him to avoid what Mr. Bowles called "the hype of a dealership." Those same reasons apply to many of the 1.5 million new-vehicle buyers who will use car-shopping services on the Internet to help them select a car this year.
Only a small number of buyers are actually purchasing cars on the Internet, but many more are using the resources available to Web browsers who want to arrive at a car lot feeling well informed. They have plenty of places to search: more than 200 sites with automotive information already exist, and the number is increasing rapidly.
According to Jon Osborn, the manager of auto sales research at J. D. Power & Associates, the market research firm, the percentage of new-vehicle buyers turning to sources other than dealers for shopping assistance has jumped from 11 percent to more than 20 percent over a year, largely because of that surge in Web services.
"This is just the beginning of vehicle shopping outside the showroom," Mr. Osborn said.
Mr. Bowles and Ms. Terwiske were not sure what model they wanted to buy when they began their search. Mr. Bowles entered the Internet via America Online's automotive service, which gave him free access to Car and Driver buyer's guide. It provides information on hundreds of new cars and trucks, rates them and identifies the best models in categories, like highest fuel economy, most interior space, lowest price.
In addition, the buyer's guide showed which vehicles were basically the same, but sold under different names. For instance, Mr. Bowles learned that the Chrysler Town and Country mini-van is the same as the Dodge Caravan, just more expensive.
Mr. Bowles also chatted with owners of other vehicles through cybermessage boards, like Car and Driver's, for "emotional" information -- what people liked and didn't like about the cars.
The Bowles family ultimately selected the Mercury Villager, which is virtually identical to the Nissan Quest, because it met their needs for passenger and cargo capacity. They also liked the fact that while it was designed and engineered by Nissan, it was built by Ford in the United States.
At the other end of the country in Seattle, George Eng used the Internet to find a replacement for his 1991 Ford Taurus with 157,000 miles.
PASSING BY a used-car lot one evening, Mr. Eng spotted a car he didn't recognize, a Mitsubishi Galant. He liked what he saw, but didn't know anything about the car. So he logged onto the Internet and began gathering information, specifically what price he should pay based on the car's features and mileage and condition, all material from the on-line used-car price guides. He posted bulletins on message boards asking Galant owners what they liked and didn't like about their cars, how much they paid for them, what kind of maintenance they had required and if they preferred the four- or six-cylinder version.
"I was deluged with responses," he said, "and people were fairly honest."
He was less fortunate in researching what price his Ford Taurus should bring as a trade-in. He collected prices from the on-line used-car price guides, but when he went to the dealerships the prices they offered were far lower. The dealers told him they didn't use the price guides. "It was a waste," he said, "but it gave me a base to work with."
There are other problems for Internet car shoppers, starting with the quality and accessibility of Web sites, which run the gamut from poor and slow to excellent. And Mr. Eng discovered that on some sites, retail car dealers are posing as wholesalers.
Indeed, the Internet is proving to be a good place for dealers to lure customers. A survey by the National Automobile Dealers Association, the industry trade group in McLean, Va., representing more than 20,000 car dealers nationwide, showed 30 percent of all dealerships report an average of 43 sales leads a month from the Internet, a new source of potential buyers. But some of the unsavory practices that can occur in the showrooms -- bait and switch, for instance -- are turning up in cyberspace as well.
Although the number of people buying cars via the computer remains low, a growing number of buying services are offering on-line financing. Typically, buying services are aligned with a limited number of dealers who pay a subscription fee and list their inventory. If shoppers are interested, they can obtain price information from the dealer by submitting an electronic request. They ultimately make the deal and take delivery of the car at a dealership.
ANALYSTS say this reflects the problems of on-line commerce in general, which has yet to overcome consumer hesitations over security and other issues. And some car shoppers doubt that a middleman -- the buying service -- can provide the best price.
Men are more apt to buy on the Internet than women, who typically do more on-line research, but only as preparation for the traditional trip to the dealer.
Mr. Bowles tapped into one of the largest buying services, Autovantage, a division of CUC International, a membership-based consumer services company in Stamford, Conn. After he paid the $50 search fee, the service found the Mercury Villager he wanted, but it was at a Massachusetts dealership, far from his New Hampshire home. Mr. Bowles ended up finding the same model at a better price on his own at a dealership nearby in Portsmouth, N.H.
So, for all its advantages, Mr. Bowles concluded, the Internet is no panacea.
"You still have to go to the dealership to touch the car and drive it," he said.

HEADLINE: Milestones and Potholes on a Well-Traveled Road

 BODY:
Today, there are $60,000 off-road vehicles that never leave the pavement, pop-up cup holders and eight-way power seats with electric lumbar supports. Japanese cars are made in Kentucky; German trucks are built in Alabama, and American vehicles are assembled in Mexico. But before there were hideaway headlamps, tailfins and push-button transmissions, before even the electric starter, there were mechanically inclined folks who tinkered with motors and gears in out-of-the-way barns. Few died rich and fewer left their names to posterity in chrome script on trunk lids. Here are some highlights, lowlights and sidelights - by no means a comprehensive history - of what they have wrought.
 
1769

1771
The first motor accident occurs when Cugnot's second steam truck hits a wall at the Paris Arsenal. Excessive speed was not the cause.

New York City requires owners to display their initials on their cars. These first license plates are usually metal letters affixed to leather pads. Two years later, Massachusetts issues the first state plates.
 
1897
Ransom E. Olds forms the Olds Motor Vehicle Company in Lansing, Mich. Four years later, the Oldsmobile Curved Dash Runabout makes its debut; the price, $650. With 425 produced, the gasoline-powered Curved Dash proves the feasibility of mass-producing simple cars.
 
1896
Henry Ford hits the road in his Quadricycle, a modified horse buggy steered with a tiller and initially lacking brakes. Ford has to demolish part of his rented shop to get the contraption out, and it breaks down a few blocks away, to the amusement of passersby.
