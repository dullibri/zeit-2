HEADLINE: A Setback For Albany: Agency Cuts Credit Rating

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 6

 BODY:
Three weeks after the Legislature adopted a budget that political leaders insisted was sound, a major credit agency, Moody's Investors Services, dealt the state a stinging setback today, lowering its long-term credit rating one notch.
The action comes two and half months after another major rating agency, Standard & Poor's, dropped the rating two notches. Both agencies now give New York roughly equivalent ratings. They are the lowest in the state's history and the third-lowest in the nation. Only Massachusetts and Louisiana have lower ratings. 
Moody's downgrading raises fresh questions about the solidity of the state's finances. The state has been in financial turmoil for so long that the new rating is not expected to have much effect on borrowing costs or marketing bonds. The state already has to pay more to borrow money than most other states because it is considered a poorer credit risk.
 
Holding Off Judgment
Moody's announced that it was lowering the rating late in the day, after the financial markets had closed. The agency dropped the rating, from A1, the fourth highest, to A, fifth highest.
Throughout the weeks of wrangling that resulted in the latest budget in state history last month, Moody's declined to act on the rating, saying that it wanted to review a completed financial plan before passing judgment.
Standard & Poor's, in contrast, early on lost faith in the ability of state leaders to produce a balanced budget and reduced the rating even before the April 1 budget deadline. Today, Standard & Poor's reaffirmed the rating it gave in March, an A, its sixth highest. The agency is not expected to re-evaluate the rating for at least several months.
In announcing its revision, Moody's noted that although the budget enacted last month appears balanced, it relied on many new taxes whose revenues ''have proven difficult to predict.'' The agency said an economic slowdown that was evident throughout the region was ''particularly apparent in New York, where employment growth has been static, and wage and personal-income growth has slipped,'' raising additional risks.
Although the state deficit last year ''was due to inaccurate estimates of the effects of tax reform,'' Moody's said, ''the revenue shortfall in fiscal 1990 was more fundamental, as it was due principally to economic weakness.''
The agency also pointed to an increasing reliance on one-shot revenues like reserve funds and debt refinancings as a weakness in the state's financial plan. ''Many of the one-time actions are questionable,'' the agency said in a statement, and only result in putting off debt-service payments.
The managing director of state ratings for Moody's, George Leung, said the downgrading was not ''that major,'' but rather represented ''an adjustment.'' He noted that Moody's has not rated New York as particularly creditworthy since 1975, when it reduced the rating from Aa to A1.
State Budget Director Dall W. Forsythe played down the significance of the lower rating, saying it was not unexpected. Repeating the Cuomo administration's refrain that New York's economic problems are part of a regional trend, Mr. Forsythe said, ''other state have been downgraded, and likely more will be.''
State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, who approved the budget last week, stressed that Moody's had not called the budget out of balance. ''There is no doubt, though,'' he said, ''that the existence of a serious structural deficit and gloomy outlook for next year have caused the low long-term ratings.''
 
Estimates of Falling Revenues
The bad news today about the budget is in keeping with the tenor of the financial news that has been emanating from here for two years. Every few months, the administration has announced that revenues are falling short of expectations and that the state will have to borrow additional money.
In budget talks this year, the administration's estimates of revenue fell almost $2 billion over four months. By the time the $50 billion budget was adopted last mnth, seven weeks late, it called for the largest tax increase in state history.
Moody's lowered the credit rating one day before the state's planned sale of $4.1 billion of short-term notes for its annual spring borrowing. The spring borrowing, which has enabled the state to carry a long-term deficit of almost $5 billion, is scheduled to be phased out over the next few years under an agreement reached by state leaders last month.
Besides lowering the rating on the long-term bonds, Moody's also reduced the rating on the short-term notes, from MIG-1, the highest available, to MIG-2, the second highest. The agency had provisionally reduced the short-term rating three months ago.

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTIONS;
Bradley Wins New Jersey Primary

 BODY:
Senator Bill Bradley, who won an easy victory in the New Jersey Democratic primary in his bid for a third term, will face a little-known Republican candidate, Christine Todd Whitman, in the November general election.
Mr. Bradley defeated Daniel Seyler, 35, an unemployed marketing manager, to face Ms. Whitman, 43, a former president of the State Board of Public Utilities, who ran unopposed.
Ms. Whitman, a member of one of New Jersey's most prominent Republican families, is seen as having little chance against the popular Senator. But Republicans recruited her with hopes she could diminish his aura as a Presidential contender. 
Other major races were in the First Congressional District, which was served by Jim Florio for 16 years before he became governor, and the 12th Congressional District seat being vacated after 12 years by Representative James Courter, the Republican who opposed Mr. Florio last year.
In the 12th District, State Senator Richard A. Zimmer, 45, won the Republican nomination for Mr. Courter's congressional seat in an upset, defeating Phil McConkey, 33, a former receiver of the Giants football team, who finished a strong second in his campaign, and Assemblyman Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, 44, who had been the favorite. Joseph F. Shanahan, 76, was fourth. Mr. Zimmer will face the Democratic primary winner, Marguerite Chandler, 46, a businesswoman, who defeated James J. Cleary, a supporter of Lyndon H. LaRouche, the political extremist now jailed on fraud charges.
In the First District, the Camden County Freeholder Director, Robert E. Andrews, won the Democratic nomination over Linda Bowker, 41, the head of the New Jersey chapter of the National Organization for Women; John A. Dramesi, 51, a retired Air Force colonel, and Joel S. Farley, 35, a lawyer.
Mr. Andrews will face a Gloucester County Freeholder, Daniel Mangini, 56, who ran unopposed.

HEADLINE: Business Wary of Gorbachev Pitch

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 6

 BODY:
Although American business leaders were heartened by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's speeches in the last week on economic reform in the Soviet Union, they warn that a series of obstacles still prevents them from investing in a big way in that country.
They expect that it will be years before American involvement in the Soviet economy is substantial. ''It will probably take a decade unless you have a revolution there,'' said William Farley, chairman and chief executive of Fruit of the Loom Inc., the clothing manufacturer.
John Hinds, president of the international division of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said: ''There is an opportunity that did not even exist a few months ago. But there are many impediments to success in the Soviet market.'' 
In speeches on Sunday in Minneapolis and again on Monday in San Francisco, Mr. Gorbachev gave what might be called ''we're-open-for-business'' speeches to some of the most prominent American industrialists and farm leaders.
He said the Soviets were considering making the ruble convertible into Western currencies and were examining ways to allow increased foreign ownership of Soviet enterprises. Mr. Gorbachev also provided a checklist of business sectors in which he said the Soviets would seek American involvement, including telecommunications, computers, farm technology and transportation.
American executives were perhaps most impressed by what they considered to be Mr. Gorbachev's high economic I.Q. The Soviet leader, they said, talked knowledgeably about such topics as repatriation of corporate profits, joint ventures and the establishment of securities exchanges.
''Here was a guy who didn't refer to his notes much,'' said Robert L. Joss, a vice chairman of the Wells Fargo Bank. ''He was throwing off complex concepts in a logical, coherent way. I've seen Presidents need more economic briefing.''
Some American executives say they had already heard what the Soviet President had to say. It was ''mainly a reaffirmation of things we already knew,'' said Allen F. Jacobson, the chairman and chief executive of the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the adhesives maker.
But even Mr. Jacobson acknowledged that Mr. Gorbachev's speeches in this country were significant, if only because of the enthusiasm and apparent sincerity with which he talked of converting his country's military factories into plants for producing consumer goods and his willingness to discuss difficulties like food shortages that economic liberalization is causing.
But the consensus in the American business community is that large impediments remain to investing in the Soviet Union. Leading the list is the conversion of the ruble into ''hard'' currencies.
 
Getting the Profits Out
''Why would you want to do business there?'' Mr. Farley asked. ''One reason, certainly, is not only to make a dollar but also to get that profit out. Presently, that is not possible.'' Other executives expressed concern over the Soviets' lack of services for business.
''Basic services that business people need - telephones, hotels, and airline service - are still very poor,'' said John Sculley, chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer Inc. ''Without telephones and fax machines, we can't do business.''
Still others said it was critical that the Soviets loosen rules on market research and foreign management of business enterprises. ''We'd have to be assured of the acceptance of our product,'' said Richard L. Knowlton, chairman and chief executive of Geo. A. Hormel & Company, the meat processor. ''But we wouldn't mind being 50-50 partners if we could control the manufacturing.''
Clearly, one impediment to increased American investment in the Soviet Union is the export approvals that continue to be needed on many American products. The Control Data Corporation, for instance, has been waiting for months to receive permission to send the Soviets six of its Cyber large-scale computers that were ordered last summer.
Notwithstanding these hurdles, Mr. Gorbachev appears eager to elevate the American participation in the Soviet economy from its current modest level. Levi Strauss & Company, for instance, which sells its blue jeans around the world, has only one operation in the Soviet Union - a state-owned hard-currency shop that it considers very successful.

HEADLINE: Bank Lending Said to Slow; No Credit Squeeze Is Seen

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
Three top Federal regulators said today that there had been a slowdown in bank lending but no credit squeeze. And they said that any slowdown should not be attributed to excessively harsh treatment of banks by examiners.
At a hearing of the House Small Business Committee, the three regulators - John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor; Paul G. Fritts, a director at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency - said the pain felt by small businesses and real estate developers who have been turned down for loans was a price to be paid for maintaining the banking industry's financial health.
''The economy's credit needs are being met,'' said Mr. LaWare, who was previously head of a large New England bank. In the text of his comments, he said that ''tightening of credit standards that has occurred so far is appropriate'' to the Fed's economic policy goals. 
 
Pleased With Economy
Several Fed officials have said recently that they are generally pleased with the economy, which grew at a sluggish 1.3 percent rate in the first quarter, after inflation. Officials at the central bank have said they seek economic growth of 1.5 to 2 percent.
The Fed has held monetary policy and short-term rates stable for nearly six months. With the economy settling in to sluggish growth of less than 2 percent, which economists hope will keep a lid on inflation, many analysts do not expect a quick change in Fed policy.
Several times during the hearing the regulators described how they were trying to balance the need of a growing economy for bank loans with their responsibility to supervise banks tightly enough to prevent a situation like the savings and loan crisis. Despite a cascade of anecdotal reports from developers and small businesses that have been denied credit in recent months, the regulators concluded that there was no threat to the economy great enough to justify a return to the more relaxed lending standards of the 1980's.
 
Concern About 'Another Disaster'
Representative Jan Meyers, Republican of Kansas, noted that the rising cost to taxpayers of the savings bailout was a reminder of the need for a ''regulatory system that will prevent another disaster.''
The regulators repeated the advice they gave at a special meeting with bankers a month ago: Do not stop lending or taking risks. But the regulators also said that the weakening of real estate markets and the economy in regions like New England would require that they continue to pay special attention to bank lending in those areas.
In New England, where bank losses from bad real estate loans have been greatest and borrowers' complaints about lack of credit the loudest, Mr. Fritts said the drop in bank lending was a ''normal response'' to overbuilt markets and a slumping economy. He noted that a special hotline created by the Governor of Massachusetts, Michael S. Dukakis, attracted 200 calls, which he said was a small number considering the size of the state.
Mr. Clarke, the Comptroller, whose office is an arm of the Treasury that regulates nationally chartered banks, noted that the shift to more stringent lending standards did not suddenly appear in the last six months. He said that many bankers who became more cautious two or more years ago have survived examinations without making major losses or large increases in their reserves for loan losses. ''This is not Sherman's march,'' Mr. Clarke said.
Examiners of the Comptroller's office are not making special ''targeted'' examinations of small-business loans as they are for real estate loans, Mr. Clarke said. But he noted that when a regional economy turns weaker and real estate values fall, it may ''also make a bank less willing to lend to all customers, including small business.''
Mr. Clark added that his office had identified many regions and kinds of lending where some banks face greater than normal risks and perhaps should become more cautious. He urged that banks ''pay more attention to the environment where they operate'' but declined to say which regions or which types of lending face the greatest risks.
Representative John J. LaFalce, Democrat of upstate New York, said he did not want to ''infringe on appropriate examination and regulation'' but told the regulators that they should do more to encourage bankers to work with troubled borrowers rather than abruptly withdraw loans.

HEADLINE: Stocks Continue Down As Dow Retreats 13.35

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Stock prices continued falling yesterday, for the second straight day, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 13.35 points to close at 2,911.65.
Selling by some investors after the big run-up that peaked on Monday with the Dow at a record 2,935.19 was again cited by traders as a reason for pressure on the blue chips. ''The market came so far and so fast that it was natural for people to want to take some profits,'' said Dennis E. Jarrett, market analyst at Kidder, Peabody. ''The fact that there was no heavy selling bodes well for the next few months.'' 
 
Volume Slips to 164 Million
Volume slipped to 164 million shares, from 199.7 million on Tuesday. Some 872 issues declined and 656 advanced.
The market was also down as measured by the broader S.&P. 500 index, which closed off 1.68, to 364.96.
Along with the selling, skepticism grew on the economy. An article in The Wall Street Journal yesterday said that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow short-term interest rates to fall anytime soon, despite a slowing economy.
A money manager, Robert G. Freedman, said that there were still ''a lot of skeptics and a lot of cash'' staying out of the market. Mr. Freedman, chief equity investment officer for John Hancock mutual funds, is not among the skeptics, however.
''I think the market is still going higher,'' he said, ''and it will easily get to 3,000.''
A cloud shaded the market before noon as traders reacted to news reports of a mysterious cloud over the Barents Sea in the Soviet Union. The Dow dropped almost 20 points before new reports said the cloud was not radioactive. ''Once that seemed not to have developed into some full-blown problem, the market stabilized,'' Mr. Jarrett said.
Among the most active stocks, Union Carbide gained 1, to 21; Philip Morris added 3/8, to 44 1/2, and Eastman Kodak rose 1 7/8, to 41 7/8.
Kodak, rumored to have attracted possible bidders for its Sterling Drug unit, declined comment on the jump in its stock.
Oil issues sagged on reports that Saudi Arabia is taking steps that would continue downward pressure on oil prices. Texaco dropped 1 1/2, to 57 7/8, and Atlantic Richfield, 2, to 116 1/4. But airlines, which had surged Tuesday on indications that fuel costs could decline, edged up yesterday. AMR the parent of American Airlines added 1/8 to 69; Delta Air Lines, 1/8, to 80 1/8, and Pan Am 1/8 to 2 1/2.
Some retail issues were lower on expectations of weaker May sales reports. The Limited lost 1, to 49 1/4. May Department Stores fell 1 3/8, to 56 1/8, and the Gap dropped 7/8, to 62 7/8.
 
Campbell Issue Downgraded
Campbell Soup lost 3 1/8, to 56 7/8. A Prudential-Bache analyst, John McMillin, downgraded the issue to a hold from a buy. He said an annnouncement by three of the company's holders that they would pool their 17.4 percent stake into a trust meant that a deal to buy the company was not likely for some time.
Upjohn, which has long been rumored as a potential merger partner with an overseas pharmaceutical company, declined comment on activity in its stock. The issue was up 2 3/8 on Tuesday but dropped back 1 1/4 yesterday.
NCH, a specialty chemicals maker, lost 4 1/2, to 58 3/4, on second-quarter earnings disappointing to analysts.
Tyco Toys, which gained last week on prospects of a sale of the company, fell 4 3/4, to 22 3/4, in over-the-counter trading, after it said the talks had been terminated and no new suitor was being actively sought.
The Amex market value index closed up 0.36, to 364.19, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.35, to 464.96.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Notes and Bonds Narrowly Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds were narrowly mixed in very slow trading yesterday, as dealers sifted through, and ultimately shrugged off, a series of potentially negative developments.
Among the events the market participants chose to ignore were a rise in oil prices and a newspaper report that the Federal Reserve Board is not about to ease monetary policy.
The report, which quoted some Fed governors by name and others anonymously, appeared in The Wall Street Journal.
Although he was not quoted in the article, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, seemed to add some credibility yesterday to the notion that the Fed will maintain its current policy stance. 
Without commenting directly on the Fed's intentions, after a speech in San Francisco Mr. Greenspan said that despite three straight months of weak employment data he saw no signs of an ''underlying deterioration'' in the economy.
''The fact that the market absorbed a lot of bad news is moderately constructive,'' said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. ''But until we get more data next week I would be surprised to see interest rates move up or down by more than five basis points.''
William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, said that ''ordinarily, the market might have viewed Mr. Greenspan's remarks as a mild negative,'' adding, ''But after the decline in prices on Tuesday there is a bid for paper at these somewhat lower levels.''
 
Short-Term Notes Fall Slightly
Perhaps in deference to the notion that the Fed is not about to ease policy shortly, prices of shorter-term Treasury notes dipped modestly. But long-term note and bond issues posted small gains.
Because of their shorter maturity, notes and bills are more sensitive to shifts in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market than longer-term securities.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at a price of 100 10/32 late yesterday, down 1/32, to yield 8.41 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were unchanged at 100 10/32, to yield 8.32 percent.
Among longer-term securities, the 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at 103 14/32, up 5/32, to yield 8.43 percent. Late Tuesday the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.44 percent.
Treasury bill rates were little changed on the day.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.68 percent, down one basis point, or hundredth of a point. Six-month bills were unchanged at an offered rate of 7.59 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 7.49 percent, also unchanged on the day.
Activity in the corporate bond market was highlighted by a two-part offering of $600 million worth of credit sensitive notes from the Georgia-Pacific Corporation.
The first $300 million of the issue are seven-year notes that mature June 15, 1997. The securities are noncallable for life.
The 10 percent notes were priced at $100, 1.50 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The rest of the issue consists of $300 million of 12-year notes due June 15, 2002.
These securities, which are also noncallable for life, carry a 10.10 percent coupon and were priced at $99.937, to yield 10.109 percent, 1.65 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes.
Bear, Stearns & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. Both sections are rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BB-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Secondary Market Activity
Activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was light, traders said. Prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged on the day.
Trading was also fairly quiet in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds. Participants said that prices of most actively traded issues dipped by about 1/8 point.
Today's activity will be highlighted by New York State's delayed sale of $4.1 billion worth of short-term tax and revenue and anticipation notes.
The offering had to be postponed because of protracted negotiations in Albany over ways to address the state's 1991 budget gap. As a result of those talks, the budget was not formulated until May 23, 53 days into New York State's fiscal year.
In advance of the sale, Moody's and Standard & Poor's assigned their highest short-term ratings to the notes. The securities, which will be sold through Shearson Lehman Brothers, mature March 28, 1991.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Light Trading As Gold Prices Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against all primary currencies except the Canadian dollar in sluggish domestic trading marked by various international considerations.
Gold prices posted moderate declines in the United States after moving slightly higher abroad.
Foreign-exchange dealers said trading volume was light. Various concerns depressed the Swiss franc and West German mark, steering investors to the dollar, they said. 
Confirmation that Switzerland is seeking to join the International Monetary Fund and speculation about possible declines in interest rates there encouraged selling of the franc, said Richard Levine of Merrill Lynch Futures.
The mark came under renewed pressure amid reports of a potential strike by thousands of workers in East Germany. Unconfirmed rumors of a possible accident at a Soviet nuclear power plant - stemming from reports that Finnish authorities were checking a large cloud drifting toward their country - also weakened the currency.
But Mr. Levine said the nuclear accident rumor did not have an effect on currency trading over all.
The dollar began higher in Tokyo, rising by 0.17 Japanese yen to close at 152.60 yen. Later, in London trading, it was quoted at 152.45 yen. By the time trading finished in New York, the dollar was quoted at 152.68 yen, up from 152.35 yen late on Tuesday.
The pound was quoted at $1.6880, compared with $1.6820 late on Tuesday. Sterling weakened in later United States trading, dipping to $1.6875 late in New York, from $1.6880 late on Tuesday.
Selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Tuesday, included: 1.6885 West German marks, up from 1.6840; 1.4365 Swiss francs, up from 1.4280; 5.6905 French francs, up from 5.6785; 1,242.00 Italian lire, up from 1,240.00, and 1.16975 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17605 Canadian.
The Canadian dollar's strength was tied to various political developments. Talk had arisen in the market that a rift between the Maritime Provinces and the rest of the country was not as serious as had been thought.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold prices finished lower. Gold bullion for June delivery settled at $357.40 an ounce, down by $2.40 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted an ounce of gold at $356.75 late yesterday, $2.25 lower than Tuesday's late bid.
In London, gold bullion traded late yesterday at a bid of $359.50 an ounce, up 25 cents from late on Tuesday. In Zurich, the bid was $358.60 an ounce, unchanged from late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: White House Panel Says U.S. Can Fight Pollution and Grow

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
The White House's Council on Environmental Quality says the progress of the last two decades shows that the nation can have both economic growth and environmental quality.
Michael R. Deland, chairman of the council, said in his introduction to the council's annual report, issued Tuesday: ''Over the past two decades the presumed linkage between economic growth and environmental degradation has been broken. We know now that a growing economy and a clean environment go hand in hand.'' The council is the executive branch's environmental coordinating group. 
The acknowledgment that environmental protection and economic progress are compatible and even mutually reinforcing is a significant departure from the views of Ronald Reagan's Administration, which frequently opposed environmental regulation on the ground that it had a dampening effect on business expansion.
 
Criticism Comes Quickly
But the report of the council, which mainly praised the nation's anti-pollution efforts, was quickly criticized by environmental groups. They complained that it inadequately conveyed the urgency of the environmental problems facing the nation and the world.
''They have virtually ignored the most pressing environmental problems of the day: global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer,'' said Ruth Caplan, executive director of Environmental Action, a group formed 20 years ago to promote the first Earth Day.
''It seems to me,'' she said, ''that this is just another example of the council's failure to serve as the environmental conscience of the Administration. America needs to be challenged, not patted on the back.''
The council was created in 1970 by the National Environmental Policy Act to oversee the executive branch's environmental activities. In that same year, Congress passed the Clean Air Act and President Richard M. Nixon issued an executive order creating the Environmental Protection Agency.
Under Mr. Reagan the staff of the Council on Environmental Quality was reduced. But the council is being revived and expanded by President Bush and Mr. Deland.
''There can be little doubt that 1970 was the single most important year in this country's history,'' the council noted in its 494-page annual report.
Much of the report is devoted to describing the successes achieved by the nation in reducing pollution and protecting public health. While the report points to some ''mixed results'' in areas like protecting wetlands and coastal areas, it emphasizes improvements in the quality of the nation's air, water and soil during a period of substantial economic growth.
Noting that the population of the United States rose 22 percent over the 20-year period and that the economy grew by 75 percent, the report noted that the country had made substantial progress in reducing the pollutants singled out by the Clean Air Act.
Paul Allen, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said the report ''has a bland quality about it that gives little indication of the seriousness of the problems we face.''
In response to a question, Mr. Deland said the report was not intended to be self-congratulatory. He said ''we have without question a long way to go'' in reducing waste, conserving energy and curbing pollution.

HEADLINE: G.M. AND MOSCOW IN $1 BILLION PACT

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 7

 BODY:
In a move that could foreshadow closer ties between the Soviet Union and American companies, the General Motors Corporation signed a $1 billion agreement in the Soviet Union today to sell auto parts to the largest Soviet car maker.
Aside from the size of the five-year contract, the deal is significant because G.M. will receive payment from the Soviets in United States dollars. It may also prove a test of whether American-style capitalism can profitably contribute to an important Communist industry that plans to raise its exports to the West.
The currency issue has stymied many foreign corporations trying to do business in the Soviet Union, because of the difficulties of obtaining payments for products or services. The Soviet ruble cannot be easily converted into dollars on international markets, the country's foreign currency reserves are not large, and the Soviet Union has few products to trade to the West other than oil, vodka, furs and caviar. 
G.M., which has been talking to Soviet automotive officials for 18 months, said it would supply fuel injectors, wiring, electronic controls and catalytic converters to the Volga Automobile Works, known as VAZ, in Togliatti, 700 miles southeast of Moscow. Shipments will start in 1992, G.M. said. The parts, for systems that make fuel burn efficiently with lower amounts of pollution, will be installed in two models of the Lada passenger car, G.M. said, so the cars can meet pending clean-air standards in the European Community. The Soviets plan to export the Ladas to Western Europe after 1992.
''Pollution respects no international boundaries; neither should the proven technology to control it,'' said William Hoglund, a G.M. executive vice president in charge of component operations.
Mr. Hoglund acknowledged that the company, the world's largest auto maker, understands it is accepting some risk in the deal because of the Soviet Union's currency problems. Moreover, the volume of G.M. sales to VAZ will ultimately depend on how well the Lada is received by European consumers.
Current versions of the economy car have had limited success in foreign markets, including some Western European countries and Canada. The Lada is heavily based on the 20-year-old design of the Fiat 124, and its chief appeal to Western consumers is its low price. The Lada sells for about $10,000 in Britain, where cars tend to cost more than in the United States.
VAZ hopes, at a minimum, to double current sales in Western Europe of about 50,000 cars a year, and perhaps reach sales of 150,000, G.M. officials said.
''If everything hangs together, this could be a good business opportunity for the Soviet Union,'' said David Nash, vice president of Autofacts Inc., an automotive consulting firm in Paoli, Pa.
Since the Soviet Union does not have emission standards for cars or trucks, it has not developed pollution-control equipment for vehicles. And few, if any, Soviet-built vehicles today have fuel injection or other advanced engine technologies that are commonplace in the West.
Versions of the Lada exported to Canada, which has pollution standards similar to those of the United States, are able to meet those standards only after they are fitted with additional pollution-control devices.
In reaching the agreement, G.M. won out over two West German companies, the Robert Bosch Corporation and Siemens A.G., which were also negotiating with VAZ. G.M. will manufacture the parts at several factories, including those in Melbourne, Australia; Southampton, England; Coopersville, Mich.; Rochester, and Milwaukee.
To surmount the obstacles posed by the Soviet currency situation, some American companies doing business in the Soviet Union agree to accept barter goods, rather than currency, for their earnings.
 
Pinched for Hard Currency
In recent months the Soviet Union said that it was pinched for hard currencies - those that can be freely converted in the foreign-exchange markets - and had deposited gold in banks abroad to reassure foreign companies that they would be repaid.
''To sign an agreement of this size with G.M. for $1 billion in convertible currency rather than some other form of compensation, and not in the context of a joint venture, is remarkable,'' said Morris Bornstein, a professor at the University of Michigan who specializes in Soviet economics. ''It's safe to say this is a sizable deal given the current circumstances of their economy.''
Mr. Hoglund declined to answer questions about the details of G.M.'s contract, saying he did not know the exact terms of the contract because of poor communications with G.M. negotiators who had been meeting with VAZ officials in Togliatti, U.S.S.R. A G.M. spokesman noted that Togliatti has only two international telephone lines, service is slow, reception is spotty and there are no fax machines.
 
Hurdles for Foreigners
Poor communication has been frequently cited as a hurdle to foreign business in the Soviet Union. But G.M. is studying the possibility of setting up its own satellite dish and communications network in Togliatti, through its Electronic Data Systems and GM Hughes Electronics subsidiairies, that would bypass the Soviet telephone system, said Jan Tannehill, general manager of G.M.'s AC Rochester division.
Mr. Tannehill said G.M. had proposed the idea, which is unprecedented and extraordinary in terms of past cold war tensions, and ''the Soviets are thinking about it.''
Mr. Tannehill said G.M. and Volga were also discussing a joint venture that would allow the Soviet company to produce its own catalytic converters eventually. He said an agreement was possible within a year. In the meantime, G.M. must train Russian engineers and assembly workers in advanced technologies relating to so-called ''engine management systems,'' which are sophisticated electronic and mechanical controls that reduce emissions and improve fuel efficiency.
''The Russians tell us they want advanced technology,'' Mr. Tannehill said. ''They're not afraid of it. They know they're going to need it if they want to compete.''
 
Gorbachev's Encouragement
During his recent visit to this country, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev several times encouraged American businesses to come to his country, notwithstanding the fact that American executives have reported numerous impediments when trying to negotiate agreements.
G.M. officials said the Russian executives of VAZ proved to be tough negotiators. Since November they had been close to signing an agreement twice, only to see their efforts fizzle. Through it all, ''they kept emphasizing how much like us they are,'' Mr. Tannehill said. ''They would say how their cultures are mixed like ours, how they are world leaders as we are.''
Early last year, the Ford Motor Company withdrew from a United States trade consortium with the Soviet Union because it did not receive what it said were sufficient financial guarantees to justify a $1 billion investment in an auto plant in Gorky. Specifically, Ford officials had said they were worried because the Soviets would not guarantee to repay their investment in hard currency.

HEADLINE: COMPUTER PROJECT WOULD SPEED DATA

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
A group of private companies, universities, research laboratories and Government agencies is planning to develop an advanced computer network in which data would be transmitted at speeds 700 times faster than possible now. The plan is to be announced today by the National Science Foundation. It would be the first comprehensive effort in the United States to advance the technologically critical area of computer networks and is being called an important model for cooperation between business and government.
The widespread support for the computer-network project stands in sharp contrast to the reception received by other recent cooperative projects in high technology, such as the effort to finance research in high-definition television and the joint venture, known as U.S. Memories, that was intended to strengthen the United States in the semiconductor business. Those projects have foundered for lack of money or enthusiasm among Government and business. 
In Japan, the Government and large corporations have already begun work on high-speed computer networks, known as data highways, that enable the transmission of the equivalent of about 160 hefty novels every second, compared with only about one novel every four seconds in even the fastest networks today.
By conveying so much data so quickly, using the same optical-fiber cables now used by some long-distance telephone carriers, high-speed computer networks hold the promise of many new scientific and commercial uses that could be available by the middle of this decade. These include the ability to transmit to and receive data from a hybrid of television and computer. The new device would have a picture and sound of movie-like quality and the capacity to allow the viewer to manipulate the images and data displayed on the screen and instantaneously exchange the information with other users.
Other potential uses that could evolve from the new project include three-dimensional medical imaging that enables doctors thousands of miles apart to analyze lifelike, high-resolution images; far more accurate understanding and prediction of weather and climate because of the ability to link the power of supercomputers around the country, and multimedia teleconferencing that would combine video images and computer data, allowing business meetings without the need to travel. $100 Million From Companies The data network is being initiated with $15 million from the National Science Foundation and from a Pentagon agency that has financed research in basic technology. But more than $100 million will come from companies, including the International Business Machines Corporation and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, during the three-year project, executives at the foundation said.
The venture ''marks an important step forward,'' said Robert B. Reich, a Havard University economist. ''There are a host of technological areas in which the United States is falling behind to which this model might be directly applicable if it means developing skills and insights in new technological areas,'' he said.
The computer-network project will draw together dozens of corporations and universities, including I.B.M., A.T.&T., the MCI Communications Corporation, the regional Bell telecommunications companies and universities including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Pennsylvania, the California Institute of Technology and the University of California at Berkeley. Government laboratories including those in Los Alamos, N.M., and Livermore, Calif., and the nation's five supercomputer centers will also participate.
 
A Pioneer's Brainchild
The project is the brainchild of Robert E. Kahn, a pioneer of the nation's first computer network experiment, called Arpanet, and David J. Farber, a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Kahn is president of the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, a computer technology research group in Reston, Va., that will receive the Government grant expected to be announced today.
Mr. Kahn was director of computer science research at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Pentagon agency participating in the project. Mr. Kahn said that he would not comment on the project until it had been formally announced by the National Science Foundation.
Computer scientists said significant technical challenges remain to allow the transmission and reception of computer data at speeds above a billion bits per second, a goal of the new network.
Transmitting computer data is done in a way similar to the way mail has been sorted in post offices, said William A. Wulf, a computer scientist at the University of Virginia. Postal employees read addresses and place envelopes in particular slots.
 
Stream of Digital Signals
Similarly, computer networks break data into packets, send them as strings of digital signals and then sort them when they arrive at their destination. The problem with very high speed networks, said Dr. Wulf, is that even the fastest machines that serve as gateways between the data highway and the computers they connect are not able to keep up with the stream of 1's and 0's possible with new networks. The challenge is therefore to develop a new class of machines to serve as gateways.
The development project consists of five experimental networks.
The effort represents the first phase of a multiyear endeavor that supporters hope will ultimately create the national data highway.
Project developers said they are still uncertain about the cost of deploying a nationwide high-speed network. It is possible, they contend, that the rapidly increasing technology of long-distance optical-fiber networks may generate a surplus in capacity, permitting low-cost delivery of data and digital video services.
 
Support of Gore
''This represents a great example of how industry and government can work together to develop a key technology needed for the effective use of a national network of data super-highways soon to put in place,'' said Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee. ''It's not a huge amount of money, but it will provide a great many useful applications for the network.''

HEADLINE: Texas Researchers Develop 4 Gene-Altered Calves

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 6

 BODY:
A team of scientists here has produced the nation's first genetically engineered calves, a new milestone in using advanced genetic technology to alter food-producing animals.
Four calves born in the last 15 months on a farm near Marquez, Tex., 120 miles north of Houston, have genes from other species, including humans. Researchers expect the genes, inserted into fertilized eggs removed from the womb, to speed growth and make cattle leaner. The four calves are a first step in understanding how direct genetic manipulation of the chromosomes of cattle will affect meat and milk. 
In producing the genetically engineered calves, which look no different from ordinary calves, scientists in the United States have completed their goal of inserting foreign genes into the chromosomes of every important food animal. The breakthrough holds the promise of eliminating many steps in the long and costly process of cattle breeding, and also of producing superior livestock with traits that until now have existed only in theory.
There have been no striking changes in three of the first four genetically engineered cattle, but scientists say the fact that the new genetic traits became a permanent part of the chromosomes shows that an important technical boundary has been crossed.
Federal regulators said they had several concerns about how genetic transformations might affect the quality of meat and milk, and these issues are being reviewed by the Department of Agriculture. Animal welfare groups and some family farm groups have been worried as well about the new technology's potential to harm animals, the environment and smaller producers who could be forced out of business.
Gene-altered cattle have been developed in Canada and Europe, but the achievements, reported in specialized technical journals, have received little attention outside the small fraternity of scientists conducting animal reproductive research.
The procedure has been done in pigs, sheep, goats and chickens, but scientists say the genetically engineered calves represent a significant step in using the technology because cattle are much more complicated to work with and far more important economically.
Farm specialists say the technology holds vast promise for altering production practices and changing the structure of the nation's $35 billion beef industry and $20 billion dairy industry.
For instance, cattle companies could offer McDonald's beef animals specially designed to produce more meat for hamburgers. Kraft may have the opportunity to operate dairies with its own trademark breed of cows that produce milk specifically intended for producing cheese. And farmers could gain animals far more resistant to diseases and stress, making it possible to halt or sharply curtail the use of toxic drugs and dangerous antibiotics.
 
'Tremendous Implications'
''This technology has tremendous implications,'' said Dr. Caird E. Rexroad, a research physiologist at the Department of Agriculture's Beltsville Agricultural Research Station in Beltsville, Md., who produced genetically altered sheep. ''For the time being, most people are looking at improving efficiency; the amount of feed it takes to produce a pound of meat. In the future, we're looking at manipulating growth and other characteristics.''
But Dr. Michael W. Fox, a veterinarian who is vice president of the Humane Society of the United States, had another point of view. ''We have 2 billion cattle, 1.6 billion sheep and goats, and 800 million pigs in the world today,'' he said. ''That population needs to be drastically reduced because of adverse environmental impacts. This focusing on enhanced productivity might look good to investors but is the last thing the world needs.''
The genetically engineered calves were developed by a group of Texas researchers led by Dr. Bert O'Malley, a cell biologist from the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston; Dr. Robert Hammer, a research physiologist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Dallas, and Dr. Ken Bondioli, a senior scientist at Granada BioSciences Inc., an affiliate of the Granada Corporation, a cattle breeding and food company in Houston.
Darold F. McCalla, president of Granada BioSciences, which financed the research, said his company had not been eager to disclose the breakthrough until now because not enough animals had been produced and Granada was concerned about the reaction of those who oppose biotechnology development.
 
The Earlier Developments
Two other research groups have said they produced genetically engineered calves before the American group. One group led by Dr. Robert Church, a medical biochemist, at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, said they developed a calf in June 1986 that had a human gene that produced the protein interferon as a way to improve disease resistance. Dr. Church said in an interview from his office in Calgary that the Canadian group has reported three generations of gene-altered animals, 23 males and females in all. An East German group from the Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Dummerstorf reported the birth of a genetically engineered calf on Jan. 19, 1988.
The American research team's first transformed calf, a male, was born on March 17, 1989. The animal, now a husky 15-month-old bull, contains a human gene in its chromosomes, the estrogen receptor gene, that researchers hoped would accelerate growth by making better use of the animal's own production of the hormone estrogen.
Although tests showed that the gene was successfully inserted into the animal's cells, the calf grew no faster than other animals, said Dr. Bondioli.
Two other calves, one born on Sept. 22, 1989, and the other, born on March 30 this year, both males, have an extra cattle gene that produces a protein known as insulin-like growth factor. That protein regulates development of cattle by promoting the growth of muscle tissue. The Texas scientists theorized that adding another gene to increase the levels of insulin-like growth factor would enhance meat production in cattle. The animals are too young to determine whether the gene worked, but one black male calf is bigger than calves of the same age.
Dr. Bondioli said more calves with the insulin-like growth factor need to be produced before making conclusions.
On Dec. 17, 1989, the group gained its first genetically engineered female. This fourth calf has an extra cattle gene, the bovine growth hormone gene, that controls development and milk production.
 
Drugs vs. Genetic Manipulation
The same gene has been spliced into bacteria by four large chemical and drug companies who hope to market a new veterinary drug to be injected into cows to boost milk production. The new drug has become a political issue in the Middle West, where farmers believe it could lead to new surpluses and consumers say they don't want a new artificial hormone in milk.
The Texas researchers are taking a different approach. They believe that increasing the levels of bovine growth hormone in a cow's blood through direct genetic manipulation is a better and safer way of gaining more milk.

HEADLINE: Loss of Tropical Forests Is Found Much Worse Than Was Thought

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Tropical forests, which play a vital role in regulating the global climate, are disappearing much more rapidly than previously estimated, an international research group said today.
Each year recently, 40 million to 50 million acres of tropical forest, an area the size of Washington State, has been vanishing as trees are cut for timber and to clear land for agriculture and other development, the World Resources Institute said in a report. The group said 1.9 billion acres of tropical forest remained.
The report, ''World Resources 1990-91,'' prepared in collaboration with the United Nations, was described by its authors as the first comprehensive estimate in a decade of tropical-forest losses around the world. 
The rate of loss, measured in most countries in 1987, was nearly 50 percent greater than the last global estimate, prepared by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization in 1980, according to the institute.
''We were startled to uncover this rate of global deforestation,'' said James Gustave Speth, president of the institute, a nonprofit Washington-based research and policy organization that specialized in environmental issues. ''We were saying we were losing the forests at an acre a second, but it is much closer to an acre and a half a second.''
The disappearance of tropical forests is regarded by environmental experts as one of the most serious global environmental problems. Through photosynthesis, the forests absorb huge quantities of carbon dioxide, the most important of the gases that are accumulating in the atmosphere. Many scientists believe that carbon dioxide, if not kept in check, will cause a significant warming of the earth in the next century, through a process known as the greenhouse effect.
 
From Satellite Data
The report on forests was based on remote sensing data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Landsat satellites that was orginally analyzed by each of the affected tropical countries. Dr. Allen L. Hammond, editor in chief of the report, said at a news conference here that for most of the countries the satellite data covered 1987, but for Brazil it covered 1988, since newer data were available for that country.
He said the estimates of actual forest loss were ''very conservative,'' and that the actually losses probably were considerably higher.
The group's report said that in nine major tropical countries, the estimates of total annual losses of tropical-forest acreage were about four times as high as estimates from the years 1981 to 1985. The nine countries were Brazil, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Costa Rica, Cameroon and Myanmar (formerly Burma). Dr. Hammond said, however, that in Brazil, the rate of deforestation declined in 1988 from 1987, largely because the levels from the latter year were the highest on record.
As the tropical forests shrink, their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide declines, hastening the onset and increasing the magnitude of the warming phenomenon. And as the vegetation from the cut forests decays or is burned, it emits more carbon dioxide.
The tropical forests also contain the largest and most diverse populations of plant and animal species of any habitat. As the forests vanish, so do many of these species, many before they ever have been discovered, named and analyzed.
Tropical forests have infertile soil because most of the nutrients are in the vegetation, not the soil. Thus, when these forests are cleared they tend to regenerate slowly, if at all.
 
'An Unparalleled Tragedy'
''Tropical deforestation is an unparalleled tragedy,'' said Mr. Speth. ''If we don't reverse the trend soon, it will be too late.''
Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said in a statement: ''This is the first reliable data we've had on tropical deforestation in 10 years. A situation we knew was bleak is now shown to be truly horrendous.''
The World Resources Institute report was prepared in collaboration with the United Nations Environment Program and the United Nations Development Program. Joan Martin Brown, special adviser to the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, said at the news conference that her organization did not have its own capacity to do the kind of research contained in the report.
Since preagricultural times, the report said, the world has lost about one-fifth of all its forests, from more than 12 billion acres to under 10 billion acres. In the past, most of the losses were in the temperate forests of Europe, Asia and North America. In recent years, however, it is the tropical forests of the developing countries of Latin America, Asia and Africa that have been disappearing most rapidly.
 
Forests Without Trees
Brazil, with the largest remaining tropical forest area, is also experiencing the worst losses - between 12.5 million and 22.5 million acres a year, the report found. Myanamar is losing 1.7 million acres a year, more than 500 times the 1980 estimate by the Food and Agricultural Organization.
India, according to the data, is losing its forests at a rate of 3.7 million acres a year. Large areas legally designated as forest land ''are already virtually treeless,'' the report said. Indonesia is losing 2.2 million acres a year, and Costa Rica 300,000 acres, both substantially more than the 1980 estimate.
The problem of deforestation in developing countries ''has been exacerbated by government economic, land tenure and agricultureal policies as well as population pressures, poverty and debt,'' the report said.
The World Resources report also contains a new index of countries that are the greatest net contributors to the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorcarbons and methane, the major gases contributing to global warming.
 
Surprises on List
The United States and the Soviet Union are the first and second-largest net producers of these greenhouse gases, the report found. It added that if the European Community were considered a single country, it would rank second behind the United States.
But the next three countries on the index, surprisingly, were developing nations, Brazil, China and India.
It has been widely believed that the industrialized countries are the main producers of greenhouse gases. But the research group found that the developing countries already account for 45 percent of emissions of these gases, and that their contribution is likely to rise sharply as they consume more energy for industrial development.
While there is still uncertainty about global warming, Mr. Speth said, the scientific consensus is that ''the risks of global climate change are very real and it would be very shortsighted to conclude otherwise.''
''The conclusion of the great bulk of credible scientists is that enough is known to act now,'' said Mr. Speth, who was chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality in the Carter Administration. ''It is our view that it is already late.''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
U.S. to Relax Standards On High-Tech Exports

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 7

 BODY:
Responding to political change in Eastern Europe and intense lobbying from Western companies, the United States and other major industrial powers agreed today to a sharp reduction of controls on high-technology exports to Warsaw Pact nations.
After a two-day meeting, the 17 members of the technology watchdog group known as Cocom also said that Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia could soon enjoy still greater access to advanced products on the ground that they now pose a minimal strategic threat to the West.
With German economic unification only weeks away, Cocom further took note of the special case of East Germany and agreed to lift most remaining restrictions on exports to that country pending political union between the two Germanys.
 
Fewer Sensitive Products
United States officials said the list of sensitive products had undergone its most drastic revision since 1949, when all NATO countries except Iceland, and Japan and Australia, set up the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Exports Controls to prevent Western technology from being used for military purposes by the Soviet bloc. 
''We have adopted measures that will enable Eastern European countries to move ahead with the modernization of their economies,'' said Allan Wendt, special representative for strategic technical policy at the State Department. ''These are crucial decisions for these countries.''
But Mr. Wendt added that, following the principle of ''higher fences around fewer products,'' Cocom had also agreed to tighten controls on exports of ''truly sensitive items.'' Mr. Wendt said, ''This will be possible because we have agreed on a common standard of enforcement.''
As an example of this, the United States and Britain vetoed proposals by the Denver-based US West Inc. and by British Telecom to build a fiber optic cable across the Soviet Union, arguing that it would involve technology with potential military application.
 
End to Bickering
Nonetheless, this week's Cocom meeting appears to be a significant breakthrough, not only because it will open major new business opportunities for Western companies, but also because it should put an end to months of bickering over trade restrictions among the Western allies.
At Cocom's last session here in February, the United States was accused of ''cold-war thinking'' when it blocked Western European moves to slash the list of controlled items. But the United States called for caution and insisted on distinguishing between Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
Early in May, however, President Bush gave the green light for lifting controls on 30 of 116 restricted categories. Now Cocom has agreed that, as of July 1 this year, these 30 categories, ranging from floating docks to transistors, can be freely traded. It said it hopes to eliminate eight more items by mid-August.
This liberalization also extends to relaxation of controls on exports of machine tools, computers and telecommunications, which account for the vast majority of Cocom licensing requests. All countries on Cocom's proscribed list - the Warsaw Pact nations and China, will benefit from this, with no conditions attached.
 
Export of Computers
The new ruling will permit exports of personal computers up to the speed of 275 megabits a second and standard mainframe computers for industrial and office use, as well as some high precision machine tools and more sophisticated telecommunications equipment.
Dennis Kloske, Under Secretary for Export Administration at the Commerce Department, said that, once all these measures have gone into effect, some $45 billion worth of United States exports will no longer be subject to licensing requirements. ''This means removing 50 percent of the licensing caseload,'' he added.
Mr. Wendt said that Cocom also accepted a British proposal that an entirely new list - a so-called ''core list'' - of sensitive products be drawn up before the end of this year. ''We will be rewriting Cocom controls from scratch,'' he explained, ''and this should further reduce the number of controlled items and make the list easier to enforce.''
One of Cocom's central decisions this week was to give preferential treatment to Eastern Europe, with United States officials noting that this will first apply only to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Mr. Wendt said it was difficult to establish an exact criteria that would permit other Eastern European countries, such as Bulgaria or Romania, to obtain similar preferential treatment. ''A number of factors are involved in establishing the right strategic environment,'' he said. ''We're going to judge each situation as it arises.'' ---- White House Objects WASHINGTON, June 7 - The White House today made known its strong objections to legislation passed in the House Wednesday night that would relax controls on exports of computers and other advanced technology to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, but set conditions curbing the President's foreign policy discretion.
Senior advisers have told the President that if the bill were to pass unchanged in the Senate, they would advise a veto, a White House official said today.
The bill, the Export Facilitation Act, which passed 312 to 86, would speed the transfer of technology by reducing red tape that causes delays in export licensing and clarifying department roles to limit bureaucratic infighting.
But the bill also links exports of high technology to the Soviet Union with Moscow's handling of the independence movement in Lithuania.

HEADLINE: New Civil Rights Bill Doesn't Mean Quotas

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In attacking your editorial support for the proposed Civil Rights Act of 1990, Frederick J. Krebs of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce asserts (letter, June 1) that the bill permits an aggrieved worker to attack an employer's ''employment process'' merely because of racial imbalance and therefore ''relieves the plaintiff of the obligation to show that an employer practice contributed to imbalance.''
But the text of the bill clearly states that a violation is established only where ''a complaining party demonstrates that an employment practice (or a group of employment practices) results in a disparate impact.'' Nowhere does the bill permit a challenge to an employment process or a claim based solely on racial imbalance; rather it requires that the complainant identify the challenged employment practice and link it to a disparate impact on minorities and women.
Mr. Krebs's claim that the bill will ''undoubtedly drive many employers to use quotas'' is built entirely on his erroneous premise. The bill faithfully restores the Supreme Court's unanimous 1971 decision in the Griggs case, which has removed obstacles to the economic advancement of minorities and women without calling for quotas.
The Civil Rights Act of 1990 is moving through Congress with broad bipartisan support because it is widely understood that the national interest is served by fair treatment in the workplace and employment practices that use the productive capacities of all Americans. A handful of influential opponents, including the Chamber of Commerce, has persistently mis-characterized the bill as involving quotas.

HEADLINE: Aide to Bush Assails Cuomo On Drug Plansi

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 7

 BODY:
William J. Bennett, the President's national drug policy director, issued a blistering attack on Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's drug policies today and asserted that the White House has no fear of a Cuomo Presidential candidacy.
''If Mr. Cuomo wants to wax Presidential, either cutely or otherwise, he needs to work gubernatorially first,'' Mr. Bennett said at a news conference at the State Capitol after a speech to the Legislature.
The public assault on Mr. Cuomo was the second by a member of President Bush's Administration in two days. On Wednesday, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Jack F. Kemp, told reporters at a Washington breakfast that Mr. Cuomo is politically vulnerable because of the huge tax increase in this year's state budget. 
Both Mr. Bennett and Mr. Kemp said their remarks came in response to Mr. Cuomo's speech at the state Democratic convention here on Tuesday, when the Governor blamed many of New York's problems on the policies of the Reagan and Bush Administrations. Both officials raised the subject of Mr. Cuomo without being prompted by reporters.
 
White House Comment
White House and Republican Party officials said there was no orchestrated effort by the Bush Administration to bruise Mr. Cuomo. But they also said the White House did not disagree with anything said by either Mr. Bennett or Mr. Kemp.
''They don't have to and didn't clear their remarks through here, but we don't disassociate ourselves in any way from what they said,'' said a senior White House official who works for John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff.
Mr. Cuomo, who was delivering a speech in Miami Beach today, told The Associated Press that Mr. Bennett ''may have been on a political mission.'' The Governor's spokesman, Gary G. Fryer, said he suspected that Mr. Sununu, who tried to recruit Republican candidates to run against Mr. Cuomo this year, had played a role in the attacks on Mr. Cuomo.
Facing severe budget problems this year, Mr. Cuomo has been regularly blaming Washington for the Republican Administration's handling of issues ranging from the economy to drug policy to the savings and loan bailout. His use of his nomination acceptance speech to continue those attacks and his refusal to promise to serve a full four-year term as Governor were widely interpreted this week as signs that he is keeping his political options open.
Mr. Bennett, who was invited here by Republican state senators, opened his news conference by expressing his annoyance that Mr. Cuomo had told the state convention that ''the problem of drugs is not a state failure - it's a national failure.''
John McArdle, a spokesman for the State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, said the Senate Republicans had informed Mr. Bennett of Mr. Cuomo's remarks.
''The Governor really needs to cut it out,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''I'm doing my job. He needs to worry about doing his job rather than bashing Washington. You've got governors in this country, Republicans and Democrats, who are not spending most of their time complaining about Washington.''
 
'Nobody Is Afraid of This Guy'
Mr. Bennett made it clear he believes Mr. Cuomo is using his attacks on Washington because of Presidential aspirations, and he welcomed a Cuomo candidacy.
''There's this notion out there that if he steps in, the sun will be blocked by a cloud, the earth will stop, the animals will look around, the earth will fall silent,'' he said. ''Nobody is afraid of this guy. He's got a record to run on and the record on drugs, I have to tell you, is not what it should be.''
In his speech to a joint session of the Legislature, which was delivered in the Senate chamber, Mr. Bennett said New York had made progress in the war on drugs but needed to do better.
He focused on law-enforcement issues, encouraging the legislators to override Mr. Cuomo's veto of the death penalty and to pass a bill that would strengthen the state's ability to seize property used in drug transactions. That bill is backed by Mr. Cuomo. Criticism of Bennett Mr. Bennett said little about drug treatment initiatives, which have been the centerpiece of recent anti-drug efforts by the Cuomo administration. This year's budget includes money to increase the state's capacity for drug treatment by more than 7,000 over the next few years - which would more than double the state's treatment capacity.
The Cuomo administration has criticized Mr. Bennett for paying lip service to its plan to build drug treatment campuses across the state without providing either sites or financing for the centers. Mr. Bennett said today that he liked the concept, but he provided no commitments of Federal help.
In Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Kemp was talking with reporters about tax policy when he told them that Mr. Cuomo is vulnerable because ''he is going to push through the biggest tax increase on New Yorkers ever, ever, ever.''
 
Weary of Attacks
He said Mr. Cuomo is ''so shortsighted that he fails to make the connection between the high tax rates in his state and high capital gains taxes and the economic decline of the Northeast.''
Mr. Kemp, a former New York Congressman, also said he would have a hard time supporting Pierre A. Rinfret, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, because Mr. Rinfret supports abortion rights and opposed the 1981 Federal tax cut, which Mr. Kemp supported.
Although White House officials denied any coordinated effort to attack Mr. Cuomo, Republican strategists said it was clear that the White House had grown weary of Mr. Cuomo's attacks.
''Cuomo's up there using Bush as a punching bag,'' said Eddie Mahe Jr., a consultant to Mr. Rinfret's campaign. ''I would hope at some point they would begin to hit back.''

Mandatory Sentences in Drug Cases: Is the Law Defeating Its Purpose?

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BISHOP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 7

 BODY:
The case before Federal District Judge William W. Schwarzer last fall made him weep as he sat on the bench.
The case involved a 48-year-old longshoreman with no previous criminal convictions. The man's offense: he gave an acquaintance a ride to a fast-food restaurant, where the acquaintance made a drug deal with a Federal undercover officer.
The drug seller became a fugitive. The driver, who testified that he knew nothing about the illegal cargo, was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in narcotics. And Judge Schwarzer, bound by a Congressional decision made four years ago, had to sentence the man to a 10 years in prison. Earning the maximum number of good behavior days, he will serve eight years and eight months, a longer sentence than many people serve for manslaughter. 
''We are required to follow the rule of law,'' Judge Schwarzer said at the sentencing. ''But in this case the law does anything but serve justice.''
 
Congress Urged to Reconsider
Judge Schwarzer, who became director of the Federal Judicial Center in Washington three months ago, added, ''It may profit us very little to win the war on drugs if in the process we lose our soul.''
Increasingly, Federal judges are voicing that sentiment. Last July the chief judges of the 15 District Courts in the Ninth Circuit passed a resolution urging Congress to ''reconsider the wisdom'' of these mandatory sentences. Judges in several other circuits followed suit.
With the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Congress intended to cripple illegal drug trafficking by requiring stringent Federal prison sentences for everyone from large-volume dealers to low-level couriers. The sentences were based solely on the amount of drugs possessed or sold: 10 years for 11 pounds of cocaine, 2.2 pounds of heroin or 1.7 ounces of crack. Then, the Anti-Drug Abuse Amendments Act of 1988 upped the ante, making life without parole the sentence for those with two or more prior convictions.
''What we frequently see in this district are the mules,'' said Federal District Judge Judith N. Keep, in San Diego, who serves the Southern District of California. ''A lot of them have severe economic problems. They often have no prior criminal record, just a financial crisis. They take a chance and they get caught.''
 
Mandatory 10-Year Sentence
In one such case cited by Judge Keep, an impoverished 36-year-old farm worker and divorced mother was convicted of drug trafficking last year after she drove a truck across the border from Mexicali. Hidden inside were 40 pounds of cocaine and more than 400 pounds of marijuana. Under the 1986 law, Judge Keep had to sentence her to 10 years in prison.
Asked whether he thought cases involving low-level couriers or lookouts produced sentences that were too severe, William T. McGivern Jr., who became the United States Attorney here in March, said, ''That may happen, but people shouldn't be involved in drugs at all.''
''We would like to get the higher-ups, the big people,'' he added. ''That's what we're here for. But Congress passed these laws and people look at me like it's my fault.''
Despite the concerns of some judges and lawyers, the public mood regarding even low-level participation in drug trafficking seems clear, at least in Judge Keep's district.
''The last four cases I've tried have been this kind of case,'' she said. ''And the juries have been out less than an hour.''
 
'Harsh Action' Required
Not all judges agree that the law's penalties are unduly strict. Last December, it fell to Federal District Judge David W. Williams of Los Angeles to impose only the second mandatory sentence of life without parole under the drug law. The 22-year-old dealer, who had three prior offenses related to cocaine, was arrested on charges of possession for sale of about five ounces of crack.
''We are in a war on drugs and it does require harsh action,'' Judge Williams said. ''It deals harshly with a lot of people, but it may get some people out of the business.''
Judge Williams, noting that the convicted dealer told the police that he had been cheated out of $500,000 in profits by gang members, said, ''This man is not a mule: he's an operator.''
Another concern often expressed by many judges is that the surge in drug cases is overwhelming the Federal courts, to the point that the anti-drug effort is being sabotaged. According to a report by the Federal Courts Study Committee, a 15-member panel appointed by William H. Rehnquist, the Chief Justice of the United States, to propose ways to improve the Federal judicial system, the sheer volume of drug cases has become the most pressing problem now facing the Federal courts.
 
Civil Lawsuits Crowded Out
The report says the growing backlog threatens access to the Federal courts by those pressing civil lawsuits, because the law requires that criminal cases be given priority.
''People such as those bringing Federal civil rights cases will have the legal right to file but will be unable to get into court,'' said Steven G. Gallagher, counsel to the study committee.
At some point, the drug case backlog will threaten the war on drugs itself when the flood of cases cannot be prosecuted in a timely manner as required under the Federal Speedy Trial Act, the report says.
''We're desperate in this district to try them,'' Judge Keep said of drug defendants, ''before they have to be dismissed because they were not given a speedy trial.''
Historically, about 95 percent of all Federal criminal cases involve plea bargaining; only a small number go to trial. But because mandatory sentences in drug cases leave the accused with nothing to gain by pleading guilty to a lesser offense, more and more cases are going to trial.
 
'Federal Day' Proposal
The proposed anti-crime legislation pending in the Senate, sponsored by Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat, would create a ''Federal day,'' designating one day each month in which everyone arrested by the state authorities for felony drug violations would have their cases prosecuted in Federal court, where sentences tend to be tougher. The proposal is opposed by the Justice Department.
Barry Portman, the Federal public defender here, called the idea a ''publicity relations ploy to make it appear the Democrats are rougher on crime than the Republicans.''
He added, ''We'll have people plucked out of the state system getting 10 times greater sentences in the Federal system - just the kind of extremes uniform sentencing laws were meant to destroy.''

The fetish of footnotes, or the folly of trying to eradicate the profession's enduring weeds.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
It was supposedly Noel Coward who once complained that encountering a footnote was ''like going downstairs to answer the doorbell while making love.'' Or was it John Barrymore, and was his choice of verbs more pungent? For further information, see footnote 23 in ''Footnote#1 Skulduggery#2 and other Bad Habits#3,'' by Arthur D. Austin of Case Western Reserve Law School.
Professor Austin clearly has a fetish about footnotes, those agglomerations of type that protrude upward like stalagmites from the bottom of most pages of most law reviews. The typical legal scholar, a wit once wrote, ''may not assert so much as 'the sun rises in the east' without citing Copernicus'' (see Coleman, Student Lawyer, Feb. 1989), and Professor Austin tries to explain why. 
He has already found two publications, the law reviews at Vanderbilt and the University of Arizona, masochistic enough to print his iconoclastic views. Last year, he addressed the subject at the National Conference of Law Reviews. Now, in his ''Skulduggery'' article, coming soon to a law library near you in the University of Miami Law Review, he tackles it again.
Ridiculing footnotes is nothing new. Fifty-two years ago, Fred Rodell of Yale called them ''the flaunted Phi Beta Kappa keys of legal writing,'' and little has changed.
Footnotes still help allay the lingering fear that legal scholarship is to scholarship as military justice is to justice as military music is to music (see Clemenceau). But Professor Austin maintains the problem has become even worse.
The last decade, he notes, has yielded a record for footnotes in a single article - 4,824, in Arnold S. Jacobs's ''An Analysis of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,'' a piece that also set a record for consecutive see infras (16). The 1980's also brought perhaps the longest footnote (No. 317 in Sciarrino, ''Free Exercise in the Defamation Forest: Are 'New Religions' Lost?,'' which consumes five solid pages of agate type) and the highest percentage of ids since Freud (444 out of 574 footnotes in Buchanan, ''Comparative Analysis of Name and Likeness Rights in the United States and England'').
What accounts for this scourge? Professor Austin explains the many functions footnotes serve in addition to elucidating texts. For as maligned as footnotes are, he writes, they have many constituencies. Indeed, the footnote lobby is as entrenched in legal academia as the tobacco lobby is in Congress.
For authors, footnotes offer an easy way to look scholarly or curry collegial favor. For schools, they make faculties appear more productive. For editors, they help fill issues. For legal researchers, they provide a livelihood. And for readers, they afford the thrill of turning the pages of turgid texts with lightning speed.
Some citations are, like Piltdown man, outright hoaxes. In an article on the duty to wear seat belts, in the University of Washington Law Review, two professors said - apparently as a prank - that a certain Earl of Andrews once declared: ''Quoth, what fool darest upon the highways of this realm without properly strapping his ass to his cart?'' The man, and the quote, were bogus.
But Professor Austin contends that other footnotes, while less explicitly fraudulent, are no more legitimate. Some are soapboxes for ideologues. Others provide authors with a chance to razzle-dazzle readers or escape the editorial straitjacket of the text or simply to prove they're regular guys or Renaissance types.
Law-and-economics types throw in graphs or formulas, law-and-psychiatry types throw in Jung, law-and-literature types throw in Tolstoy, law-and-baseball types throw in Yogi Berra or, in Professor Austin's case, Reggie Jackson (in legal literature, he says, footnotes are ''the straw that stirs the drink''). ''With the Woodstock generation now retiring to the friendly bosom of academe, rock lyrics have become a popular titillator,'' he writes, noting how Martha Minow of Harvard recently cited the singer Holly Near.
Footnotes provide an easy way to butter up colleagues. For junior professors, they win friends and influence people - particularly people on tenure committees. Acknowledging Laurence Tribe or Richard Posner, even if their contributions were minimal, is a bit like stamping ''Reg. Penna. Dept. Agr.'' on a box of Lorna Doones: that is, it is a sign of wholesomeness and quality. It is also a poor substitute for the kind of peer review found in other disciplines.
In a mere 16 pages of text, Professor Austin's article had 161 footnotes. Reading it is a bit like playing a Bach toccata and having to look not only at the keys of the organ but also at the pedals below.
Of course, it's his way of making a point. But even in his more scholarly efforts, he says, he can't escape footnotes. ''I try to be economic as possible, but I have to play the game,'' he said. Why?
See supra.

HEADLINE: Johnson Leaving as No. 2 at Fed

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Manuel H. Johnson, an important voice of conciliation on the Federal Reserve Board and a leading expert on international finance, announced today that he would resign from the board in August when his term as vice chairman expires.
Mr. Johnson, whose resignation was no surprise here or on Wall Street, will move to George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., where he will hold an endowed chair in international economics and direct the school's Center for Global Markets. He also plans to start a nonprofit organization to study and promote international economic coordination.
In recent years, votes of the Federal Open Market Committee, the arm of the Federal Reserve that sets monetary policy, have been lopsided, so Mr. Johnson's departure is not likely to lead to a change in policy.The committee consists of the seven Federal Reserve Board governors and the presidents of five Federal Reserve banks. 
The Fed has left credit policy unchanged for the last six months, and outside analysts say they see no sign of a change of course soon. Mr. Johnson said in an interview that he was generally pleased with the current state of the economy. That appears to be the view of Alan Greenspan, the chairman, and most other members of the board.
President Bush was traveling today, and there was no word from the White House or the Treasury about a replacement for Mr. Johnson. Administration officials said that Mr. Johnson had not been in line to succeed Mr. Greenspan as chairman of the board and that his resignation had nothing to do with whether Mr. Greenspan would be renominated when his term is up next year.
In a statement issued by his office today, Mr. Greenspan said he regretted but understood Mr. Johnson's decision to resign and added: ''The vice chairman and I have been an effective team. I'll miss him.''
Mr. Johnson's position on setting monetary policy has been somewhat different from Mr. Greenspan's. The chairman's view, which is the prevailing one, is that the Fed should maintain interest rates high enough to keep economic growth somewhat below its potential. The resulting slack in product and labor markets, Mr. Greenspan argues, slows the rate of inflation.
Mr. Johnson has argued that the economy's potential for growth cannot be measured accurately enough to be the standard for monetary policy. Instead, he has proposed that policy be guided by a set of financial indicators, including the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short- and long-term interest rates.
Despite the difference, Mr. Johnson did not cast dissenting votes on monetary policy. He did, however, occasionally dissent on issues that reflected his general disapproval of intervention in international currency markets.
Mr. Johnson was an Assistant Treasury Secretary and an outspoken proponent of supply-side economics when Ronald Reagan nominated him four years ago.
But he proved to be most concerned about controlling inflation and cautious about roiling markets. In fact, his personality much more than his ideology marked Mr. Johnson's term as vice chairman.
 
A 'Fence-Building Influence'
 Just before Mr. Johnson joined the Federal Reserve Board, Preston Martin, his predecessor, led a palace revolt against the tight-money policies of Paul A. Volcker, who was then chairman. The board was deeply divided, and Mr. Johnson, a soft-spoken Alabamian, worked hard to bring the different factions together. He continued in that role after Mr. Greenspan became chairman in 1987.
''He has been a healing, moderating, fence-building influence,'' said James F. Smith, a former Federal Reserve staff member who is now professor of finance at the University of North Carolina Business School.
Mr. Johnson, 41 years old, said he had decided to leave because he was unwilling to commit himself to another four-year term as vice chairman. He has two small children, and friends said he had begun to worry about financing their education.
Mr. Bush can either elevate a current board member to the vice chairmanship or nominate Mr. Johnson's successor on the board to the No. 2 position. Some people outside the Government suggested that Mr. Bush might promote David W. Mullins Jr., who went on the board early this year, but officials said that was uninformed speculation. Mr. Mullins had been Assistant Treasury Secretary for Domestic Finance.
The vice chairman presides over meetings in the chairman's absence but normally has little more influence than other Fed governors.
Mr. Johnson is the only board member now who specializes in international finance, and some have suggested that the President might name someone expert in that field. One person in that category is David W. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.

HEADLINE: Argentina Pays Debt Interest

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Trying to improve relations with its foreign creditors, Argentina met today with leading banks in New York and made a $40 million interest payment.
The payment was only a small part of the $6.1 billion in past-due interest, but it was a tangible sign that Argentina's leaders want to regain access to world financial markets. Since Argentina defaulted on its debts two years ago, it has been unable to borrow for long-term projects and has had difficulty financing its foreign trade. Argentina owes foreign banks about $30 billion. 
The negotiations between 13 large banks and Javier Gonzalez Fraga, vice president of Argentina's central bank, are the first since Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady began in early 1989 to encourage banks to forgive some loans to debtor countries like Argentina. Large borrowers that have arranged debt forgivness under the Brady plan include Mexico and the Philippines.
 
Relations With the I.M.F.
 Before meeting with the banks, Argentina had patched up its relations with the International Monetary Fund so that the fund would resume disbursements from a $1.4 billion loan, which Argentina could use for a variety of purposes, including payments to creditors. The country recently received about $240 million from the I.M.F. and another $240 million is expected this summer.
When it agreed to resume lending to Argentina, the I.M.F. urged the Argentine Government to make a token interest payment to the banks to help get negotiations started. The I.M.F. and the bankers are encouraged that the economic policies of Argentina's new President, Carlos Saul Menem, appear to be making progress, although the country is in a recession. Inflation has fallen to a monthly rate of 11 percent in April from a high of 96 percent in March, and the Government is accumulating a budget surplus.
''The biggest challenge for Argentina is to keep its budget in surplus,'' said an economist who follows the country's program. The economist, who asked not to be identified, said Argentina might accumulate a trade surplus this year of $5 billion.
The Associated Press reported that Argentina was seeking an agreement to pay the banks $300 million in interest by the end of this year. Banking officials said they were seeking more, but were currently talking about monthly payments of $40 million.
Analysts expect that the package to be negotiated with Argentina will give the banks significantly less than the 65 cents on the dollar they received from Mexico or the 50 cents on the dollar from the Philippines.
In the market that has developed for trading the loans of troubled debtor countries, Argentina's loans were offered today at about 14.75 cents on the dollar, little changed on the day. Earlier this year, Argentine loans traded as low as 9.5 cents on the dollar.
 
Debts of $62 Billion
Argentina has total medium- and long-term foreign debts of $62 billion, and it is the third-largest debtor among the less-developed countries, following Brazil and Mexico.
Bankers, who hope that the debts of Argentina and Brazil may be reorganized this year, noted that both countries have taken steps in recent months to cut inflation and make economic changes. The Government of Brazil, which stopped paying its $77 billion of foreign bank loans in September 1989 and owes more than $5 billion in interest, has sharply reduced its inflation by freezing most bank accounts.
Brazil, like Argentina, is trying to reach an agreement with the I.M.F. before negotiating with its bank lenders. Brazilian officials have declined to schedule a formal meeting with a committee of bank lenders, but they have been meeting sporadically with individual banks.
American banking regulators are scheduled to meet on Monday to judge the quality of bank loans to less-developed countries and tell the banks which loans, if any, must be written off as a loss. The regulators are not expected to require that banks write off as a loss any loans to Brazil or additional amounts of their loans to Argentina.
''The fact that Brazil has taken measures to reform its economy would loom very large'' in the eyes of regulators, said John Hazeltine, director of banking at the Institute for International Finance, a Washington organization financed by large banks.

HEADLINE: Iacocca Says He Will Stay At Chrysler's Helm Past '91

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 7

 BODY:
Seeking to allay concerns among investors, dealers and employees that a leadership vacuum could develop at the Chrysler Corporation, Lee A. Iacocca said today that he would stay on as chairman beyond December 1991.
The 65-year-old executive had previously said he would make a decision on his retirement by the end of 1991, when his current contract expires.
Mr. Iacocca's decision to stay came at Chrysler's regular monthly board meeting today in New York. No retirement date was set, and a spokesman for the company said board members had not yet negotiated a new contract with Mr. Iacocca. 
Automotive analysts expressed dismay last week when Chrysler's vice chairman, Gerald Greenwald, resigned. Mr. Greenwald signed a five-year contract to become chairman and chief executive of UAL Inc., which owns United Airlines, if financing can be lined up for the proposed employee buyout of UAL.
Two other top Chrysler executives, the corporate treasurer and an executive vice president, announced plans in recent weeks to leave. While Chrysler appeared to handle those departures in stride, Mr. Greenwald's decision seemed to rattle Wall Street, and some analysts expressed concern that the company's management lacked depth and experience.
''Clearly there is a crisis of confidence among the white-collar rank and file, dealers and, to some extent, investors,'' said Joseph S. Phillippi, an automotive analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton.
Robert M. Barboza, who owns a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership in Raynham, Mass., said: ''It's good that he isn't leaving with auto business tough as it is, because he is a seasoned auto pro. There are people who can do Mr. Greenwald's job, but Mr. Iacocca is very essential for us to keep selling cars.''
''With Iacocca at the helm, we feel kind of stable,'' said Aaron Taylor, president of Local 7 of the United Automobile Workers union, which represents 3,500 unemployed hourly workers whose hope for the future depends on an unfinished Chrysler plant in Detroit.
In a statement issued by the company, Mr. Iacocca, who earned $1.4 million in salary and bonus last year, said one of his primary responsibilities would be to arrive at an orderly succession plan. ''We're going to do that according to our own timetable, and it won't be driven by a big X on a calendar,'' he said.
Chrysler wasted little time dividing Mr. Greenwald's management duties among other ranking executives. But today's announcement is likely to go further in calming the jitters of nervous investment analysts, many of whom said last week that they had hoped for a signal from Mr. Iacocca that he would stay past 1991.
 
More Competition Expected
 ''I think this is an indication that Iacocca will be more of a hands-on manager than he has been in the last few years,'' said David Healy, an auto industry analyst for Barclays Bank in New York. ''He has said the 90's are going to be so highly competitive. I think he still wants to be there to run the show.''
In the current competition for American car and truck buyers, Chrysler has been bloodied more than its rivals. Chrysler's market share for the first five months of the year stands at 8.9 percent, nearly two full points below the 10.7 percent market share it posted through May of last year.
The company's decision to drop its subcompact Omni and Horizon models and reduce sales to rental fleets accounts for a portion of the decline in market share. But Chrysler has also been losing ground in the remainder of its car models. Even more worrisome to Chrysler is the new competition to its mini-vans and Jeeps, which have been vital sources of profits.
Chrysler stock has seesawed in the week since Mr. Greenwald made his departure official, trading between $15.375 and $16.625 before losing some of its price at the end of the week. The shares rose 12.5 cents each today, closing at $16.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.

How a Trade Pact Could Aid Soviets

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
The trade agreement signed by President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Washington summit meeting still has high hurdles to clear before it takes effect.
Foremost among these is the Jackson-Vanik requirement that to achieve most-favored-nation tariff status from the United States, countries must grant liberal emigration rights to their citizens. Mr. Gorbachev has liberalized emigration policy for Soviet Jews. But Mr. Bush, although he signed the agreement granting most-favored-trade status to the Soviet Union last week, said he would not submit the agreement to the Senate for ratification until the Soviet legislature, the Supreme Soviet, enacted a satisfactory emigration law.
Although he has not required codification of emigration rights from China and other Eastern European countries to gain most-favored-nation status, Mr. Bush apparently wants a law from the Soviets to insure against on-again, off-again swings in exit rights for Soviet Jews, as occurred under previous Soviet leaders. 
Indeed, during the summit talks, Mr. Gorbachev raised anxieties that he might do the same, warning that he might withdraw exit permission from Soviet Jews if Israel settled many of them in the West Bank, which he regarded as Arab territory. Soviet officials later said that Mr. Gorbachev had not threatened to restrict Jewish emigration in response to Arab pressures.
The Soviets have, in fact, been working on a new emigration law, and a draft was given to Jonathan J. Halperin, president of FYI Information Resources, an American company specializing in analyses of Soviet affairs, by a Soviet official.
The law establishes ''the right to exit from and enter the U.S.S.R.'' but states various reasons why a Soviet citizen ''can temporarily be denied the possibility to go abroad.'' These include ''reasons affecting state security of the U.S.S.R. - until the circumstances constituting an impediment for his going abroad cease to exist.''
An even broader clause in the draft law provided that a Soviet citizen may not be allowed to leave when the refusal ''is dictated by the need to protect public order, health and morality of the population - until the circumstances constituting impediment to exit the country cease to exist.'' But that clause has apparently been deleted from the latest draft of the law. Heated debates over the draft law took place in Moscow during the weeks before the Washington summit meeting, but no action is expected until the fall.
How important is it for the Soviet Union to pass a law that will satisfy Mr. Bush and Congress and earn it most-favored-nation treatment from the United States? Soviet officials visiting this country this week said the trade status was extremely important ''psychologically'' and ''symbolically,'' but not urgent economically in the short run because of the relatively low level of Soviet-American trade and the limited export potential of the staggering Soviet economy. Mr. Bush signed the agreement on most-favored treatment to demonstrate good will and the prospect of future benefits.
And most-favored trade should, in the longer run, in fact mean big benefits for the Soviet Union in money terms. Its exports are currently hampered by the tariff rates set by the highly protectionist Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1929. For instance, tariffs on various Soviet textile fabrics now range from 40 percent to 83.5 percent; these would fall to a range of 3.4 percent to 16 percent. Duties on chess sets, now 35 percent, would drop to 3.5 percent. On average, duties on Soviet goods would fall to 5 percent from 40 percent.
Most-favored-nation tariffs would make the Soviet Union a far more attractive place for many American companies to locate manufacturing plants, for export sales back to the United States or other Western countries.
But the Soviets' lack of most-favored trade is only one of many factors discouraging foreign investment there. The trade agreement would deal with problems in cutting red tape for American business activities, for example providing access to all advertising media and extending rights to hire directly local employees or citizens of other countries.
But the most serious deterrent to American and other foreign investment is the inconvertibility of the ruble. Changing that will necessitate deep reform of the Soviet price system and strengthening the balance of payments. The Russians have been covering their worsening trade balance with gold, but while producing nearly 11 million ounces a year, their gold reserves have been declining.
According to Central Intelligence Agency data, Soviet gold reserves peaked at 76.1 million ounces in 1985, and were down to 74.5 million in 1987, the last year for which C.I.A. data are available. But even with that hefty war chest, total Soviet gold reserves, at current prices, are worth less than $30 billion, just about equal to the nation's net hard-currency debt to the West.
Without an internal economic overhaul and a big export push, the ruble will stay very soft and will deter foreign investment in the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Trump Aide Denies Talk Of Sales

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, June 7

 BODY:
The executive in charge of Donald J. Trump's three casinos denied today that Mr. Trump was seeking buyers for any properties and sought to dispel reports of poor casino performance, managerial dissension and widespread layoffs.
''There is no for sale sign on the Trump properties,'' said Edward M. Tracy, president and chief executive of the Trump Hotel Management Corporation, which runs the Trump gaming operation here. ''We are not shopping the properties. We are not interested in selling the properties.'' 
Mr. Tracy said the summer season at the three Trump casinos, the peak period for this resort market, would ''produce an avalanche of cash.'' He added: ''Donald Trump is thrilled. He should be thrilled.'' Mr. Tracy, at a news conference in one of the chandeliered meeting rooms of the Taj Mahal, the newest and costliest of the Trump casinos, would field no questions about the discussions Mr. Trump is conducting with his bankers in New York. Those talks are said to be aimed at renegotiating various repayment deadlines facing Mr. Trump, whose estimated $2.3 billion in debt includes $1.3 billion in mortgage bonds sold to finance his three gaming properties.
An executive from one of the banks who asked not to be identified said there had been a positive atmosphere at the negotiating table. The official said the negotiations were expected to continue on Friday.
Mr. Tracy declined to say whether Trump's Castle, the financial laggard of the three, was prepared to make a $22.6 million payment to bondholders due on June 15.
What he chiefly wished to discuss, he said, was the ''fabulous'' performance of the three casinos during May, and their prospects for the months ahead.
He said the Taj, which is twice the size of any other casino here, collected $36.4 million in casino revenue and $14 million in other revenue for the month - a daily average of $1.6 million. That is well above the lavish casino's break-even point, which he said was likely to fluctuate between $1.1 million and $1.3 million a day, according to the volume of business.
Mr. Tracy did not cite the revenues per square foot at the Taj - a significant calculation since the casino is twice the size of any of its rivals. Recent figures provided by A. C. Action, a newsletter for the gaming industry here, showed that the giant casino's revenues were about $304.40 a square foot in May, which placed it eighth in the citywide rankings and below the city average of $342.40 a square foot.
Mr. Tracy also boasted of the record-setting revenues at the Trump Plaza in May. The Plaza revenues were more than $31 million, on which the estimated operating profit was more than $9 million, he said. But he did not mention that almost $10 million of the Trump Plaza's May revenues represented the losses of Akio Kashawagi, a high-stakes Japanese gambler who stalked angrily out of the casino after his losses and vowed not to return to any Trump property because of a dispute with Mr. Tracy over his credit limit.
As for the Trump's Castle casino, Mr. Tracy said gross revenues declined by about 2 percent in May in the face of competition from the Taj. ''But we were thrilled it didn't decline more than it did,'' he said.
In response to questions, Mr. Tracy said that if there were any morale problems or dissension in the executive ranks at the Trump casino facilities, ''I have no knowledge of that.'' None of the three casino presidents on the dais with him - W. Bucky Howard of the Taj, Gary Selesner of the Plaza and Anthony Calandra of the Castle - made any comment throughout the news conference.
Mr. Tracy confirmed that some vendors were being paid less promptly now than in the past, but he said that was simply the result of better cash-management techniques.
''The Trump Organization has always had a reputation for always having paid everything absolutely on time,'' he said. ''But I have a little bit different view on life.'' In his view, he said, ''On time is a relative term.'' At present, payments to vendors are being made anywhere from 30 to 120 days, he said, depending on the vendors.
Mr. Tracy dismissed local news reports that some 2,500 of the approximately 6,500 people working at the Taj would soon be laid off in an economy move.
While about 350 people had been dismissed since the Taj opened in early April, Mr. Tracy attributed those layoffs to the ''streamlining'' typical of any start-up casino operation.
''Will we lay off people? Absolutely,'' he said. ''But nothing close to what has been projected.'' He forecast that the Taj, at its optimum staffing levels, would employ the equivalent of 6,000 to 6,200 full-time people.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Some Managers Shunning Stocks

BYLINE: By Anise C. Wallace

 BODY:
As the Dow Jones industrial average flirts with 3,000, many market watchers are wondering whether a group of professional investors will be forced by their clients to join the rally and spend their huge sums of cash, thus pushing stock prices even higher.
But so far the almost two dozen firms that use the computer-modeling technique known as ''tactical asset allocation,'' which weighs the probable risks and returns of various investments, have not acted in unison. While some firms have increased their holdings in stocks slightly in recent weeks, others, like the Quantilogic Asset Management Company in San Francisco, have sold stocks and moved their clients' assets into Treasury bills or bonds.
Quantilogic, which invests $800 million for pension funds and other institutions, has earned one of the best investment records among managers using this strategy. In the last few years its model successfully timed the firm's shifts in and out of stocks and bonds while some firms stumbled. Last year, for instance, its pension fund accounts appreciated 29.2 percent while other firms using the technique had returns of 5 to 15 percent. This year, as stock prices have climbed, the fund managers at Quantilogic have cut their clients' holdings in stocks to only 30 percent of the portfolio. 
The firm's computer models compare stocks, bonds and short-term investments and find that stocks are now riskier than bonds. ''There is some risk to corporate earnings this late in the economic cycle,'' said A. Darrell Braswell, managing director of the firm. ''Stocks are a little overvalued.'' The computer models used by several other firms that use this form of analysis suggest a different scenario. Their models suggest that stocks should provide the best returns over the next six to twelve months. Firms like Matrix Capital Management in Stamford, Conn., New Amsterdam Partners in New York and Avatar Associates Inc. in New York have bought stocks or stock index futures over the last month to increase the equity percentage of their clients' portfolios.
The model used by Matrix suggests that stock returns, including dividends, should increase by another 10 percent, said Michael A. Petrino, the company's president. ''We expect inflation to stabilize, interest rates to come down a little and real economic growth not to be negative,'' Mr. Petrino said. If these variables continue to improve, the firm would buy more stocks, he said.
The direction taken by firms that use this computer-aided trading technique are often important signals for traders who try to determine short-term moves in the financial markets. No one knows for certain how much these money managers control for their pension fund clients. But corporate executives and consultants who monitor investment management firms estimate that it could be as high as $40 billion.
The firms' computer models analyze and rank different factors, including interest rates, inflation, corporate earnings and dividends. Unlike so-called portfolio insurance, a form of program trading popular before the 1987 market crash, tactical asset allocation is used to anticipate expected investment returns rather than in reaction to moves in the various markets. And unlike firms that use stock-index arbitrage and trade daily, these managers shift their client portfolios monthly or even less frequently.
Most of these firms do not move all of their clients' assets in or out of stocks at one time. Generally they make small incremental moves in and out of the market by buying and selling stock index futures, they say. Nevertheless, because they control such large sums for institutional investors, these firms often buy or sell millions of dollars worth of securities or stock index futures at a clip.
Some traders keep an eye on Renaissance Investment Management Inc. in Cincinnati, which in the past has made dramatic moves in and out of the stock market. For instance, after the Dow fell more than 190 points on Oct. 13, Renaissance bought stocks, raising its clients' stock holdings from zero to half its portfolio. The move was its first into stocks since mid-1987.
While some of the firm's clients have questioned the wisdom of buying stocks after shunning them at lower prices, Renaissance officials say there are important differences in today's market. ''People look at the market now and think it is expensive,'' said Frank W. Terrizzi, managing director. But he argues that some stocks are cheaper than they were in 1987, when the model said they were overvalued.
Mr. Terrizzi said the firm had not bought more stocks since October. And he declined to say what changes in his model would direct him to increase his clients' holdings in stocks to 100 percent of the portfolio. ''Our model is saying we're in the right place,'' he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Issues Rise in Light Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose slightly in light trading yesterday, as interest rates remained locked in a tight range.
''We are in a very narrow counter-trading market,'' one Government bond trader said. ''That means when prices go down by a few ticks you see some buyers, and when they go up by a few ticks you see sellers. I think it will stay that way through the end of next week at least.'' 
The announcement that Manuel H. Johnson, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, intends to resign in early August mildly surprised market participants, and bond prices dipped briefly after the news was made public.
The decline was short-lived however, and a report later in the day that showed that consumer credit growth during April was weaker than had been expected prompted some buying.
 
Fed Governor Resignation
 An analyst said that while he had been a staunch ally of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, for the last three and a half years, for market participants the real significance of Mr. Johnson's resignation would be who is chosen to replace him.
''It has become a common practice for Fed governors to resign well before their terms are about to expire,'' said Darwin L. Beck, an economist at the First Boston Corporation.
''I personally never thought that Mr. Johnson would serve out his full 14-year term. And from the market's perspective, the announcement of who will replace him might well cause more of a flurry than his resignation created.''
Mr. Johnson, who was appointed to the Fed by President Reagan on Feb. 7, 1986, became vice chairman on Aug. 4 of that year. His resignation will come at the end of his term as vice chairman. His term on the central bank would have ended Aug. 21, 2000.
As noted, the rise in Treasury prices was modest.
By late in the day, the 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 103 17/32, up 1/8 point, to yield 8.42 percent. Late Wednesday the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.43 percent.
 
Treasury Note Issues
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 27/32, up 1/32, to yield 8.44 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 10/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 8.32 percent.
Treasury bill rates were little changed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.69 percent late yesterday, up one basis point, or hundredth of a point. Rates on six-month bills dipped by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.58 percent. And one-year bill rates also fell by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.49 percent.
Activity in the tax-exempt securities market was highlighted by a successful sale of $4.1 billion worth of tax and revenue anticipation notes for the State of New York.
Despite recent ratings downgrades, which reflect the state's poor economic prospects, the notes were sold at lower interest rates than were issues at the state's spring borrowing in March 1989.
The 6.60 percent notes sold yesterday were priced at $100.378, to yield 6.10 percent.
By contrast, the $3 billion worth of notes sold by the state in March 1989 had a coupon of 7.50 percent and were priced to yield 7 percent.
''In the final analysis, the ratings downgrade didn't effect the state that much,'' said Stanley Ciemniecki, an executive vice president in charge of municipal underwriting at Shearson Lehman Hutton, the investment bank that acted as lead manager on yesterday's negotiated underwriting. ''There was strong institutional and retail demand for these securities.''
The notes are rated MIG-2 by Moody's Investors Service and SP-1 by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Elsewhere in the municipal market, the State of Illinois offered $90 million worth of general obligation bonds at competitive bid.
A bid from a syndicate led by Prudential-Bache Securities won the issue, which consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1991 to 2011. Coupons on the bonds range from 5.80 percent in 1991 to 6.95 percent in 2011.
The issue is rated Aaa by Moody's and AA-plus by Standard & Poor's.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Whirlpool Corporation offered $200 million of 10-year securities through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The 9.5 percent notes, which mature June 13, 2000, were priced at $99.875, to yield 9.519 percent, 1.05 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is noncallable for life, is rated A-2 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
Prices of most actively traded bonds in the secondary market for tax-exempt securities rose by about 1/8 point, traders said. Prices of widely quoted corporate bonds were unchanged on the day.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell sharply in the week ended May 28.
The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets, but analysts said that the sharp slowing in money growth over the last two months could be a worry should it continue much longer.
''If this kind of pace continues through June, people at the Fed will probably start to get concerned,'' said Wayne Smith, an economist at Ried Thunberg & Company, an investment advisory firm in Westport, Conn.

HEADLINE: Don't Test Mandela on Israel

BYLINE: By Alisa Solomon; Alisa Solomon is a member of Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, a group of religious leaders, professionals and community organizers.

 BODY:
Nelson Mandela is on his way to Geneva to meet with leaders of half a dozen mainstream American Jewish organizations who are asking him to clarify his position on Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Mr. Mandela's answers will determine not only how but whether several major Jewish organizations, such as the American Jewish Congress and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, welcome Mr. Mandela to New York City on June 20. Will Mr. Mandela utter the magic words these men want to hear?
What troubles many Jewish leaders is what they call Mr. Mandela's ''embrace'' of Yasir Arafat. Mr. Mandela has met with Mr. Arafat twice and has expressed his sympathy with the P.L.O.'s cause of self-determination for the Palestinian people. 
Spokespersons for Jewish organizations have told me that if Mr. Mandela says in Geneva that there is no question that Israel exists, that won't be enough. If he says that Israel should live with guaranteed security beside a Palestinian state, that won't be enough either. Only the magic phrase ''Israel has a right to exist'' will do. Even then, he better not add a word more. If his response is inadequate, Mr. Mandela will be greeted by a variety of protests on his visit.
The Jewish community's decision to stand up for a cause of such clear moral rectitude as the fight to end apartheid should not be held hostage to this litmus test. With a sly trick of a trope, Mr. Mandela's physical greeting of Mr. Arafat - clasping shoulders - is employed for metaphorical duty. Saying that he has ''embraced'' Mr. Arafat is meant to imply that he adopts everything Mr. Arafat has ever said or done. Mr. Mandela has done no such thing.
He has - as has the African National Congress - supported the call for Palestinian rights. So have countless American Jews. So have countless Israelis. Indeed, members of the Knesset and Israeli military officers have long argued that Israel's security depends on Palestinian self-determination in the West Bank and Gaza. Obviously, there is no majority position on this matter in Israel, but it is openly debated. Only among America's mainstream Jewish leadership is discussion denied.
As a result, the mainstream Jewish leaders misrepresent the people for whom they claim to speak. Opinion polls show that the majority of American Jews support a land-for-peace compromise between Israel and Palestinians in the occupied territories. And a poll funded by the Israel-Diaspora Institute, an Israeli policy center, has revealed that the leaders don't even speak their own minds. A full 76 percent of leaders of American Jewish groups back trading land on the West Bank and Gaza for peace.
Clearly, then, American Jews and their purported leaders have no trouble recognizing that supporting Palestinian rights and supporting Israel's existence are not mutually exclusive. Then why assume that because Mr. Mandela speaks out for Palestinians he is attacking Israel's existence, especially since the A.N.C. has never questioned Israel's status?
Many mainstream Jewish leaders object to Mr. Mandela calling Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza ''a unique form of colonialism.'' Even if one disagrees, it's understandable that the leader of a third-world liberation movement would use such terms to describe a situation in which 1.5 million people live under military occupation without the right to vote.
What's more, Mr. Mandela has good reason to be wary of Israel, which continues to sell arms to South Africa. While it's true that Israel need not be singled out for special criticism - plenty of other countries trade with South Africa - Israel must not be excused, either.
There are Jews and Jewish organizations that will honor Mr. Mandela. Rabbis will participate in interfaith services, and Jews for Racial and Economic Justice will hold a Sabbath service. Yet Jewish right-wing fringe groups threaten to dog Mr. Mandela as he races from event to event, protesting his ''Communist'' platform.
But mainstream Jewish organizations claim to speak for the Jewish community at large; they are the ones to whom journalists go for quotes; they have the resources to take out ads proclaiming their views. As such, they should be counted among those welcoming Mr. Mandela, a moral voice for human rights all over the world.

HEADLINE: SHAMIR ANNOUNCES A NEW GOVERNMENT OF THE RIGHT WING

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, June 8

 BODY:
With his final deadline only hours away, Acting Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir announced tonight that he had succeeded in forming a new Government, the most conservative ever in Israel.
The announcement appears to have brought an end to almost three months of bargaining and bickering that kept Israel from dealing with a wave of Soviet Jewish immigrants, a continuing economic crisis and a hardening of attitudes among its Arab neighbors.
''This ceremony marks the end of much effort by many parties,'' Mr. Shamir said as his Likud party and its proposed partners - nine religious or far-right parties and individuals -signed an agreement on the new Government's terms and priorities.
 
Priority for Immigration
Chief among those priorities, the document says, is ''dealing with the massive immigration that's coming here and its absorption.'' 
Also on the list is a commitment to ''strengthen, expand and develop'' Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip - a position that may send Israel into a period of confrontation with its main ally and benefactor, the United States.
Though the document's language appears to avoid explicit promises to increase the number of settlers or settlements in the occupied territories, the Bush Administration opposes any expansion of the settlements. And not one member of the new Government advocates pursuing Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's plan for initiating Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
 
Faces Parliament Monday
The new Government is not official until it is approved by Parliament on Monday, and in the meantime Mr. Shamir must satisfy a two-seat religious party, Torah Flag, which signed the accord today but has not signed the formal coalition agreement.
But even assuming that that problem is resolved and the new Government is approved on Monday, it will have only 62 supporters in the 120-seat Parliament, including one 2-seat far-right party, Moledet, that agreed to vote for approval of the Government but declined to join it.
''This Government, you can say for sure, will represent the majority of the population in Israel,'' Mr. Shamir told the Israeli television tonight.
But in a national opinion poll published in an Israeli newspaper this week, only 14 percent of the country's Jewish population said they favored the establishment of a government consisting solely of right-wing and religious parties. Such a government has never been in power in the 42 years since Israel's independence.
Three far-right Likud members who dogged Mr. Shamir for the last year, repeatedly accusing him of leaning too far left, have been given the most senior positions.
David Levy, whose best-known recent action as Housing Minister was to authorize the secret $1.8 million Government financing of the disputed Jewish settlement in the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City, has been promised the Foreign Ministry.
Ariel Sharon, the former Defense Minister whose resignation as Trade Minister last winter set off the Government crisis that seems only now to be ending, is to head the Housing Ministry, which subsidizes housing for Jewish settlers in the occupied territories. He will also be the immigration chief, in charge of coordinating Government policy toward the resettlement of immigrating Soviet Jews, who are now arriving at the rate of more than 10,000 a month.
 
Sharon Wants More Settlements
Mr. Sharon is an outspoken advocate of increased Jewish settlement in the occupied territories, and as Housing Minister he will have broad authority to promote his views and perhaps even to increase the small number of Soviet Jews who move to the West Bank and Gaza.
Yitzhak Modai, the dissident Likud Minister who before agreeing to join the Likud coalition in April demanded a $10 million personal bond to insure that Mr. Shamir's promises would be kept, is to be the Finance Minister.
Acting Foreign Minister Moshe Arens is to be Defense Minister.
Without necessarily referring to any of these appointments, Mr. Shamir, like others in his party, professed no great enthusiasm for the proposed new Government. Asked if he was satisfied, he said, ''We'll see after it is established and begins its work.''
The crisis began in March when the Labor Party, the junior partner in a coalition with Likud but unhappy that Mr. Shamir had refused to accept the American proposal for peace talks, brought the Government down with a parliamentary vote of no confidence.
 
Bad Gamble for Peres
The Labor Party leader, Shimon Peres, was jubilant at the time, but after five weeks of trying he was unable to form a new governing majority.
In retrospect, Mr. Peres's gamble 11 weeks ago could hardly have produced worse results for him. The Labor Party is now essentially powerless, in opposition, and former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin is challenging Mr. Peres for the party leadership.
The proposed new Government will be so unstable that if even one of the smallest two-seat parties grows unhappy and pulls out, the Government will be just one vote short of collapse.
The three small parties - Tehiya, with three seats, Tsomet, with two, and Moledet, with two - all advocate holding onto the West Bank and Gaza Strip forever. And Moledet, which plans to support the Government without joining it, urges the expulsion of the Arab population from the territories.
So Mr. Shamir, now one of the most liberal members of his new Government, is less likely to push even his own modest plan for regional peace than he was when he was in coalition with Mr. Peres and Labor.
 
Three Individuals Join
The other new coalition partners are the National Religious Party, a right-wing and moderately Orthodox group that has five seats, and two rigorously Orthodox parties - the Sephardic Torah Guardians, or Shas, with five seats, and Torah Flag, with two. Two dissident former members of rigorously Orthodox parties also signed with Likud as independents.
And just as the Labor Party lured a Likud member away seven weeks ago, only to see him return to Likud after Labor failed, so Likud has lured away a senior member of Labor, Mordechai Gur, a former Army Chief of Staff. Likud itself has 40 seats. Mr. Peres was bitter over that today and said Mr. Shamir's new Government ''was born in sin.''
''I don't think this new Government will solve problems,'' he added. ''It will cause problems.''
Mr. Shamir, meanwhile, acknowledged that keeping the new Government from collapse ''will not be easy.''
 
INTERNAL MATTER, BUSH SAYS
OMAHA, June 8 (Reuters) - President Bush said today that Israel's forming of a new right-wing Government was an internal matter for the Israelis, and that United States policy toward Arab-Israeli peace talks would stay the same.
''Israel can do what it wants with its government, and I'll work with whomever that country puts forward as their government,'' he said. ''But they know the policy of the United States on peace talks. U.S. policy is firm. We want the peace talks to begin.''

HEADLINE: New York Agencies Push Huge Queens Development

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
In a plan that is being pressed with unusual urgency at City Hall, three public development agencies in New York City and several prominent business executives are trying to build a small new city along the East River in Queens.
The project, planned along 1.25 miles of waterfront in the Hunters Point section of Long Island City, would include 6,300 apartments, a hotel and offices in 15 buildings across the river from the United Nations building in Manhattan. The site is blighted by rundown warehouses and industrial buildings.
The plan is under review by the city's Planning Commission, and is expected to be put to a vote by the Board of Estimate in August as one of its last acts before it is disbanded under the revised City Charter. Some critics, however, charge that the public agencies are moving too quickly through the approval process. 
If approved, the Hunters Point project could be a model for redevelopment of old industrial space along New York City's waterfront, which many regard as a vast, underutilized asset. It would also give Queens its biggest economic boost in decades, attracting thousands of affluent new residents and supporting other new development of retail space and offices.
''We deserve this project,'' said Claire Shulman, the Borough President of Queens and a leading advocate of the plan. Like other Borough Presidents, who are on the Board of Estimate, her influence over the Hunters Point project will be reduced in August when the board's land use review powers pass to the City Council and the Planning Commission.
 
Difficult Questions for Dinkins
The Queens plan could pose difficult questions for Mayor David N. Dinkins, who said during his campaign last year that he favored a balanced approach to development that would provide low- and moderate-income housing, open space, recreation and other neighborhood improvements.
Most of the apartments at Hunters Point are being designed as market-rate housing, with two-bedroom apartments priced at $250,000 or more. Nonetheless, Sally Pinero-Hernandez, the deputy mayor for finance and economic development, said the project was being supported vigorously at City Hall.
It is hard to find anyone who objects to redeveloping the gritty, 70-acre Long Island City waterfront site, which commands New York's most expansive view of midtown Manhattan and has no housing. But critics say that because the current Hunters Point proposal has attracted so large a network of investors and is approaching approval without a developer or detailed plan for improvements to roads and subways, it has become questionable.
The plan has gone through several revisions. An earlier version envisioned a 50-50 mix of office space and apartments, but the mix has been changed to 80 percent residential and 20 percent commercial space.
The Public Development Corporation, one of the project's sponsors, said this week that it had told representatives of the neighborhood around the Hunters Point site that open space and playground would be increased to 19.2 acres from 16.7, and that a preschool and kindergarten would be built by whoever is chosen as the developer.
The agency also said some of the new housing at the riverfront site would be set aside for elderly or low-income tenants, but that it was too early to determine how much.
The negotiations did not satisfy all complaints.
 
'Behind the Scenes'
''We still don't have confidence in what is going on behind the scenes,'' said Walter L. McCaffrey, a City Councilman whose district includes the Hunters Point site. He added that the plan was being rushed through city approvals in a way that gave residents far too little information.
The plan is different from most other developments that have been sponsored by New York government agencies or involved publicly owned land. A third of the 70-acre Hunters Point site is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which has budgeted $125 million for the project. Another $30 million has been budgeted by the city.
For the first time, all three of New York's major public development agencies - the Port Authority, the city's Public Development Corporation and the New York State Urban Development Corporation - are sponsoring the plan together. The state agency, with powers to condemn property and speed environmental review, stepped in as the lead public agency in August, partly at Mrs. Shulman's request.
In most past projects, the public agencies have decided on broad guidelines, selected developers through competitive bids, and assigned them responsibility for architecture and environmental and regulatory reviews. But at Hunters Point, the agencies do not intend to select developers until those reviews are complete.
 
Investors Aggressively Buying
With the three agencies pressing forward, investors have been aggressively buying land in the development site that is not already owned by the Port Authority.
Barbara J. Fife, the deputy mayor for planning, said last month that she had stepped aside from any involvement in the project to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. Her decision followed a report in New York Newsday linking her husband, Martin Fife, to a Wall Street concern that has taken a financial stake in Hunters Point land.
Mr. Fife is an outside director of the Dreyfus Corporation, an investment firm that operates several mutual funds and deals mainly in stocks and bonds, but that recently created a new fund to invest in real estate, including land at Hunters Point. A spokesman for Dreyfus, Jack Bernstein, said Mr. Fife's responsibilities were confined to overseeing a small number of funds that deal exclusively in stocks and bonds.
Others involved rank among New York's business elite. A group headed by William Zeckendorf Jr., the developer, and Martin J. Raynes, president of a large brokerage and real estate management company, has been buying land and courting landowners in the Hunters Point site.
Mr. Zeckendorf said the group included James D. Wolfensohn, an investment banker; and a partner in Mr. Wolfensohn's firm, Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve. Victor Elmaleh, chairman of the Worldwide Group, a real estate investment firm and Arthur Cohen, another large real estate investor, are also members of the group, Mr. Zeckendorf said. Dreyfus's interests are represented by the Trotwood Corporation, an investment fund it established last year that is headed by Herbert J. Sturz, a former chairman of the New York City Planning Commission.
 
Two Japanese Concerns
Mr. Zeckendorf said the group had bought or entered into contracts to buy separate parcels that amount to 25 percent of the 70-acre site. Mr. Raynes said the group had a ''business agreement'' to purchase another major part of the site, now owned by Pepsico Inc., which operates a bottling plant on the site.
Pepsico's land would give the group nearly 50 percent of the site. The largest remaining parcel is owned by the Port Authority.
Other private interests taking part in the venture, Mr. Zeckendorf said, are two Japanese concerns, the Tekken Construction Company, which has bought a 50 percent stake in a large parcel in the Hunters Point development site, and the Tobishima Corporation, an investment concern. He added that Mr. Wolfensohn had received preliminary commitments from the Fuji Bank, a major Japanese lender, to provide financing.
Another unresolved question is how much, if any, of the housing will be set aside for subsidized low-income or elderly tenants. Mr. McCaffrey and some neighborhood groups have proposed that 20 percent of the apartments be set aside for elderly people.
But Ms. Pinero-Hernandez said Mayor Dinkins would support the project even with less than 20 percent set aside.

HEADLINE: Cuomo's Real Race

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 8

 BODY:
Four years ago, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo was swept into a second term by the biggest landslide in New York State history. He defeated his opponent, Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive, by a margin of more than 2 to 1, and carried 57 of the state's 62 counties.
 
This year, aides to the
Governor are desperately hoping to avoid a repeat of 1986.
It is not because they are uninterested in winning, and winning big. It is because in racking up the largest victory in state history, Mr. Cuomo gained a reputation for arrogance and irascibility that lent his landslide a pyrrhic quality. 
''It didn't cost him many votes,'' Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, said of the Governor's behavior in the last campaign. ''But it clearly cost him in terms of perceptions.''
 
More Refined Standards
In its broad outlines, the 1990 campaign looks so much like the 1986 campaign that the risk of repetition seems enormous. Once again Mr. Cuomo, a popular incumbent with a full campaign treasury, faces a politically unknown opponent with an empty war chest this time Pierre A. Rinfret, an economist.
Because the Governor enjoys such an overwhelming advantage, he is likely to be judged, as he was in 1986, by more refined standards than politicians are normally subjected to. The consultants and commentators who handicap the contest will be looking to see not only how strong the Governor is at the polls, but also how gracefully he handles his strength.
While it is still far too early to tell whether Mr. Cuomo will be able to avoid the kind of public relations damage that he sustained during the last campaign, it is already clear that a desire to avoid it is shaping the Governor's strategy as his campaign team, led by his son Andrew, prepares for the next election.
Perhaps the most damaging perception that arose during the 1986 campaign was that Mr. Cuomo was too aloof and arrogant to engage his opponent, Mr. O'Rourke, in a genuine race. The perception arose from the Governor's reluctance to do the kind of state-fair stumping that is a staple of most gubernatorial campaigns and from his refusal to debate his opponent more than once.
 
Campaign Trail
This year, Mr. Cuomo has pointedly pledged to act like a more down-home kind of candidate, the sort that might win points for humility. Accepting the Democratic nomination on Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo promised to drag his running mate, Stan Lundine, the Lieutenant Governor, from one end of New York to the other.
''We'll talk to them in Buffalo, and we'll travel all throughout central New York,'' he said, adding, ''I especially like the rural areas in the summer.''
Mr. Cuomo also seems anxious to avoid the accusations of selfishness that were leveled against him in 1986. Members of the State Senate's Democratic minority, who saw the campaign as their best shot at seizing the majority, complained that the tremendously popular Governor did little to put his prominence to work for his fellow Democrats.
The Governor has pledged to do better this year. ''He will not be accused of being out there for Mario Cuomo and not for the ticket,'' said an adviser who is working on the campaign. ''He's much more sensitive to that.'' Already the Governor has called at least four potential Democratic candidates and exhorted them to run for the State Senate, aides to the Governor said.
 
'Press War'
One of the greatest challenges that Mr. Cuomo faces this summer is avoiding the bruising battle with news organizations that became the story-behind-the-story of the last campaign. During that campaign, the Governor several times accused reporters of intentionally distorting their coverage to damage him.
''I didn't make me look bad; you made me look bad,'' he said at one point to a group of editors and reporters.
Known affectionately in Albany as the ''press war,'' the Governor's running contretemps with reporters in 1986 fostered the already popular image of him as testy and thin skinned, and it raised questions about whether he was temperamentally suited to a Presidential race.
''People thought, 'If this is a guy who focuses on issues, why the sideshow,?' '' said Mr. Miringoff, of the Marist Institute. ''It raised eyebrows.''
Advisers to the Governor attribute the clash to restless reporters who felt deprived of a bona fide campaign. ''In many ways the adversary was not the Republican candidate,'' said one of the Governor's closest advisers, who asked not to be identified. ''Reporters cast themselves in the role of opponent. They figured if O'Rourke wasn't going to make the case, they were. That's a game that you don't win. The Governor has to be cognizant of that and not let it happen again.''
 
Bad Times and Mickey Mouse
In an effort to prevent this campaign from turning into a five-month contest between Mr. Cuomo and the state's news organizations, advisers to the Governor are zealously trying to convince reporters that the race will not be so easy as it looks.
''You're running against incumbency, you're running against bad times and running against bad stories,'' one adviser said. ''You have to remember that Republicans would start out with 35 percent of the vote if they ran Mickey Mouse.''
In case reporters are still not taking the race seriously, the Governor's campaign staff is planning to treat them to a whistle-stop tour of upstate New York in August.
''This will be a much more active campaign than last time,'' one adviser said, ''first for the Republicans and second for the press corps.''

HEADLINE: Shepard Clough, 88; Professor and Writer Of European History

 BODY:
Dr. Shepard B. Clough, who retired after 42 years as a history professor at Columbia University, died on Thursday at Northeast Vermont Hospital in St. Johnsbury. He was 88 years old and lived in East Peacham, Vt. His son Peter said Dr. Clough (pronounced cluff) had died after a stroke.
Dr. Clough, a specialist in European economic history, wrote ''The Rise and Fall of Civilization,'' (1951), ''Basic Values in Western Civilization'' (1960), ''The Economic History of Modern Italy'' (1964) and ''The Economic Basis of American Civilization'' (1968).
He was born in Bloomington, Ind. After earning a bachelor's at Colgate University, he did postgraduate work at the Sorbonne and Heidelberg. He received a doctorate from Columbia, where he began teaching in 1928. He retired in 1970.

The Economy
 The Public Service Commission's authority to price electricity based on power saved, rather than power used, has been upheld by a New York State court. The approach, which is an attempt by regulators to reduce air pollution and cut power costs, is opposed by some large companies. They contend that if the money spent for conservation does not justify the investments, it will lead to one group of customers subsidizing another. [Page 31.] The drive to re-regulate the cable television industry gained momentum as the Senate Commerce Committee approved a bill that would let the Federal Communications Commission set guidelines on the fees cable subscribers pay to receive broadcast and public-access channels. The industry opposed it. The House is preparing its draft for the end of the month. But passage of re-regulation this year is far from certain. [35.] 
 
 
 
Markets
 Stock prices tumbled, as the Dow Jones industrial average lost 34.95 points to close at 2,862.38. The slide, the fourth in a row, left the blue-chip barometer 72.81 points below the record it set on Monday. Computerized sell programs magnified the downward trend. [31.] Prices of long-term Government securities eased, but the market in shorter Treasury maturities was essentially unchanged in unusually lackluster trading. [34.] Gold recovered a bit from its recent selling bout, with bullion for current delivery up $1.10, to $355.70 a troy ounce, on the New York Commodity Exchange. The dollar was also stronger. [39.] Cocoa futures prices were sharply lower, and grain and soybeans also declined. Crude oil and gasoline were higher. [39.]
 
International
 The American electronics industry is losing its edge in the world marketplace, the Commerce Department warned. The $200 billion-a-year giant long considered a bellwether of the country's competitiveness may well be eclipsed in this decade by Japan and newly emerging producers like South Korea, the agency said in a 221-page study. The study, ordered by Congress, could cause the White House some discomfort. [31.] Negotiations to conclude a major trade agreement between Japan and the United States before an economic summit meeting in Houston next month may be derailed, people on both sides said. There is a struggle within the Japanese Government and resistance to American demands for more specific commitments. [32.]
 
 
 
Companies
 Ames Department Stores took its biggest cost-cutting step since its April 25 filing for voluntary bankruptcy by announcing the closing of 188 stores in addition to the 33 it had previously said would be closed. Some 18,000 employees are involved in the closings, which affect about a third of the chain's stores. [31.] Gerald Greenwald will get at least $9 million to give up his post as vice chairman of the Chrysler Corporation and become head of a union effort to buy the UAL Corporation, people familiar with the plan said. If the buyout is completed, he will also be paid $1.2 million a year, plus an additional $1.2 million in the first year. [33.] Layoffs of 1,500 people are planned in Texas by Texas Instruments Inc. and the General Dynamics Corporation. The two leading military contractors cited expected military budget cuts. [33.] Donald J. Trump could give his bankers a bigger stake in his properties as he tries to persuade them to lend him more money on top of the $2 billion he already owes, a banker said. [33.]
 
 
 
Today's Columns
 Loads, as mutual fund commissions are known, are aptly named. They weigh down investors' returns, so financial experts advise becoming the educated consumer. Your Money. [32.] A method for using low-powered lasers to reverse gum disease, which troubles many middle-aged and older people, has been patented by a New York ophthalmic surgeon. Patents. [32.]

HEADLINE: Report Warns of Decline Of U.S. Electronics Industry

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
In a study that could cause the White House some discomfort, the Commerce Department warned today that the $200 billion-a-year American electronics industry, long considered a bellwether of the country's competitiveness, is losing its edge in the world market and may be eclipsed in this decade by Japan and newly emerging producers like South Korea.
Neither the conclusion nor the recommendations for future action are startling. But the study is the most comprehensive yet by any Government agency of what had generally been expected to become the country's flagship industry and biggest employer by the turn of the century. The analysis, ordered by Congress two years ago, is bound to set off more heated debate about the Government's role in promoting industrial welfare. 
So controversial has this issue become that in the foreword there is a disclaimer that the report represents only the views of the Commerce Department, and ''not necessarily'' those of the Bush Administration.
This could signal that the Administration is uncomfortable with the implications.
''If the Commerce Department does not speak for the Administration, then who does?'' asked Representative Mel Levine, a California Democrat who is co-chairman of the House Export Task Force. ''The climate is so threatening that nobody wants to face the truthful assessment of this report.''
The report found that although the United States remains the overall electronics leader, American suppliers of a broad range of products -from silicon wafers and memory chips to computer displays and telecommunications network switches -have rapidly lost their shares of the world market in the last several years.
The situation is even more bleak for some of the newest technologies, like X-ray lithography, optical storage devices and flat panel displays, the report said.
''If the current relative growth rates continue, the Japanese will be the world's No. 1 electronics producer and trader by the early 1990's,'' said the report, which was prepared by electronics sector specialists of the International Trade Administration of the Commerce Department. The report also drew on the overseas resources of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service, which monitors competitive conditions in foreign countries.
The report recommends familiar Bush Administration policy proposals: tax credits for research and development, antitrust exemptions for joint manufacturing consortiums, relaxed export-control regulations and cuts in the capital-gains tax to reduce the cost of raising capital.
Over the last decade, prominent Democrats, including the party's Presidential candidates, have warned that the Government needs to take a more active role in industrial policy. Hands-Off Policy But the Bush Administration, like the Reagan Administration, has avoided such a role, arguing that instead of picking winners and losers, the Government should create an economic atmosphere that allows all industries to flourish.
A spokeswoman for the Commerce Department said the department had decided to publish the report now rather than wait for the formal interagency clearance that would have made the report an Administration document. In response to the report, a representative of the electronics industry and some members of Congress said the Government should be doing more to promote the industry.
''The Government has to be far more creative,'' said Representative Doug Walgren, a Pennsylvania Democrat who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer Protection and Competitiveness.
Mitchell E. Kertzman, chairman of the American Electronics Association, which represents 3,500 electronics and information-processing companies, said the report ''accurately presents where the industry is, but doesn't go far enough in identifying ways in which the Government and industry can work through the problems together.'' Partnership Is Urged In a briefing for several reporters, J. Michael Farren, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade Administration, said: ''I think it's important that the Government and the private sector operate as partners, and that's something this Administration has clearly demonstrated a willingness to do.
''I've been around politics long enough that I don't want to see the political process making these decisions. You need the market to do it.''
Because it was considered a technical and analytical study under the International Trade Administration, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher asked Mr. Farren to handle the briefing, department officials said. The report noted that one of the many indicators of the American decline was the downward trend in the American share of electronics patents.
The Japanese have more than doubled the number of United States electronics patents they have received since the mid-1970's, the report said, and their patents have been licensed more frequently than those of their American counterparts.
Three Japanese companies -Canon, Hitachi and Toshiba - topped the list of companies receiving American electronics patents in 1987, the most recent year for which figures are available. Only four American companies were in the top 10. Previous Role of Government In process materials, American companies lag behind the Japanese. American companies also trail in many processing equipment technologies, like those used to produce semiconductors.
While there has never been a coordinated set of Government policies applied to the electronics sector in particular, some policies have nevertheless affected the sector's direction in a significant way.
The Defense Department, for example, has paid for much of the industry's research and development. In addition, through the huge military buildup of the last decade the Pentagon has been an important market for the industry's production. The Pentagon has also provided, through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, money to support basic research in specific electronics sectors, including high-definition television.
The study found some shortcomings in the industry itself, citing its focus on ''short-term tactical'' considerations, in contrast to the longer-term strategic perspective taken by Japanese companies.
It reported on a survey on the corporate objectives of Japanese and American executives, and noted that Japanese executives placed market share and return on investment as their first and second objectives, whereas American executives were primarily concerned with return on investment and raising the price of shares, with market share in third place.
''This downward trend in the U.S. share of patents is reflected in the declining capabilities of U.S. firms relative to the Japanese in the research and development phases of bringing key electroncs technologies to market,'' the report said.

HEADLINE: Pier 1 Finds Success Beyond Brass

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
The recent push by Pier 1 Imports Inc. into Manhattan caps a four-year overhaul that has transformed the company from a retailer of inexpensive imported goods into one selling moderately priced home furnishings for successful young professionals.
Three weeks ago, the Fort Worth-based company opened a store at 40th Street and Fifth Avenue, the first of four locations planned in Manhattan in the next three years. Pier 1 expects to open more than 80 stores nationwide this year, expanding the chain to 582 outlets.
Pier 1 is seeking new customers in new markets, but it also hopes to attract many of the same customers it had in the past - only now they have established careers and higher incomes. 
''These buyers, and there are a lot of them - about 79 million out of 230 million Americans - have about 67 percent of the discretionary income in this country,'' said Clark A. Johnson, chairman and chief executive of Pier 1. ''But they are hardly captive customers. We sell wants, as opposed to needs, so we have to earn our way into their hearts and pocketbooks.''
The new outlet in Manhattan is similar to the nearly 300 that Pier 1 has opened since 1985, when Mr. Johnson joined the company and began to spruce up its image. With an all-glass exterior that exposes two floors of merchandise to the street, the new store is bigger and more elegant than those opened before 1986.
Only one corner of the store is devoted to brass and wicker from Asia, a predominant offering in the early stores that appealed to college students in the 1960's and 70's. The rest of the space is filled with lamps, tableware, ceramics, rugs and sportswear.
While the company views department stores and large specialty stores as its main competitors, its outlets sell many of the same items as chains like the Pottery Barn and Conran's.
The repositioning has made Pier 1 one of the most closely watched and respected retail stocks on Wall Street. Today, the average customer spends $25.44 on a visit to a Pier 1 store, up from $17.46 a few years ago. In the last five years, the company's net income has grown almost 34 percent, compounded annually, and its sales have risen 24.4 percent a year.
For the fiscal year ended March 3, 1990, the chain earned $25.5 million on sales of $516.9 million. Its 5.5 percent profit margin on sales compares with the industry average of 3.5 percent.
With continued expansion, Mr. Johnson predicted, sales should double again by 1996. ''By the end of fiscal 1998,'' the tall, confident Mr. Johnson insisted, ''we will have opened our one-thousandth store.''
Analysts are impressed with the improvements. ''The company's merchandising prowess and consumer franchise are vastly stronger than they were in 1986,'' said Donald I. Trott, a specialty retail analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York.
While Kenneth M. Gassman Jr., an analyst at Wheat First Securities in Richmond, views the company as a ''high-growth retailer,'' he is cautious about whether it would thrive in a recession.
''Our only major concern is that Pier 1's merchandise appears to fill discretionary consumer needs,'' he said. ''Therefore, in an economic slowdown, it is possible that Pier 1 would feel a negative impact.''
But Mr. Gassman promptly added, ''Pier 1 targets a higher-income consumer who traditionally has not cut back on overall spending in prior economic slowdowns.''
Pier 1 now aims at a customer whose average family income is $50,000 a year. For years, the family income of its average customer was $39,000 a year.
 
Began in California
Conceived as an importer of inexpensive merchandise called Cost Plus, the company was formed in 1962 with a single store in San Mateo, Calif., featuring mostly wicker and rattan furniture. Charles Tandy, the founder of the Radio Shack chain, had made a loan to a rattan furniture wholesaler who owned a store by that name, and in return received the rights to operate shops under the name. The company expanded to 16 stores within three years.
To express the stores' exotic foreign flavor, the company changed its name to Pier 1 Imports - a name picked in a contest for store managers.
In 1966, the Tandy Corporation sold Pier 1 to a management group. The new owners continued to expand the business, and in 1970 made the 42-store chain, concentrated in the West and Southwest, a public company. Intermark Inc. purchased 58 percent of its shares and is still the biggest shareholder, with a 51 percent share.
While Pier 1's formula worked well in the 60's and 70's, it proved less successful in the 80's. Its core following, the college students of the 60's and 70's, had tired of Pier 1's inexpensive merchandise.
In 1985, management hired Mr. Johnson in hopes of putting the company back on track. Pier 1 was then operating 265 stores, each contributing almost $1 million in annual sales, and net profits were $15 million.
Mr. Johnson, who has an entrepreneur's flair and a salesman's pitch, had been honed in the highly competitive home-improvement sector - he is a former top executive of the Wickes Companies, and later as a partner of Jack Nicklaus in a sporting-equipment company.
 
Sought Advice of Customers
Mr. Johnson attacked the problems of Pier 1 head-on, by starting a series of consumer ''focus groups'' in five cities. Looking back on those discussions, in which customers were asked their perceptions of the stores and how they could be improved, Mr. Johnson said, ''They set the course for us.''
The consumers said they wanted larger stores, where it would be more convenient to see and handle the goods. They liked the merchandise, they said, but would pay more for higher-quality, more fashionable goods. Despite the popularity of shopping malls, they said they preferred free-standing stores for their convenience and ease of parking.
Putting many of these suggestions to work, Mr. Johnson urged his buyers to pick better goods and bring in additional foreign suppliers. (Today there are 44.) He also insisted that new stores be more accessible, with wider aisles and shorter shelving. Indeed, today's stores average 9,000 square feet, double the size of those opened before 1985. The company has been closing older stores and replacing them with larger ones.
 
New Policy on Returns
Hoping to insure customer satisfaction, he took the unusual step of giving store managers complete authority in handling returned goods, even on sales made months earlier. ''I know that some customers take advantage of us,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''but we feel it is a worthwhile public-relations effort on our part.''
The real test has been in the financial results, which have steadily improved. Pier 1's stock closed yesterday at $11.375 a share, down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. It has traded as high as $13.25 a share this year, and as low as $9.50.
''We look favorably on the company's stock,'' said Mr. Trott of Dean Witter. ''We estimate 1990 earnings of 90 cents a share, and $1.10 a share in 1991, against 1989's 71 cents a share.''

HEADLINE: Dow Falls by 34.95 in Fourth Straight Loss

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
The slide in stock prices extended to a fourth day yesterday as the Dow Jones industrial average fell sharply, dropping 34.95 points, to 2,862.38. The blue-chip index is now down by 72.81 from its historic high on Monday and off 38.69 from last Friday's close.
The industrial average finished the week with some computerized sell programs magnifying the trend downward in relatively light trading. Retail and technology stocks were among the weaker groups. 
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was also off, by 4.44 points, to 358.71. Declining issues outnumbered gainers, by 1,010 to 458. Volume reached 142.6 million shares, down from 160.4 million on Thursday.
''It was a sleepy market, with not a lot of volume and no conviction on the downside,'' said Tracy G. Herrick, an economist at Jefferies & Company. Soft bond prices contributed to the weakness.
Bernard Spilko, senior vice president at Bank Julius Baer in New York, said there was little news to move stocks and the fact that the Dow closed below the 2,900 mark on Thursday ''was mentally a little upsetting and that is just feeding on itself.''
Some advisers have been telling clients to sell some of the major stocks as overvalued, he said. A favorite, Walt Disney, for example, dropped 4 7/8, to 123 3/8.
Some other big stocks with losses were Eastman Kodak, off 3/4, to 41 3/4; Philip Morris, 5/8, to 44 1/4; Coca-Cola, 1/2, to 44 1/4; Procter & Gamble, 1 5/8, to 80; Merck, 1 1/2, to 80, and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, 1 1/8, to 82 7/8.
Financial stocks were mostly lower as enthusiasm about the possibility of lower interest rates waned. Among money-center banks, BankAmerica dropped 1/2, to 32; Citicorp, 1/8, to 24; Manufacturers Hanover, 7/8, to 36 5/8; J. P. Morgan, 5/8, to 37 3/4, and Chemical Banking, 1/8, to 28 3/8.
Mortgage issues also slipped. Federal Home Loan Mortgage (Freddie Mac) fell 1 1/8, to 78 1/2, and Federal National Mortgage (Fannie Mae), 1/2, to 42 1/8.
Several analysts said that bearish comments by Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's investment strategist, helped to dampen the market.
Looking ahead, Mr. Herrick of Jefferies said that next week was a big week for economic numbers and there was a hint that they could hurt the market. The Producer Price Index is scheduled to be issued Thursday, followed by the Consumer Price Index and industrial production figures on Friday.
The economist said these statistics might show an upturn in inflation, giving the Federal Reserve more reason to hold credit tighter.
 
Sell Programs Cause Drop
In yesterday's trading, four sell programs pushed the market down, said Birinyi Associates, a research firm. The largest sell program started at about 10 A.M. and pushed the market down 15.77 points in 15 minutes. Another took place starting at 1:12 P.M. and took 12.62 points. One buy program pushed the market up by 3.15 points.
Among computer stocks, I.B.M. fell 1 7/8, to 118 3/4. despite reiteration of a Paine Webber buy recommendation by an analyst, Stephen Smith. He said I.B.M. had aggressive plans for its mainframe computer business.
 
Microsoft Rises by 1 1/2
Apple Computer, trading over the counter, lost 3/4, to 38 1/4. Sun Microsystems also was down 3/4, to 30 5/8, and Compaq Computer fell 2 5/8, to 119 1/8. Microsoft, however, rose by 1 1/2, to 73 1/2.
Among retail stocks, the Gap continued to drop as analysts expressed unhappiness with its May sales figures. It lost 2 3/8, to 56 1/8. Melville dropped 1 1/4, to 50 1/4; the Limited lost 1, to 46 3/8; Dillard Department Stores fell 2 5/8, to 85 1/4, and Home Depot was off 5/8, to 56 3/4.
Conagra, the big agricultural company and food processor, added 1 1/4, to 33 1/4, a day after it announced plans to buy Beatrice Foods.
Maytag jumped 2, to 19. The appliance company said it did not comment on unusual activity in its stock.
The Amex market-value index sank 2.40, to 361.17. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.22, to 460.87.

HEADLINE: New Disputes Threaten Pact on U.S.-Japan Trade

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 8

 BODY:
Negotiations between Japan and the United States to conclude a major trade agreement before an economic summit meeting in Houston next month may be derailed by a struggle within the Japanese Government and resistance to American demands for more specific commitments, people on both sides of the talks said today.
Japanese and American negotiators warned that failure to meet the summit deadline - a possibility seriously mentioned today for the first time - might have high political costs. It could sour relations between the countries just after they had again begun to warm and possibly set off a new round of protectionist legislation in Congress.
An American official involved in the discussions described them as ''close to a crisis,'' while Taizo Watanabe, the Foreign Ministry's chief spokesman, complained that American demands ''are rather embarrassing to us.'' 
 
Main Sticking Point
''The United States does not understand how much effort we have exerted,'' Mr. Watanabe told reporters.
Several issues separate the two countries, but the main sticking point is an American demand that Japan commit itself to spending a fixed percentage of its gross national product within Japan on projects like new bridges, roads, sewage plants and public housing.
The American aim is to narrow the gap between what the Japanese save and what the country invests. Many economists maintain that that would reduce the country's trade surplus by creating a better balance between what Japanese companies produce and what Japanese consumers buy.
Japan spent the equivalent of 6.7 percent of its gross national product on public works last year, and the Americans are now demanding at least 9 percent. Negotiators said the Japanese Finance Ministry was refusing.
 
Friction Between Ministries
A Japanese official said there was fear of being held to a fixed percentage of public investment in an uncertain economic climate. But another official conceded that part of the reluctance stemmed from longstanding rivalries between the Finance Ministry and other ministries that would benefit from a new flood of domestic spending, like the Construction and Transportation ministries.
The impasse has come in talks designed to remove what are believed to be fundamental structural barriers that have created the yawning American trade deficit with Japan - $49 billion last year. The talks are a novel approach to trade frictions, concentrating on broad and presumably deeper-seated problems than on the traditional approach of focusing narrowly on specific markets where trade restrictions are believed to exist.
On April 5, participants produced a long interim report after lengthy talks in Washington. That report seemed to resolve most of the basic issues by pledging Japanese business practices that would be more open and more fair to foreigners. The final report, for what is known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, was expected to be concluded in a meeting on June 25 and 26 in Tokyo.
 
Timing of Summit Meeting
That would have allowed Japan and the United States to issue the final report before the economic summit meeting of the leaders of the seven leading industrialized democracies, to be held in Houston in early July.
The first sign of serious problems came late last month at a meeting in Hawaii. American negotiators said they began to feel that their efforts to ''add flesh'' to the principles outlined in the interim report were going nowhere.
Meanwhile, disputes broke out on the Japanese side, with the Finance Ministry fighting the effort to set a specific amount for public investment, a matter on which the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry were willing to concede, Japanese officials said.
 
I.M.F. Report Is Cited
Finance Ministry officials have gone out of their way in recent weeks to use a recent International Monetary Fund report to argue that Japan must maintain moderate surpluses to help pay for the reconstruction of Eastern Europe and the development of the third world. The United States has rejected this view, but it is now at the heart of the trade dispute.
President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu had a telephone conversation at the beginning of the week to discuss the outcome of President Bush's summit meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, sources on both sides have said. At that time, President Bush raised the trade problems, and reportedly urged Mr. Kaifu to use his influence to bring about an agreement or risk another breach in relations.
Asked about that conversation by Japanese reporters today, Mr. Kaifu was said to have retorted, ''I am exerting leadership without having to be told to do so, and am doing my job to the utmost.''
An American official said that these are among a range of issues on which there is still a gap between Japan and the United States:
* The United States is pushing for Japan to detail the increased penalties it had promised to impose on those found guilty of violating antitrust laws.
* The Americans have asked for quarterly reports monitoring progress in carrying out the changes Japan has agreed to, a frequency Japan has refused.
* Japan is reportedly resisting American demands that Japanese bureaucrats produce in writing all of their ''administrative guidance,'' an informal means of forcing companies to hew to Government policies. The Americans are seeking to make it easier to trace and discuss this guidance.
Finally, the Japanese are reportedly reluctant to create an interagency board of Government and business leaders to promote imports and open Japan's ports, airports and other facilities to more imports.

HEADLINE: Prices of Long-Term U.S. Bonds Ease

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Government securities eased yesterday, but the market in shorter Treasury maturities was essentially unchanged in unusually lackluster trading. One reason was the absence of any significant economic news.
The fixed-income market showed little response to the weakness in the stock market because, dealers said, they found little interest in Treasury bills, which usually benefit from any ''flight to quality.'' 
Another reason for the bond market's inertia, dealers said, was the reluctance of investors and traders to take positions before the flood of economic data due out late next week.
 
Biggest Move by Long Bonds
As it was, the usually volatile Treasury long bond, which serves as a bellwether of long-term fixed-income maturities, showed the largest price move. The 8.75 percent Treasury bonds maturing in 2020 were being offered late in the day at a price of 103 13/32, off 5/32 on the day. This raised the long bond's yield to 8.43 percent, compared with 8.42 percent the day before and 8.44 percent a week ago.
The Treasury's long notes, the 8 7/8 percent issue due in 2000, slipped by 4/32, to 102 24/32, to yield 8.46 percent. By comparison, the yield on 10-year Japanese Government bonds, Tokyo's longest maturity, was 7.02 percent. The yield on the also closely watched 10-year West German bonds was 8.82 percent. The yields on all three 10-year maturities were basically steady for the week.
Among the shorter Treasury issues traded in the secondary market, the 8.5's of 1992 were unchanged at 100 10/32, to yield 8.32 percent; the 8.5's of 1995 dipped 2/32, to 100 10/32, for a yield of 8.41 percent. 90-Day Rate Unchanged The discount rate on the Treasury's 90-day bills was unchanged at 7.71 percent; six-month bills rose four basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.64 percent, and the one-year bills edged up a basis point, to 7.52 percent.
''We believe next week's flow of Government economic statistics will be negative on balance for the fixed-income market,'' said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Inc. ''The data will probably show that the economy is not as weak as many think, but the numbers will also support policy makers at the Fed who remain concerned about inflation. Both factors are negative for the fixed-income market.''
Consequently, Mr. Ricchiuto and his staff do not believe the Federal Reserve will be inclined to move interest rates either way. ''Recently, interest rates have declined because the market expected the Fed to cut rates in order to resuscitate the economy,'' he said. Technical Move by Fed The Fed did intervene in the credit markets to add reserves to the banking system over the weekend in what analysts interpreted as a technical move. This was borne out by the steady Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans. The funds traded all day at 8.25 percent, which is widely believed to be the Fed's target for this key interest rate.
The economic reports due out next Thursday and Friday include last month's producer and consumer price indexes, industrial production and factory utilization rates, as well as the nation's merchandise trade balance and business inventories for April.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Gold Ends on a High Note; Dollar Advances Broadly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices finished a sluggish week on an upbeat note yesterday, and the dollar ended the day stronger against major currencies.
Gold, which has been increasingly shunned by investors, may have hit bottom on Thursday when the price in London reached a four-year low at $351.50 in morning trading, one analyst said.
''I think if the market was going to break $350 it would have happened this week,'' said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst at Paine Webber Inc. ''It was the perfect climate for the market to collapse and it didn't,'' he said, referring to reports Thursday of Middle East selling. 
Many traders fear Saudi Arabia has been selling large amounts of gold lately, leading to at least two sharp drops in recent weeks.
Bullion for current delivery rose $1.10, to $355.70 a troy ounce, on the New York Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $355.00 a troy ounce, up $1.40 from late Thursday.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $354.50 a troy ounce, from $354.15 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $354, from $353 late Thursday.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 39 cents an ounce, to 356.06 an ounce.
Silver bullion was quoted in London at $5.02 an ounce, up from $5.01 bid late Thursday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver for current delivery slipped 0.6 cent to close at $5.007 a troy ounce.
The dollar was stronger as investors anticipated next week's economic reports. Many apparently felt the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index could show stronger inflation, which could lead to higher interest rates, said Robert Hatcher, corporate trader at Barclays Bank P.L.C. in New York.
The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo, rising 0.10 yen to a closing 152.65 Japanese yen. Later, in London, it was also quoted higher at 153.48 yen, and in New York, it rose to 153.49 yen, from 152.55 late Thursday.
In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, which was quoted at $1.6843, compared with $1.6880 late Thursday. In New York the pound also dropped against the dollar, falling to $1.6840, from $1.6895 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's late rates, included: 1.6975 West German marks, up from 1.6930; 1.4495 Swiss francs, up from 1.4445; 5.7145 French francs, up from 5.7035; 1,248.00 Italian lire, up from 1,244.75, and 1.1743 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16975.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's levels, included: 1.6973 West German marks, up from 1.6913; 1.4480 Swiss francs, up from 1.4385; 5.7155 French francs, up from 5.6993; 1.9088 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9028.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe: East Berlin Journal;
A First U.S. Visit, and Maybe a Last

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BERLIN, June 5

 BODY:
For Lothar de Maiziere, the idea that he is about to be the first East German leader to visit the United States is not really that extraordinary.
''Everywhere I travel it's for the first time,'' said the former orchestra musician who emerged as much to his own surprise as anyone else's as the first democratically elected Prime Minister of East Germany. ''After all, I'm a citizen of the German Democratic Republic and always have been.''
The statement played both on the fact that East Germany's former Communist leaders were not widely welcomed in the West and that for ordinary citizens, Western travel used to be a rare privilege. 
Mr. de Maiziere is to make his first trip to the United States on Saturday, after a visit to Moscow to talk with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The East German leader will see President Bush in Washington on Monday, and before that he will be a guest at a banquet given by the World Jewish Congress in New York.
The paradox of the breakthrough -a paradox that accompanies most of what Mr. de Maiziere does - is that his many firsts are likely to be lasts. If German unification proceeds at the pace set so far, he may also prove to be the last East German leader to pay an official visit.
 
Enjoying Contradictions
A refined man who came to law and then to politics after an ailment forced him to abandon his career as a professional violist, Mr. de Maiziere, who is 50 years old, seems to enjoy the many contradictions that the role has thrust on him.
''If someone had told me a year ago that I would be sitting here with you in this role, I would have called him an idiot,'' he said in an interview in the Prime Minister's office of the Council of Ministers building.
A year ago, in fact a half-year ago, this was the realm of Willi Stoph, one of the old-guard Communists who ran East Germany with an iron hand under Erich Honecker. In the lobby, the old Communist emblem was still there only a week ago.
The pace of change has been Mr. de Maiziere's greatest challenge. His own rise is a case in point: he came to office largely because the old Christian Democratic Party in East Germany, tainted by its long association with the Communists, had no one else with any credibility last fall to make its leader. Then, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany decided to throw his formidable political weight behind the Christian Democrats in the East German elections in March.
But to the surprise of many in East and West, Mr. de Maiziere has shown an unexpected degree of independence and political skill. He has succeeded in resisting Mr. Kohl's pressure for moving up all-German elections to December without creating a split.
''In my party and my Government, we have always said that unification will have to come as soon as possible, but also as well as possible,'' he said. ''Now we have taken a big step forward with the treaty on economic, currency and social union, and we have to make as many laws as some parliaments write in a whole term. And people have to learn how to follow these laws.''
''The day has only 24 hours in the G.D.R., and I can assure you we cannot tackle the problems of unification any more quickly,'' he added.
 
Seeking U.S. Investment
In talking of his trip to the United States, Mr. de Maiziere is distinctly a lobbyist for his country. ''We hope that we can meet with representatives of American industry during the visit,'' he said. ''You know that our country faces great economic problems and that now, with the state treaty we signed with West Germany, we are creating a legal order that allows favorable investments for those who are interested.''
The economic problems that Mr. de Maiziere referred to are a matter of dispute. The economic unity scheduled for July 1 is expected to sound the death knell for many antiquated East German industries, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers without jobs. Some politicians have warned of major social unrest once the difficulties of union set in next fall.
Mr. de Maiziere sought to play down the threat, but also to blame the former Communist Government for any troubles.
''I think that with the measures we have decided on now there will not be a 'hot autumn,' but at most a warm one,'' he said. ''We do not want to underestimate the difficulties we are facing, but we do not want to dramatize them either.
''We have to make clear that problems, when they come about, are the aftershocks of socialism, and not the first shocks of the new market economy. We will not stand trial for thing we have not done.''
The main issue that Mr. de Maiziere is likely to confront in his foreign talks is the debate of the future Germany's place in European security arrangements. The issue was left essentially unresolved in talks between Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush last week.
 
Caution on NATO Issue
Mr. de Maiziere seemed to take extra care in discussing the problem so as not to be seen as criticizing the Soviet Union, which still has 350,000 troops stationed in East Germany.
''The Soviet Union makes it clear again and again that in the process of German unification, their legitimate security interests have to be maintained and that this would not be the case if a unified Germany became a member of a structurally unchanged NATO,'' he said.
Moscow has rejected Western demands that a united Germany belong to NATO, and has proposed instead the creation of a pan-European security system, possibly in the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, in which all European and North American nations take part. In the interim, some Soviet troops are expected to remain in Germany.
Mr. de Maiziere indicated that he did not expect the Soviet Union to delay reunification if talks between the wartime Allies and the German states found an acceptable formula.
''We think also that we can recognize after talks with the Soviet side that the Soviet Union aims for an all-European collective security system in the frame of the C.S.C.E., and that transitional solutions are no longer the main problem, if you make it clear that this is in a time framework,'' the Prime Minister said.
''There must not be a solution so that those who say Gorbachev lost World War II would not be proven right,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Needed: A Tough Exec for Two States

 BODY:
Running the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is one of the most challenging executive jobs in government. The Port Authority's operations are vast and so is its impact on the region's economy. It oversees airports, commuter rail systems, bus terminals and bridges; runs container ports and the World Trade Center, and deals with airline executives and commuters. It pays for all its own operations.
The impending departure of Stephen Berger, the Port Authority's executive director since 1985, presents the two states' Governors, Mario Cuomo of New York and Jim Florio of New Jersey, with the formidable task of finding a highly qualified successor.
Overseeing so complex an organization demands political, financial and managerial skills that are hard to find in the best of times. And now is not the best of times. The Northeast's troubled economy will make it even harder for the Port Authority's next director to win political support for toll and fare increases. Such increases are unpopular. They're also critical to the Port Authority's fiscal integrity and to the completion of Mr. Berger's ambitious $6 billion capital plan.
Mr. Berger was successful partly because he understood the Port Authority's many constituencies. He was comfortable with the private sector and the political establishment; his successor will need to be just as comfortable in both worlds. Other requirements are experience in managing a very large staff, and skill as a conciliator and firm bargainer.
Because the Port Authority's board chairman, Richard Leone, is from New Jersey, the next executive director will likely be a New Yorker. That gives Governor Cuomo a greater say in the selection, but both states need a choice of distinction.

HEADLINE: Florio's Puzzling 'Vision' for New Jersey

BYLINE: By Chuck Hardwick; Chuck Hardwick, Republican of Union County, is a member of the New Jersey State Assembly.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
When you put together a puzzle, no one piece gives you the whole picture. But piece by piece the puzzle becomes clearer, until the picture is complete.
Gov. Jim Florio says he has a vision for New Jersey; piece by piece he is assembling it, and the picture of his vision for the state is becoming clearer. As a state legislator for 13 years and former Assembly speaker, I can see a distinct pattern - and I believe that the future of New Jersey's middle class is in jeopardy. 
The first piece of the puzzle is the so-called auto insurance reform bill. The Governor calls the bill ''The Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act.'' But the act isn't reform and it certainly isn't fair.
It only shifts costs and adopts a new criterion for rating the risks of drivers. But that criterion will result in low-risk drivers (senior citizens, married couples, women, suburbanites) subsidizing high-risk drivers (young, single males, particularly those in the inner cities).
The Florio administration already admits that insurance companies, after onerous state surcharges are eliminated, may raise rates to make up any losses. So the $212 per car surcharge will be gone, but the companies will raise basic rates the same amount to make up the difference.
The second piece of the puzzle, the Governor's tax package, hits the middle class especially hard. It will make New Jersey's income tax the second-highest in the country and bring a 17 percent hike in the sales tax to consumers.
It will also eliminate homestead rebates and property tax reductions. These will add substantially to the total tax burden of all New Jerseyans, but especially working families and singles.
The Governor says with pride that his is a progressive tax proposal, that the bulk of the added taxes will be paid by the ''wealthy.'' The trouble is that he is having a tough time defining what he means by ''wealthy.''
First he told us that families with an income over $55,000 were among New Jersey's richest. But the 300,000 New Jerseyans who work in New York, pay taxes there and will pay the new, higher New Jersey Transit fares proposed by the Governor know that $55,000 in family income does not make them rich by any means.
Then Governor Florio defined ''wealthy'' as a single person earning $35,000 or more - with no regard for whether the person was a parent.
The final piece of the puzzle came last week: the distribution formula for aid to education. The Governor plans to cut aid to suburban communities - so-called high-income communities. Bergen County, for example, will lose more than $100 million in school aid. The Governor's goal is to direct more aid to cities such as Camden, which would receive an additional $45 million in school aid. The plan is partly based on the belief that all residents in ''high-income'' communities have high incomes.
Unfortunately, that's simply not true. The selective aid cut will result in an increase in taxes and a reduction in municipal services for property owners regardless of income. The Governor's plan will have exactly the opposite impact that he desires: Lower-and middle-income families will no longer be able to afford to live in suburban communities.
The cumulative effect of higher transportation costs and taxes and reduced aid will result in a massive redistribution of wealth. That's a philosophy that failed and was discredited in Massachusetts and New York a decade ago and has been discarded by the Eastern Bloc countries.
Wealth-redistribution schemes stifle economic growth. The plan proposed by Governor Florio will hurt the people of New Jersey in the decade ahead. Why would a start-up business want to locate in a non-competitive environment? It wouldn't.
What New Jersey needs are policies that attract economic activity and build a bigger economic pie so that all can benefit. Our state urgently needs policies that encourage growth through low taxes and a favorable climate for new jobs.
Of course, the missing piece of the puzzle is the voice of the taxpayers. In the weeks ahead, they could very well overturn the Governor's puzzling vision for New Jersey.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD;
Paying for Electric Power by the Time of Day

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
A growing number of consumers are paying a price for electricity based on the time of day they use it.
Utilities, either on their own or on the orders of regulators, are merging the clock and the electric meter to create ''time-of-day'' pricing. The idea is to make the price reflect production cost, which also varies by time of day.
In Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Ohio and other states, utility companies are picking up an idea that has been practiced by airlines and long-distance phone companies for years. The goal is to spread demand over all hours of the day and to make better use of expensive generating equipment that, in the current use pattern, often sits idle. 
Meeting everyone's needs when demand reaches its peak is an especially severe problem for power companies because the costs of building and maintaining generating equipment is very high. Manufacturers solve the problem by building up a surplus of their product in off-peak periods, but electricity cannot be stored; it must be produced at the instant the consumer wants it.
 
A Decades-Old Method
Utilities, using a system called ''economic dispatch,'' run their cheapest generators continuously, and start up the more expensive ones as demand increases. Thus at 2 A.M. a utility might meet all its needs from a hydroelectric dam that produces power for 2 cents a kilowatt-hour. But on a summer afternoon when every air-conditioner is running, demand would be so high that the utility would use its most expensive generators, perhaps an oil-fired plant where electricity cost 8 cents a kilowatt-hour.
Under the traditional pricing system that has been used for decades and is still by far the predominant system for residential use, customers are charged the same amount, a standard rate, for all hours. There is increasing interest among utilities and state governments in promoting more efficient use of electricity.
Primarily because of the increasing use of air-conditioners in summer and heat pumps in winter, the demand during peak hours is growing strongly in many parts of the country, and few utilities have much spare capacity or plants under construction. Shifting peak demand to off-peak hours could save millions of dollars in construction costs for new plants, experts say - costs that are eventually passed on to consumers.
''The purpose of the time-of-use rate is to give an improved price signal,'' said Charles J. Roncaioli, manager of rate analysis at Northeast Utilities of Berlin, Conn. He meant that under this new system, the consumer is now told what the product costs to make at various hours of the day. ''An economist would expect a customer would react and shift load to other periods of the day,'' he said.
Northeast implemented such rates in Connecticut a decade ago with mixed results. The company found that customers either could not or would not shift activities like running a clothes washer or dryer, a dishwasher or an oven to off-peak hours.
Technological changes are making such rates easier to implement. Clock meters have been used in homes for more than a decade, but are getting more sophisticated. For example, DPL Inc., the company that owns Dayton Power and Light, of Ohio, builds meters with microprocessors that can be read automatically by a central computer at the utility over the customer's telephone line. Other companies are using meters that can be controlled by radio signals.
In New York State, the Public Service Commission has ordered that time-of-day rates for residential customers be phased in, beginning with the biggest customers. For Consolidated Edison Company of New York, for example, beginning in January 1992 time-of-day rates will be required for homes that used more than 4,000 kilowatt-hours in a summer month in 1988. In practical terms, that means a very big house with a high air-conditioning load.
Homes that used between 3,000 and 4,000 kilowatt-hours will follow in January 1993, and then homes using more than 2,500 kilowatt hours in January 1994.
For Con Ed, electricity used between 8 A.M. and 10 P.M. weekdays will be billed at about 27 cents per kilowatt-hour; from 10 P.M. to 8 AM, and on weekends, the charge wil be three to five cents.
About 700 volunteers are already on the system and have cut their costs about 10 percent, according to the company.
In New Jersey, about 40,000 residential customers pay on a time of use basis. As in New York, the system is mandatory for large users and voluntary for smaller ones.
Public Service Electric and Gas has three rates, peak, off-peak and intermediate. The price spread is as large as 15 cents per kilowatt-hour in summer.
The system does not reduce total energy use among residential customers, according to Con Edison. But it can shift use. A study of a two-year experiment in time-of-day rates at Pacific Gas & Electric Company of San Francisco published earlier this year in The Energy Journal, an academic publication, found that participants in that voluntary program moved 21 percent of their electric use between noon and 6 P.M. to other hours of the day.
In contrast, Northeast's program was mandatory, and proved unsuccessful and unpopular. It was ordered by regulators for new houses with electric heat in a peak period defined as 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. People resented its mandatory nature, the company found, and customers did not shift much energy use. The price difference was small, about a penny a kilowatt-hour, or less than 20 percent, said Mr. Roncaioli, largely because Northeast has a relatively small difference in cost between peak hours and off-hours.
Faced with thousands of unhappy electric customers, Connecticut regulators allowed the company to make the program voluntary, Mr. Roncaioli said. Several hundred Connecticut households are still on the time-of-day rate, said Mr. Roncaioli, mostly childless couples who both work outside the home. Their use is mostly in off-peak times anyway. ''They save by doing nothing,'' he said.

HEADLINE: How the $8 Billion Space Station Became a $120 Billion Showpiece

SERIES: Big Science: Is It Worth the Price? - A periodic look at the largest new research projects.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
America's planned space station, sold to Congress in 1984 as an $8 billion project, will actually cost at least $120 billion when operating and other expenses are counted, and even then it will not meet what has become the Government's top objective in space.
Achieving that goal, sending Americans to the Moon and Mars as planned by President Bush, would mean adding costly new elements to the station, or perhaps building a separate spaceport in orbit.
The 500-foot-long, 290-ton space station Freedom is planned as the centerpiece of the nation's program for the manned study of space. It is to be lofted piecemeal in the late 1990's.
 
'World's Greatest Invention'? 
Experts say its story is a case study in cost escalation, bureaucratic sleight of hand and the inflexibility that often plagues science projects when they reach giant proportions. Some experts even question its importance for the advancement of knowledge.
''It's advertised as the world's greatest invention,'' said Dr. James A. Van Allen, the University of Iowa physicist who discovered the earth's radiation belts. ''But its scientific uses are pretty dubious.'' Those uses, he went on, could easily be accomplished on ''a much less grandiose scale.''
Many scientists fear that in the competition for Federal dollars, the station will drain money from highly productive small-scale research, especially as its budget rises.
Frederick N. Khedouri, who was a White House budget official in charge of the space agency's budget in the Reagan Administration, said NASA officials had consistently underestimated the station's cost. ''They always talk about a stripped-down model that doesn't exist,'' he said.
Supporters admit that they are frustrated with the station's delay-ridden six-year history, in which much paper has been shuffled but nothing has been built and no science accomplished. ''We've spent $4 billion so far and there isn't a nut or bolt to show for it,'' said one supporter, Dr. Jerry Grey, director of science and technology policy for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the world's largest aerospace engineering society.
Current and former officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration dismiss much of the criticism as unfair. The station's cost may be high, they say, but it is a fair price to pay for the scientific and commercial benefits it promises. And while conceding that the program's management had problems in the past, they say that the station is now on track and that it can serve as a sound basis for a host of scientific and exploratory goals, including those of Mr. Bush.
''The station by its very design can be modified to suit a wide variety of missions,'' said Dr. Earle K. Huckins 3d, head of station engineering at NASA headquarters. ''It can evolve.'' Perhaps nowhere is enthusiasm for the station greater than at the National Space Society, a 30,000-member private group based in Washington that backed the idea before the Government did.
''This station suits us fine,'' said Lori B. Garver, the society's executive director. ''It's a first step on the road to space colonization. This station is critical to expanding the human presence into space.''
As now envisioned, the station will be an orbiting outpost in which astronauts fashion new materials, study the physics of fluids, grow crystals, perform medical experiments, scan the stars and examine the possibility of living in space for long periods. Most basically, it is seen as a bold venture for America that will have a host of scientific, economic and cultural payoffs throughout the 21st century.
This year's budget for the station is $1.8 billion, and the Bush Administration has requested $2.5 billion for next year. So far $3.9 billion has been spent on design studies and the building of prototype parts. By far, it is the most complex spacecraft NASA or anyone else has ever tried to build - five times as long and many times as sophisticated as the Soviet space station Mir, launched in 1986.
Starting in 1995, about 30 space shuttle flights are to carry aloft its trusses, solar power panels, supplies and nine pressurized modules in which astronauts would live and work. Assembly is to be completed in late 1999. The station would orbit about 250 miles from Earth and house as many as eight crew members.
 
Early Problems
Falling Morale, Rising Budgets
The space station's troubles can be traced to its earliest days, experts say. The main problem was that in the early 1980's the thing uppermost in NASA's mind was the decline in its ranks and budget since the Apollo era of sending astronauts to the Moon.
James M. Beggs, an aerospace executive who was NASA's director in the early 1980's, conceded that the station was seen as a way to help keep the agency in business. ''The feeling was that unless we could get a station, the manned activities would truncate and we'd run out of mission,'' he said in an interview.
Mr. Beggs said the agency rejected the idea of putting up small self-contained units that could be linked together and expanded, slowly achieving complexity - a method adopted by the Soviets. Instead NASA planned a single large unit that would function only when fully assembled.
Critics have faulted that decision, saying the emphasis on bigness was a political move to secure hefty budgets and a large political base. Ronald D. Brunner and Radford Byerly Jr., analysts at the University of Colorado, recently wrote in the journal Space Policy that the plan was driven less by a search for technical excellence than by a drive to ''meet NASA's own institutional needs and to secure program approval and survival.''
Mr. Beggs disputed that, saying the design was the best possible technical choice, both ''economic and utilitarian.''
Seeking support for its idea in Government, industry and the academic world, the space agency in the early 1980's said the station's large size would allow a variety of uses. But scientists themselves were often skeptical. President Ronald Reagan's own science adviser, George A. Keyworth 2d, told Congress in 1983 that a space outpost would be ''a most unfortunate step backwards.''
 
Costly Visions
How $8 Billion Grew and Grew
That counsel was ignored. Hans Mark, a former deputy adminstrator of NASA, wrote in his book ''The Space Station'' that Mr. Reagan was dazzled by the commercial possibilities of the project. In January 1984 the President called on the nation to build its first permanently manned space station ''within a decade,'' saying it would advance ''research in science, communications and in metals and life-saving medicines.''
Its price was put at $8 billion and the likely date of completion at 1992. But costly delays soon arose as new users, contractors and political supporters joined the cause.
''They made sure there was something in it for everybody,'' said John E. Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, a nonprofit policy group based in Washington.
Station development was seen as employing tens of thousands of people in more than a dozen states and scores of Congressional districts. And though it was the commercial possibilities that excited Mr. Reagan, NASA quickly planned to add elements that would expand the station's use as a base for planetary exploration.
 
The Vicious Cycle
Then came a vicious cycle of financial shortfalls that led to delays, delays that led to cost increases, increases that necessitated less costly new designs, and new delays.
In 1986 NASA acknowledged that the station's projected cost had nearly doubled to $16 billion. So in April 1987 the Reagan White House scaled back the plan. The smaller station was to cost $12.2 billion. But the price of the cutback was high - $2.2 billion for the new design, according to the Brunner-Byerly paper from the University of Colorado.
Lost in the cutback were the features that would have helped make the station into a spaceport - including the ability to service and fuel spacecraft, to construct large structures and to prepare for the staging of exploratory missions.
Even so, it was still big, ''about double what we started out with,'' said Mr. Beggs, the former NASA director, who had left the agency by then.
 
Skepticism, Then a Study
Skeptics in the executive branch doubted NASA's newly advertised price. So the National Academy of Sciences, the prestigious private society that advises the Government, was asked to study the problem. In September 1987 it gave the most thorough estimate to date of the station's construction costs. These ranged from $25 billion to $30 billion, including expenses (usually excluded by NASA) like ground operations, personnel and the lofting of station parts into space.
The academy report also warned, ''High space station operating costs could potentially absorb a significant portion of the civilian space budget.''
The General Accounting Office, an investigative agency of Congress, examined that issue, finding in May 1988 that annual operating costs could be $2.7 billion, or $81 billion over its 30-year lifetime. That figure included food, fuel and transportation to and from the outpost.
Last year, spending limits imposed by Congress again delayed the station, pushing back its completion to 1999 and driving up its cost. Malcolm Peterson, director of NASA's resources analysis, said the best current construction estimate was $37 billion, excluding science equipment to outfit the station. NASA will give no estimate of that cost; industry analysts say it will be many billions of dollars.
Mr. Beggs, the former NASA Administrator, said the station's overall cost was still reasonable, despite the increases.
''It's like building a house,'' he said. ''If you start to calculate what it's going to cost over a lifetime, to furnish it and heat it and operate it, you'd never buy it. The lifetime cost is very high. But you say, 'I want a house.' We wanted a space station.''
 
New Worries
Every Solution Is Expensive
Scientists, including some who receive grants from NASA, worry that the station has become so costly that it will siphon money from fundamental research in space science. Such a tradeoff clearly occurred in the 1970's and early 80's, in the $25 billion program to develop the space shuttle.
''I watched with great sorrow and frustration as NASA sacrificed the great American enterprise of robotic planetary exploration in its desperate attempt to make good on overblown shuttle expectations,'' Dr. Bruce Murray, former director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, wrote in his book ''Journey into Space.''
Last month, Dr. Athelstan F. Spihaus Jr., executive director of the American Geophysical Union, the world's largest society for the study of the earth and its space environment, last month warned Congress of the danger, adding that his group ''cannot justify'' the station on a scientific basis.
Dr. Spihaus said he knew of ''no other scientific society prepared to justify space station Freedom.''
Experts say other problems loom on the horizon. For instance, experts at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston worry that station repairs will be far greater than originally planned. Most solutions now under discussion involve money - improving parts to make them last longer, having advanced robots do repairs and developing a new generation of spacesuits to ease astronauts' chores.
 
Whirling Debris Up There
Another threat involves orbiting debris, including rocket parts. About 24,500 of these objects, as small as an aspirin or as large as an abandoned spacecraft, now whirl about the Earth, threatening the planned station with catastrophic damage, according to a recent G.A.O. report. Station designers, it said, ''greatly underestimate the seriousness of the debris environment.''
Again, solutions are expensive. Better shielding would increase the station's weight, driving up costs to transport it into space. NASA is also considering an on-board system to warn of impending collisions.
A different kind of danger involves a shuttle accident like the explosion that destroyed Challenger in 1986. If a shuttle were disabled or destroyed, the crew of the space station might have no way of getting back to Earth; depending on the damage, it could take months or even years to send another shuttle to rescue the astronauts. A shuttle catastrophe is considered statistically likely in this decade.
NASA's solution, still under study, is known as the Crew Emergency Return Vehicle. This capsule could return astronauts to Earth. Not yet part of the station budget, it might cost as much as $2 billion, said Mark Hess, a NASA spokesman.
 
Unanswered Questions
Moon and Mars: At What Price?
The biggest cost riddle of all involves the feasibility of making the station into a transportation hub from which Americans could go on to the Moon and Mars. To achieve this goal, a host of costly modifications would be needed, including powerful new solar collectors to nearly double the station's electric power, living areas for more crew members, and large new booms and hangars to assemble, store and service the exploration vehicles. Plans for such an expansion have yet to win approval.
Some experts question how well a bustling spaceport could coexist with delicate scientific tasks like growing crystals in near weightlessness. Now there is discussion of whether it might be better to build a separate spaceport.
Further modifications of space station Freedom would be needed to study ways to avoid the debilitating and possibly fatal effects of prolonged human exposure to zero gravity - a critical hurdle for astronauts making the long voyage to Mars. Soviet astronauts who have stayed aboard Mir for months have developed a variety of medical problems, some of them serious.
 
Unbearable Lightness
''The current design isn't up to it,'' said Dr. H. Guyford Stever, a former White House science adviser who was chairman of a recent National Academy of Sciences study of NASA's plans for the exploration of the Moon and Mars.
In March, Dr. Stever's report urged NASA to consider building devices in space to study artificial gravity on humans. For instance, a slowly spinning cabin would generate its own gravity through centrifugal force. Such research would help determine whether a slowly spinning Mars ship could keep astronauts fit by inducing a fraction of the earth's normal gravity.
NASA has no plans for such a research unit on the space station, although it is considering the addition of an eight-foot rotating drum where such studies could be conducted on rats.
 
Mixed Signals
Dr. Murray, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology who was director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, advocates a manned mission to Mars. But he warns that the Federal Government is sending mixed signals on the issue of exploration. After years of turmoil in planning, he said, the station is so embattled that NASA dreads making any further design changes, especially ones that would sharply increase its cost.
''NASA is kind of ignoring Moon-Mars,'' he said in an interview. ''And the White House is plunging right ahead and ignoring the station. There's a disconnect developing, which I personally watch with anguish.''
Despite its formidable cost and other problems, many experts say the station will probably move forward to some level of completion, if not as a base for space exploration, by the sheer power of political momentum.
''It's going to get built,'' said Mr. Pike of the Federation of American Scientists. ''When you've got all those employees and contractors, and that big an operation at stake, a project has to be more obviously preposterous than the station in order not to happen.''
 
HIDDEN COSTS OF THE STATION
 
NASA's estimates for the cost of the space station often exclude the following: scientific equipment for the station's laboratories; the expenses of about 30 shuttle flights to loft parts and supplies during construction; dozens of dozens of gorund stations to train astronauts, prepare payloads and administer the project; salaries for personnel; food and supplies for crew members, and operating and maintenance expenses for the stations 30-year lifetime.

HEADLINE: In AIDS-Stricken Uganda Area, The Orphans Struggle to Survive

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MUTIKULA SOUTH, Uganda

 BODY:
Josephine Senyonga, a diminutive woman with decades of hard farm labor etched into her face, sat on the floor of her one-room house, surrounded by 12 grandchildren.
What in normal circumstances should have been a tableau of warmth was one of tragedy, repeated in thousands of houses and huts in a 30-mile swath from this village in Rakai County to Lake Victoria.
Mrs. Senyonga's three sons and three daughters-in-law died of AIDS last year and left her, a struggling 69-year-old widow, to care for their children.
In a grove of banana trees in her backyard, heaps of red pebbles, dappled with sunlight, mark the graves.
In another village closer to the lake, 70-year-old Salongo Mawawu looks after his 12 orphaned grandchildren. Six graves, five of them freshly dug, are at the side of his house, reminders to his grandchildren that their parents - teachers and traders - had died of AIDS. His last daughter, who is also a mother, is expected to die soon. 
 
A Disease Crueler Than War
The AIDS epidemic here is perhaps more haunting, more depressing than Africa's hard-case wars and famines. In war, the women and children are often spared. In famine, only segments of the population, the very young and the elderly, seem vulnerable.
In Rakai, a county of about 300,000, AIDS kills the breadwinners and leaves behind the most helpless: children.
From all the thousands of AIDS deaths of mothers and fathers, up to 40,000 children in the county have been are orphaned by a disease they understand to mean continual and uncurable sickness, uninterrupted mourning, daily funerals and impoverishment.
In many villages of Rakai, rows of houses stand silent, shuttered and abandoned, the parents dead and the children taken to usually less prosperous and aging grandparents.
''We are losing everyone,'' Mr. Mawawu said., after showing a visitor the graves in his garden.
Doctors here say that the transmission rate of AIDS from infected mother to baby - during pregnancy or while giving birth - is 30 to 50 percent, about the same as in the United States.
But since they have no measure of when mothers died or how old their children were when they died they cannot estimate, they say, how many of the surviving children in Rakai are infected with the virus.
The people of Rakai have always thought that AIDS, commonly known as ''Slims Disease,'' was different from malaria. For a long time they believed that AIDS afflicted those who stole or were ''bewitched'' by relatives.
 
Now They Know the Cause
Many now say they know it is caused by heterosexual transmission but seem unprepared to accept it. Elizabeth Nakabago, whose 52-year-old husband died of AIDS last year, appeared very thin. She felt well, she insisted. But a visitor from Kampala, the capital, said he had watched her deteriorate.
Scientists are studying why heterosexual transmission of the virus is such an important factor in Africa but have not yet reached any conclusions.
AIDS testing is virtually impossible for men and women deep in the villages. And as one man argued: ''Why should we have tests if you have no medicines to cure us.''
A member of Parliament from Rakai, Manuel Pinto, who organized a house-to-house survey recently, says there are about 40,000 children in Rakai who have lost one or both parents through AIDS.
An American statistician with the United Nations Children's Fund, Susan Hunter, reports 25,000 such children as of last fall but cautions that her figure was conservative even at the time.
In Uganda, an orphan is defined as a child who has lost one or both parents. In families where one parent has died, the grandparents commonly take charge of the children, particularly when the remaining parent moves away to try to remarry.
It is the question of how to lift the morale of these orphans in a country bereft of social services that Mr. Pinto and others are trying to grapple with.
 
The Background
 
War's Ravages And Now Disease's
 The Rakai district, an area of greenery and red soil, ravaged in the 1970's and early 1980's during the civil war, was the first place in Uganda to report cases of AIDS. Once a flourishing region of the Baganda Kingdom, railroads used to run to the lake shore. Crumbled milestones poking out of papyrus reeds attest to a road, now a potholed track barely suitable for bicycles, that once was alive with buses.
The area was neglected after independence from Britain. But during the 20-year civil war, the traders of Rakai prospered, buying soap, tires and beer from across the water in Tanzania and selling them to the capital, Kampala.
It was those who profited and led a high life who became the AIDS carriers and casualties, says Juvenalis W. Kibira, the deputy chairman of the orphans' organization of Rakai, which was founded last year by Mr. Pinto.
 
AIDS Spread From Area
After the first AIDS cases were reported in 1982 around Kasensero - the first known concentration of AIDS in Africa - the disease moved through Rakai county and then spread north to the entire country.
In Uganda as a whole, the figures are dramatic. Last December, the Minister of Health, Zak Kaheru, reported that 790,522 Ugandans had tested positive for the HIV virus and of these, at least 10,000 had developed the disease. The figures compiled for 1988 showed that, discounting children, about 1 in 8 Ugandans was infected.
In Kampala, the Health Ministry reported that 1 in 4 was infected. And in Rakai, new figures from a survey by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta show that half the women at the trading posts are HIV positive.
The infection rate compares to a rate of 1 in 200 in the United States and 1 in 500 to a thousand in Britain, said Martin Foreman, director of the AIDS unit of the Panos Institute, a London-based group specializing in development issues.
Rakai remains the region in Uganda most affected by AIDS, with the death toll steadily rising after 1986. While the total number of deaths apparently leveled off last year, deaths among women are inexplicably increasing, according to Miss Hunter's figures. There are no precise figures on the total number of AIDS deaths.
 
The Despair
 
Parentless Children Survive on Own
 The despair in Rakai is evident in the almost universally sullen expressions of children almost uniformly dressed in ragged clothing. In some cases there are no guardians and they must fend for themselves. In one case, Mr. Pinto's group found five sisters and brothers cared for by the eldest, a 17-year-old. They cooked in an old paint can. Even in Rakai households where one parent has survived, there is no escape from the disease. In Kimote, a village along the road that rises from Lake Victoria, the chief, Leo Muddu, died of AIDS just before Easter.
On a recent Saturday afternoon, a visitor found one of the chief's sons, Munyumya, a vigorous boy of 14, at home. A 26-year-old sister died of AIDS two years ago. His mother and four brothers were away at an AIDS burial.
In a side room of the house lay his dying 26-year-old brother. When a European face appeared in the doorway, the young man, Tofa, pleaded in a scratchy voice for medicine. His left leg had a large sore, he was suffering from diarrhea and he had been unable to walk for a month. ''We are all dying. We are all dying,'' he whispered. ''I bring him water and juice,'' explained Munyumya.
 
Widow Cares for 9 Children
Up the track, Elizabeth Nakabago, a 49-year-old widow, was walking home from the burial rites of a girl of 17 who had died in childbirth, probably of complications arising from AIDS.Mrs. Nakabago's 52-year-old husband, part-owner of a bus in Kampala, came home to die last year, leaving her seven children aged 5 to 17. She also cares for two grandchildren left her by three of four grown sons and daughters who died of AIDS.
As in many homes, the inside of Mrs. Nakabago's one room showed remnants of a better past. A faded photograph of a fancy wedding, probably in the 1940's, hung on one wall. But now Mrs. Nakabago can only afford the $3 yearly school fees for two of the seven children. The rest stay home.
 
Medical Help
 
Basic Dispensary Almost Inaccessible
 Rakai County's medical services consist of a derelict dispensary and an overworked medical center on the most northern edge and thus inaccessible to most. The only two doctors in the county are posted there.
During an inspection of the dispensary one night, Mr. Pinto found the place in darkness because there were not even candles. Patients, women with young babies, sat on the veranda and three unattended babies slept inside. The senior officer, known as a medical assistant, who is trained in hygiene and no more, had left for home three days earlier.
The dispensary is supposed to receive four cartons of essential drugs a month from a Danish medical program but receives two - the contents of which are usually sold for profit by the staff, Mr. Pinto said.
 
Burdens of Debt and War
AIDS has hit Rakai and the rest of Uganda at a time when the Government of President Yoweri Museveni, trying to recover from 20 years of war, is strapped for cash. About 50 percent of the national budget is spent to fight rebels in the north. Most of the meager revenues that come from coffee are spent on repaying debts.
A tight economic reform program from the World Bank allows no room for social services: $1 a year per person is a generous estimate of the amount spent on medical services, some economists say.
Inadequate medical services and traditional inclinations not to trust them anyway, makes many AIDS sufferers in Rakai seek other means of treatment. Last year, thousands of AIDS patients flocked to a woman in neighboring Masaka County after she asserted that soil from a certain place, drunk with water, would cure AIDS. The government put an end to her practices but not before vast quantities of soil had been consumed.
More enduring is Brother Anatoli Wasswa, a Roman Catholic priest of Kyotera in Rakai who dispenses herbal medicine - bark, roots and leaves - to AIDS patients. On a recent day, a 24-year-old woman who had been diagnosed as being HIV positive a year ago, arrived for her first treatment.
''We treat each symptom differently, so you can give a person up to five different herbs,'' he said. He doesn't promise cure. ''But a person can live longer, to six months longer,'' he said.
 
The Future
 
Surveys Conducted But Not Much Else
 The future of the children in Rakai has caught the attention of various international aid groups. But so far, little other than surveys of the numbers of orphans has been accomplished.
This irritates the energetic Mr. Pinto who, like his wife, Marie, was born in Baloole, a village not far from the lake. A former manager of the Esso Oil Company, before he fled from Idi Amin into exile in Kenya for 10 years, he has founded the association to help the orphans, as well as the Rakai Development Association. The main challenge, says Mr. Pinto, is to show people hope.
''We have to persuade people to do something for themselves,'' he says. He believes it is paramount that the children stay in the area with relatives and not be transplanted to orphanages, as has been proposed by some groups.
In Ugandan culture, all adult members of a clan are responsible for the clan's children. ''Everyone in your clan is a mother or father,'' said Mr. Kibira. ''That's why we believe the orphans can be looked after in our homes. If you don't take an orphan then the spirit of a dead mother or dead father will come and curse. This strong force will make sure orphans are taken in.''
Already Mr. Pinto's association is paying the school fees - compulsory for Government schools in Uganda -of orphans who are doing well in school but whose guardians cannot afford the outlay. New classrooms have been added to Lugonza Primary School in the district; one day-care center for 30 children has been started.
Mr. Pinto plans to turn an overgrown plantation into plots for the unemployed young men who remain idle and set a depressing tone for the children. A clay brick-making factory to be run by women is also in the works.
And he is going to ask the multinational corportions that have remained in Uganda to pitch in. It would cost about $125,000 for 40,000 orphans to go to school for a year, he said.
''We need help now because a child of 8 will be 12 in four years time and a real social outcast if he hasn't been to school,'' Mr. Pinto said.

HEADLINE: A Cafe Reopens: Lunch Returns to the Prairie

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOUISBURG, Minn., June 8

 BODY:
When Louisburg's last cafe closed its doors in 1988, Keith Hansen and John Lund and the other men who farm the rich, rolling prairies of western Minnesota found themselves confronting a new and lonely challenge: lunch.
Not only had they lost their midday refuge in town, a place to gather over coffee and talk prices and politics, but they had no one back at the house to cook for them either.
''My wife's got a job now,'' Mr. Lund said. ''So does Keith Hansen's and Spence's and Elmo's. You want to keep your farm these days, you need two incomes.'' $4,500 to Reopen the Doors So a few months ago, Mr. Lund and his neighbors near Louisburg did what seemed natural. Nearly 50 of them got together, raised about $4,500 in contributions and reopened the little cafe that has served this remote town of 60 residents since the turn of the century. 
For the farmers in Louisburg and other small towns across America, the cafe represents more than just a yearning for hearty home-cooked meals at noon, which the men say they do not have the time or the skills to make for themselves.
The campaign to reopen the cafe is a measure of the way in which the rhythms of rural life have changed.
More and more farm women now have jobs off the farm, forcing their husbands and their children to adapt to life in families in which both parents are wage-earners just as their counterparts have in the cities.
What has happened in Louisburg also reflects the concerns that are shared by residents of many small towns who have watched their communities wither away, bled by declining populations and failing businesses along Main Street.
''There is not much left here in Louisburg, but we're not ready just yet to let go of it,'' said Mr. Hansen, surveying the afternoon crowd in the cafe, where Emily Hansen, who is no relation, and her husband, Harold, were busy filling coffee cups and chatting up the customers. ''At least we managed to bring a little bit of action back to town.''
 
Creation of the Railroad
Like most places in the far reaches of western Minnesota and the Dakotas and Montana, Louisburg was a creation of the railroad, one of hundreds of small towns built at regular intervals along rail lines during the late 19th century so that nearby farmers could deliver a horse-drawn wagon of grain to the rail siding and be back home again by nightfall.
The grain elevator is still the town's biggest enterprise, and its most imposing structure. Its tin-sided towers dominate the long, low prairie horizon, and it is easily seen from several miles away.
But Louisburg, almost straight west from Minneapolis and close to the South Dakota border, is not on the railroad's main line. It is not even on some highway maps, since it is several miles from the nearest state road. Although the population nearly reached 100 in the 1950's, mostly the progeny of the Scandinavian and German farmers who first settled the area, it began slipping in the 1960's.
In the mid-1970's the farm implement dealership closed, and the town's only gasoline station shut its doors a decade later, along with the last grocery store. Except for two soda machines on the sidewalk in front of empty storefronts, the only retail commerce conducted along the main street these days is at the cafe.
 
Services Move Farther Away
Steve Padgitt, a sociologist at Iowa State University who specializes in rural areas, said residents of Louisburg were confronting a plight common to farm people throughout the region: as small communities and their populations have shrunk, services have been concentrated in fewer and more distant places.
''From the house where I was raised, I could always see the smoke from two or three other chimneys,'' Mr. Padgitt said. ''Now the countryside has thinned out so that people have to drive 10 miles to get their mail, or 30 miles to find a restaurant.''
When the old cafe closed in 1988, Mr. Lund said, it meant that he was traveling 10 miles to Madison, the closest town, to buy lunch. It was either that or make do alone at home. ''You can only eat Campbell's soup for so long,'' said Mr. Lund, whose wife, Nancy, works as a bank teller in Appleton, about 12 miles to the east.
As farm profits have declined in recent years, particularly among the operators of small family farms, both husbands and wives have been forced to seek work off the farm. A 1988 Agriculture Department survey estimated that 50 percent of all farm households had someone in the family who was working off the farm. As often as not it is the wife, as most farms are operated by men. In farm communities closest to urban areas, Mr. Padgitt said, some studies suggest that more than half the farm wives now hold jobs off the farm. In any case, sociologists say the number has been growing slowly but steadily over the years.
 
Offer From Former Resident
The idea of reopening Louisburg's cafe took root last December, when Catherine Wiese, who grew up in Louisburg but now lives in California, came home to visit her father. Since the cafe had closed her father, Arnold, an elderly widower, had lost a place to go for meals and companionship. She said she would help buy the cafe if others in the town could help fix it up and find someone to run it.
Mr. Lund and the men down at the elevator started taking up a collection, asking for donations of $50 or $100. ''The names on the list just kept coming and coming,'' Mr. Lund said. Some nearby banks and businesses contributed, too, and the local power company offered three months of free electricity.
Most of the work was done by Harlan Wiese, who is Ms. Wiese's cousin. Along with helpers, he tore out the interior of the old cafe, a one-story storefront, and put up plywood paneling and installed floor tiles and new kitchen equipment. Dining tables were ordered and a new menu board was mounted on the wall for notice of the dinner special, which costs $3.50 and changes daily. Today it was roast beef with mashed potatoes.
Then they painted the facade and put out an American flag and a sign that reads: ''Louisburg Cafe: Service with a Friendly Smile.'' At least that is what it was supposed to say: on one side the painter misspelled service as ''sevrice.''
 
Celebrating the Opening
The restaurant had its formal opening in mid-April. Toby Haug and His Playmores, a polka band from Madison, performed on the street out front, and most of the town turned out to dance and drink a little beer. Radio station KQLP from Madison broadcast live from the scene. So many people showed up to sample Mrs. Hansen's swiss steak that they had to wait in line for tables.
Since then, there have been some problems. The roof started leaking and the farmers had to go $4,000 into debt to replace it. Then the electrical system blew. Now they say they are going to have to install a new circuit box.
But Emily Hansen, who was managing a convenience store in Madison when she was asked to take on the cafe, says she and her husband, who had been laid off from his job, will stay on as long as they can. They work every day as it is, including Sunday, when the church crowd comes in for coffee.
''Even if we don't get rich, it's such a great feeling just to be here,'' said Mrs. Hansen, who had just finished baking a fresh batch of homemade doughnuts. ''Whatever else, we feel like we're helping to hold this little community together.''

HEADLINE: Peruvians Vote Today in Neck-and-Neck Runoff

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, June 9

 BODY:
After a bitter campaign, Peruvians go to the polls on Sunday to choose a President to lead them out of a decade of economic collapse and spreading guerrilla war.
Final opinion polls released Friday indicate a neck-and-neck race in the runoff election between Alberto K. Fujimori, an agronomist supported by the left, and Mario Vargas Llosa, the writer who advocates a free-market revolution.
''We have a statistical tie,'' said Manuel Torrado Bermejo, president of one polling organization, Datum. Mr. Torrado's survey gave the novelist 42.9 percent of respondents and Mr. Fujimori 41.5 percent. Another nationwide poll, by Apoyo, gave Mr. Fujimori a slight edge, 41 to 39 percent. In both polls, the remainder were undecided or planning to cast blank ballots. 
For the 10 million voters in this nation, South America's third largest and perhaps most troubled, the election comes after a punishing decade of economic and political mismanagement that stretched civic patience and civilian institutions to the breaking point.
''Peru is producing a situation very similar to Lebanon - polarization, a lack of political center, incapacity of consensus and a genuine collapse of the state,'' said Alfredo Barnachea, a member of Congress.
Prices have increased 1 million percent since the current President, Alan Garcia, took office on July 28, 1985. Also during the Garcia years, combined unemployment and underemployment climbed from 45 percent to 80 percent in Lima, home to one third of Peru's population of 22 million.
Mr. Vargas Llosa has proposed a detailed free-market ''shock'' program designed to bring Peru's 2,000 percent annual inflation down to 10 percent. The program calls for privatizing most of Peru's 200 state companies and for phasing out subsidies, tariffs and price controls. To ease the social costs of the transition, the writer called for an internationally fiananced $1 billion program to provide jobs, health care and food to Peru's poorest people.
Mr. Fujimori, who finished a strong second to Mr. Vargas Llosa in the first round of voting in April, espouses a more gradual version of Mr. Vargas Llosa's free market blueprint. But he opposes privatization and charges that his opponent's plan would throw millions out of work.
Mr. Fujimori's ''no shock'' anti-inflation formula calls for improving farm production and creating a new currency pegged to the United States dollar. The son of Japanese immigrants, Mr. Fujimori promised to attract millions of dollars in Japanese aid and investment. On voter worry lists prepared by pollsters, ''economic crisis'' is invariably followed by ''terrorism and subversion.'' In the 1980's, the Shining Path guerrillas spread from a mountain stronghold to carry out actions across the country. So far this year, more than 1,200 people are listed as having died in violence associated with the rebellion.
Mr. Vargas Llosa advocates giving the military better equipment and more political support for the counterinsurgency war. Mr. Fujimori advocates undercutting the rebellion with more social services - health clinics, schools, roads and higher prices for farm produce.
Although Peru is the world's largest source of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine, Peruvian surveys list combating drug trafficking as the sixth most important priority. The illicit export is believed to infuse about $1 billion a year into Peru's economy.
Both candidates favor gradual crop substitution. Because of overproduction and disruption of flights to Colombian laboratories, price trends favor substitution. In the Upper Huallaga Valley, the main growing area, prices have dropped from $1.10 per pound of leaves a year ago to 35 cents today.
Complicating the election outcome will be Peru's tortoiselike vote count. Only on Friday, two months after the April 8 elections, did officials announce the winners of Lima congressional seats.
In Sunday's vote, some returns will be available on Sunday night. But the National Elections Board has warned that official results will be known only in early July.

HEADLINE: Alarmed at Turn in Israel, Arabs Forecast War

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, June 9

 BODY:
Arab and Palestinian commentators responded today to the formation of a new, right-wing Israeli Government with forecasts of war, reflecting a mood across the region that blends apprehension, anger and a deepening hostility toward the United States, Israel's main supporter.
''It is a war Cabinet, the worst in Israel's history,'' Salah al-Khalaf, a senior Palestine Liberation Organization official, told reporters in Tunis, where the P.L.O. has its headquarters. He was referring to the announcement yesterday by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the first coalition Government in Israel's history to be formed exclusively of right-wing parties.
Commenting on the new Government, one Jordanian newspaper, Sawt Al Shab, said the Arab world should ''brace for the ugly option of a new war imposed on the Arab nation. Praising peace does not mean dropping our weapons and burying our heads in the sand.'' 
 
Hostile Mood
Western diplomats said the Arab mood toward Israel and the United States was generally more hostile than it had been for many years. ''The situation is very dangerous,'' one said, speaking in return for anonymity.
An immediate focus of concern is the United States threat to break off its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization over the group's refusal to condemn a seaborne raid on Israel on May 30. President Bush said on Friday that his Administration was considering a possible breach with the P.L.O. but had made no final decision.
Egyptian officials said President Hosni Mubarak and President Bush held a 15-minute telephone conversation on Friday and diplomats here said the Egyptian leader apparently urged Mr. Bush to avoid a complete break with the P.L.O.
 
Egypt on the Spot
Egypt is the United States' leading ally in the Arab world and the only Arab country at peace with Israel. It has sought to pursue moderating policies, but, with Arab frustration mounting over the failure of American efforts to set up direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, Cairo faces taunts from hard-line Arab governments that its diplomacy has gotten nowhere.
Yasir Abed Rebbo, who leads the P.L.O. side in the dialogue with the United States, said in Jordan that a break in the contact would ''encourage a fierce Israeli crackdown on the Palestinians'' who have been embroiled in a 30-month uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The dialogue itself has been challenged by some Palestinians who say it has produced no results. But other Palestinians and Arab diplomats say Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, wishes to retain it because it represents the only political gain secured since the start of the uprising in the occupied territories.
 
From Moderation to Belligerence
Diplomats here and elsewhere said that with the shift in mood away from avowed moderation, a shift confirmed at an Arab summit meeting in Baghdad, Iraq, last month that endorsed more bellicose tones, the region's confrontation could escalate.
In this atmosphere, the diplomats said, a break in the United States-P.L.O. dialogue could be taken by Arab and Palestinian hard-liners as proof of the futility of pursuing the diplomacy of peace and justification for new efforts to pursue armed actions against Israel.
Mohammed Abbas, leader of the P.L.O. faction that took responsibility for the May 30 attack near Tel Aviv, said in an interview published today that he planned further attacks using hang gliders.
''Who said the price of this dialogue was to halt armed struggle?'' he was quoted as saying by Sawt Al Shab. The P.L.O. draws a distinction between terrorism, which Mr. Arafat renounced in December 1988 as part of a deal to open the dialogue with the United States, and guerrilla warfare or ''armed struggle.'' No Response From P.L.O. The United States has been insisting that the P.L.O. denounce the May 30 attack. But, when the P.L.O. Executive Committee met in Baghdad last week, it made no public reference to the attack and announced no moves against Mr. Abbas or his Palestine Liberation Front, a small faction with close ties to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader.
The 21-member Arab League said in a statement on Thursday that the United States policy lacked credibility.
''The Arab states believe,'' it said, ''that the strategic alliance between Israel and the United States, the amount of military and economic aid and political support which Israel receives from the United States and the lack of adequate effort to make Israel respect international law have enabled Israel to persist in its attitude.''
 
Forces Pulling Further Apart
Western and Arab diplomats in the region said they feared that the belligerent Arab mood, coupled with the right-wing profile of the new Israeli Government, could draw Arab states more closely into greater violence.
''The region will now face an extremist Government that will heighten tension, carry out acts of aggression on some Arab countries, especially Libya, Iraq and Jordan, and clamp down on the intifada,'' Tayeb Abdul-Rahim, a Palestinian official in Jordan said, using the Arabic word for the Palestinian uprising.
Others in the Arab world expressed similar sentiments. A newspaper in Oman said, ''The present climate in Israel, reflected by the new Cabinet, pushes the region more and more to a state of war.'' In the United Arab Emirates, the newspaper Al Ittihad said, ''While not dropping the olive branch, the Arab nation should not forget the language of war because it is not through diplomacy alone that liberation can be achieved.''

Moments after hearing the last witness in two days of hearings, a committee in the House voted Thursday to send the legislation to the full House in the next few days. The bill, which many lawyers say is unconstitutional, has no exceptions for pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. It carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison at hard labor for anyone who performs an abortion. Although sponsors of the bill say a woman who has an abortion would not be penalized, opponents of the bill say it is written so broadly that they would face the same penalties as those who perform abortions. 
Not since the bitter fights in the 1970's over the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution has an issue attracted so many women's groups to the State Capitol, where there are only 3 women among the 144 legislators.
 
Emotions Running Strong
''The decision was made without discussion,'' said Terri Bartlett, executive director of Planned Parenthood of Louisiana. ''There was no discussion, no questions, no amendments. There was total disregard for women and the right to privacy. This is a new decade in Louisiana. The Legislature just hasn't gotten it yet.''
In testimony at the hearings, Sharon Fontenot, a City Council member in Eunice, La., who is executive director of the Chamber of Commerce and a lobbyist for Louisiana Federation of Right to Life, said: ''Today what you're witnessing is a tremendous increase in the grass-root movement. You've got every pro-life group in Louisiana behind this bill.''
''We will be lobbying on the floor, on the phone and in the districts,'' she said after the hearings, adding, ''In the House, it looks good.''
The battle in the Legislature here was set up last year when the United States Supreme Court handed down a decision allowing states to restrict abortions.
 
Move for Tough Legislation
Soon after the Court ruled last summer, in a Missouri case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, state legislators in Louisiana passed a resolution asking district attorneys to enforce the tough anti-abortion law that was in effect here before the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion.
The state and the New Orleans District Attorney, Harry Connick, went to court and sought to revive the old law, one of the strictest in the nation. But a panel of three Federal judges decided in January that the law had in effect been repealed because the Legislature, after Roe v. Wade, had enacted other laws regulating abortion.
''What we simply want to do is re-enact the old law,'' said Representative Woody Jenkins, a Democrat who is an author of the bill now before the House, in testimony at the committee hearings this week.
The bill is intended to be ''a rifle shot, clear and simple,'' to strike down Roe v. Wade, said John Baker, a professor of law at Louisiana State University, who testified at the hearings. In passing a strict new abortion law, Representative Jenkins said, Louisiana has the chance ''to make history'' since it is the last legislature in session this year considering abortion legislation and since ''the mood of the Supreme Court is right.''
 
Moves in Other States
The American Civil Liberties Union has reported that similar bills were introduced in Utah, Alabama, Minnesota and Idaho in the past year. The Idaho bill was the only bill passed by a legislature, but it was later vetoed by Gov. Cecil D. Andrus. Much of the testimony in support of the Louisiana bill centered on medical opinion that life begins at conception and that the proposed law should not be amended to allow abortion in cases of rape and incest. Gov. Buddy Roemer has vowed to veto a bill that does not have these exceptions to the abortion ban, and some legislators predict the bill will be amended on the House floor to include the exceptions.
Testimony by those opposed to the bill centered on the privacy issue, the state's high teen-age pregnancy rate, and what witnesses said was the state's pressing need for better reproductive health care for the poor, more sex education and more accessible family planning services.
Representative Arthur Morrell warned the committee against approving the bill. ''You will awaken a sleeping giant,'' he said, ''and if that giant awakens, beware.''
Privately, many legislators say they would rather not vote on the issue because their constituents are so divided.
Planned Parenthood, only six years old in Louisiana, has pitched much of its argument on the cost of defending an abortion ban, litigation that many people say the state cannot afford. Among the knottier issues now before the Legislature is how to balance the budget, which has been battered by low oil prices and a recession.
A recent poll, conducted for state newspapers and television stations, showed that of 805 voters questioned, 53 percent favored allowing a woman to decide, in consultation with a physician, whether to have an abortion, and that 67 percent believed the state should not spend money on a constitutional challenge. The margin of sampling error in the poll was four percentage points.

HEADLINE: SOUND;
SUITCASE MUSIC TRANSPORTS PEOPLE AND VICE VERSA

BYLINE: By HANS FANTEL

 BODY:
Skipping town is an old summertime urge. Even in ancient Rome, those who could afford it headed for their seaside villas when the weather got hot; and in the backwoods of New England, where this column is written, cabins and cottages are now filling up with summer people from the cities.
Those among them who require regular rations of music to get through the day face the problem of setting up a sound system in their temporary homes - a system that is easily transported to and from those summer houses. Yet despite their necessary compactness, such sound rigs should be musically enjoyable. 
These requirements may seem contradictory. Good sound and portability don't usually go together. But a few recent designs have managed to resolve that conflict. Even demanding listeners can now live out of a suitcase - literally.
The suitcase in question is the Model 11 by Cambridge SoundWorks, a company headed by Henry Kloss, whose name is famous in audio history. Among Mr. Kloss's earlier achievements was one of the first portable sound systems using transistor technology and miniaturized circuits. Made by KLH in the early 60's, it was also called the Model 11 and set new performance standards for its day. The present Model 11 is an adaptation of those ideas for the digital age.
The key element in the new Model 11 is the suitcase, which does double duty as woofer and as carrying case for the other components. It measures 16 1/2 by 19 1/2 by 6 1/4 inches, small enough to fit under an airplane seat.
Arriving at your destination, you open the case, pull out two upper-range stereo speakers and a small amplifier that delivers 18 watts per channel and works on both American (110 volt) and European (220 volt) power supplies. It may also be plugged into the lighter socket of a car. Because separate amplifying channels are used for the woofer and the upper-range speakers, the unit can produce a far greater volume of sound than its nominal power rating suggests.
The bass frequencies projected from the suitcase woofer are nondirectional. Thus a single woofer (or suitcase) is needed. The small upper-range speakers unpacked from the case are enough to furnish the stereo effect. Despite the compact dimensions, little if anything has been sacrificed to portability; and in terms of its sound, the Model 11, priced at $749, compares favorably with other systems in that range. It is not available in stores but can be ordered on a 30-day trial basis by calling 1-800-AKA-HIFI. The Model 11 is intended to work with a portable CD or tape player, which is not included. But there's room for such items in the suitcase.
A somewhat similar approach has been taken by Atlantic Technology, a company affiliated with the well-known audio company NAD. Though not conceived exclusively for portable use, its Pattern system fits in a tote bag.
Here too, a single woofer conserves space, and its enclosure also contains separate amplifiers for highs and lows with a combined power of no less than 60 watts - astounding for such a compact system. The upper range is handled by small outrigger speakers measuring a mere 4 by 4 by 7 inches. These can be angled to provide different sound radiation patterns to suit the acoustics of various environments.
The $500 list price does not include a music source, such as a portable CD or tape player, and the protectively padded tote bag is $99 extra. Even so, the Pattern system is an outright bargain.
Sonically, it is remarkable for its size and holds its own against many respectable midpriced home stereo rigs. The overall sound is clear, true in its musical timbres and well balanced.
The bass, in particular, is impressive, reaching down to about 35 Hertz. That lends credibility even to the lowest instruments of an orchestra and represents a remarkable achievement for a portable sound system. Of course, the term ''portable'' is relative. We're dealing here with a 31-pound package measuring 21 by 17 by 10 inches. ( In contrast to the high capability of the two portable systems mentioned above, the most common form of portable sound gear - the ubiquitous boom box - has not risen to the challenge of digital sound. Granted, some of the newer models now sport built-in CD players. This adds to their weight and price but doesn't make them sound any better.
Their blatant shortcomings lie in their puny amplifiers and raspy little bassless speakers. Unable to cope with the tonal range or the dynamics of a CD, the boom box screeches - perhaps in frustration and dismay at being assigned an impossible task. The discrepancy between the good CD signal going in and the flawed sound coming out is even greater than with tapes or the radio. So, if anything, the addition of a CD player to a boom box makes matters worse.
Of course, boom boxes are important. They add millions to the economy, and their popularity indicates that they serve a need. But they don't serve the cause of music.

HEADLINE: DANCE VIEW;
Amid Dire Warnings, Glimmers of Optimism

BYLINE: By Anna Kisselgoff

 BODY:
''Internationalism in dance, Past, Present and Future'' seemed like the usual call to brotherhood and cooperation when Dance/USA, the 200-member service organization for nonprofit professional dance companies and presenting organizations in this country, opened its biennial roundtable in Philadelphia last weekend.
Instead, nationalism, both noted and then embodied at the conference itself, gurgled up to the surface like a geyser. ''We are seeing a retribalization of the world,'' as one American panelist put it in a another context.
Amid all the frank talk, the following positions were stated: A Belgian held that American dance had nothing new to say and was unwelcome at the avant-garde festival he directs; American festival directors denounced the Immigration and Naturalization Service for its ''obstructionism'' in delaying or refusing visas to foreign dancers; an official of the French Ministry of Culture hoped for an end to this ''cultural protectionism'' but also noted that national differences in dance should be preserved after 1992, when the unified European Common Market is scheduled to go into effect. 
A Yugoslav dance festival director warned of patronizing attitudes from abroad and the tendency to see culture in terms of blocs (East and West) while the East Europeans, bloc or no bloc, bemoaned the advent of a market economy that has not only accompanied their new freedoms but also demoralized their performing artists. Having lost their subsidies, the Eastern Europeans now see hordes of Western dance companies rushing in to play a dominant role (projects for sending American choreographers to the Soviet Union were sketched out at the conference).
The issue of censorship was a leitmotif at the conference, but it was not unrelated to the international theme. John E. Frohnmeyer, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, received a standing ovation when he began his address on the urgency of the campaign to have Congress reauthorize the Endowment without restrictions on content. ''We are in the midst of what can only be described as a war, and we need to bring sanity to the hysteria we have had in this country,'' he said, urging the arts community to speak less to the converted than to a broader public.
There is, understandably, a tendency to view the controversy over the Endowment, stemming from its financial aid to works that Senator Jesse Helms and his supporters have defined as obscene, as a national issue.
Yet, it is an issue that should not be seen in isolation. The outcry, mainly from the forces of the right in this country, comes at a time when right-wing forces in Eastern Europe, especially in their echoes of pre-World War II ethnic and religious hatreds, have resurfaced in highly nationalistic form. Participants at the conference stressed that Senator Helms receives support from evangelical groups in the United States.
Is there a global connection between the attempt to restrict publicly financed art in the United States and the nationalistic currents in Europe, both East and West?
This question was put to a session convened by W. McNeil Lowry, president of the San Francisco Ballet and a former vice president of the Ford Foundation. The panel members were Marc Wilson, director of the Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City, Mo.; Edward Albee, the playwright, and Andrzej Lipicki, a member of the Polish Parliament who is an actor-director and an adviser to the leader of Solidarity, Lech Walesa.
In Mr. Wilson's view, the connection between the controversy surrounding the Endowment and the divisions in Eastern Europe are clear. The ''retribalization of the world'' that he sees is also, he said, a ''retribalization of the United States, where our nation is being fragmented into groups, each with its own codes. There is a separation of identities, of tribes, instead of one nation, who are competing to say that my values should be those of the nation. It is the droit moral over the rights of common law.''
Mr. Albee called current attacks of the Endowment ''religiously motivated, a cultural fear.'' The function of art, he said, is ''clarity to comprehend ourselves'' even if it means expressing disturbing truths.
Mr. Lapicki said the right-wing forces in Poland were small in number. As chairman of his Parliament's cultural commission, he personally ''liquidated'' the censorship laws. Censorship, he said, ''is nothing but the mainstay of any totalitarian regime.''
At another panel, entitled ''The New Europe,'' a young Hungarian dance impresario named Gyorgy Szabo noted that the new Hungarian parties sought, in Hungary's weak economy, to distinguish their respective programs on grounds that in some cases took on a nationalistic tone. ''I hope in the next five years that this will change completely,'' he said.
In the meantime, Mr. Szabo added, such a tone in Hungary would mean that whatever government subsidy existed would go to opera-house companies rather than to the kind of avant-garde troupes he himself had already been presenting in Budapest. Mr. Szabo, who said he had often been called in by the secret police in the past, founded the Petofi Csnarnok, an exhibition and performance space that he ran as a disco on Saturdays to finance the presentation of dance companies. One of his programs several years ago included a concert by Yves Musard, a French choreographer who now lives in New York. A member of the Budapest Opera House Ballet who performed in the concert wore a mask because her teacher was sitting in the front row.
Mr. Szabo, whose programming has survived through ingenuity, is better trained to deal with the market economy than state-supported institutions. If he does not get financing for his dance programs, Mr. Szabo said, he will try to start a foundation.
For all the dire warnings, optimism pervaded this extremely stimulating conference. Its statement of purpose summed up: ''Our future, depends on our ability to work together.''
Along the way, Dance/USA gave its Honors award to Paul Taylor and Agnes de Mille. A posthumous Honor was also given to Alvin Ailey.

HEADLINE: Backstage, Bands on the Run Have Cleaned Up Their Acts

BYLINE: By KAREN SCHOEMER; Karen Schoemer writes frequently about popular music for Spin, Mademoiselle and other publications.

 BODY:
In the mid- to late 1970'S, when Aerosmith was one of hard rock's most popular and powerful bands, the scene backstage at their arena concerts reflected the excesses of a very rich, very spoiled group of musicians. The band members were known to be heavy drug users. At every show they demanded a Thanksgiving-style roast turkey, which usually went untouched, as well as several cases of Budweiser and assorted bottles of liquor. Right before they went onstage, each member drank a shot of Bacardi 151-proof rum. 
Earlier this year Aerosmith played a sold-out show at the 20,000-seat Brendan Byrne Arena at the Meadowlands complex in East Rutherford, N.J., in support of their 12th and most recent album, ''Pump.'' After the show, in which the lead singer, the 42-year-old Steven Tyler, cavorted onstage like a teenager, the atmosphere backstage was calm, peaceful, almost domestic. Mr. Tyler bounced his year-old baby on his arm. The tables were littered with half-empty bottles of mineral water and bowls of Greek salad left over from the band's supper. At one point someone handed Mr. Tyler a small brown jar. He opened the top and popped a Geritol. The new atmosphere backstage at Aerosmith's concerts is one of the more conspicuous examples of how the business of rock tours has evolved over the last decade. By the end of the 1970's the game of excesses played by both rock-tour promoters and the bands themselves had reached ludicrous proportions, with each act attempting to one-up the last with their demands - the more idiosyncratic the better. Rob Reiner's 1984 film ''This Is Spinal Tap'' captured the mood with its parody of rock musicians who refused to go onstage if the sandwich bread was too small or the olives didn't have pimentos.
As the indulgent 70's became the health- and business-conscious 80's, even rock-and-roll cleaned up its act; much of the excess seems to have gone out of style. A primary reason is money.
On many tours everyone from concert promoters to managers to musicians themselves have stripped shows of profit-gobbling perquisites like large quantities of alcohol, extravagant catering and other ego boosters so costly that even the biggest touring acts of the 70's were often hard-pressed to break even on the road. At the time rock tours were primarily intended to boost sales of a new album; they were not seen as moneymakers in themselves. But now, although tours are still used to promote recordings, they are also regarded as profitable ventures in their own right, with the emphasis on efficiency and organization rather than frivolity and self-gratification.
 
Getting Kicks From Carbohydrates
 And as the rockers themselves have aged, they've found that they don't have the physical tolerance for the old excesses. Concerts now usually last a strenuous two to two and a half hours, and tours often go on for several months (Aerosmith will have been on the road for nearly a year when the tour ends next month), demanding an athletic endurance and concentration that is difficult to sustain on the steady diet of alcohol, drugs and junk food that used to be a standard part of life on the road. Backstage at Aerosmith's Meadowlands concert not a drop of alcohol, a trace of drugs or even much cigarette smoke was to be found. In 1984, after years of severe alcohol and drug problems, members of the band underwent drug rehabilitation treatment; this is their second ''clean'' tour, and ''Pump'' is the group's best-selling album since the 70's, with more than two million copies sold. Aerosmith has dictated that the band's touring contract (a 40-page document known in the business as a rider) include a clause that states, in big bold letters, that no alcoholic beverages are allowed anywhere on the tour. That goes for band members, crew members, backstage or on the buses - everyone, everywhere, at every minute.
''Other bands ask me about drugs,'' says Mr. Tyler. ''They just want to hear my war stories. I tell them I almost died. I tell them how it raped our creativity. I mean, what are you really doing? Who are you fooling? Now we have Skippy chunky peanut butter, Sorell Ridge preserves, rice cakes, dry-roasted soybeans and distilled water. Good stuff like that. Before we go onstage we have a huge, hot plate of al dente spaghetti and six baked potatoes, one for each guy - you know, to fill up on carbohydrates.'' Even the Rolling Stones, who are renowned for past excesses, both onstage and off, implemented some changes for their 1989 North American tour. The band's dressing room was stocked with Evian, fresh juice and Earl Grey tea; their ''rumpus room'' was outfitted with a pool table, video games and a jukebox - low-key compared with the scene backstage during their previous tours.
''I don't like all this lavish, pretentious sort of stuff that was in the 70's,'' said Mick Jagger in a telephone interview. ''We have a cappuccino machine - that's very yuppie. You don't see so many drug pushers anymore. That seems to have gone a bit out of fashion.''
 
The Old Days: Nothing Exceeded Like Excess
 A 1972 concert film by Robert Frank documents Mr. Jagger sniffing cocaine backstage and crew members shooting heroin. Other bands' behavior was just as extreme. By the early 70's, Led Zeppelin had earned a reputation for throwing giddy groupie parties, destroying entire floors of first-class hotels and lobbing color TV sets out of upper-story windows.
Such tales are now rare. But back then, the logistics of touring fostered extravagance. A concert promoter in each city was responsible for laying out the money up front to produce the show, supplying sound and lighting systems, renting the concert space and outfitting the backstage areas according to the needs specified in the band's rider. With the money earned through ticket sales, the promoter would cover expenses first, then divide whatever was left over with the artist, usually in a 50-50 or 40-60 ratio.
As top-grossing road acts became more and more excessive in their requests, promoters likewise became more flamboyant, setting up elaborate backstage scenarios to greet the artist after the show. Mick Jagger remembers coming backstage to find the promoters had installed ''big ice sculptures - huge tongues, or replicas of the band. And there'd always be a theme, like Hawaii. There'd be hula dancers and things like that. A roast pig. They'd go absolutely mad.''
Among the most famous for such scenarios are Bill Graham, the San Francisco-based promoter, and Ron Delsener of New York. Mr. Delsener points out that such theatrics tended to happen in larger cities, where the artists were more concerned with upholding their extravagant image in front of friends, family, celebrities and the media.
''There'd be a New York theme, and we'd set it up to look like a street scene, with hydrants and people dressed as old-time policemen giving out chocolate egg creams,'' he says. ''In the 70's, Elton John once wanted to play tennis, so we arranged with Nassau Coliseum to set up a court backstage, and he played with Billie Jean King. I've had a pool table assembled, a golf driving range, caviar by the truckloads, you name it. Topless bartenders.''
Gregg Perloff, an executive with Bill Graham's company, Bill Graham Presents, says, ''Things didn't happen overnight. First there was no food backstage. Then there was food backstage. Then bands started traveling in limousines. Then each member went in a different limousine. Another band member would say, 'Well, I want two bottles of champagne in my limousine.' Bands made $100,000 a night, but at the end they hadn't made any money. People find that hard to believe, but when you spend $6,000 a night on limousines it's very easy not to make any money.''
When the requests came directly from the performers, promoters would pull out the stops to give them what they wanted. But the promoters' own sturdy profits prompted them to add their own embellishments. As late as the early 80's Bill Graham employed a designer, Eleonore Hockabout, whose job was to decorate the backstage area.
''Bill always liked to surprise artists,'' she says. She designed mannequins filled with colored lights and hung with trash jewelry for a Cyndi Lauper concert. When Peter Gabriel did a Christmas show, she set up enormous Christmas trees with presents underneath, and all the band members were given lace stockings stuffed with gifts. For a U2 show, Ms. Hockabout's team brought huge pieces of black paper, chalk and crayons out to fans waiting before the show, and had them write messages to the band which were then hung up backstage.
Performers and promoters eventually realized that such gimmicks were bleeding their profits. ''A lot of bands were broke after a tour,'' says Mr. Delsener. ''They didn't know what they were doing in those days. They'd come off the road and say, 'God, that's all the money we made? We have to cut down our expenses.' ''
 
The New Economy: Less for the Promoters
 Bands not only cut their expenses, they cut the promoters' profits. As early as 1972, Led Zeppelin had capitalized on their massive touring popularity by knocking the promoters' cut down from 40 or 50 percent to as little as 10 percent. In return, the band's organization took on many of the promoter's expenses. By the 80's it became standard practice for bands to take their own sound and lighting systems from city to city, since the quality of equipment on the road could vary.
The relationship between promoter and performer was essentially reversed. Whereas once the promoter was in control of nearly every aspect of a concert except the actual playing - and was paid accordingly - now the promoter is more a hired hand who follows the band's directives.
When promoters were making all the arrangements, Mr. Delsener says, ''acts were getting ripped off and cheated. There were a lot of deals supposedly going down where people were piling on the bills, getting rebates they weren't passing along to the artist. Now bands carry accountants on the road. They scrutinize every bill and every expenditure. You can't go overboard spending the band's money like you could in the 70's.''
The new economy is reflected in bands' riders. For the most part, says Bob Garcia, a promoter for Radio City Music Hall, riders have become standardized (occasional eccentricities do pop up; in 1986, the rap group the Beastie Boys requested condoms in various colors). Mr. Perloff notes that most groups he's worked with, from the Grateful Dead to R.E.M. to New Kids on the Block, have straightforward, streamlined contracts.
Other bands may have unusual catering needs (in the B-52's case, three band members are strict vegetarians), but these acts either bring along their own food-preparation staff or send meticulous guidelines to the concert hall well in advance.
''What's in the rider is what's necessary to do the show,'' says Mr. Perloff. ''There isn't a lot of fluff.''
Says Tim Collins of Aerosmith's current rider, ''We don't ask for anything we don't need. We're just not into wasting. What they didn't know then, and what they know very well now, is that, ultimately, the artist pays for everything. Ticket prices can only go so high.''
Rock performers aren't the only ones who have trimmed their budgets. Mr. Garcia says that the pop crooner Julio Iglesias has changed his rider significantly over the years. ''Ten years ago, he asked for a lot of catering, especially expensive caviar,'' he said. ''Now he doesn't. His contract is very standard, very simple. It's more of a business now than it used to be.''
Since most of the financial burden to organize a tour now rests on the band's side, many artists, such as the Rolling Stones, have developed deals with corporate sponsors to defray costs.
''The performers get a million dollars or whatever,'' says Mr. Delsener, ''which will help underwrite the plane fares, the cost of rehearsing - things that have to be done before they collect a nickel.'' The role of the promoter, he says, has decreased to the point where now ''all you have to do is follow the rider and do the promotion and advertising as they direct.''
Despite all the changes, Mick Jagger says that a lot of the aspects of touring are still the same. ''Take a band that's been around forever,'' he says dryly. ''In the big cities, you have lots and lots of people backstage, and every groupie that was ever around has to be let in just on a nostalgia basis. I still rather like to have pretty girls backstage, rather than ancient old journalists that turn up, trying to remind you they wrote a great story on you in 1969!
''I think the big difference in touring is that in the 60's you used to go out and do 20 minutes, which was wonderful. Now you go out and do two hours and a half, and it's still not enough.''
 
THE M & M WARS
 A band's touring contract, called a rider, spells out a band's requirements - food, alcohol, technical specifications such as how many electrical outlets are needed in the dressing rooms. By the late 70's, bands were caught up in an almost perverse contest to see whose rider could be the most excessive.
The competition reached the height of absurdity in 1980, when the pop-metal group Van Halen, on their first arena tour as the top-billed act, put a clause in their rider requesting bowls of M & M's candy with the brown ones taken out. In 1981, the Rolling Stones production coordinator, Michael Ahearn, added a clause to the Stones' rider asking for only brown M & M's.
A spokesman for Van Halen insists that the M & M clause existed solely to test whether promoters were actually reading the rider, but the band continued to specify the demand on subsequent tours. As for the Stones, Mr. Ahearn says, ''I did it for fun.''
Tim Collins, Aerosmith's manager since 1984, insists that his band was the first to be really excessive in the rider. ''They started the M & M's thing,'' he says. ''They had to have a four-gallon jar of M & M's and the promoter had to pick out all the green ones.''

BYLINE: By M. A. FARBER with DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
At no time since he burst upon the scene as a New York City developer and then as an Atlantic City casino operator has Donald J. Trump seemed in more financial trouble than in the last few weeks. The 43-year-old entrepreneur has been closeted with his bankers amid concerns that he lacks the cash to make timely payments on his huge business debt. In New Jersey, worried gaming regulators have undertaken a broad review of his holdings and financial condition.
In a wide-ranging interview recently, however, Mr. Trump was as irrepressible as ever, asserting that his resources were still enormous, striking out at those who he said were ''jealous'' of him and affirming his plans to continue as a force in the economic life of the city and the region.
At his cherrywood desk on the 26th floor of Trump Tower, at Fifth Avenue and 56th Street, surrounded by framed magazine covers of himself and by baseball bats into which his name had been carved, the sandy-haired chief executive of the Trump Organization seemed mindful of everything that had been written about him. But the talk of his demise, he said, was indeed premature. 
What follows are excerpts from that interview, interspersed with observations by his wife, Ivana, who may soon be seeking a divorce, and by a number of financiers, builders and other professionals who have dealt with Mr. Trump since 1977, when he first came to notice with his conversion of the decrepit Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street into the Grand Hyatt.
 
'Things Could Be Tougher'
 Mr. Trump was asked about speculation that his financial worth was much exaggerated.
 ''They say I've slimmed down to $500 million,'' he said. ''Things could be tougher. The latest hot rumor is that I'm trying to get my net worth down as far as possible for the benefit of the divorce. That's total [expletive]. I don't want to get it down real low or up too high . . . Let me tell you something, just so you understand. If I'm worth $500 million, if I'm worth $3 billion, I really don't give a [expletive]. I really don't. I truly don't.''
Mr. Trump pointed to the Plaza Hotel, visible from his wall-size office window, and likened it to the two Impressionist masterpieces that had been purchased at auction by a Japanese bidder at record prices.
''What is that building worth? You tell me,'' he said. ''See, the whole point is, what are my assets worth? The Plaza Hotel is like those paintings that sold the other day at numbers nobody believed possible. The Plaza is the same thing as those paintings. If I were to sell the Plaza, I would get a number that would knock you off your seats. I don't even know what that number is. I couldn't tell you what it is. But that number would be tremendous.'' He recalled his sale last year of the St. Moritz Hotel to Alan Bond, the now-struggling Australian financier, for approximately $100 million more than Mr. Trump had paid for it.
''There's always somebody to pay more,'' he said. ''The St. Moritz was not a trophy - it was only a modest trophy. The Plaza is the ultimate trophy in the world. There is always somebody that is going to want to buy the greatest hotel in the world.''
 
Ivana's View:'Donald Is Fine'
 Few have ever faulted Mr. Trump's energy. Despite widespread reports that Mr. Trump has had an affair with a model, Marla Maples, Ivana Trump was generous with her praise. During a luncheon interview early this month in a corner table at the Edwardian Room of the Plaza, which she has continued to manage, she called her husband the ''hardest-working man I have ever met. He is a great businessman and a great promoter. You don't have those both very often in the same person.''
She said she believed he would weather his current financial difficulties - ''I think Donald is fine, I think he will be all right.'' A few days later, as headlines about Mr. Trump's uncertain fortunes flared, Mrs. Trump issued a brief statement: ''Donald and I are partners in marriage and in business. I will stand by him through thick or thin, for better or worse.''
Irving Fisher, head of the HRH Construction Company, which has built all of Mr. Trump's major projects in New York, also portrayed Mr. Trump as a shrewd developer whose image as a fun-loving, sports-loving ''people's billionaire'' could be deceptive. ''He is a master at projecting his image,'' Mr. Fisher said, but ''there's the public image versus the smartness. He doesn't want people to understand how smart he really is.''
Conrad Stevenson, a former banker who helped finance the Commodore Hotel project and Trump Tower, said Mr. Trump ''has more perseverance than many other developers, who tend to be impatient.''
Mr. Stevenson, agreeing that bank credit is increasingly tight across the board, divided real estate developers into three categories. There are ''the small number who have no troubles, like Leonard Litwin and Lewis Rudin, the ones at the other end that have real trouble - and I won't name any names there - and then there's the rest of them, who are not in trouble but who have problems. And Donald is there.''
 
Criticizing His Managers
 Just as Mr. Trump has recently taken to criticizing the executives who had previously managed his casinos in Atlantic City, he expressed displeasure in the interview with the people now running his Trump Shuttle, which links New York with Boston and Washington.
Mr. Trump bought the shuttle in October 1988 from Eastern Airlines for $365 million. Although it was once believed to be one of the most profitable airline operations in the nation, its ridership had suffered severely during the protracted strike at Eastern. It competes with the Pan Am shuttle, which is up for sale, and there have been conflicting reports about whether it, too, is on the block.
 Q. Is the Trump Shuttle a success?
 A. The Trump Shuttle is an esthetic success. It will be a financial success. But right now, I'm upset with the people running the Trump Shuttle, for one reason: We give a much better product than Pan Am, and yet we only do about 50 percent of the business.
 Q. Is that their fault?
 A. Yeah, I think it's their fault. [Noting that the shuttle had only about 12 percent of the market when he purchased it, because of the labor troubles, Mr. Trump continued:]
 A. I've spent a lot of money making it a great operation. We took that 12 percent up to 50 percent. Now, there are people who would say that is a great job. I am not satisfied with it, because I think our product is so far better than Pan Am. I am disappointed in my people.
 Q. But those are the same people who brought you from 12 percent to 50 percent?
 A. That's right. But I am not satisfied with 50 percent.
 Q. Would you sell it?
 A. Only if I get the right price. I'm very proud of the Shuttle.
 
The Unbuilt Trump City
 Mr. Trump describes himself as the biggest landowner in Manhattan, based primarily on his ownership of 76 acres of railroad yards along the Hudson River on the Upper West Side, where he has been planning to build Trump City. The keystone of the project would be a 150-story skyscraper, the world's tallest.
Mr. Trump bought the site for about $95 million in 1984, and is paying roughly $20 million a year in debt service to keep it. He has yet to get city approval for this gargantuan project, which has drawn a storm of protest from people living in the neighborhood.
Mr. Trump said that, given the downturn in the real estate market, it was probably a lucky break that he had not undertaken the project sooner. ''I could have had a job under construction and coming on now, into a bad market,'' he said.
For Mr. Trump, the city's current economic situation resembles the climate in which he negotiated the renovation of the Commodore Hotel. Because the city's fiscal plight was so acute at that time, he said, ''They were begging me to take 40 years of tax abatement. I got 40 years of tax abatement. They were begging me to build a restaurant over the street. And I built a room over the street - the only room in New York that is built over the street. You could get anything you wanted because times were so bad in New York that the Planning Commission and the city were just begging me to go ahead with the building.
''Now there is no construction going on. It's all timing. You've got to get your zoning when it's going like this,'' tilting one hand down, ''and do your construction and get to market when it's going like this,'' tilting his hand up.
Mr. Trump hinted that the idea of having the world's tallest building at the West Side location might have to be abandoned. ''I have a whole development plan over there. There will be give and take and there will be negotiation. There always is. Things will be given to the city.''
Peter Paden, a lawyer for People for Westpride Inc., said that almost any form of the project as outlined by Mr. Trump would be battled through the courts for years. ''That is as certain as the night follows day,'' Mr. Paden said. Even some of Mr. Trump's oldest real estate associates question whether the West Side project will ever work out.
 
'What Else Is New?'
 But Mr. Trump remains undeterred. ''Remember when I put up Trump Tower,'' he said. ''Everyone laughed when I said I was going to build a 60-story building right next to Tiffany's. They said, 'No way.' But I got it. My whole life, I've gotten zone changes. People say, 'Oh, you've got to get a zone change.' I say, 'What else is new?' That's all I've done. I'm a guy that goes out and gets zone changes and builds buildings.''
Mr. Trump also suggested that too many people were simply jealous of his accomplishments. ''I don't think anybody has done what I've done. Because what I've done is not only Manhattan real estate but Atlantic City and stock deals that have been tremendous,'' he said. ''People in my business that are 80 years old and have been there forever, they don't like that I own the Plaza Hotel.'' Mr. Trump lamented that ''these are the 'beat up Trump' months.'' He has always been sensitive to criticism and in the past, was said to have had newspapers with unfavorable articles removed from the gift shops of his casinos. When things weren't going right, he was also known to occasionally flash a photograph of his lawyer, the feared Roy Cohn, and demand of his antagonists: ''Would you rather deal with him?''
Vincent DeSimone, a well-regarded structural engineer who has worked on several Trump residential projects, finds the criticism of Mr. Trump very much misplaced.
''Trump-bashing has become a popular form of social intercourse,'' Mr. DeSimone said. But ''when you do business with Donald Trump, you've got visibility. It says you're good. Every time I ever thought I had second-guessed Donald Trump and that he had made a mistake, I didn't fully realize what he was thinking.''
Mr. DeSimone donated his firm's services to Mr. Trump's restoration of the Wollman Rink in Central Park, completed in late 1986. He recalled Mr. Trump telling him, ''Vince, I'll make you famous.'' And he did, Mr. DeSimone said. ''At the opening ceremony, Donald personally thanked me in front of everyone. Lee Iacocca was there. The Cardinal was there. Koch was there. And I heard it all that night on the radio.''
Suddenly, such celebratory days for Mr. Trump seem, if not gone, at least remote. But veterans of the New York real estate scene are philosophical. ''This business is like the Bible,'' said Mr. Fisher of HRH Construction. ''You have seven good years, and seven bad years. The cycle turns. No one is immune from what's happening.''

The Gumshoe of Annual Reports

BYLINE: By Alison Leigh Cowan

 BODY:
Do not expect to see Behind the Numbers spreading sunshine on coffee tables throughout greater corporate America. In the two years since the pricey, and influential, investment newsletter made its debut, it has recommended the stock of only one of the 78 companies it has written about.
Behind Behind the Numbers, is David W. Tice. He is a 35-year-old accounting gumshoe who scrutinizes annual reports and other published documents for clues to a company's financial health. They are the sorts of tantalizing tidbits that have been overlooked by the public and the analysts who watch public companies, in part as a service to investment-banking clients. 
''There are so many other people out there touting stocks,'' said Mr. Tice ''I can add value because I don't have the conflicts of interest in telling people what to be wary about.''
Sometimes, the tip-off is a bloated inventory. Other times, management's alibi fails to check out or Mr. Tice discovers that a profitable company is not reporting expenses in a timely fashion. And like any detective, he sometimes hits a dead end. ''You end up going down a lot of blind alleys before you find something,'' he said.
The approach may have made him a scourge of public companies, but it has made him popular among the 30 or so investors who each pay $10,000 a year to subscribe to the newsletter, which has 10 issues a year. (The subscribers can pay in cash or do an agreed-upon amount of trading with any of several brokerage firms Mr. Tice works with.) Most of the subscribers are institutional investors. A handful are short-sellers, speculators who sell borrowed stock on a bet that the price will drop and they will be able to buy it back at a cheaper price.
The subscribers have presumably done well. The 77 stocks Mr. Tice has issued warnings on have underperformed the market by an average of 8.5 percent, said Mr. Tice, whose policy is not to personally buy or sell any stock on the list until at least one week after publishing his recommendations.
Mr. Tice, who grew up in Independence, Mo., has a bachelors degree in accounting and a masters in business administration from Texas Christian University. ''I never planned on being an accountant,'' he said, ''but thought accounting would just help me be a better businessman.''
He spent 10 years in industry, first at the Atlantic Richfield Company's management training program, then at the Enserch Corporation, where he evaluated mergers for the diversified energy company. Even then, he was not known for clamming up when things did not look right. ''They made a bunch of dumb acquisitions that I tried to keep them out of,'' Mr. Tice said.
He then joined the Concorde Financial Corporation, an investment adviser in Dallas. In 1987, however, his life changed when he read ''Quality of Earnings,'' a classic by Thornton L. O'Glove, the editor of another newsletter on accounting shenanigans.
''What I liked about him was he was a skeptic and a critic of the conflicts of interest that exist between brokerage firms and the companies they recommend,'' said Mr. Tice, who soon quit his job to start a competing product out of his Dallas home.
Today, Behind the Numbers occupies a 500-square-foot office in Dallas overlooking a golf course, and is still primarly a one-man show.
His best call was on Aug. 24, 1989, when he predicted the slow demise of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the big publishing house that had restructured at great cost to avoid a takeover. Unnerved that the stock moved from $10 to $18 in the span of one quarter, Mr. Tice investigated and found that the company's separate pieces, when the debt is repaid, will be worth a mere $1.70. Yesterday, the stock closed at $3.50 So far, his worst call has been the Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation , a large chain of video stores whose stock has risen sharply despite Mr. Tice's warnings on October 1988. Then. the stock was trading at $9.50, adjusted for a later split. Yesterday, it closed at $22.50. Mr. Tice was one of a few analysts who had criticized the company for taking three years to write off the expenses of purchasing its library of hit tapes. The critics contended that hit tapes lose their economic value faster than that. The company has since agreed to speed up in certain cases. An inventory write-down is still possible, said Mr. Tice, whose analysis included visiting several Blockbuster stores and counting the number of hit tapes on the shelves.
On his latest warning list are several popular blue chips. including Merck & Company, the pharmaceutical giant, and the Philip Morris Companies, the consumer products giant. In both cases, the negative reviews have to do more with concerns over fundamentals than with any quarrels over their accounting.
After interviewing some physicians, Mr. Tice soured on Merck, he said, because, ''the company's research and development pipeline will not generate the blockbuster drugs that it needs.'' He also thinks investors are ignoring subtle hints by management that this quarter's earnings will be up modestly compared with last year's, not the 20 percent most of Wall Street is expecting.
As for Philip Morris, he is concerned that too much of its 1989 profits came solely from sharp price hikes on its cigarettes. ''Eighty-eight percent of their earnings gain came from tobacco and 94 percent of that came from price increases,'' he said.
Sometimes, Mr. Tice's intuition is on the money but still backfires. He criticized the Noxell Corporation, a cosmetics company, for its rapid buildup in inventories. At the time, the stock was trading at $22. It turned out that the company was indeed experiencing slower growth, but its stock rose. Reason: it agreed to be sold in late 1989 for about $35 a share.

COMPANIES
 
The Trump Seesaw - Headed for a Downswing?
 
He flashed onto the scene more than a decade ago. (''I wasn't satisfied just to earn a good living. I wanted to make a statement.'') He flourished. (''I like thinking big. I always have.'') And now, could Donald J. Trump be in danger of flaming out? ''I want to be king of cash,'' he said recently. His bankers wish him the best in raising that cash, having spent last week meeting with him about debts that have left his New York and Atlantic City properties mortgaged up to their minarets. Casino regulators, who gave Trump his first license after a one-day hearing in 1982, were inquiring about his financing as well. One regulator said that Mr. Trump's Atlantic City employees were ''terrified,'' and ''hiding under their desks.'' But a Trump executive called a press conference Thursday to say the casinos' performance was ''fabulous,'' recent layoffs were merely ''streamlining,'' later bill payments were the result of better cash-management and that no casinos were for sale. ''Junk bond'' traders responded by pushing some of the Trump paper down below the value of Chilean debt. 
 
Greyhound on the Ropes
 
The survival of the nation's only coast-to-coast bus system is at stake. With creditors about to seize some of its buses, Greyhound Lines Inc. filed for bankruptcy last week. Greyhound Lines has been staggering under a heavy load of takeover debt and a three-month drivers strike. As the company rebuilt its network with replacement workers, 52 shooting incidents, more than 100 bomb threats and uncounted cases of vandalism chased riders away. Creditors are likely to pressure Fred G. Currey, the angry, adamant chief executive, to make peace with the drivers. But the bigger question is whether creditors will agree with Mr. Currey that for a bus company to profitably serve Chicago, for example, it must also serve Olive Hill Junction, Ky. If they say no, they would probably sell off buses and leave small-town service to regional bus lines or none at all.
 
Beatrice on the Slopes
 
Who says a successful investment banker has to spend all the time at the office? In a profession where those who have hobbies and family lives are accused of lacking commitment, Eric Gleacher sometimes preferred broad golf courses and ski slopes to the confines of Morgan Stanley, where he was head of mergers and acquisitions. But it was on a lift line in Vail, Colo., in January that he and Charles M. Harper, chief executive of Conagra Inc., discussed a bid for the Beatrice Company. On Thursday, Conagra announced that it had agreed to buy Beatrice for $1.34 billion, creating the nation's second-largest food company after Philip Morris. It was Mr. Gleacher's first deal since he formed his own company at the beginning of the year.
 
A Billion for the Lada
 
Lada on the outside, General Motors on the inside: The General Motors Corporation signed a five-year contract on Thursday to sell auto parts to the Volga Automobile Works, the Soviet Union's largest automaker, for $1 billion - in hard dollars, not rubles. The parts will help two models of the Lada passenger cars meet the European Community's clean-air standards so that they can be exported to Western Europe after 1992. But if the Soviet Union expects to sell cars anywhere west of Minsk, the cars had better work more smoothly than the Soviet phone system. G.M. executives in Detroit didn't know the details of their Soviet contract because communications with Togliatti, where the Soviet company is based, have been spotty. The city has only two international telephone lines and no fax machines. Not to worry, says G.M.; let's think about hauling in our own satellite dish to bypass the Soviet telephone system.
 
Niet to Underground Calls
 
Serving him medallions of Maine lobster at the White House is one thing. Letting an American telephone company lay fiber-optic cable across his country is another. And so, the day after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union left the United States, the Commerce Department told US West Inc. to drop its plans for leading the effort to build a $500 million communications system linking Europe and Japan. Technology transfer is at most a secondary concern, since US West planned to install outmoded equipment. American defense officials worry that Soviet communications, now transmitted by microwaves, would be more difficult to intercept if they traveled on underground cables instead.
 
Chip Maker Loses a Leader
 
Sematech is suddenly without a leader, and the electronics industry without one of its pioneers. Robert N. Noyce, an inventor of the computer chip, died last Sunday at the age of 62. His work led the way to everything from personal computers to programmable coffee makers. A co-founder of the Intel Corporation, Mr. Noyce was chief executive of Sematech at his death. The company is a government and industry research consortium trying to help American chip makers catch up with the Japanese.
 
An Isolationist Institute
 
The prophet of American corporate nationalism has attracted some unlikely followers. Clyde V. Prestowitz opened his Economic Strategy Institute in Washington last week with the goal of keeping American companies from becoming stateless global enterprises. One study under way is likely to dispute the value of recent trade agreements with Japan; Mr. Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department official and businessman, has become the Mike Tyson of Japan-bashers. Another study probably will question foreign investment in the United States. Still, among the 10 corporations financing his center are Motorola and Ford, both dedicated global marketers, and North American Philips, owned by the Dutch.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
On the Wings of Druk-Air
 
The Druk-Air Corporation stunned Bhutanese airline analysts last week by reporting load factors 25 percent to 50 percent above industry expectations. Druk-Air has going for it an absolute monopoly at its hub in Paro, in the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. The fleet, one 80-passenger British Aerospace 146, flies a total of six weekly round trips. The Bhutanese expected average load factors of less than 40 percent. ''It was anticipated we wouldn't make any money,'' said Ugyen Tshering, Bhutan's Ambassador to the United Nations. Instead, Druk-Air has load factors of 50 percent or 60 percent, sometimes filling the plane. And, besting those New York hotels that boasted of a queen standing guard, Druk-Air counts King Jigme Singye Wangchuk among its passengers. On operating costs, the airline already is close to breaking even, Mr. Tshering says. Another few years and Bhutan might begin privatizing it, selling shares to the public and maybe even establishing a stock market, he adds.
 
Argentina Makes a Payment
 
Like a compulsive shopper gone repentant, Argentina has made a token payment to start settling its bills. It paid $40 million last Thursday on $6.1 billion in interest that has piled up since it defaulted two years ago. Bankers are encouraged that President Carlos Saul Menem has reduced inflation, built up a budget surplus and convinced the International Monetary Fund to resume lending. Argentina's debt, which traded for less than a dime on the dollar earlier this year, struggled back to about 15 cents last week before softening. ''What you're seeing is selling on good news,'' said Peter Albano, a trader at Salomon Brothers.
 
In Brief
 
Hitachi Ltd. of Japan has developed an electronic memory chip that can store 64 million bits of information, or more than 5,000 double-spaced typewritten pages, in an area about the size of a thumbnail.
 
*
 
Japan chose American technology last week as the standard for a new generation of cellular telephones. The use of the technology, from Motorola Inc., will make it easier for American companies to sell their equipment.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Credit Yes, but for the Small?
 
Maybe the banks aren't such tightwads after all. The Federal Reserve Board said that the amount of loans and investments by banks in the United States, reported as annual rates, rose by 8.4 percent in February, 9.2 percent in March and 5.1 percent in April. Commercial and industrial loans, down in the first two months of the year, were up at a 9 percent rate in March and 10 percent in April, with real estate loans rising about as much. ''I doubt we have credit conditions that would keep the economy from experiencing modest growth,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter. Banks have been chastened by bad loans and tough examiners, and some regulators fear that banks might react by becoming so stingy that the economy's health would be at risk. The Fed's figures hint that small businesses, at least, might be justified in complaining about tight credit: an increasing percentage of commercial and industrial loans are coming from foreign banks, which tend to concentrate on large accounts.
 
Alas, Productivity
 
Productivity fell at a 2.7 percent annual rate for the first quarter. Many economists saw the news last week as inflationary, with employers having to pay more for labor or hire less-able workers.

On the Road With Grace Pineda

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Grace Pineda, daughter of a Filipino diplomat, lived in France, Switzerland and the Philippines before her family settled in the United States. Here she studied Russian, one of four languages she now speaks, and later earned a graduate degree in international business from Fordham University. She has specialized in the Pacific markets since 1982, when she got her first money management job and was assigned to watch a promising spot called Japan.
The many roads that Grace Pineda has traveled now all come together in Princeton, N.J., where she has been managing the Merrill Lynch Developing Capital Markets Fund since it opened for business last September. The $79 million fund, which invests mostly in stocks in the smaller international markets, ranked No. 1 among international funds in the first quarter, returning 6.1 percent while the group dropped 5.4 percent, and ranked 16th among the 1,700-plus funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services. 
The 33-year-old Ms. Pineda makes five worldwide trips each year to scout companies and countries. Right now, she considers Mexico ''the most interesting part of the world'' because of the reforms underway there, but she is also watching South America, especially Brazil and Argentina, ''because those countries are seeing what Mexico is able to do.''
Her biggest holdings, 10.8 percent of her portfolio, are in Mexico, with Malaysia (10.2 percent) a close runner-up. She is also looking at - but not yet buying - stocks in Turkey, Greece and Sri Lanka.
Her fund invests in 23 countries and defines ''emerging markets'' broadly: It focuses on economies where capitalism is developing or where there is great growth potential. Ms. Pineda says Austria, Switzerland and France fit the bill, and so too do India, Chile, Venezuela and Indonesia. She avoids the mature United States, Japanese, British and West German markets.
Her strategy is bearing fruit. To deal in emerging markets, managers must ''have experience, know the countries, understand the psychology of these markets and ride some markets' ups and downs,'' said Antoine W. van Agtmael, president of the Emerging Markets Investors Corporation, a Washington-based investment management firm and a competitor. ''I think she has all that.''
She certainly knows her geography. She has just returned from a whirlwind trip that sent her to five countries in two weeks. She travels, too, when she is on vacation, looking at ''churches, not companies,'' she said. But on a recent vacation to Chile, she added, she was buying a shirt in Santiago and couldn't help turning a critical eye on the traffic and prices in the shopping center. When she got back, she bought more shares in the closed-end Chile Fund to increase her exposure to the market there.
Her investing strategies are guided by the theory that developing markets are driven by sentiment, liquidity and rumors. ''That's the way the locals invest,'' she said. ''They hear stories, get excited and the momentum builds.'' And because those markets can grow so rapidly - the forecast for this year's growth rate in Indonesia, for example, exceeds 40 percent - they offer potential for big gains. So she is willing to pay as much as 20 times earnings for a company.
But there is risk involved. Because of its focus on smaller markets, the fund is riskier than many international ones. In an attempt to control risk, Ms. Pineda avoids some markets, such as Africa, which she said is politically unstable and lacking the economic reforms of other developing regions.
In Mexico, where she is targeting many of her investments, she likes Cifra, a Mexico City-based mass-market retailer, which she expects will benefit from the country's strong growth in manufactured exports. Another favorite: Telefonos de Mexico S.A. de C.V., the state telephone company that is soon to be privatized.
In Hong Kong, she likes Dickson Concepts Ltd., a luxury wholesaler and retailer in Asia. She expects Dickson to grow at a yearly rate of 15 percent or more over the next two or three years and considers its luxury retail niche a good bet because ''that part of the market is recession-proof and Tiananmen Square-proof.''
She also favors Skala Aktie, Hungary's largest mass-market retailer, which is traded on the Austrian over-the-counter market. It is her sole holding in Hungary, which she calls the most backward of the markets she follows. But a recent visit gave her hope for change. ''I was one of the last Westerners to see the Communist red star on top of their stock exchange,'' she said.
She says there is opportunity in the pent-up demand for infrastructure in developing nations and taps into it by buying stocks of companies that deal in cement. In Denmark, she likes FLS Industries, which supplies engineering services to companies in the cement industry. She also likes the Siam Cement Company in Thailand and P.T. Cement Cibinong in Indonesia.
 
KEEPING MORE FUNDS IN THE PORTFOLIO
The number of mutual funds grew sharply in the 1980's - there are now about 3,000 - and so too has the number of funds that individual investors keep in their portfolios.
In 1984, 40 percent of the 1,007 people queried by UAI Technology Inc., a North Carolina financial services and consulting firm, owned shares in one mutual fund - and just 6 percent had invested in six or more funds. By 1989, things were pretty much reversed. Only 20 percent of 851 investors polled by the firm had shares in one fund while 15 percent had invested in six funds or more.
There are good reasons why people invest in more than one fund and why that trend will continue, said Larry Cohen, vice president of Phoenix-Hecht/Gallup, a division of UAI that also does market research and consulting. As more funds become riskier investments, it makes sense to diversify to reduce risk and enhance total return. Furthermore, investors are using different funds for different financial goals, such as saving for retirement or for a child's education.

HEADLINE: All About/Dairy Farming;
Cows on a Technological Tightrope

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
American agriculture has few symbols more popular than the Holstein cow. Her wholesome, black-and-white form decorates bedsheets, coffee mugs and countless other household items.
Dairy farmers, however, have found that the warm feelings do not necessarily extend to them. The industry's use of drugs to make cows more productive, its contribution to pollution and soil erosion, and its dependence on import quotas and taxpayer-funded subsidies all alienate consumers. Though retail dairy sales continue to edge upward - topping $43 billion last year - the health-conscious tend to associate dairy products with cholesterol.
Farmers complain that consumers take plentiful supplies at some of the world's lowest prices for granted. ''Most farmers feel underappreciated, especially when the milk check arrives,'' said John Nye, whose family has a 200-cow farm in Washington Depot, Conn. 
The industry rebounded last year from a dismal 1988, and 1990 looks promising because prices for most products are strong. But support prices have fallen to a level where many farmers will face huge losses if production hikes or an unexpected drop in demand reproduces the surpluses of the 1980's.
Farmers say that making capital improvements to expand production has become more risky. They are becoming less receptive to environmentalists demanding that they limit their use of agricultural chemicals or take some of their cropland out of production to protect wetlands. ''Farmers fear that people want changes but will balk at paying the bill,'' said Stephen Kerr, chairman of the Council of Northeast Farmer Cooperatives, which lobbies for 10,000 dairy farmers.
 
The Politics
Washington Weighs Price Support System
The biggest immediate fear of most farmers is that Congress and the Bush Administration will further whittle away at Government supports.
Dairy supports and pricing are bewilderingly complex. When prices are high, the free market rules. When prices are low, Government supports come into play. First, milk processors negotiate monthly prices with farmers in Minnesota and Wisconsin, the dairy heartland. Federal milk boards in major cities around the nation then use these to set minimums that processors in their areas must pay farmers - depending on variables like distance from the Midwest and how much milk is processed into other products. California has its own pricing system.
Underlying everything is the Federal support price - currently $10.10 per 100 pounds (about 11.5 gallons) of milk - that farmers get if market prices are no higher. The Government also calculates support prices for other dairy products. Last year, with milk soaring to a peak of nearly $16 per 100 pounds, nearly all of the $600 million the Government spent was on one product: butter.
Dairy executives say that the butter glut is primarily a side effect of the rapid growth in demand for skim and low-fat milk. They say that heavy Government purchases of butter created an illusion that dairy supplies in general are abundant, leading to support prices too low to guarantee reasonable supplies of other milk products. ''Ten dollars and 10 cents is a non-support level,'' said James Barr, head of the National Milk Producers Federation. But the federation and other farm groups figure that, with a deficit-conscious Congress, they will have to fight just to keep the current levels.
Farmers also fear that the Administration will agree to drop quotas limiting dairy imports from countries like New Zealand, the world's major dairy exporter. They anticipate more political clashes this fall, when Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter plans hearings to review the entire pricing system.
 
Economics of Scale
The Cutting Edge? California, Of Course
An average farm in the Northeast or Midwest is still a small business, with herds of 50 to 75 cows. In California, dairy farms are more like factories, averaging 500 cows, with a growing number of farms exceeding 2,000. To raise more cattle on less land, California dairymen buy feed instead of following the traditional practice of growing it themselves. Needing neither cold-weather barn nor the land and equipment for raising feed, they have lower production costs.
In California, therefore, farmers are prospering even though prices are $1 per 100 pounds of milk lower than elsewhere. Low milk prices have encouraged a rapid expansion in dairy processing plants there. ''Cheese production is growing at 20 percent to 25 percent a year,'' said Fred Douma, chairman of the Milk Producers Council in Southern California. ''Morale here is pretty good.''
Mr. Douma, who has 2,500 cows on just 120 acres in Southern California's San Bernardino Valley, says farmers have steadily raised their estimates of the most profitable size for a herd. Investments are soaring too. Farmers sink $5 million into a 1,200-cow operation, 10 times the investment in the average Eastern farm. ''You won't survive with 300 cows, even if you have no debts,'' said Mr. Douma.
The assembly-line dairies have farmers elsewhere worried, especially since the California style is spreading to New Mexico and Texas. ''People aren't very happy about it because the growth in California can create oversupplies which will lead to more cuts in Government support prices,'' said Bob Wellington, chief economist for AgriMark Inc., a dairy cooperative in the Northeast.
Tensions between regions are one reason for this autumn's pricing hearings. More pressures come from upper Midwestern farmers who feel that other regions benefit from excessive pricing premiums. They argue that if farmers in the Southeast were not guaranteed such large margins over the price paid to Wisconsin and Minnesota farmers, the Midwesterners would sell more dairy products to that region throughout the year. They already supply a large portion of the Southeast's needs during the summer and autumn because dairy cows, like many of their owners, slow down in hot weather.
 
Techological Gains
From Hormones to Automoted Milkers
Dairy farming is awash in new technology. Genetically engineered drugs, computer monitoring and automation are increasing productivity and challenging regulators.
Take the case of bovine somatotropin, a naturally occurring growth hormone in cows that genetic engineers have managed to grow in bacteria. By injecting this artificial BST into their milkers, farmers can boost production by up to 20 percent.
Studies so far indicate that the injections have no measurable impact on milk's nutritional value. But critics argue that added BST can harm the health of cows and that the long-term effect on consumers is unknown. Some farmers say that its use will create a milk glut, driving more farmers out of business. Others believe the hormone is valuable but not worth using if it damages milk's image for purity. The Food and Drug Administration has repeatedly delayed issuing its findings on BST injections, allowing their use for at least the time being. But in recent months, Wisconsin and Minnesota have imposed BST moratoriums.
More farmers are using computers to monitor the health, feeding, and reproduction schedules of their herds. Other computer programs help farmers select bull semen and help breeding companies track the success of their animals.
Farm machinery also continues to evolve. In automated milking parlors, sensors turn suction cups off when a cow's udders are drained, automatically detaching the cups and pulling them away to allow the cow to exit. Gascoigne-Melotte, a Dutch company, hopes by 1993 to market a device that makes the feeding and milking entirely automatic.
 
IT'S ALL A MATTER OF BREEDING
In an industry where better breeding has accounted for 75 percent of increased productivity in recent years, Walkway Chief Mark is a star. Currently the nation's highest-rated Holstein bull, Mark will probably produce 80,000 daughters - and 80,000 sons, who usually end up as veal - by the end of his career, according to Richard Chichester, general manager of Select Sires Inc., his owner. The art of cattle breeding is steadily becoming more scientific thanks to computerized record-keeping, better understanding of genetics and more experience with artificial insemination. Bulls continue to offer the quickest path to improvement since a single bull produces enough semen for 25,000 to 100,000 inseminations in a top year.
Developed in the late 1930's, artificial insemination is used today in more than half of all dairy cow breeding. About 1,100 bulls are tested annually for their ability to reproduce desired characteristics in their female offspring: high milk output, high fat and protein content, ease of milking and durability. Only one in 10 bulls makes the grade and most of them will be culled from the steadily improving breeding pool within five years.
Meanwhile, to multiply the offspring of the best females, embryos are repeatedly flushed out of the cows, to be implanted in their less productive sisters.
According to the Department of Agriculture, genetic progress is accelerating. Selective Holstein breeding increased the average annual milk output per cow by 42 pounds during the 1960's, 151 pounds in the 1970's and 257 pounds in 1981-85, the most recent years for which there are figures. The average production for an American dairy cow is 1,650 gallons (more than 14,000 pounds) a year, with top cows producing more than 2,900 gallons.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
The Forgiving Municipal Bond Market

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
Is it a hard time for debtors? Not in the municipal bond market.
Last week, the once-notorious Washington Public Power Supply System came to market to sell $600 million worth of tax-exempt bonds. This agency's nickname is ''Whoops,'' in recognition of its apparent inability to get nuclear power plants finished on time and on budget. In 1983, it mothballed two unfinished plants and defaulted on $2.25 billion in municipal bonds, despite dire warnings from Wall Street that any debtor who committed such a heinous act would never again be welcome at the lender's trough. 
But ''forgive and forget'' is apparently the muni market's motto. When the W.P.P.S.S. issue came to market last week, its second sale since the default, it was very happily received, according to the bond analysis firm of Delphis Hanover in Litchfield, Conn. Indeed, demand was so strong that the power authority was able to boost the size of the issue to $875 million and still get yields that showed no trace of retribution.
Of course, the overall market was in a good mood early in the week, with the Dow Jones industrial average shooting up more than 34 points on Monday. It later gave up those points and more, plunging almost 35 points on Friday, to close at 2862.38. But Laszlo Birinyi, head of the investment analysis firm of Birinyi Associates, does not believe the market has made a fundamental turn. ''This was the first day for real significant profit-taking, but there is no indication that anything has changed,'' he said. Through all of this unheaval the bond market remained unruffled.
And defenders of the muni market's mentality pointed out that the credit agencies recently upgraded the power authority's rating. Fair enough - but that hardly explains the reception the same market gave to the short-term notes sold on Thursday by New York State, whose deteriorating fiscal health has led to its credit rating being lowered in recent months.
The New York State tax and revenue anticipation note issue, totaling $4.1 billion, was as warmly welcomed as the W.P.P.S.S. bonds. Originally priced to yield 6.15 percent, the notes were so popular that their yield was cut to 6.10 percent. ''It was as if there had been no downgrading at all,'' one trader marveled.
Does this mean that New York is a stronger state than the credit-watchers think it is? Probably not. Short-term investments are so scarce in the tax-exempt market, and demand is so high, one analyst said, ''that if Donald Trump sold tax-exempt notes today, the market would snap them up.'' You listening, Donald? The big test for the bond markets will come at the end of this week, with the Government's back-to-back inflation signals: the producer price index on Thursday, the consumer price index on Friday. ''I think the figures will be roughly in line with a 4 percent annual inflation rate,'' said Jay Goldinger, a principal at Capital Insight, a specialty brokerage house in Beverly Hills, Calif. ''It will take something better than that to get the bond market to rally.''

HEADLINE: The Long Campaign for a Perfect Prom

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
Esther Truzman, the class secretary, fiddled with her notes and spoke up: ''The club has to be a nice space. A lot of clubs, you walk in and they're so blah. Hot Rod last year was nice, but the music wasn't so hot.''
A possibility was broached by Larry Kang, the senior class president. Meltem Bozkurt, the class vice president, shot him an oh, brother look. ''A lot of hoodlums go there,'' she said. ''It's a good place to go if your aim is to get beaten up.'' ''We better settle on the boat soon,'' interjected Mr. Kang. ''Don't worry,'' said Ms. Bozkurt, effusing confidence. ''It's going to be the greatest prom ever. The greatest.''
As on many afternoons of late, the members of the prom committee at the Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn were huddled in the principal's conference room, assailed by decisions. Although this was only October, nerves were already fraying as the trio embarked on its longest odyssey in economics: the dogged task of choosing among the gaggle of businesses that wanted to make their senior prom an unforgettable - and profitable - experience. 
The high school prom is an American institution, and at thousands of high schools across the country, from rural schools in South Dakota to inner-city institutions in Chicago, students like the Murrow committee members were doing exactly the same thing. That's why the staging of proms has coalesced into a substantial industry worth millions of dollars, pursued by hotels, boats, dance clubs, photographers, disk jockeys, balloon makers and limousine companies.
For small businesses that serve prom-goers, the parties allow massive sales in one night, though they sometimes have to dangle discounts or other incentives to land the contracts. ''It's a cut-throat business,'' said Nathan Tsukroff, head photographer at G & B's Photography, which will shoot the Murrow prom. ''We know of companies that get the business by citing a low price and then, on prom night, the price is suddenly three times higher. This is not high-profit business, but there's a lot of it, and you make your money on volume.''
 
Sifting Through Options
 There are even companies that tackle the arrangements and book the halls and the entertaintment - like Promoceans, the Manhattan company that is doing some work for the Murrow students. Its founder, Steven Salsberg, has been booking proms for 12 years. A prom disk jockey before he formed his company, he now arranges some 35 affairs a year, most of them on boats, bringing his company revenues of more than $750,000.
The large number of enterprises competing for prom business means more possibilities have to be scrupulously sifted through by young adults entrusted with tens of thousands of dollars, even though they're often bewildered about how to stretch an allowance through a full week. It is not for the weak-kneed senior. The Murrow prom committee - consisting of Mr. Kang, Ms. Bozkurt and Ms. Truzman, with Carl Lefton, a genial art teacher, as the faculty adviser - started its planning early to lock in the date it wanted - Wednesday, June 13. After all, roughly 300 private and public high schools in the New York metropolitan area hold proms during the prime prom months of May and June.
Some 500 students were expected to attend the Murrow gala, and the plan was to charge $80 a person, enough to cover the affair itself and a party afterward at a Manhattan club. That meant a total budget of $40,000. ''I hope it's enough,'' Ms. Truzman said. Hotels, party rooms and boats were all eager to welcome prom students, especially the ''prom factories'' like the big catering halls Marina Del Ray in the Bronx and Terrace on the Park in Queens, as well as hotels like the Waldorf-Astoria and the Plaza. Many of these flooded high schools with promotional literature, often gushy testimonial letters from satisfied schools, saying things like, ''I was astonished by the caring, the kindness, the helpfulness, the work ethic, the skill, the efficiency and the smiles of each and every person on your incredible staff.''
Staying on land seemed awfully pedestrian to the Edward Murrow committee. In recent years, it has become de rigueur at Murrow and many other schools near the water to charter a boat, and the committee wished to prolong the aquatic tradition. They emphatically did not wish to repeat last year's somewhat odious result, when the boat wasn't scrubbed after the previous party on it. ''We went there in formal wear and all,'' Ms. Bozkurt said, ''and like the floor had gum stains on it, and you thought, like why didn't I wear shorts?''
To begin the hunt, Ms. Bozkurt called Metropolitan Charters, which offered the dinner yacht Mystique at $48 per person. It was keen enough to get the business that it invited the Murrow committee for a complimentary cruise on Oct. 30. The boat's promotional package vowed: ''The Mystique is the place where memories are made. We have a single goal in mind - to make your prom or after-prom the talk of the town!!!''
 
Seeking a Ship
 Mr. Kang and Ms. Bozkurt liked that talk, but the moment they boarded they squinched their eyes. It was simply too small. Knowing this, the two seniors proceeded to have a wild time and scarfed down monstrous quantities of food. ''We felt a little guilty,'' Ms. Bozkurt confided afterward. ''But only a little.''
Meanwhile, Mr. Lefton contacted Promoceans. It said it was in the process of acquiring its own boat, but it wouldn't be available in time.
In November, the committee inspected the Spirit of New York, part of Cruise International, a Norfolk, Va., line. The bulk of the yacht's business is corporate cruises, social parties and weddings, but it is the site of about 25 proms a year. ''Proms are a good market,'' said Thomas D'Amato, the general manager. ''What happens is you get alumni business and social parties off of them.''
But proms can be a little dicey. ''They can be crazy business,'' he admitted. ''To have 600 people between the ages of 16 and 18 on a boat is different than a dinner party of people from I.B.M. We've never had anyone hurt, but I have had to give restaurant managers weekends off.''
The Murrow students liked the Spirit, a vast, swank vessel with three decks. Shortly before Thanksgiving, they agreed to rent it. They would have it from 8 until midnight, at a price of $45 per student, for a cruise that would follow a horseshoe path around lower Manhattan. The package came with singing and dancing waiters and waitresses, a nice touch.
 
On to the Clubs
 Hot Rod? Red Zone? Emerald City? Mars? What club to retreat to after the cruise was no easy decision - you wanted to be hip but not burst the budget - and so the committee elected to work with Mr. Salsberg of Promoceans. Mr. Salsberg says he can negotiate lower prices because of his volume, and he also extends scholarships: faculty advisers can identify a limited number of needy students who will be charged about half-price. He initiated the program because he relied on a scholarship when he attended Ramaz high school in Manhattan, for which he planned a prom in 1982 at a SoHo loft. His brother, David, was more inventive: in 1985, he orchestrated his class's prom on a barge.
''Everyone in New York is happy to take money from kids,'' Mr. Salsberg said of his work. ''Everyone. That's why I do so well.''
On a dank Monday in early December, Mr. Salsberg showed Meltem Bozkurt and her prom date some clubs. Before beginning, he couldn't resist doing a rapid pitch to try to persuade them to scrap the yacht in favor of the Great Hall of Science in Queens. He felt museum proms were the next wave, and had designed a package that would include 25 videotapes of the prom and a 1,000-balloon balloon drop from 90 feet. Ms. Bozkurt adored balloons but she said they were going sailing. By now, the committee members had already done some checking and had a rough feel for club prices.Though it was remaining open-minded, the prom committee truly had its heart set on Red Zone. ''I asked kids at the school what clubs they liked, and they said 'Red Zone, Red Zone, Red Zone,' '' Ms. Bozkurt mentioned. ''It's really hip.''
 
Selling the Site
 Mr. Salsberg escorted them through Hot Rod, the site of last year's after-prom party. The committee recoiled at the thought of duplication, but Mr. Salsberg pushed Hot Rod hard. ''Last year, you had croissants, bagels and coffee,'' he said. ''This year we can do eggs, bacon and home fries, so it's a bigger breakfast. We can also do nonalocholic tropical drinks. I realize you don't want to go to the same place. But we can outdo last year.'' Doubt pervaded Ms. Bozkurt's face. ''Listen, you want to make sure the kids come here,'' Mr. Salsberg said. ''Take $3,000 - that's just $5 or $6 per kid more - and get Andrew Dice Clay to do 45 minutes of comedy. Nobody is going to miss that.'' ''Uh-huh,'' Ms. Bozkurt nodded in a mood of forbearance. A few Saturdays later, Mr. Salsberg escorted them through Red Zone, and there was no more doubt. Hence Mr. Salsberg struck a deal: they could book the club for $22.50 per person. This was met with delirium.
When spring rolled around, the committee turned to hiring a disk jockey. It can cost more than $1,000. The committee had heard a Murrow student who went by the name D. J. Scott at sweet-16 parties, and liked his sound. His fee was $600, which sounded best of all. He had all the gear - smoke machine, bubbles - and they figured he would work extra hard because of his Murrow spirit.
''He plays a lot of disco,'' Ms. Bozkurt said. ''We said we don't want disco all night long. We want a little reggae. A little rap. A little house music. Some slow songs. We don't want anything childish, like 'Shout.' ''
In early May, with the big day nearing, arrangements were made with Flora Tech, which does balloon decorations, to make a balloon arch for the students to walk through when boarding the boat. The company said a really nice arch would be $500. The committee settled on a pretty nice one for $300.
Limousines are considered obligatory for proms, and students began booking rides. They would not come cheaply; limousine companies typically require 10-hour minimums at a cost of about $500, plus a 20 percent tip.
Many students were sharing cars. Ms. Bozkurt and Ms. Truzman hooked up with four other couples. They phoned 15 companies before hiring a 44-foot white limousine from Amex Limousine. It comes with two VCR's and a compact disk player. They would have it for 14 hours for $2,400. They wanted extra time, for as Ms. Bozkurt said, ''It takes a long while just for the thing to turn around.''
Limousines can be problematic. Anthony Gurino, who runs the Superior Limousine Company in Queens, which gets about 10 percent of its business from proms, said: ''It's a shame to say, but there are more treacherous, unprofessional, scheming thieves in limousines than anything. Limousine companies collect money up front from kids and then fold up.''
 
A Surge of Expenses
 Last year, for instance, 500 students from John Dewey High School came out of Bentley's looking for the limousines and were less than happy when none were there. To insure reliability, Mr. Gurino likes to have off-duty and retired policemen drive his cars on prom nights. ''Listen,'' he said, ''a cop in the car doesn't hurt.'' Expenses kept mounting. Tuxedos and prom dresses. Corsages. Hair styling. Money was flying out of parents' pockets. Ms. Bozkurt was having a dress made especially for her for $475. ''O.K., that sounds like a lot,'' Ms. Bozkurt said. ''But you have to remember, a prom comes just once.''
Finally, with everything all booked, it was just a matter of counting down the last few days until the big event. Then it would be time for next year's senior class to begin figuring out a way to outdo it.

The Guys in White Hats from Sony

BYLINE: By SHELDON WEINIG; Sheldon Weinig is chairman and chief executive of the Materials Research Corporation.

 BODY:
In 1989, the Materials Research Corporation, which I founded, was faced with a critical challenge: raise capital or probably fail. The capital we finally raised came from Japan. We are now a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony U.S.A.
Our company makes manufacturing equipment for the semiconductor industry, and in all the generations of this equipment, there has never been a time when our machines were not the most advanced technologically. We also produce the expendable materials that are used to produce thin-film layers on semiconductor wafers - a type of electronic material that was virtually invented by M.R.C. and has served as the model for all other subsequent entries in the field. 
Possibly, with that sort of pedigree, we might be considered an important American technological asset. But in 1988 we realized the company could not develop the next generation of equipment without fresh capital. Because of lower-than-expected activity in the worldwide semiconductor markets, we were capital-short. In fact, we had considerable debt funded by a bank syndicate.
American banks do not understand technological cycles. At the very time we needed more money for new development, they pressed us for repayments and restructuring. We knew that bank loans were no way to move forward, so we explored other sources of capital.
Our customers, including the International Business Machines Corporation, are among the largest companies in the world. Some of them have assisted their suppliers in the past, earning handsome dividends in the process. But when we turned to major customers, we were met by a wall of silence.
We turned to Wall Street financiers and found two varieties - those who were prepared to raise money for bottom-of-the-barrel buyouts with dismemberment plans for the company, and those who were prepared to sell ''junk bonds'' for the company at costs beyond our ability to generate profits.
We turned to a European-based competitor, which was interested in an acquisition but, unfortunately, also needed help. It showed a great interest in our short-term ability to improve its bottom line.
Then Sony appeared - from our point of view, a white knight. Our technologies are closely related. The president of Sony U.S.A., Mickey Schulhof, is a friend of mine, and Sony is an aggressive technolgy and marketing company.
When the deal was done, we ran into a familiar bugaboo: selling a high-technology company to the Japanese. Government restrictions were overcome, but that did not eliminate the bruised American sensibilities of our customers, the American press and even some of our employees.
Well, what if we had not sold? Would our brilliant team of scientists and engineers still be together, working on the next generation of processing machines and improved materials? Would the employee base that we had jealously guarded over 30 years - providing lifetime employment for most of those years - be as gainfully employed as it is today? Or would some of those employees be out on the street, forced to accept lower-paid jobs with far fewer benefits? Would the Rockland County and New York state economies still be benefiting from our operations? Or the American economy?
And these questions may not touch the most basic issue. The main point for a company like ours is, would we have been able to continue to make significant contributions (as we have in the past) to world technology?
The likely answer to all of these questions was no. But with our purchase by Sony, the answer to all of them seems to be a definite yes.
It has been claimed that lower-cost capital, more patient capital and greater capital availability are necessary to prevent the continued crumbling of the American technology industry. Actually, all may be necessary, but none may be sufficient to keep the corporate edifice standing. An editorial in The New York Times last month lauded I.B.M. for suddenly taking a leadership role in trying to sustain a viable semiconductor industry in the United States. I agree with their actions and hope that my prodding a year ago was of some influence in their decision-making.
But for M.R.C., necessity opened a different path. A great artist, a great craftsman, virtually anything great, can receive the appellation ''National Treasure'' in Japan.
After we were purchased by Sony there was an outcry about how M.R.C., an American national treasure, had slipped into the hands of a foreign company. No one said we were a national treasure before we were sold.
It is apparent by now that industry has entered a new phase dictated by the demands of the world economy. Technology is being globalized. Little has been lost by our sale to a foreign company. Much has been gained. Now we can strive to be a world treasure. In a time of shrinking geography and global business, that is not a bad title.

HEADLINE: Turning Short-Lived Fads Into Steady Growth

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
Strolling into his debut fashion show in 1987, Rick Fayer had little more than an idea for a new pair of pants. He was a fashion designer with no name recognition, no track record and not even enough money for a display booth.
Feeling a bit like a gate-crasher at a society ball, Mr. Fayer carried only a briefcase with a product sample, a few swatches of fabric and a willingness to buttonhole buyers with an idea: cotton doctors' pants, with the drawstring, but in bold plaid prints instead of staid operating-room green.
It wasn't much of a launch in a business known for lavish promotions. But the pants caught the attention of George Kucin and Ken Rodriguez, top buyers for Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc. While other merchants clustered around established designers, Mr. Kucin and Mr. Rodriguez gave Mr. Fayer a test order. 
Within weeks, Mr. Fayer's new brand, called Skidz, was a hit. Today, fueled by Merry-Go-Round, Skidz has expanded into shirts and accessories. Its sales exceed $15 million a year and its customer base has widened to include Barneys New York, Macy's and Dillards. Mr. Fayer said recently of Merry-Go-Round: ''If they asked me to make three-legged pants, I'd do it.''
Based in Joppa, Md., a suburb north of Baltimore, Merry-Go-Round has emerged as the leading merchant devoted to trendy fashions for the mercurial tastes of people between the ages of 14 and 35. It doesn't matter whether the rage is for savagely ripped Get Used jeans, Zum-Zum party dresses made with ''63 percent metal,'' or the deep-crotch pants popularized by Bobby Brown, the rapper. The company has displayed a consistent knack for spotting fads long before other retailers do so.
''They're always out there beating the bushes for new ideas,'' said Alice Ruth, a retail analyst for Montgomery Securities. ''By the time Macy's picks up on a product, Merry-Go-Round has often moved on.''
Stuart M. Lucas, president of Merry-Go-Round's Menz division, is not reluctant to agree: ''Whoever's hot,'' he said in an interview, ''9 times out of 10, it's going to be somebody we've had a good relationship with long before they were hot.'' New designers know that Merry-Go-Round is receptive and helpful to them, he added.
The results are impressive. Since 1987, the company has expanded from 388 stores to 625. Sales have skyrocketed, from $207 million in fiscal 1987 to $478 million in the year ended last February, and earnings almost tripled from $7.4 million to $22.2 million. This year, predicts Miss Ruth, Merry-Go-Round will earn $33 million on sales of $615 million. Adjusted for stock splits, Merry-Go-Round's share price has grown almost fivefold from less than $6 in early 1989.
In sharp contrast to the disastrous acquisition binges of retailers like the Campeau Corporation, Merry-Go-Round has shown success based on merchandising prowess. Comparable-store sales - the measure of sales growth at stores within the company that have been in operation at least one year - have increased more than 42 percent during what has been a sluggish year for the rest of the industry.
Even more dramatic is the transformation of Silverman's, a lackluster chain of 124 stores acquired by Merry-Go-Round in February 1989. As of April, those units had doubled their sales from the levels of a year earlier.
That is not to say Merry-Go-Round faces no challenges. It did not escape a dip in earnings during 1986 and 1987, and a recession-induced drop in consumer spending would hurt again.
In addition, some of Merry-Go-Rounds's success stems from being in the right place at the right time: about two-thirds of its sales are to young men, a relatively underserved niche in the otherwise overserved clothes market. But that gap will not exist forever. A few youth-oriented competitors - like Edison Brothers Stores Inc., which operates J. Riggings as well as other chains - have posted good gains in the last year. The department stores also are angling for position. Some analysts are casting an eye on the heretofore un-hip J.C. Penney Company as a potentially serious competitor.
After two decades of stready growth, however, Merry-Go-Round has proved itself far more enduring than the clothes it sells. Underlying that is a blend of tough-minded management and a sensitivity to the rhythms of fashion. At a time of turmoil for overleveraged department-store chains, Merry-Go-Round paradoxically demonstrates the value of old-fashioned principles. Among them: the importance of management continuity, an emphasis on merchandising skills rather than acquisitions and an ability to stay close to customers.
The chain was founded in Baltimore in 1968 by Leonard Weinglass - who was the basis for the flamboyant character named ''Boogie'' in the movie ''Diner'' - and his boyhood friend Harold Goldsmith. Although the two men retain a combined 35 percent stake in Merry-Go-Round, and are still vice chairman and chairman, both dropped out of day-to-day operations in the late 70's. (Mr. Wein-glass now runs ''Boogie's Diner,'' a clothing store and restaurant in Aspen, Colo. Merry-Go-Round licensed the concept and built a similar store in Chicago, but Mr. Weinglass owns his store separately.) Under Michael D. Sullivan, who joined the company as chief financial officer in 1974 and became chief executive in the early 80's, Merry-Go-Round has been subdivided into three divisions. The biggest division is the original Merry-Go-Round chain, catering evenly to men and women in the 15-to-25 age group. Following in size is the Menz division; it carries more expensive clothing for men aged 18 to 34 and comprises four chains: D.J.'s, DeJaiz, Attivo and His Place. Third is Cignal, an upscale chain for both sexes emphasizing European fashions.
Like other successful specialty retailers, such as the Limited and the Gap, the company applies technology to fashion. It has installed computer systems that poll stores daily to track products. Merchandise managers crunch numbers ruthlessly, to enable them to add hot items and slash prices as needed to weed out mediocre ones. ''It takes a lot of the clairvoyance out of things,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
Evidence of management strength comes in different ways. Inventories, for example, have creeped up only 8 percent in the last year, even though those of comparable stores soared at more than five times that rate. In addition, the company's stores rotate merchandise faster than traditional retailers: instead of changing stock once a season, outlets receive a continous stream of small shipments of new products. Thanks to its strong balance sheet, Merry-Go-Round has avoided the credit crunch imposed by the lenders, called factors, who finance shipments from vendors to stores.
But what makes Merry-Go-Round hard to imitate is its flair for satisfying trendy young customers. Like other retailers, it sends its buyers to fashion shows around the world. While others gravitate toward established designers, however, Merry-Go-Round buyers cull ideas from everywhere, drawing heavily on MTV music videos, new movies and obscure designers like Mr. Fayer.
Back in the 70's, it was Merry-Go-Round that placed the first order with New York-based Bugle Boy, a clothing manufacturer primarily for young people, which now has sales of $500 million a year. In the early 80's, the company scored huge hits with jackets like those worn by the singer Michael Jackson in his music video ''Beat It'' and by Tom Cruise in ''Top Gun.'' More recently, Merry-Go-Round was among the first retailers to ride the popularity of Jimmy Cavaricci, a casual-wear designer.
''They are more in touch with the market today than anybody else,'' said Gary Olsaver, a top executive at Bugle Boy. ''The department stores are so focused on a few vendors that if you're not well known, they won't buy from you. They'll tell you things like, 'You're not in the matrix - I can't buy from you.' ''
Unlike Mr. Sullivan, an unreconstructed square who talks about the ''guys and gals'' who buy his goods, the others in top management roam the executive offices in flowing Shang-Hai suits, designer jeans and other items sold in Merry-Go-Round stores. The division presidents - Paul D. Levine, Mr. Lucas and Ken Rodriguez - started out as store clerks in the early 70's and share a passion for fashion. ''They're garmentos,'' commented one designer, a term that rankles Mr. Sullivan because it implies in the trade a kind of facile arrogance.
Certainly, most analysts and industry experts credit Merry-Go-Round with the best antenna in the market. ''There's a lack of buying talent in the young men's business, and they seem to have it,'' said Steven Roorda, a retail analyst with the Banc One Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. The competitors who do not, he said, are at a serious disadvantage in getting in on new products.
The most important key to Merry-Go-Round's success may be the continuity of its top management. Mr. Lucas, for example, rose up from store clerk in 1974 to store manager and through a succession of buying jobs. The same is true for most of the buyers and other managers.
Under Mr. Lucas, the companylaunched its first major in-house label, I.O.U. sportswear for Merry-Go-Round stores, which now accounts for more than $100 million in sales. It also has started labels for more expensive clothing for the Cignal stores.
The chain also plays a major role in helping and influencing designers. When the buyers pushed for a line of denim pants several months ago, Mr. Fayer said, ''They told me the specs, the wash, the silhouette - everything about how it should look.
Despite the company's grasp on emerging trends, however, Mr. Lucas is wary of smugness: ''You always have to be angular,'' he likes to tell people, by which he means being able to switch directions quickly. ''A buyer is never right,'' he went on, ''if something is hot, and you didn't buy enough; if it's not, you bought too much.''
 
A HISTORY OF FASHION HITS
 
MERRY-GO-ROUND hits:
 
1974 Prewashed jeans with a patchwork of dark and light areas. They sold for $23 a pair - far more than the previous price for fashion jeans - and rescued Merry-Go-Round from a recession.
 
1976 Discomania. Sparked by the movie ''Saturday Night Fever,'' the chain shifted to three-piece polyester suits and nylon shirts. It also was first to order Cheeks, pants with no seams or pockets. A hit for three seasons, theyaccounted for as much as 75 percent of the chain's dress-pant sales at the height of their popularity.
 
1983 Parachute pants. Tight-fitting models made from nylon-parachute cloth became a hit at $50 a pair. Because of limited supplies from the one small manufacturer, Merry-Go-Round was the only chain offering them for a year. The craze surged in late '84, when other companies copied the idea, but died abruptly in '85.
 
1984 Michael Jackson jacket. Merry-Go-Round originally sold 60 jackets - at $750 each - modeled on the one worn by the singer in his video ''Beat It.'' The company then turned to cheaper manufacturers and by spring 1985 had sold 50,000 of the jackets for as little as $29 each.
1985-86 Z. Cavaricci, an obscure manufacturer in Los Angeles, comes out with its ''975'' line of casual pants. It propels Cavaricci's sales to more than $100 million by 1989, with Merry-Go-Round accounting for more than $30 million.

The Cookie Monster Makes Policy

BYLINE: By STEPHEN BERGER; Stephen Berger is stepping down next month as executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. He will become president and chief executive of the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, a municipal bonds insurer.

 BODY:
A not-so-funny thing happened to Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner on the way to the White House, where he was to deliver America's new national transportation policy. The policy got eaten up by a Cookie Monster named Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
The Skinner policy offered many new ideas: it would involve the private sector as a full partner in the transportation system, support research into new technologies that overcome problems of limited capacity, use transportation investment as a tool of environmental protection and harmonize the various transport modes - rail, sea, air and highway - to work together. 
But Mr. Darman's hungry budgeteers stripped the policy bare of any resource commitments that might have brought the words to life. Bold pledges in the policy's early drafts to ''rebuild'' infrastructure were reduced to ''maintain'' existing facilities. A commitment to spend down the transportation trust funds now being held to mask the true size of the Federal deficit were banished. No effort to address real environmental concerns, like controlling aircraft noise, was permitted. And the Federal Government's traditional bias against mass transit remains secure.
Mr. Skinner legitimately noted that most criticism of his work ignores the new ideas and focuses on the demand for more Federal subsidies. But by not bringing any resources to the table, the Bush Administration guaranteed that the debate will not proceed. Washington cannot expect its talk of creative new partnerships to be taken seriously if it will not put up any equity.
Since 1960, public infrastructure investment relative to gross national product has fallen by more than half. At the same time, our competitiors were investing. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent by the European Community, Asian nations, Australia and others for new airports and marine terminals, high-speed railroads, computer-controlled ''smart cars'' and ''smart highways'' and state-of-the-art waste treatment facilities.
In making these commitments, our competitors have shown they understand a lesson that Americans have forotten: public investment is a long-term proposition. Whether it's in human capital or physical capital, the dividends don't start for years.
A 50 cent-a-gallon increase in gasoline taxes, dedicated to infrastructure, would raise $60 billion a year to invest in our future. It would still keep average American gas prices almost a dollar lower than the gas sold by any of our competitors. In constant dollars, it would still be only two-thirds of what we were paying at the pump 10 years ago.
The transportation debate America should be having now is how to break through the artificial barriers created by Federal programs that are organized, administered and competing for money in distinct categories, like rail, air and sea. Sadly, that discussion was pre-empted when Mr. Darman decided that Washington would be the one player at the table who did not have to ante up.
Mr. Skinner made a serious effort to develop a program that would help shape America's future. He did not deserve to run into Mr. Darman before breakfast. Neither did our children.

Getting a Mental Grip On The Dimensions of The Savings Disaster

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
ONE of the more curious aspects of the savings and loan debacle is how much money has been lost and how little anyone seems to be upset about it. ''Twin Peaks'' appears to have generated more intense national discussion.
Recent revelations that the ultimate cost of the bailout is likely to be in the $325 billion to $500 billion range seem finally to be catching people's attention. But for months the public took in stride news that the effort would cost billions and even tens of billions of dollars. Perhaps such enormous numbers are so hard to envision because they seem as abstract and meaningless as the age of the solar system or the distance across the Milky Way.
This is, after all, a nation that faces an almost daily barrage of billion-dollar statistics. With $150 billion Federal deficits, $300 billion military budgets and $8 billion supercolliders perhaps it is not surprising that a certain numbness has set in. 
''I can't grasp what a billion is,'' conceded George J. Benston, a finance and accounting professor at Emory University in Atlanta. ''We go from $100 billion to $300 billion like we're counting one, two, three,'' said the exasperated professor.
To help his students appreciate the enormity of the amount the savings and loan industry has lost, Mr. Benston said he tries to get them to think about how hard it is to become a millionaire. Then he asks them to imagine 1,000 millionaires, then 150,000 millionaires. The savings and loan industry's losses are the equivalent, he explains, of reducing all of those millionaires to paupers. Another way to think of the total is to imagine Donald Trump building 150 of his Atlantic City Taj Mahals.
And that doesn't include the cost of financing and overseeing the bailout. Unlike earlier Administration projections, the latest tally sheet from Congress's Government Accounting Office includes $133 billion in interest on the money the Government must borrow over 40 years to pay for the $155 billion of estimated losses at failed savings and loan institutions. And on top of that is $37 billion in administrative costs. The bill could go to $500 billion if interest rates rise more than is now expected, or if a recession further depresses the value of real estate and topples more already weakened thrift institutions. Some economists have estimated that the total could exceed $1 trillion, but nobody really knows.
Now that people are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars, the discussion seems to have finally entered the zone of ''real money.'' The mega-numbers led many evening news programs, and Phil Donahue seized on these latest estimates and hammered them home to his 10 million television viewers. ''Five hundred billion dollars,'' he exclaimed repeatedly, waving his arms with evangelical emphasis. ''Nice people like you'' are not going to be able to get loans, he told an increasingly dismayed studio audience, because savings and loan industry executives were allowed to gamble with depositors' money.
Members of the talk-show audience shook their heads in disbelief when they heard that the debacle could cost each household thousands of dollars. Some estimates put the figure at $5,000 a household.
Part of the reason for the new concern is that the latest estimates have coincided with discussions of a tax increase. There seems to be a growing recognition that the need for additional tax revenue has arisen in part because of the ever-increasing cost of the savings and loan bailout.
The financing of the rescue is already beginning to have a discernible economic impact. Since April, the amount of short-term notes that the Treasury has had to sell each week to finance its needs has risen by $1.2 billion, to $17.2 billion. William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., says that the increase comes almost entirely from the need for more money to cover the savings and loan industry's losses.
That is also an important reason, he said, why short-term interest rates remain high. While long-term rates on 30-year bonds have fallen since April to 8.39 percent from 8.63 percent, short-term rates have hardly dropped at all. In a recent Treasury auction, for instance, investors demanded a 7.69 percent yield on 3-month bills, just a slight drop from the 7.75 percent level in April.
The economy and the outlook for inflation will still be the determining factors in whether interest rates shoot up to, say, 11 or 12 percent levels, or glide back down to 5 or 6 percent. But whatever level interest rates go to, they will be higher than they otherwise would have been, said Mr. Sullivan, because of the Treasury's need over the next 40 years to finance the cost of the savings and loan industry's losses.
The multi-billion-dollar bailout means that it will be harder to get mortgages and small business loans. And for those who succeed in becoming borrowers, it will mean paying higher rates. It means the Government will be able to spend fewer dollars on programs that many Americans seem to care about, like those that would improve the environment and the schools, or address the AIDS crisis, the drug epidemic or the homeless problem.
Even though the public may finally be awakening to this calamity, many academics and financial experts complain that all the arguing and finger-pointing have not led to any real changes in the policies that allowed the savings and loan industry to lose all that money in the first place.
By continuing to guarantee deposits of up to $100,000 at banks and thrifts, the Government is still underwriting a risk-prone financial system. Troubled institutions that would otherwise be taken over or forced out of business can instead attract a steady flow of deposits by offering higher rates than sound institutions, and investing the money in high-risk ventures. After all, if their strategy fails, it is the insurance funds that are on the hook and whose obligations are guaranteed by the United States Government and, ultimately, the taxpayers.
At the same time, many academics and industry specialists believe that far more thrifts and banks are allowed to exist than is economically justified because restrictions on interstate banking have prevented consolidation.
Many of the hard questions, then, have still not been seriously confronted. Does the United States need a specialized industry to finance housing when it now has an efficient mortgage market?
Does the nation need 13,000 independent banks and 3,000 independent thrifts, or should institutions be allowed to consolidate across state lines, which would also enable them to spread their risks by diversifying their sources of loans and deposits?
Most important, is it time to consider changing the system for insuring deposits so that there is less of an incentive to gamble with taxpayers' money? Some industry experts believe that if deposit insurance reform is not undertaken the taxpayers could find themselves paying an even bigger bill to rescue the banking system.
To be sure, bank regulators have done a better job of policing that industry than have their counterparts in the thrift industry. But despite those efforts, the same forces are at work. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has just $14 billion in reserves to act as a cushion for losses in a system that now has $1.8 trillion of bank assets. And given that there are already tens of billions of dollars of questionable loans to third world countries, real estate developers and overly indebted companies already on the books, some financial experts believe now is the time to start focusing on changes to the country's deposit insurance system.
''If nothing is learned from this, then we will be going through the same process with the banking system in relatively short order,'' said Gerald L. Smith, a managing director in Salomon Brothers' financial institutions group. At that point, even $325 billion and $500 billion would seem like chicken feed.

With Luck and Ingenuity, Ethiopian Aid Gets Through

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya

 BODY:
WHEN the rains failed in northern Ethiopia last year and the civil war reached new levels of destruction, with thousands of casualties inflicted each month, the specter of skeletal children and mass starvation loomed again, recalling the suffering of 1984.
But early awareness of the drought, followed by creative disaster management by Western governments and relief organizations over the last five months, have averted the worst. Despite nightmarish logistical difficulties of moving food into one of the most remote, undeveloped and war-torn corners of the world, relief officials say about three million Ethiopians who were on the brink of starvation have received monthly food rations since January.
''It has been a very, very significant problem but it has been addressed through a jerry-rig set of solutions,'' said Willard J. Pierson, the director of the United States Agency for International Development's office in Addis Ababa. Mr. Pierson said that food would have to keep coming at its current pace for the next six months or ''a crisis will flare up in a matter of weeks.'' 
The summit announcement that the United States and the Soviet Union would work together to deliver relief supplies to Asmara, the Government-held capital of Eritrea, as well as to the rebel-held port of Massawa, was welcomed by relief officials. But the rebels, who are poised to seize Asmara, where food for civilians is becoming scarce, have said no to the summit plan. The Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front, which can sense that victory is near after three decades of fighting the Government, said Soviet planes trying to bring in American wheat would fly into Asmara at their own peril.
Indeed, the whole character of the war has changed in the last year. Soviet support has receded as Moscow withdraws from its role as a Government ally, and the fighting has moved into a decisive phase. The level of combat has increased so much that American officials describe it as the deadliest conflict under way in the world. The rebels seem on the verge of complete victory, and now are in a position to deny food to people on the Government side in much the same way that the Government has tried to deny food to starving people on the rebel side for years.
 
Coping Artfully
So far, the relief handlers have been able to cope without Massawa, which was taken by the rebels in February and has been bombarded ever since by the Ethiopian Air Force. But the aid officials have had to be dexterous. Ships with food from Europe and America were diverted to Assab. The food was then trucked - after arduous negotiations with the Government - by an Ethiopian church group through Government-held territory into the rebel-held province of Tigre. With an expected donation of 300,000 tons of food by the end of the year, the United States is the biggest single donor to the international operation. While it does not formally acknowledge it, Washington has dispatched most of the grain through what is known as the ''back door,'' an overland truck route through the Sudan from Port Sudan to rebel-held Tigre and Eritrea.
Given the reluctance of the Government of Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam to let enough food cross its lines into Tigre and Eritrea, Washington has had little choice but to deal directly with the rebels, with whom it has no formal ties. An estimated 70 percent of Ethiopians affected by drought live in the rebel-held areas, which now include all of Tigre and most of Eritrea.
In addition to importing food, Washington has found an unusual undercover way of acquiring food inside Ethiopia. Serendipitously, the western region of Tigre produced surplus crops earlier this year, and this trove of up to 80,000 tons of grain is being bought for the province's drought-stricken eastern section by the United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance. Officials familiar with the plan say the disaster office has hired Fred Cuny, a relief expert with years of experience in Africa, to travel to Jiddah, where he changes $500,000 of agency money at a time on the black market for Ethiopian currency, the birr. He then travels the ''back door'' route into Tigre and purchases grain, which is then trucked from western Tigre to the east. Officials said the disaster office has dedicated $4 million to the operation, which a Scandinavian relief agency is also helping.
The intensity of Washington's effort to avert another Ethiopian famine seems to illustrate that the humanitarian impulse has replaced the strategic drive that dominated American policy in the Horn of Africa during the cold war. In the neighboring drought-stricken Sudan, Washington has also given aid on both sides of a civil war. ''The one thing the State Department can't stand,'' one diplomat said, ''is having Congressmen hammering them because constituents are calling up after seeing starving Africans on the television screen.''

Sound of Hands Shaking Wakes Asia

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
AFTER fretting that it was being left out of the changes transforming Europe, Asia received its first bracing encounter with the global diplomacy of the 1990's last week as a Soviet leader met a South Korean President for the first time. The hastily arranged visit in San Francisco handed President Roh Tae Woo a diplomatic windfall and gave President Mikhail S. Gorbachev a chance to maneuver in a region he has largely ignored until now.
But as the excitement died down, diplomats and experts added a dose of realism to the hopes the meeting had raised. Northeast Asia, they said, is likely to remain frustrating for those trying to undo the last but most thorny vestiges both of the cold war and of the hot wars that created the intricate political fault lines that fragment the region. 
The concern that the potential changes may only bring greater risks was made clear in the headline on an editorial that appeared in the Asahi Shimbun, a leading Japanese daily: ''Asia on Thin, Melting Ice.''
The caution was not misplaced. The complex reactions of the region's major political players all underscored how difficult it is likely to be to soothe the irritants each feels.
The Soviet Union subsequently played down the meeting as little more than talks with a commercial partner. Partly, it seemed, this was an attempt to avoid alienating Communist North Korea completely.
A humiliated North Korea lashed out at the talks as treachery, and there was speculation that Pyongyang would just be driven closer to its other principal ally, China, rather than toward reunification.
China, for its part, was so consumed by domestic problems a year after the killings in Tiananmen Square that it took little official notice of the Roh-Gorbachev encounter. There were no substantial signs that China's hard line at home was softening.
And the Japanese brooded, saying the meeting represented no real change because the Soviets had said nothing about returning the four northern islands they took from Japan in the closing days of World War II. There were reports that Mr. Gorbachev had suggested to American officials in Washington that the Soviets might consider swapping the islands for substantial economic aid. But Japanese officials, who have been working on a visit by Mr. Gorbachev that is planned for next year, said they had heard nothing of such an offer.
Some Japanese felt especially slighted when their long-planned debut as a diplomatic problem-solver - as host of a meeting here for the warring Cambodian factions to sign a cease-fire accord - was totally upstaged by their economic competitors, the South Koreans.
 
A Question of Speed
''We had been saying that the reforms in Eastern Europe hadn't reached the Far East as quickly as we'd hoped,'' said Kuniko Inoguchi, a professor of international politics at Sophia University in Tokyo. But then the Roh-Gorbachev meeting ''happened much faster than we'd expected in Japan,'' she said. ''That still leaves us wondering where it will go and whether Japan is really doing everything it can to make progress.''
On the Korean peninsula, diplomats and scholars had not expected any positive responses to the Soviet-Korea meeting from Pyongyang, and they were not disappointed. Underdeveloped North Korea, which has watched in anger over the last two years as most of its former East European allies exchanged ambassadors with prosperous South Korea, was left even more isolated by Mr. Gorbachev's move.
But there were no signs that Pyongyang was budging from its hard line against an opening to Seoul.
A senior Japanese diplomat suggested that Asia might have to wait for Pyongyang to reach a more dramatic moment of truth. ''In the short run,'' the diplomat said, ''It's probably a minus for dialogue between the North and the South. North Korea is going to have to reach some kind of Buddhist enlightenment to deal with some of the new realities of the world.''
 
Different Pressures
A Western diplomat in Seoul also pointed out that, unlike the breakthroughs last year that set the stage for German reunification, none of the preliminary confidence-building steps that had been present in Europe exist now in Korea. North Korea still blocks deliveries of mail and telephone calls from the South, has sharply limited reunions of divided families and has almost no trade with its enemy.
In addition, the diplomat added, economic pressures are unlikely to work in North Korea as they did in Eastern Europe, because the Government has so effectively cut the country off from the world, making economic backwardness a measure of ideological purity. ''It's a very spartan society and they are inured to a lot of hardship,'' the diplomat said.
Feelings in Japan were more complex. Many resented what they saw as a Soviet effort to play a ''South Korea card'' - using the opening to Seoul to dislodge Japan from its rigid insistence that the four islands, Habomai, Shikotan, Etorofu and Kunashiri, be returned before Japan will expand relations with the Soviets.
Japan and the Soviet Union opened diplomatic relations in 1956, and they have extensive trade, but they have yet to sign a peace treaty. Many Japanese businessmen would like to expand trade and investment, and the Soviets would love access to Japanese capital and technology. But progress has been stalled and the resentments remain.
''I'm not saying that nothing is happening in Asia,'' said a senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official. ''but we have to strike the right balance between saying what's new and what's not.''

HEADLINE: The Region;
The Latest Plan for the Adirondacks Leaves Adirondackers Skeptical

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

DATELINE: CHESTERTOWN, N.Y.

 BODY:
WITH dozens of majestic peaks, 31,000 miles of rivers and streams and millions of acres of forested wilderness, New York's Adirondack Park is often referred to as the largest park in the lower 48 states. Indeed, the area encompassed within the Adirondacks Park's boundary - larger than Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Glacier and Olympic National Parks combined -qualifies for the designation.
But park is far too simple a term for the Adirondack Park, which is actually a complex patchwork of public wilderness, vast timber tracts and smaller plots of privately held land. That explains some of the growing tension caused by the recent recommendations of a special commission appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
The commission, warning of a ''last clear chance'' to preserve much of the Adirondacks' wilderness character, recommended a sweeping program of state land acquisition and zoning restrictions that would channel almost all future construction to about 10 percent of the park's 6 million acres. The remainder would in essence be preserved as open space, with much of that land set aside as wilderness areas where human intrusion would be sharply limited and motorized vehicles prohibited altogether. The land purchases would raise the state's ownership to more than 50 percent of the Adirondack Park's area, from 42 percent, and the zoning regulations would extend far beyond measures enacted in the 1970's to control development.
But for all the natural grandeur there is another side to Adirondack Park. It is the year-round home of 130,000 people, some of whom live in communities that are among the poorest in New York State. Per capita income within the park is less than three-quarters of the state average and unemployment is widespread.
''We're trying to get people to understand that this is not just a playground up here,'' said Mike Connery, the supervisor of the town of Ticonderoga. Charlie E. Bartgis, who directs a public-access television project in the Adirondacks, said, ''If you really travel around, you know you're also talking about a place that has pockets of Appalachia. There's dirt poverty.''
 
Local Opposition
So far, dozens of local governments have officially voted to oppose the commission's overall approach, which includes a one-year moratorium on permits for new construction in much of the park, saying it could be crippling to the local economy.
The commission's report contains several recommendations for revitalizing the Adirondack economy, such as creation of special development corporations to build low-income housing and other local projects, to be financed by a special tax on the sale of luxury residences within the park. The larger goal was to foster both ''great open spaces'' and ''dynamic hamlets,'' said Peter A. A. Berle, the president of the National Audubon Society and chairman of the panel, the Governor's Commission on the Adirondacks in the 21st Century.
But such ideas have been met with skepticism by people in the park, many of whom complain that the commission is seeking to ''herd'' them into the hamlets. ''This wasn't a commission created to help people in the Adirondacks,'' said Frederick H. Monroe, a former town attorney in Chestertown who is chairman of the Adirondack Fairness Coalition, one of several citizens' group formed in opposition to the report. ''And any bones they throw in there about helping the locals are just that - bones tossed to try to placate us.''
There is an even angrier side to the opposition. Another group, the Adirondack Solidarity Alliance, has at times shut down parts of the Interstate highway through the Adirondacks, and some members have threatened to take up arms or burn parts of the forest if the recommendations are implemented by the Legislature. Others have put up posters accusing members of the commission of trying to commit ''genocide against the Adirondack people.'' The commission's executive director, George D. Davis, has been shouted at in several meetings while trying to explain the report. In Plattsburgh last week he was forced to give up altogether and was escorted off the stage by state troopers.
 
Specter of Development
Amid all the arguments about whether the state should save the Adirondacks or save the Adirondackers, the danger is that it will do neither. Sales of subdivided land tripled from 1982 to 1985 and had doubled again by 1988, the commission reported. Much of the vast, forested back country remains open to the kind of large second-home developments whose specter caused Governor Cuomo to form the commission after one major forest-products company had been forced to sell off the land for quick cash in the early 1980's.
Meanwhile, there is virtually no consensus in the Legislature, which would have to approve most of the commission's proposals. Although the commission's report was issued more than a month ago, Mr. Cuomo has yet to embrace any of the proposals. When he recently listed the 15 top priorities for the remainder of the legislative session, which is expected to end within the month, the implementation of the Adirondack study was not among them. Aides said he preferred to study all reactions to the report before deciding how to proceed.
When he formed the commission early last year, the Governor said the Adirondacks appeared to be threatened by ''an era of unbridled land speculation and unwarranted development.'' The commission concluded that such dangers were real, but Mr. Cuomo's deputy secretary for environmental affairs, Francis Murray, said recently that the Governor ''has a lot of questions about the factual predicate for the Berle commission's recommendations.''
In an interview inside the park last winter, Mr. Davis, the commission's director, spoke not just of protecting the North Country's wilderness and diversity, but also of preserving something he defined as ''Adirondack culture.''
''It would be shame if 20 years from now, you and I come back to the Adirondacks,'' he said, ''and all you see of the local Adirondackers are the service people. I think it's kind of important to stop at the Miss Tupper Diner, or the Lumberjack Diner back there in Blue Mountain Lake - although that's closed now - and some of these others, the Long Lake Cafe, and you can see the plaid shirts and you can see some real people.''
Many of these real people, however, remain doubtful that the state has their interests in mind. The challenge to the state will be to find a balance for both the humanity and the wilderness whose home is the Adirondacks: otherwise, both might fairly be said to remain endangered.

HEADLINE: Re-regulate? Not on Your Life;
Triumphs on the Road, on the Phone, in the Air

SERIES: First of two articles.

 BODY:
Small towns howl about losing bus and rail service. Travelers complain about rising air fares and congested airports. Cable television users resent soaring rates, and many people occasionally pine for the days when Ma Bell cared for their every telephone need. The widespread elimination of Government regulation in the Carter and Reagan years has hit some Americans hard.
Now, aggrieved parties are lobbying Congress to put the regulatory cork back in the bottle. This misguided movement threatens the consumer. Study after study shows that deregulation has been an overwhelming success in railroads, airlines, buses, trucking and telecommunications. For most Americans, prices are lower and service is better. 
That is not to say that mistakes haven't been made. Deregulation of cable TV and savings and loan institutions is ample proof. As an industry-by-industry review demonstrates, Congress will need to fine-tune existing laws - but not to re-regulate.
 
Surface Transportation
Deregulation of buses, trucks and railroads allowed new companies to enter, old companies to drop unprofitable routes and prices to reflect market conditions. Result: cheaper, smoother service.
But not everybody wins. Truckers and railroad workers lost the wage premiums they enjoyed under the protective umbrella of regulation. And rural towns suffered service cutbacks, though few were abandoned. Still, even counting these losses, the economy-wide benefits from deregulation are estimated at more than $20 billion every year.
 
Airlines
Studies by Steven Morrison and Clifford Winston at the Brookings Institution show that deregulation has brought increased safety and decreased fares, down by an average of 18 percent. Contrary to popular impression, competition has increased.
True, eight airlines have come to dominate the industry. But on the typical individual route, which is what matters, the number of rival airlines is higher.
Airport congestion has worsened. In part, this is due to deregulation's success in lowering fares. The solution is not to re-regulate but to build new terminals and better allocate space in old ones.
 
Telecommunications
A.T. & T used to provide high-quality equipment and universal access. Because Ma Bell was insulated from competition, it could overcharge long-distance customers in order to subsidize local customers. This workable system was brought to a crashing halt by a 1982 court order that stripped A.T. & T. of its local customers.
The court, however, merely confirmed what technology had already made inevitable. Upstarts like MCI were able to provide an inexpensive, off-wire alternative to A.T. & T.'s long-distance service. Without these profits, A.T. & T. could no longer subsidize local customers.
Court-ordered deregulation has produced much good - and some bad. Some poor families are forced to pay more for routine service and everyone has been annoyed by the split responsibility for phones, lines and service. Still, new companies have offered a spectacular array of low-cost equipment and specialized services. Cellular phones, call-waiting, $1 long-distance calls and $8 telephones are just a few of the benefits.
The lesson in each sector is clear: Deregulation has been a triumph. That flies in the face of traditional liberal reliance on Government regulators to protect ordinary consumers. That image was relevant in the 19th century, when farmers needed protection from monopolistic railroads. But it does not easily apply to the modern economy, even in industries with limited competition.
The reason is that a politicized regulatory process produces a politicized outcome. Rather than protect customers, regulators have too often protected the railroads, airlines and trucking companies they were supposed to oversee. As Ralph Bradburd, author of a recent deregulation study for the World Bank, concludes, imperfect regulation can be every bit as bad as imperfect competition.
Deregulation doesn't work perfectly, as tomorrow's article will show; safeguards need to be passed. But it works very well indeed. The evidence is compelling: re-regulation would be dead wrong.

HEADLINE: The Beltway and the Globe

 BODY:
Now that Communism is in retreat, need Americans care all that much about NATO or the messy third world? Not really, argues Irving Kristol, a panjandrum of neo-conservatism, in The Wall Street Journal. He is saddened, for example, by turmoil in Liberia but sees no reason why it ''should even be within the purview of American foreign policy - or why The Times should be devoting so much space to it.'' High time, he says briskly, to devote more attention to national interests. 
Though surely unintended, this echoes Neville Chamberlain's famous lament about Britain's preoccupation with ''a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing.'' The Prime Minister was referring to Czechoslovakia, on the eve of its betrayal at Munich in 1938. If this century teaches any lesson, it is that no country is truly faraway, that an assassination in Sarajevo can start a global war, that an AIDS virus in Africa can become a global pestilence.
Faraway places also touch directly on American honor and responsibility. Liberia was peopled by freed American slaves; its flag and Constitution were based on the American example. Its economy is dominated by a U.S. rubber company. Its repressive, now embattled ruler received $500 million in U.S. aid - more per capita than any other African country. Whether Washington helps, or ignores, Liberia makes an enormous difference to Liberians.
Granted, as the Soviet threat has diminished, so has the strategic importance of remote countries. But it diminishes America to suggest that dependent peoples are disposable counters in a cold war game. Having inspired others to seek freer governments and market economies, should Americans view their struggles with distant impartiality?
In Mr. Kristol's eyes, the debate over the Western alliance and a united Germany is equally overblown. Perhaps - but only if one believes that Europe has wholly outgrown the rivalries and instability that brought on two World Wars. It seems a triumph of optimism for Mr. Kristol to conclude that a German decision with regard to NATO should be ''up to them, and them alone.''
It's possible that Mr. Kristol's shrinking interest in faraway places has something to do with his migrating two years ago, with considerable ado, from New York to Washington. Like other emigres, he has seemingly gone native, his vision blinkered by the Beltway.

HEADLINE: Gorbachev, Though Besieged, Isn't Defeated

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was in Beijing during Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit there a year ago. Huge crowds of protesters filled the streets demanding the end of the corrupt rule of Deng Xiaoping and introduction of democracy. Chinese intellectuals predicted the dawn of liberalism. With a sole exception of Michael Oksenberg, so did the American experts on China, including those in the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department. The news media, forever excited by revolutionary changes, focused exclusively on Beijing demonstrators, evoking the deep sympathy of the American public. 
Some Chinese I talked to in Beijing remained skeptical, warning not to underestimate Deng Xiaoping and the forces under his control, but those were mere officials, supposedly lacking in vision. Still, I decided not to prolong my stay and by the time of the Tiananmen Square incident I was safely out of the country.
Now, a year later, it is the turn of Russian intellectuals and of Western journalists who talk to them to predict the fall of President Gorbachev. Perhaps smarting from their failure to predict the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the extent of disintegration of the Soviet system, American experts on Soviet affairs foretell Mr. Gorbachev's speedy demise. Some of them indeed anticipate a descent of the whole Soviet Union into economic and social chaos. And a few can't hide their pleasure at such a prospect.
Things surely look bad in that country, President Gorbachev's glasnost and the proclivity of his associates to wash dirty linen in public making the sight probably worse than the reality. Demagogues of all denominations have a field day, and Mr. Gorbachev may indeed be sinking.
On the other hand, he may not. A tenacious man, he still heads the Government of the Soviet Union, which functions quite independently from its constituent republics, whose governments possess modest powers. That the Russian Republic is huge, and that the chairman of its Supreme Soviet has the personality of Huey Long, does not automatically transform Boris Yeltsin into Mr. Gorbachev's nemesis. Soviet ministers and generals, if they question Mr. Gorbachev's wisdom at all, do it in private, and there have been no reports of insurrections in the army and K.G.B. ranks. And at least until the coming Soviet Communist Party Congress, Mr. Gorbachev can, in his capacity as secretary general, deal quite competently with disgruntled politicians.
This means that in his own context Mr. Gorbachev retains immense power. Only he can lift the economic blockade of Lithuania or order Soviet troops in East Germany to return home. He cannot produce an economic miracle or make Armenians and Azerbaijanis love one another, but he remains the only man to speak for the Soviet Union and to do it effectively because of his remarkable international popularity. Precisely because of the horrible mess at home, he cannot make major concessions in international negotiations, for these will make his hand weaker.
Charles de Gaulle, notable for his tenacity, said on one occasion, ''I am too weak to bend.'' This might be Mr. Gorbachev's unspoken message to President Bush.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. - Costly, Inept, Anachronistic

BYLINE: By Roger Morris; Roger Morris was a member of the National Security Council in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations.

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M.

 BODY:
Of all the rusting relics of the cold war, none lingers on with more irony, more resistance to its growing anachronism than the Central Intelligence Agency.
Born in the crucible of the great postwar U.S.-Soviet rivalry and some of its worst expedients, with often no apparent vision save conflict, no abiding purpose save bureaucratic justification or aggrandizement, America's ministry of espionage should be facing questions about its mission and ethic, its practical and constitutional role in the international relations and security of a democratic society. Yet there seems little evidence that either the C.I.A. or the Bush Administration has begun to ponder a more relevant concept of an intelligence service in a radically changed world.
Not surprisingly, the C.I.A. has resorted to the hoary but dependable politics of the past 45 years. It has trotted out suitably new, old or simply hidden dangers, asked for more money and scrambled to protect bureaucratic flanks. 
Along with its 11 related institutions in the U.S. espionage community - including the Defense Intelligence Agency and the electronic eavesdroppers and code breakers of the National Security Agency - the C.I.A. dined well on the flush national security spending of the 1980's. Intelligence budgets tripled over the decade to reach nearly $30 billion in fiscal 1990. Money for C.I.A. operations and analyses has continued to grow throughout the past five years, even as Pentagon appropriations have peaked and declined.
To preserve and extend that expanding domain while much of its rationale disappears, the C.I.A. has begun to advertise new perils of the post-cold-war period - international narcotics, terrorism, industrial espionage, even the spread of chemical weapons. In each field, however, the agency's own performance has been inept if not worse.
From hostage-taking to airline bombing, U.S. intelligence on terrorist attacks has been notoriously flawed, and little better on the humming commerce and intrigue that built chemical warfare arsenals in the Middle East. As for policing the narcotics trade, the C.I.A. itself stands shrouded in a long history of alleged, still unresolved complicity with drug traffickers - from mountain tribesmen and corrupt colonels of Southeast Asia in the 1960's to Gen. Manuel Noriega and the contras of Central America in the 1980's.
As if aware of the vulnerability of these newer projects, C.I.A. lobbyists have summoned an old ally in the budget wars - the agency's major foreign counterpart and in some disturbing ways its mirror image, the Soviet K.G.B. Thus the predictable speeches, leaks and briefings in which the C.I.A. Director, William H. Webster, sees what he calls ''more aggressive, more robust'' Soviet intelligence efforts, lavishly funded and cunningly effective despite the veritable bankruptcy, political chaos and disintegration within the U.S.S.R.
The Russians somehow retain their secret police control in Eastern Europe even as the bloc crumbles, Mr. Webster told one audience last winter. The now-acknowledged backwardness and disarray of the Soviet economy, he maintained, only means even greater K.G.B. zeal in industrial and technological espionage.
Moreover, there are the imminent new U.S.-Soviet arms agreements, the intelligence demands of on-site monitoring and verification, the inspectors who are spies and thus the spies to watch the inspectors. Nor can it all be done safely with a mere $10 billion to $15 billion more for new radar-imaging satellites, part of a major investment in reconnaissance and listening posts already committed by Congress and the White House last year.
In its perennial rivalry with electronic intelligence, the C.I.A. will require added ''humint'' - human-collected intelligence - and thus more manpower. As Mr. Webster told the National Press Club last November, his needs are ''staggering.'' Peace, it turns out, is going to be even more expensive than the cold war, and by all odds a growth industry for the intelligence community.
It is symptomatic of our plight, of our gagged dialogue in national security, that there has been in Congress or the media so little challenge to this campaign, however transparent or contrived. As usual, hard edges of issues and money have been softened by settling on personality, in this case on the somewhat bland and dutiful Mr. Webster.
A U.S. Court of Appeals judge from St. Louis and the F.B.I. Director for nine years, Mr. Webster came to the agency in 1987 to calm everyone after the swift exit and death of William Casey amid the Iran-contra affair - still another scandal in which the C.I.A. was deeply embroiled yet escaped virtually free of consequence.
Mr. Webster was hardly a reformer. He had left behind at the F.B.I. an unsavory record of surveillance of dissident groups as well as charges of racial discrimination. His anemic response to the constitutional atrocity of Iran-contra was to dismiss a pair of lesser officials and demote or reprimand five others, moves widely interpreted in Washington as essential immunity for the agency at large.
The new Director went on to oppose the creation of a quasi-independent C.I.A. inspector general, legislation that became law late last year despite Administration opposition, and to date the only potentially significant new oversight measure to emerge from the Iran-contra revelations.
For his loyalty, Mr. Webster has been rewarded with fattening budgets and only occasional sniping of the sort reserved by the intelligence bureaucracy for exogenous directors. (In acid comparison with William ''Wild Bill'' Donovan, the legendary head of U.S. wartime intelligence and godfather of the C.I.A., agency veterans reportedly call the current Director ''Mild Bill.'') Rather more ominous are the first accounts this spring by a Houston Post reporter, Pete Brewton, of extensive ties between failed financial institutions and the C.I.A. - more than 20 savings and loan institutions and at least two banks with agency connections or relationships with organized crime figures with links themselves to the C.I.A.
Money-laundering, looting of thrifts to finance forbidden covert actions, manipulation of markets, Mafia alliances - hovering over the Post stories and an inquiry by the House Select Committee on Intelligence are too-familiar, too-believable ghosts. These are all too consistent with a shady, seamy margin on which the agency has operated for so long, and which now threatens to mock Mr. Webster's rectitude and hands-off management.
The Central Intelligence Agency has been at the core of America's cold-war Faustian bargain: by one count, at least 900 major projects and several thousand secondary actions over more than four decades, often deliberate decisions to enlist or engage evil in the service of perceived good, often to match in kind an enemy whose values we deplored.
It will not be necessary for scholars of the next century to seize upon the agency's relatively rare renegade departures from Presidential edict. The record of proposing, organizing, executing, rationalizing and then concealing authorized policy will be enough for the most extraordinary chapter in the history of American foreign relations.
The proof, as they like to say at C.I.A. headquarters, is in results. Off only the briefest roll call - Iran, Guatemala, Indonesia, Zaire, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Chile, Somalia, Brazil, Angola, Libya, Nicaragua, Vietnam, El Salvador, Cambodia, Panama, Lebanon, Korea - some conclusions are already plain. Whatever the presumed alternative, most C.I.A. interventions have consigned or left countries to repression and prolonged suffering. Despite billions in secret subsidies of U.S. tax dollars, several of our most favored clients fell of their own savagery and corruption, leading to violently anti-American successor regimes. Many of our secret police proxies and proteges have displayed an amazingly consistent penchant for torture.
Yet history may not judge so harshly, after all, the seedy bag men or sleepy watch officers counting off the moments to a faraway coup d'etat. Far worse than any covert action, however wrong or misshapen, is an intelligence agency's intellectual dishonesty, the ideological, political or bureaucratic corruption of the information that is the essence of the art. Expected to deceive everyone else, it must never willfully or by incompetence lie to itself.
That the C.I.A. has done just that so often, and especially vis-a-vis the Soviet Union, its most vital object of study, should now raise the gravest doubts about its future role and funding. The agency's bafflement at the process loosed by glasnost, its stuffy, orthodox ignorance of the volcanic forces so close beneath the surface of Soviet society, is only the latest and most spectacular failure.
There is, too, what one scholar has called ''politics and guesswork,'' the systematic overstatement of Soviet military expenditures since 1948, distorted estimates that in the eerie cold-war twilight of the past decade came to look somehow moderate beside the wildly tendentious and budget-plumping analyses of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Without a discourse of integrity, the C.I.A. could not accurately gauge the old Soviet threat, or honestly inform U.S. policy in response. Now, with little sense at home or abroad of a politics of the left, it sees clearly neither the present nor the future of a new Soviet Union that is still the most important power in Europe or Asia.
Reconversion is as essential to the C.I.A. as to so much of the bloated weapons industry it helped feed. In a Washington no longer in thrall to the old myths of ideology and power, most political intelligence could be vested in a revitalized foreign ministry and diplomatic service, where it belongs. Military intelligence, much too important and tempting to be left to the generals, should be shifted entirely to a broader new National Security Agency with no stake in either the Pentagon budget or old bureaucratic quarrels.
Left - with open budgets, openly arrived at - would be a truly new C.I.A. for an obviously new world, a select and streamlined agency shorn of its operational folly and extraconstitutional means. The new agency would be dedicated unequivocally to analyses of cultural sensibility and socioeconomic developments. One might hope that these would inform a new relevance in government decision-making, from development aid to control of the arms or drug traffic, from combating AIDS to fostering human rights. The peace dividend of that C.I.A., of course, would not only be billions in savings and genuine national security but also a fresh generation of talented and idealistic young officials for whom intelligence was once again a public service.
Like high priests railing at an end to superstition, the professionals will call such a plan heresy, impossible. If only they could tell us that the danger were really gone, they have always said. Only then could we change this obese, tunnel-vision relic, slouching toward Capitol Hill for still more money, still more ominous briefings on a world already past.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Victors In the Cold War

BYLINE: By A.M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
Max Schmeling looked up from the floor of the boxing ring, saw Joe Louis still standing there and said:
''Joe, this thing is over. Let's not argue about who won it.''
Well, he should have said it. The words would have lived forever in the anthologies of chutzpah, as will Mikhail Gorbachev's immortal two sentences at Stanford: ''The cold war is behind us. Let us not wrangle over who won it.'' We've lost our sense of humor. Too many people in government and academia actually take him seriously and nod in pious approval. 
That could be dangerous. If we all are gentlemanly about Mr. Gorbachev's wistful request to ignore reality, a terrible distortion of history will take place and the lessons of the past half-century will not have been learned.
To ignore history is to risk repeating it. Humanity's historical record makes that an especially gruesome thought.
The world knows one thing for sure - the Communists certainly did not win, or Mr. Gorbachev would not have been courting capitalists in California. Since he does not recognize the victory of the other side, logically what he is saying is that nobody won. That is not true. The cold war does not exist separately in history. It was one battle in the great struggle of the 20th century - the struggle against tyranny.
The struggle was won against Hitler, which might not have happened without the blood of the Soviet people.
Then Stalin and his successors expanded their own empire of tyranny. What we call the cold war was the struggle against that particular despotism. It was fought around the world. It still is being fought in the reaches of the empire where the Communist side has not yet been defeated - countries like China, Cuba, and North Korea.
Some American specialists on the Soviet Union now say that the Western buildup against the Soviets was never necessary - just look how the empire collapsed.
They have strong voices. CBS hires and presents frequently as its regular Soviet affairs commentator an American academic who is generally seen as an enthusiastic advocate for that position. And Time magazine assures us that the doves were right all along.
Gentlemen, go tell that to the Poles, the Hungarians, the Czechs.
They know that without the growth of Western armed power and the necessity to match it, the Kremlin could have gone on controlling the evil empire for more decades, staving off collapse by sucking out the resources of the colonies.
But the contest was never simply between Western and Soviet armed forces. Not a shot was fired between them. Mr. Gorbachev does not want to ''wrangle'' because he does not yet dare either to define the cold war or to tell the truth about the side that fought his own.
But he knows, and one day he may say it. The side against Communism was an alliance, between the West and the people within the Soviet empire who fought it year after year, for almost a half-century.
Millions of Soviet and Eastern European people sacrificed their liberty fighting in that alliance or were murdered for it. For them, it was never cold.
It is an unbearable thought, that Mr. Gorbachev, who but for the past few years was on the side that jailed and killed these fighters in the freedom alliance, be allowed to wave aside their very existence by implying that nobody really won.
Simple respect to them demands that we recognize that the cold war was not between armed camps or even economic systems but between freedom and slavery.
If that is not worth wrangling about, what are the Chinese youngsters and workers fighting for now? Why do they risk death and torture in the filthy jails of the Communist regime?
There is a ''cold war'' in China -and Tibet - but the lineup of contestants has changed. The fighters for liberty are still on one side and the Communist chieftains are on the other. But the Western powers, to their eternal shame, are not to be seen in the struggle.
One day the unutterably nasty men who rule in China will be torn down and apart by their people. If the United States keeps helping the rulers, it will take longer, but they will go.
Will we then be told that the Chinese Government was really never so fearsome? Will the sufferings of the Chinese people and their victory so dearly bought be waved away - not worth arguing about?
The fighters in the European cold war did exist; they did fight; and they did win.

HEADLINE: West Comes Alive in A Ghost Town

BYLINE: By B. P. RILEY; B. P. RILEY is a journalist who lives in Carson City, Nev.

 BODY:
LIFE in the West's rough-and-tumble mining camps didn't get much harsher than in Bodie, Calif., a treeless, wind-whipped site some 8,500 feet above sea level on the east slope of the Sierra Nevadas. The lure of gold brought hard-rock miners, drifters and toughs to a town that once boasted a population as high as 10,000 at its peak in the early 1880's.
A tinsmith-turned-prospector, Waterman S. Bodey, a native of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., discovered gold here in 1859 but died in a winter snowstorm and never saw the town that was named for him. (His name was often misspelled; Bodie was the form favored by the town's founders). His remains weren't found until the next spring. By most accounts, Bodie was one of the wildest towns in the Wild West, producing the legendary ''bad man from Bodie,'' violence among idle miners addicted to opium, and about $100 million worth of gold. The peak boom period lasted only three years, beginning in the fall of 1877 and ending in the summer of 1881. After that, historians say, the decline was rapid, although several mines continued to produce and many people hung on.
Early-day news accounts tell of a young girl, en route to the remote town with her family, writing in her diary: ''Goodbye God, I'm going to Bodie.'' Town boosters, so the story goes, turned the phrase around, maintaining that she really meant: ''Good, by God, I'm going to Bodie.'' 
Only a fragment of Bodie remains, preserved in ''arrested decay'' as a California State Historic Park at the end of 10 miles of pavement and 3 miles of gravel road running east of Route 395 just south of Bridgeport near the Nevada line. Standing are more than 170 buildings such as hotels, a schoolhouse, church and union hall, as well as twisted and tilted shacks and outhouses. Enough remains for visitors to get both a glimpse of camp life and an eerie sense of this true ghost town.
A few of the buildings are open, such as the Miners' Union Hall on Main Street, which doubles as a visitors' center and small museum filled with bits and pieces of Bodie history, books and pamphlets on the town and even two hearses. In the visitors' center, a small sign warns of the bad luck that can follow anyone who picks up old cans, bottles, square nails or other artifacts found lying in the dirt in what is one of the best preserved ghost towns in the West.
Others buildings are locked, but one can peek through uncurtained windows and see tables, chairs and beds abandoned by departing townsfolk. Children's drawings are still pinned on the walls of the old schoolhouse on Green Street. Books are on the desks, and teachers' lessons on the chalkboard.
The old Methodist Church, also on Green Street, was built in 1882, when the camp's lawless days were nearly over - and after a local reporter suggested that ''a general improvement in morals would not be out of place.''
On the corner of Green and Main, visitors can peer into Boone's store and see housewares, drugstore items, a paint display, a mannequin and other merchandise. Parked outside, next to an old gasoline pump, is a 1927 Dodge-Graham truck, the most modern piece of equipment visible in the town. (Visitors' cars aren't allowed on the dirt streets; they must be parked in a lot just west of town.) Across the street from Boone's stands the Wheaton and Hollis Hotel. A battered, dusty pool table and bar can be seen in the lobby, and iron beds and old mattresses are visible through other windows.
Visitors who look through the ground-floor windows of the brick Dechambeau Hotel on Main Street can see an old mail-sorting box used by the postmaster. His office moved from one location to another over the years - usually to smaller and smaller spots as the town dwindled.
Halfway up Bodie Bluff on the northeast side of the town is the Standard Mill, the most imposing structure visible from Main Street. The mill was rebuilt after a fire in 1899 and still contains almost all the machinery needed to process ore. Also standing, on a saddle east of town, is the Bodie railroad station, the terminus of a 31-mile-long narrow-gauge railroad completed mainly with Chinese labor in 1881. Old carriages, still in good repair, survive in a few barns around town. Freight wagons, their iron wheels rusting and wood frames rotting, stand unprotected outside.
In its heyday, around 1878, Bodie had almost 50 saloons, as many brothels and dance halls, a dozen lawyers, a few doctors, twice-daily stagecoach service, several newspapers, a score of restaurants, several hotels and a telegraph line to Genoa, Nev., about 95 miles to the north. There were more than 600 buildings and Main Street was a mile long; today the section with buildings on it is less than half that. By 1885, census figures showed the population was 6,000, although local newspapers and some historians put the figure as high as 10,000.
By then the first signs of an economic decline were apparent. Real estate sales slumped, and abandoned houses and vacancy signs were common. Gold strikes in Arizona and Idaho siphoned off many miners in the late 1870's and the 1880's, and by 1890 only two mines were still operating and only 15 of the camp's total of 160 stamp mills were being used.
A fire in 1892 destroyed much of Bodie, but many of the buildings were replaced or rebuilt. One of the town's principal property owners in the 1890's, J. S. Cain, and others helped to keep the town going by processing low-grade ore and building a hydroelectric dam to bring in power that cut mining costs.
By the 1920's the town was looking more and more like a ghost, with fewer than 100 residents. The rails and rolling stock of the Mono Lake Railway and Lumber Company were dismantled and sold for scrap, and mining activity was small-scale and intermittent.
Another major fire in 1932 destroyed most of the buildings, including such landmarks as the post office, the U. S. Hotel and Occidental Hotel and the Bodie Bank. Much of what was left behind remains standing today.
Cain's home was spared, but his land was exhausted. In 1935 he leased his mining property and moved to San Francisco. His family hired a caretaker to look after the house and the land until it became a state park in 1962. The ''arrested decay'' concept used by the California Department of Parks and Recreation calls for more beams and braces to keep the remaining buildings just as they are, unrestored and without any commercial improvements. New shingles are necessary from time to time as protection from the weather.
Bodie's high elevation accounts for radical extremes of hot and cold in winter and summer. Summer temperatures can exceed 100 degrees. Winter snows can be as deep as 10 feet, and last winter temperatures dropped to 30 degrees below zero.
The harsh conditions have peeled away almost all the paint on buildings, leaving behind bare wood walls - and a few brick buildings -that get so pummeled by the elements that log braces have been used on the leeward sides of many to keep them from collapsing.
THE unspoiled nature of Bodie may not last. The gold deposits discovered in 1859 have attracted miners again, and test drilling is already under way to see whether the bluff above town may yield more fortunes.
A park ranger, Jack Shipley, says as many as 15 of the old buildings still standing on Bodie Bluff might be razed should Galactic Resources, based in Vancouver, renew mining there. If standard, modern-day earth-moving methods are used, much of the bluff might disappear. Even if the company goes no further than testing, the faint sounds of drilling and the rumble of an occasional mine truck is enough to disturb the reverie that Mr. Shipley has come to treasure during his six years in Bodie. ''If they start mining, it would be busy and noisy all the time,'' he said, brushing a fine layer of ever-present Bodie dust from a stack of pamphlets in the park office in Cain's home.
 
One of the wildest in the Wild West
 
Getting There Bodie can be reached by traveling south from Reno, Nev., on Route 395 about 110 miles to Bridgeport, Calif. From Bridgeport, the seat of Mono County and the closest town to Bodie, it's another seven miles south on Route 395 to the Bodie turnoff. From there, the road goes east on 10 miles of paved surface and three miles of good gravel and dirt to the town. From Yosemite, the road that runs east through Yosemite National Parktravels down the east slope of the Sierra Nevadas to the small town of Lee Vining, on Route 395 and about 22 miles from Bodie.
 
Prices and Hours The only services at Bodie are a parking lot and restrooms. Entrance to the Bodie State Historic Park (619-647-6445) is $3 a car, $2 for seniors. It's $1 for a dog on a leash.
From Memorial Day to Sept. 1 the park is open every day from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M. and the museum in the miners' union hall is open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.
The rest of the year it is open from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., but the road isn't plowed and snow can block cars for two to six months. Cross-country skiers often ski in during the winter.
 
Accommodations In Bridgeport there are several motels on Main Street. The Silver Maple Inn (619-932-7383), which was recently completely remodeled, charges $50 a night without breakfast for a room with a queen-sized bed and $55 for a room with a king-sized bed. The Walker River Lodge (619-932-7021) charges $65 a night for a single and $70 a night for two. Breakfast is not available.
The Cain House (619-932-7040), next to the Silver Maple Inn, is the only bed-and-breakfast place in town.Rates are $75 to $125 a night. The mailing address for all three is Main Street, Bridgeport, Calif. 93517.
 
Dining A steak dinner at the Bodie Union Mining Company (619-932-7345) on Main Street or the Sportsman's Inn (619-932-7020), also on Main Street, will cost about $13 a person. It's $19.95 at the Bridgeport Inn (619-932-7380), across the street. - B. P. R.

HEADLINE: Homeless in America

BYLINE: By Mitchel Levitas; Mitchel Levitas is a senior editor of The New York Times.

 BODY:
One of the most incongruous snapshots of America's homeless men and women can be taken daily at about 4:30 in the afternoon on one of the two large lawns that flank the entrance to City Hall on Main Street in Santa Monica, Calif. The neatly trimmed grass, the blue canopy and Art Deco mosaic tiles over the front doors of the white, two-story building just two blocks from the serene Pacific, is an odd setting for a soup kitchen. Private volunteers of Family Assistance Involving the Homeless, or Faith, serve 250 or 300 people a hot supper and dessert. Several park rangers stand around in case of trouble, but on this sunny, cool afternoon the line moves quietly along the perimeter of bright green grass toward the tables of food. Wearing down jackets and windbreakers (one or two men are in suits) and carrying knapsacks, duffel bags or black plastic garbage bags, the homeless seem mostly in their 20's or 30's; some are black, some white; men far outnumber women. A middle-aged street woman dressed in layers of clothing feeds her toy poodle vegetables with a teaspoon; its doghouse is a mobile home - a carton wedged at the front of a shopping cart piled high with possessions. 
The scene is familiar to Barbara Stinchfield, the community development manager of this prosperous city of 90,000 whose liberal politics have inspired conservatives to call it the People's Republic of Santa Monica. Five years ago, Stinchfield said: ''Our homeless task force had a very positive feeling, trying to address the problems of a few hundred veterans and families, single men and women. We won awards for an innovative outreach program and a day center for mentally ill women. Then the numbers of homeless got so great'' - about a thousand is the highest estimate - ''that people thought, 'My God, we're going under!' Now we feel like desperate people in a desperate city.''
Across Main Street from City Hall, along a landscaped knoll that overlooks Faith's food line, is the low-rise glass headquarters of the Rand Corporation, where cadres of hands-on analysts are employed to think deeply about solutions to vital problems facing the United States in peace and war. Three years ago, Rand got into the homeless question. Under a new five-year, $2.3 million grant from the National Institute of Mental Health, Audrey Burnam of Rand and Paul Koegel of the University of California at Los Angeles are trying to learn how mentally ill homeless people in Santa Monica and on Skid Row in Los Angeles manage to find a home, or at least a roof over their heads, as most of them do after less than a year on the street. ''We don't understand why and how they cease to become homeless,'' says Burnam. ''Where do they go? How does that happen? What kind of housing is useful and what support services do they really need?''
The Rand study may clarify some of the many uncertainties still surrounding the homeless population. The basic questions begin with its size and composition. Is the number of homeless about 600,000 on any given day, as the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Washington, believes? Or is it closer to the 3 million claimed by advocates for the homeless? Even harder to agree on are the causes and strategies for attacking the phenomenon. Whatever the answers, the fact that Rand has turned its attention to this issue suggests that homelessness may well have become a permanent feature of poverty in America.
It has all happened in less than a decade, after the experts realized that the 1981-82 recession was not a temporary spasm, but an early warning of an evolving, major socioeconomic breakdown. Homeless - a word that until recently was virtually unknown in the public-policy vocabulary - has become a slogan, a stigma and a symbol of the country's reluctance and inability to relieve a novel suffering among its poorest people.
As President-elect, George Bush called homelessness a ''national shame.'' Jack Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, likes to call himself ''a bleeding heart conservative'' when it comes to housing for the poor. And Anna Kondratas, H.U.D.'s assistant secretary for community planning and development, asserts that although ''the problem is shocking and getting worse,'' she's convinced that it will be turned around in this decade. ''After all,'' she said, ''this is the land of the rich as well as the free, by world standards, and we should be able to do it.''
Is this climate of rhetorical concern a sign of Federal determination to attack homelessness? Or is it really going to be up to the states and cities to find solutions - and pay for them? The trouble is, solutions depend on how homelessness is defined and who makes the definitions. Public officials? Academic experts in welfare economics or the dynamics of poverty? And what about the thousands of volunteer groups and other advocates who have so far shaped the debate and provided the services to help the homeless? Are they capable of coping with such a threatening phenomenon? In short, who is doing what about eradicating this ''national shame''?
Some answers emerged in more than a month of travel to several cities, each with its own problems, and talks with dozens of scholars, advocates, service providers and public officials. One conclusion is evident: There is no grand strategy aimed at eliminating homelessness, no master blueprint on the drawing board of the social engineers. The very complexity of homelessness explains why so many partial ''solutions'' are inescapable. ''It's the most fascinating, frustrating public policy issue I've ever been involved in,'' said Gordon Berlin, who recently finished up a stint as the chief for management, policy and budget of New York City's Human Resources Agency.
Berlin's feelings are widely shared, even by advocates who are prone to boiling down the problem to three causes, ''housing, housing, housing,'' and three cures, ''housing, housing, housing.'' Homelessness, as James D. Wright, a Tulane University sociologist and author of ''Address Unknown,'' has written, is ''simultaneously a housing problem, an employment problem, a demographic problem, a problem of social disaffiliation, a mental health problem, a family violence problem, a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending, a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family, and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level.''
Even that partial list of targets makes the 1960's War on Poverty seem like a simple commando raid. Lyndon B. Johnson presided during a period of moral fervor over civil rights, coupled with Great Society domestic spending. In today's climate, said Wright: ''The solutions are almost prohibitive. Moreover, there doesn't seem to be an entry point into the problem because every subgroup in the homeless'' -single young men, single women, one-parent families, alcoholics, families in which no one is employed, the mentally ill, the elderly - ''has its own complex of needs. The drug problem is getting worse all the time.'' ''And,'' he summed up, ''I think in all honesty that we're losing ground.The 1990's will be worse than the 1980's.''
Not everyone is as pessimistic, but few activists or social service providers are optimistic either. In what many argue is an abdication of Federal responsibility, thousands of advocates and volunteer groups have had to learn new organizing skills, patching together funds from half a dozen sources while avoiding the snares of bureaucracy. Their many successes come in small victories - the neighborhood, not the nation, is their focus. The lawyer-advocates are more politically savvy, and look a little further down the road. Gary Blasi is a housing lawyer in Los Angeles who specialized in fighting evictions, which is how he began defending the homeless and wound up as president of the National Coalition for the Homeless; his term was recently extended, he reported without enthusiasm. Blasi isn't weary, exactly. It's just that he knows the score.
''If God stopped the creation of homeless people,'' he said, ''we might, with enormous expense and effort, get back to normal within two or three years. But we still will need fewer poor people or more cheap housing. Otherwise, the process will go on forever. That's why the energy of the advocates goes for housing and raising incomes. We can't solve this problem on the basis of humanitarianism. Thank God for saints and martyrs, but the problem goes well beyond that. ''The future? The pessimist in me sees homelessness becoming a permanent part of American society, with millions of kids growing up in an essentially third-world country with all those sadly familiar extremes of wealth and poverty. The other possibility is that people will decide it's curable and fix it. It's a question of political priorities and public perception.''
About a million flophouse rooms have been torn down nationwide since the 1970's, when cities across the land began to rejuvenate their downtowns. Bowery bums who worked occasionally are among today's homeless.
What's left of Skid Row in Los Angeles says a lot about the homeless problem. The 55 square blocks just east of the spiffy new downtown is the scene of intensive rescue and renewal aimed at 11,000 Skid Row men and women who live in the 65 remaining single-room-occupancy hotels, or spend the night in the 2,000 emergency beds and chairs provided by half a dozen missions; all but one of the missions provide sermons along with shelter. City shelters open only when it's raining, cold (below 40 degrees) or when the weather is threatening.
Six years ago, the city's Community Redevelopment Agency hired Andy Raubeson from a successful S.R.O. program in Portland, Ore., to do the same in Los Angeles, where the homeless population is usually estimated at 50,000 to 70,000. The S.R.O. Housing Corporation, partly financed by a new tax base from downtown skyscrapers, opened its first renovated flophouse in 1986; the city passed a five-year moratorium on the further destruction or conversion of S.R.O.'s in 1989 (about 2,300 units were lost between 1969 and 1986), and now Raubeson's outfit owns 13 S.R.O.'s and is adding two more.
Joining the S.R.O. Housing Corporation in the race to renovate is the nonprofit Skid Row Housing Trust, whose president is Alice Callaghan, an energetic Episcopal priest and former nun. Callaghan doesn't think of Skid Row as a homeless community, but as an ''endangered low-income residential community'' with jobs in fish processing and wholesale toys, and under hostile pressure from Little Tokyo, a growing enclave of Asian commerce. Real estate values in Skid Row are climbing 15 percent a year, evidently in the belief that commercial growth is inexorable, moratorium or not. The trust's first project did away with a rendezvous for drug dealers and prostitutes, reborn in 1988 as the 29-room Genesis Hotel, in a partnership between a Pasadena Episcopal church and a West Los Angeles synagogue. The trust now owns 10 hotels, three already gutted and redesigned with community kitchens, skylights, pastel colors and cheerful tile floors. There is a manager on the premises, in case of trouble or if someone sees demons in the middle of the night.
According to a blue-ribbon commission appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley, one-fourth of all renters paid more than half their income for housing, a burden that often leads to homelessness. The average rent in Los Angeles in 1988 was $525 a month, 70 percent of the income of a minimum-wage worker, and more than twice the rent in 1980. But during the last 20 years, the value of welfare payments to about 4 million adults (principally Aid to Families with Dependent Children), and other forms of welfare assistance has declined by more than a third, making cheap, decent housing almost impossible to find. H.U.D. appropriations for subsidized housing programs were cut by 80 percent during the Reagan Administration, from $33 billion in 1981 to $8 billion in 1988; about 500,000 people were dropped from the welfare rolls after being declared ineligible.
Advocates point to numbers like these and argue that Washington is responsible for the sudden appearance of homelessness in the 1980's. Anna Kondratas of H.U.D. rejects the idea that Federal policies are the root cause of the problem; it thus follows, in her view, that Federal policies are not the root solutions either. Similarly, Stuart M. Butler, director of domestic-policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, believes that more housing only ignores ''the disabilities'' among the ''majority'' of the homeless: ''either mental illness, long-term drug and alcohol abuse, or a combination of the two.''
John P. Singleton, vice chairman of Los Angeles's Security Pacific Corporation, heads an $8 million drive for a new home for the 99-year-old Union Rescue Mission. Like Butler, he believes that ''government aggravates the problem, not solves it.'' But Singleton concedes that volunteerism has its limits: ''We were ready to spend $100 million to keep the Raiders in town. Where is our sense of priorities?''
A few miles down the Santa Monica Freeway, Vivian Rothstein asked the same question. Her Ocean Park Community Center raises $800,000 a year from private sources, ''but there is no way the nonprofits can meet the needs of the homeless,'' she said. ''The Feds have walked off the scene. We're literally keeping people alive, and we were not set up for that.'' Goaded by such frustrations, some providers are seeking new means to end homelessness, taking hundreds of small steps at a time. Maxene Johnston has converted a dangerous 11-story fleabag hotel (''A murder a day at the old El Rey,'' was the local wisecrack) into the Weingart Center, which includes under one roof an inexpensive cafeteria operated by a national food service company; county medical, mental health and welfare services; 600 beds, most of them in private rooms; an alcohol detoxification unit; a Veterans Administration office, and an assortment of referral services.
Tanya Tull has been helping Los Angeles homeless for a decade, first by mobilizing emergency shelters, then by starting transitional housing programs. She recently founded two nonprofit groups that operate permanent housing with support services for the mentally ill and for families with children. ''It's impossible to find enough transitional beds,'' she maintains. ''Besides, moving people around from one place to another isn't normal. We helped create the monster of dependency. Now we have to redirect our energies and re-educate the public toward supported, independent housing.''
On Skid Row, Jill Halverson runs the Downtown Women's Center and 48 units of adjoining, permanent housing. The architectural design is modern and cozy, complete with a porch light over each door and an old-fashioned mailbox to create the feeling of a home for the once-homeless mentally ill and elderly residents. ''We got to know the women at the drop-in day center,'' Halverson explains. ''So we take as tenants those who are willing to accept treatment or who can profit from it. It made sense to bite the bullet on permanent housing. After all, what do they transition to?'' 
People who live in Minneapolis, describing the rate of crime, addiction, poverty and family violence in the city's near North Side, call it ''our South Bronx.'' If the South Bronx had lawns, decently kept one-family houses and clean streets, the comparison might seem more credible. Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul, across the Mississippi, also know homelessness, but like other problems in the Twin Cities it almost seems manageable. Cold winters help, discouraging heavy migration. But a combination of political liberalism, a Scandinavian and German cultural inheritance, enlightened corporations and relative prosperity has done much to create a sense of civic-mindedness. The McKnight Foundation, for example, supports projects for the state's disadvantaged; according to Tom Fulton, president of the Minneapolis/Saint Paul Family Housing Fund, the foundation has given his organization a total of $28 million for local low-cost housing development. Church groups and other volunteer agencies in the Twin Cities have created more than half a dozen emergency shelters with about a thousand beds and several drop-in centers that serve meals. On the night of Feb. 22, the shelter population was 1,022, almost the same as last year, according to a head count by the Wilder Foundation. Blacks are disproportionately represented among the homeless in American cities; even in metropolitan Minneapolis, which is less than 15 percent black, blacks constituted an estimated 41 percent of the foundation's census. (Whites were 37 percent; Hispanic people, 9 percent; American Indian, 10 percent; Asian, 1 percent.) Two of the most innovative programs in Minneapolis are aimed at homeless mothers and their children, the fastest-growing component of the homeless population nationally. One program is run from a small office in a Presbyterian church by Sue Watlov Phillips, who last year installed 138 adults and children in suburban homes leased by her Elim Transitional Housing organization. One ranch house was a temporary refuge for four homeless women and three children: one had a violent boyfriend; another's husband had started using drugs; the parents of a third were dealing in drugs; the fourth got pregnant and had been thrown out by her mother.
Another program, focused directly on youngsters, is the Learning Center, operating from cheerful quarters in the basement of a former motel, now a shelter for homeless families. ''It's a place of learning and fun,'' Panna M. Putnam, its director, told a dozen youngsters seated at their desks, poised to write a collective poem. Putnam said the children are curious and bright, but building trust is difficult when the average stay at the motel is 21 days. The women are so desperate for housing that they wind up in the same situation they were in before: bad neighborhoods, substandard housing, high rents and eviction. ''It's a revolving door,'' said Putnam. ''And within a year we see half the same families again.''
''Unless we put money into permanent affordable housing,'' said Tom Fulton of the Family Housing Fund, ''we're just dealing on an emergency basis.'' Doing their best to fill the need, a dozen neighborhood-based community development organizations are actively buying abandoned buildings, and constructing new ones; in the last eight years they've created 3,000 low-cost permanent housing units. J. Paul Getty's birthplace, The Heritage, on the edge of downtown Minneapolis, has been remodeled by the Central Community Housing Trust, which has finished or has under way a dozen such projects. The Heritage is now 16 units of carpeted efficiency apartments, renting to the formerly homeless for one-third of their monthly income.
With all the problem-solving energy of the Twin Cities, is homelessness declining? ''The basic problems are beyond our control,'' replied Fulton. ''When you provide more, you're helping someone. But I can't honestly say we're winning the battle, no.''
After a five-year flood of crises, Gordon Berlin, a key strategist in the Human Resources Administration of former Mayor Edward I. Koch, hopes that the tide of homelessness in New York City - at least 35,000 people, and perhaps twice that number - might be getting easier to manage. Though the city may fail to meet a June 30 deadline for moving homeless families out of welfare hotels, the worst hotels have been emptied and the number has dropped sharply even though 800 new families enter the system every month. ''What we've done is a miracle, and we get no credit for it,'' Berlin said.
The most important city effort to contain homelessness is a 10-year $5.1 billion program to construct and rebuild 84,000 new apartments by 1996. Of that total, 15,000 are earmarked for homeless families - most of them single mothers with children. In half of these cases the women never had a home of their own before, living doubled up with parents or boyfriends. Andrew Cuomo, whose Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged organization in New York State builds transitional housing for families, has estimated that at least half the mothers and older children in his facilities have a drug problem. Seventy-five percent of the new permanent housing for homeless single mothers is in the South Bronx, Cuomo pointed out: ''We have just moved the Martinique Hotel there and built a time bomb. Unless these women become self-supporting, society should be prepared to take care of them and their kids for the rest of their lives. Is that the kind of country we want?''
Dr. Ellen L. Bassuk, a psychiatrist who is president of the Better Homes Foundation, reports that homeless mothers who are alcoholic or on crack are showing up in large numbers. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, she says, has replaced Down syndrome and spina bifida as the leading cause of infant mental retardation. ''Substance abuse and family violence - not unrelated pathologies - are the main cause of family homelessness throughout the country,'' she said.
Compared to the problem of homeless families, housing for the single homeless seems almost attainable. Mayor David N. Dinkins is under pressure to build more than 10,000 S.R.O. units, a quick, relatively cheap fix. But the rush to the S.R.O. bandwagon has already produced an anguished backlash from not-for-profit groups who operate more than 2,000 S.R.O. units in Manhattan. A statement drafted by Stephan Russo of the Goddard-Riverside Community Center warned that by referring homeless men and women from emergency shelters without proper screening for drugs, alcohol, prior hospitalization or criminal activity, the city was threatening the stability and security of long-established neighborhood agencies. ''The notion of limited supportive housing sounds nice in principle,'' the statement declared, ''but the reality is that the level of need of those we are housing is far greater than our capacity to respond. As a result, the 'new' nonprofit S.R.O.'s are in danger of becoming nothing more than more humane repositories for the shelter population fraught with the same problems of violence, drug abuse and decompensation found in city shelters.''
A case in point is the Senate, a completely renovated eight-story, 136-room former shooting gallery and hangout for pimps and prostitutes on West 92d Street, east of Broadway. Janice Johns, the director of Social Services, says the police are called three or four times a week to prevent violence, deter suicide, or arrest a drug dealer. The building's own security force reports two or three incidents a night: ''Lorraine was arguing again with her imaginary enemies.'' ''Jorge is drunk and playing the radio with incredible noise.'' ''Luis pulled out a knife.'' Johns had not expected this sort of trouble. ''We didn't know about MICA'' - the acronym stands for Mentally ill/Chemical Abuser - ''and the city didn't tell us,'' she explained despairingly. But MICA's are in the minority; for most tenants, the Senate is the first quiet haven they have known in years.
Perhaps the most remarkable resident is the Senate's tenant association treasurer, a 44-year-old woman named Jay. She was in the Willowbrook mental hospital for 12 years, homeless for six years on the streets of the Bronx, and was raped, robbed and beaten before finding safety at the Traveler's Hotel for women near the Port Authority Bus Terminal, run by the West Side Cluster, among the larger of the city's hundreds of volunteer agencies for the homeless. Jay works as a volunteer at St. Luke's Hospital one day a week. One of her proudest possessions is a Mickey Mouse phone, which stands on a table in her spotless room. ''I never had a private phone until I came to this beautiful home,'' she said. ''And I'm not homeless anymore. What more can I ask.''
The collective experience of Robert Hayes, Ellen Baxter and Kim Hopper, who met while working with the homeless more than a decade ago, shows how much ingenuity and persistence are required to get anything done. Hayes, fresh out of New York University Law School, got his first job with the blue-chip firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, and won a landmark pro bono case in 1981. Citing the State Constitution, he obtained a court order compelling City Hall to provide shelter for Robert Callahan, a homeless man; the municipal shelter program, now consisting of 10,000 beds, followed. Hayes, chairman of the Coalition for the Homeless, has begun another major legal assault, arguing in State Supreme Court that the city and state must create supportive housing for the mentally ill. Ellen Baxter had been working at the Community Service Society since the summer of 1979, when she was a graduate student at the Columbia University School of Public Health. Hayes was putting together the Callahan case and Baxter helped him gather evidence. Later, she worked with Franciscan nuns who had opened a shelter for homeless people who were being removed from the Madison Square Garden area during the 1980 Democratic National Convention. ''That's when the homeless coalition got off the ground,'' she said. In 1986, she opened the Heights, on West 178th Street, the first of four permanent S.R.O. buildings for the homeless. It took her three years of hacking through red tape to get the building gutted, rebuilt, financed, and finally filled with 55 single men and women who had been sleeping on the street.
Kim Hopper went to Columbia with Baxter and in 1981 was the co-author with her of ''Private Lives/Public Spaces,'' a pioneering study that investigated the nature and origins of today's homelessness and is often cited in later, more academic, works. Hopper has a doctorate in medical anthropology. He organized the local effort by the United States Census Bureau to monitor its own count of the homeless by employing 127 observers, disguised as homeless people, who watched the official enumerators at work. Is there hope for homelessness? ''I have mixed feelings,'' Hopper said. ''Positively, there are hundreds of private shelters in the city, and people are more involved. On the other hand, the public is responding to society's traditional view of homelessness as a problem of damaged and disagreeable people.''
Peter P. Smith heads the country's largest network of private aid to the homeless - almost 400 New York City churches and synagogues that supply emergency food, shelter and permanent housing through the Partnership for the Homeless. In March, the partnership opened a supportive residence for homeless people with AIDS, a group expected to number 100,000 nationally by 1995. ''In the last 10 years we've learned what works and what doesn't work,'' Smith said. ''Now, at least, the building blocks are in place.''
Social scientists have pointed out that the Government virtually eliminated poverty among the elderly by enormous spending on Social Security (which helps explain, incidentally, why the median age of the homeless population has dropped to somewhere between 30 and 35). ''For the first time in our history,'' writes the sociologist Peter H. Rossi, author of ''Down and Out in America,'' ''the poverty rate for persons aged 65 and over is less than that for the rest of the population.'' Now is the time, Rossi and others are suggesting, to raise the basic level of welfare benefits and even add a new category, Aid to Families With Dependent Adults, for those doubled-up families who are warding off homelessness by taking in relatives.
President Bush's own plans for helping the homeless rest largely on a $728 million housing proposal that advocates have welcomed more for its recognition of homelessness than as a seriously financed attack on it. About $450 million of the $728 million is restricted to vouchers that pay a monthly subsidy based on the difference between a ''fair market'' rent and one-third of the tenant's income. But, because the rent may exceed a ''fair market'' level in tight markets that exist in many major cities where the homeless need housing the most, vouchers are likely to induce a landlord to raise his asking price.
One skeptic is James W. Rouse, a highly successful commercial builder and developer, now retired, whose Enterprise Foundation has provided expertise and funds since 1981 to 100 groups in 27 communities to develop affordable housing for the poor. ''Vouchers do nothing to repair bombed-out neighborhoods and abandoned buildings,'' Rouse said. ''It's outrageous to think you can solve homelessness that way.'' According to Rouse, if the Federal Government gave the states $3 billion coupled with matching requirements, ''it would have a tremendous impact at reasonable cost. A thousand points of light sounds fine,'' he added, ''but there's no electricity.''
Margery A. Turner, a housing specialist at the Urban Institute in Washington, agreed that without more cheap housing there could be ''no solution and no prevention'' of homelessness. And that can't happen without a heavy Federal commitment, she stressed. She didn't think that local housing solutions, no matter how ingeniously financed or enthusiastically pursued, can be the answer. ''Even if there were a hundred Jim Rouses,'' she said, ''that's still not a national housing policy.''
Housing in the United States is regarded as a commodity, not a necessity. Production for profit is the game, but losers can't play. And it will take more than billions of dollars spent on housing to make a big difference in homelessness, which is only the most extreme form of poverty. ''We spend less on social welfare as a percent of G.N.P. than any advanced industrialized country,'' said Lee Bawden, a senior economist at the Urban Institute. ''That's the American way, but it's catching up with us on the homeless issue.'' Deeply ingrained in American attitudes is the distinction between the ''deserving'' and the ''undeserving'' poor. As the sociologist Daniel Bell put it in ''The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism'': ''The United States, so strongly individualist in temper, and so bourgeois in appetite, has never wholly mastered the art of collective solutions, or of readily accepting the idea of a public interest, as against private gain.''
Bell's analysis helps explain why private philanthropy developed its unique social-welfare niche in America, and why President Bush was just echoing tradition when he called on armies of volunteers to cope with homelessness. Despite an impressive response by thousands of local nonprofit groups, private exertions are clearly not the same thing as public policy, given the scale and complexity of homelessness. Moreover, unlike the elderly, the homeless have no constituency of children or Congressmen to give them voice; they don't even vote. Nor do the competing needs of education, health, drug control, deficit reduction or a crumbling infrastructure suggest that America's poor are about to cash in on any peace dividend. At H.U.D., for example, Anna Kondratas draws the line when asked whether higher Federal welfare payments for poor tenants might help stem homelessness: ''We can't have socialism for the poor and capitalism for the wealthy.''
Peter Rossi has estimated that in 1980 there were about 17 million ''extremely poor'' people in America; for a family of four, this meant an annual income of $4,396 or less - about half the Federal poverty line. Calculating further, he figures that with a rent bill of $200 a month, such a family would have been left with a daily budget of $1.50 to cover all other expenses. ''Given the increased size since 1980 of the extremely poor population,'' Rossi concludes, ''it is remarkable not that we have so many homeless people in America, but that we have so few.''

HEADLINE: Bryant Gumbel, Forecast for 'Today': Cloudy

BYLINE: By Bill Carter Bill Carter covers television for The Times

 BODY:
Richard Nixon is sitting stiffly cross-legged in an interview area on the set of ''Today,'' NBC's beleaguered morning news program, his hands clasped tightly in front of him, nervously staring straight ahead. Behind the cameras, where Nixon can't see him, Bryant Gumbel, the ''Today'' anchor, is waiting for the end of the newscast being read at the anchor desk. ''I can't sit down with him yet,'' Gumbel says. ''Nixon has a terrible stage whisper.'' Sure enough, in the closing seconds of the news, as Gumbel moves to take his place next to the former President, Nixon extends a hand enthusiastically and says, loud, ''Well, how are you?''
The two men know each other rather well. Gumbel has interviewed Nixon several times and has even been a guest for dinner at Nixon's home. In fact, when Nixon appeared on ''Today'' in 1982, it was at his own request - he wanted to meet Bryant Gumbel. ''It came from my days doing sports,'' Gumbel says. ''He loves to talk sports.'' 
Gumbel is totally relaxed and confident interviewing Nixon, but Bryant Gumbel has few moments in front of a camera when he isn't. Since his debut as a sportscaster for the NBC station in Los Angeles in 1972, he has become, perhaps, the network's most reliable and versatile on-camera presence. He's been host of ''Today'' - until recently, the top-rated news program in the 7 A.M. to 9 A.M. slot - for eight years, and has served as anchor for special events like the Olympics and reportorial projects like his series of interviews inside the Kremlin in 1984, for which he received the Overseas Press Club's Edward R. Murrow Award for outstanding foreign affairs reporting.
With his seamless elocution, assiduous preparation and astonishing memory for detail, Gumbel can speak cogently and off-the-cuff on virtually any subject - though he acknowledges a weakness in economics - and has a reputation for being unflappable, equally deft with a script or without, a man who can handle any broadcast crisis without flinching on the air. ''He's flawless,'' whispers Steve Tacon, one of the camera operators, as Gumbel talks with Nixon. ''He's the best interviewer, the best ad-libber I've ever seen.''
With Nixon, Gumbel consciously seeks to steer the interview toward personality, away from politics, looking not to rehash old sins but to find some new revelation of humanity. The effort is not entirely successful; Nixon, after all, is Nixon. But Gumbel leaves no doubt that the direction of this conversation, like all others he has on ''Today,'' is entirely in his hands. As Gumbel leans in to concentrate on Nixon's answers, his eyes shift almost imperceptibly toward the floor manager who is signaling to him how much time he has left; the interview finishes precisely to the second.
Later, Gumbel admits that his comfortable relationship with the former President, whom he considered ''the embodiment of evil'' during his college days, is ''a little bizarre.'' But one of his friends, Cliff Kappler, finds common ground. ''I think,'' says Kappler, who left the ''Today'' show as senior producer in January, ''that Richard Nixon has an affinity for tragic individuals. The fact that someone has become a victim partly because of his own words further endears him.'' Edging into hyperbole, Kappler explains:
''Bryant's memo became such a pervasive thing on the show. It became a larger-than-life situation. It became Watergate.''
More than a year has passed since the publication, in February 1989, of Bryant Gumbel's memo assessing the state of ''Today'' for the show's then-executive producer, Marty Ryan. Solicited by Ryan and written four months before it was leaked to the press, the memo criticized several of Gumbel's colleagues on the program, most notably Willard Scott, the popular weatherman. In blunt, specific and often profane language, it also analyzed the newscasts - ''when there's a ton of news they're five minutes long and when there's nothing going on they're 4:59!''; the political coverage - our ''first response too often is to round up the usual suspects''; celebrity interviews - ''put on celebs ONLY when they've something to say, not just cause they're in town.'' And it discussed dozens of other details generally left to news executives, not news anchors, all in the service of addressing what Gumbel later called the show's lack of ''spirit, creativity and sense of danger.'' ''One of the reasons I watch sports on television - and nothing else - is I like to be surprised,'' Gumbel says. ''It's the same with our show. While the viewer has to be comfortable, the viewer also has to be aware that something might go off here.''
That's an unorthodox view of morning television, which network executives typically see as a gentle wake-up call, their ''family'' joining yours before breakfast. In the NBC News division, Gumbel's memo sounded like a shrill alarm clock. ''Bryant can be a terribly driven taskmaster when it comes to that show,'' says Dick Ebersol, who subsequently joined NBC News as the senior vice president in charge of ''Today.'' He adds, ''The memo was the most insightful document ever written by a talent about the show he's involved in.''
But whether canny or cruel, all of Gumbel's insights were lost amid the outrage surrounding his vituperative comments about Scott, who Gumbel wrote was ''holding the show hostage to his assortment of whims, wishes, birthdays and bad taste.'' Since then, it has been a year of near-constant turmoil for ''Today,'' and most of the show's staff members trace the upheaval directly to fallout from the memo. So does Gumbel. ''I think one could draw a common line from the memo to the present and see everything spinning off it,'' he says.
Everything includes a new executive producer, director and senior producer, musical chairs in the newscaster position and, most disastrously, the departure of Gumbel's longtime on-air partner, Jane Pauley. Network executives say that though some viewers may have found Pauley's replacement, Deborah Norville, chilly and affected, the audience has unfairly held her responsible for breaking up the ''Today'' show family.
The end result: a ratings plunge that, in the last year, has cost NBC millions of viewers - and dollars. Since the spring of 1989, ''Today'' has lost more than 15 percent of its audience, relinquishing its position as the network morning leader to ABC's ''Good Morning, America.'' The toll has been most costly among the viewers advertisers most want to reach in the morning: younger women. One network sales executive says ''GMA's'' ascension has meant a daily six-figure income advantage over ''Today.''
The money alone would make morning television an area of intense competition. But tradition is also significant. ''Today,'' on the air since Jan. 14, 1952, established the mix of hard news, talk-show conviviality and entertainment coverage that defined morning television for an entire generation. ''Good Morning America'' didn't come along until 1975. It gradually won viewers with a softer, more celebrity-oriented approach, overtaking ''Today'' in early 1980. With Gumbel in the anchor slot, however, ''Today'' regained its leadership in December 1985, only to yield it in January of this year.
The main difference between the shows, now as always, is the place they come from. ''Today'' remains a product of NBC News. ''GMA'' is produced by ABC's entertainment division. ''CBS This Morning,'' perennially bottom-rated and traditionally considered the hardest news program of the three, has deliberately set out to soften that image - with some success, so far mostly at the expense of ''Today.''
Since the loss of Pauley, ''Today'' has struggled to find any sort of consistency - it's ''underperforming,'' in Gumbel's phrase. Where it once stood out as the best morning choice for the well-read, thinking person, the show has lately risen to that level only occasionally, usually when Gumbel himself has something substantive to do, such as the Washington-based interviews he conducted during the summit nearly two weeks ago. Otherwise, the pace and the energy elements of the show that arise from the interaction of the regular cast members and various correspondents - have been off, sometimes jarringly. Norville, though clearly not without talent, has looked uneasy and, at times, even tired. The result is that for months, ''Today'' has been a program all too obviously in transition.
The turbulence has left its mark on Gumbel, who spent most of the year reading press accounts of his responsibility for the ''Today'' show mess - and saying nothing, though he was urged by the network to speak out in his own defense. ''In retrospect, it was a poor choice of words,'' Gumbel says now, of the infamous memo. ''Probably writing it was a poor choice of action. It hurt both Willard and me.''
Gumbel knows that the available explanations - that the memo was solicited and intended to be private, that it even stated that the comments needed to be guarded because those named could be hurt - won't wash at this point. ''I've never run away from the thing,'' he says. ''I wrote it, plain and simple. I'm guilty.'' Indeed, some ''Today'' staff members say he is guilty of more than that. It is Gumbel, they say, who holds the show, if not hostage to, at least in the custody of his passions, pastimes and preferences. Beginning in the mid-1980's, ''Today'' took on a tone of smart - critics say smug - buttoned-down aggressiveness, clearly a reflection of the anchor's personality. The show began to be produced more frequently outside of the studio, and became less scripted and faster paced, all of which took advantage of Gumbel's nimbleness. At the same time, Gumbel's ideas for interviews and features began to be acted upon by producers more frequently. By now, they're rarely ignored. The show's distinct sports bent is certainly a concession to one of Gumbel's intense personal interests. He always rewrites the features prepared for him, so he sounds on videotape the way he does live - glib, facile, but fond of formal, slightly archaic phrases such as ''if truth be known,'' or ''I daresay.'' The writer-producer Allison Davis says: ''He puts everything into Gumbelese.''
As a result, there are those who would assign him the works: the forcing out of Ryan, once a close friend, as executive producer; the recruitment, initially as a newscaster, of Norville, a 31-year-old news reader who'd been making her mark on the even-earlier morning program ''Sunrise'', and finally the loss of Pauley. Others see assigning him blame for every negative event of the last year as more Gumbel-bashing, a sport that has grown more popular, both inside and outside NBC, in the last two years.
In one scenario, outlined by two longtime NBC News staff members, Gumbel skipped Pauley in his otherwise comprehensive memo (Gumbel says he was not asked to comment on her) only because he had long since ''given up on Jane.'' He urged the hiring of Norville to ''give Jane a jolt''; manipulated the hiring of his friend Ebersol as senior vice president of ''Today'' in order to have an operative in high places, and engineered the ouster of Marty Ryan because he decided the executive producer was weak and ineffective.
Gumbel expects the shots. ''I'm still there and I'm the guy in charge,'' he says. He rarely takes the easy way out - going for the simple denial - in answering any accusation. Instead, he adheres to a kind of personal code that will not allow him to, as he puts it, ''court somebody else's opinion.'' The result is answers that can sometimes leave the doubts hanging.
''Nobody thought it was a bad move,'' he says, about the decision to bring in Norville. ''You had to see it as an opportunity to upgrade what you've got.'' Had he thought there was a need to re-energize Jane? ''Not really,'' he says, adding, with no apparent concern for how the words might sound: ''You stand next to the way I do things and whoever you put in there is going to look a little like they're moving in slow motion.''
Gumbel is completely up front about Marty Ryan, with whom he was ''very, very close,'' but whom he felt could not muster the authority to run the show the way Gumbel thought it ought to be run. ''Marty was at the heart of everything I talked about in the memo,'' Gumbel says. ''As it turned out, Marty was an excellent senior producer, not an excellent executive producer.'' (Ryan, citing an agreement with NBC, would not comment for this article.) Certainly the memo fiasco lingered and festered far longer than most television catastrophes, gaining fuel from the program's subsequent crises, especially the changeover from Pauley to Norville.
But Gumbel has apparently survived it all. In the last month, the network has moved to rebuild the show around him, reducing Norville's role in the face not only of audience resentment of her - however unfair - but also some real doubts among the NBC hierarchy that she is up to the job.
In early May, facing a certain outcry over the Norville-for-Pauley switch from managers of affiliated stations at the annual June meeting, NBC executives were seriously considering removing Norville from the show - even though they realized such a move would only add to the appearance of a program in chaos.
As least part of Norville's problem, as described by NBC executives, is her inability to play well off Gumbel's lead, one of Jane Pauley's special talents. There is also a feeling that Norville does not accept advice very willingly. ''She just doesn't get it,'' one executive says.
Eventually, a less drastic strategy was devised. As a means of dimming the spotlight on Norville, the network decided to usher in additional cast members - Faith Daniels from CBS as the newscaster, Katherine Couric from NBC's Washington bureau as a national correspondent, and from out of the program's happier history, Joe Garagiola, to share the co-anchor chores with Norville.
In this revamped format - scheduled to be unveiled tomorrow - Gumbel's place is apparently even more elevated. Eventually, the show will be getting a new set and most likely a new rhythm; it will be up to Gumbel to orchestrate the parts played by the new people, giving Norville enough to say to deflect any conclusion that she's being phased out, while balancing the contributions from the other two women so they are not seen as new ''threats'' by those who perceive rivalry and scheming any time more than one woman gets an important role in a television program.
To help out, Gumbel will get Garagiola, a man he describes as his ''very, very good friend'' as a partner for on-air bonhomie, an element the show has been lacking since Pauley's departure and the estrangement of Willard Scott, who decided to do his weather forecasts almost exclusively outside the studio, far away from Bryant Gumbel.
Given the damage inflicted on the anchor's image over the last year (an executive with a rival morning program still calls Gumbel ''our secret weapon''), the moves to shore up the structure under Gumbel amount to a reaffirmation of the network's commitment to him, in spite of the protests of some affiliates who blame Gumbel for their recent losses. (Fifty percent of ''Today's'' commercials are sold by local stations.) ''If he were a less talented person than he is, it would have been all over,'' says Robert C. Wright, the president of NBC. ''But he's such a horse. He's got the ability to come back.''
Under the strikingly elegant suits he wears, Gumbel, now 41, looks bulky and powerful. He carries himself with grace. His smile can be dazzling. But what comes through instantly when he enters a room is aggressiveness; sitting down to chat, Gumbel, who drinks Diet Cokes by the six-pack daily, pops open a can and thrusts it whole into a large glass mug, then lets go as soda rushes down all at once.
''Do I like what people have said about me in the last two years?'' he says. ''Absolutely not. But in order to change that, if I've got to dislike who I look at in the mirror, it's not even close. I'll be damned if I'm going to do anything that forces me to look back and say, 'Ugh.' ''
One of Gumbel's NBC friends calls him a ''compulsive winner.'' Gumbel certainly puts an emphasis on winning. He competes ferociously in everything from rotisserie baseball to weekend golf. ''I'm not necessarily sure there's great fun in finishing second,'' he says.
He prepares obsessively for each ''Today.'' Everyone comments on his work ethic. ''A preparedness freak,'' a friend calls him. He consumes newspapers and magazines, as well as the daily stacks of material presented to him by segment producers. Most of the time, for interviews with authors, he actually reads the books. ''This is a host who doesn't just read the jacket,'' says Gene Shalit, the ''Today'' movie critic. (''I think he appreciates the fact I do read his books,'' Gumbel says of Richard Nixon.) He's a history buff and, obviously, a sports nut. That manic drive to collect information, combined with his remarkable capacity to retain it, creates the ever-present possibility of spontaneity on the air.
''With Bryant there is always an element of danger,'' says Jane Pauley, who sat next to Gumbel every morning for eight years and appreciated the on-air challenges, the questions or insights he tossed at her unexpectedly. ''My tendency is to protect the personal side. Bryant forced me to draw myself in broader strokes than I would have otherwise.''
But where Pauley considers Gumbel's aggressive nature as a positive trait, others see it differently, citing the impossible demands that he puts on people; hostility, especially toward women (Pauley once called him a Neanderthal, though she now says, ''I saw the vulnerable side''); aloofness, and - most commonly, arrogance.
Gumbel does not entirely shrink from those characterizations. One former NBC News executive says: ''He has tremendous contempt for women. You can see it, feel it in everything he does.'' Not true, Gumbel says, though he confesses to being a ''guy's guy. I like the humor of guys. I like guys' conversations.'' Some of the accusations, he says, come from misinterpretations of ''all the teasing I do of the girls around here.''
Aloofness? Gumbel says he believes some people find him icily mechanical because he does what he does so effortlessly. As he describes the attitude: '' 'It looks like he's not trying, and if it's so damn easy how come they're paying him all this money?' ''
Some of the reaction to Gumbel flows naturally from his unwillingness to compromise. He admits, if not to arrogance, to the ''terrible sin'' of hubris. But his fall from public grace has been accelerated by other factors. The turning point in Bryant Gumbel's image did not come at the time of the memo, in fact, but six months earlier. Just prior to his marathon work as NBC's main studio host for the 1988 Olympics from Seoul, Gumbel was the subject of a profile in Sports Illustrated, which, while acknowledging his prodigious television talents, painted him as a size triple-E egoist, who had committed the unpardonable offense of being insensitive and even cruel to his mother.
Before that article, most assessments of Bryant Gumbel were admiring. After it, almost none have been. He and many of his closest friends feel the Sports Illustrated piece was destructively unfair. ''The real tragedy is I love my mother; my mother and I are very close,'' he says. ''To say that piece was twisted is putting it mildly. After she read the piece, my mother broke down crying.'' But Gumbel never wrote a letter to the magazine to protest what he saw as inaccuracies or distortions, nor did he ever say a word to the writer. ''I can't see running around saying, 'No, I didn't do this. I didn't hit a dog today,' '' he says. ''If people are really going to judge me by that, maybe their opinion isn't really worth it.''
He credits his parents with instilling in him that kind of self-esteem, adding, ''If truth be known, probably a lot of it is racial.''
It is characteristic of Gumbel's refusal to think defensively that never, in the midst of all the criticism directed at him, has he suggested it might have something to do with race. Some of his friends certainly have.
''How far is it from the word 'arrogant' to the word 'uppity'?'' says one NBC News executive.
Gumbel says, ''I think it means a lot when you're black to succeed and be accepted on your own terms.'' Certainly he has been fully accepted as a television personality, and that was not a certainty when he started on ''Today.'' Steve Friedman, the executive producer at the time (and now the executive producer of NBC Nightly News), remembers that Gumbel was subjected to an unstated scrutiny: ''Can a black man sit next to a white woman on television and work?'' By now, the fact that he is black is rarely even mentioned - an achievement all by itself.
''Does it color the way I do things?'' Gumbel says. ''I suspect not.'' But as Robert Squier, a political commentator for ''Today'' points out, ''most black professionals, entertainers, writers, if they're going to get a break in being seen by a wider audience, they get it on 'Today,' because of Gumbel.''
The writer-producer Allison Davis, who is also black, notes that Gumbel does many subtle things on the air to help change images. One example, she says: ''Bryant Gumbel does not say 'Black Monday' when talking about the stock market. He's constantly qualifying and looking at stories where the issue of race may or may not be germane.'' GUMBEL WAS BORN INJU 1948 in New Orleans and grew up in Chicago, where his world was defined by city life, sports in the park with his older brother Greg (now a sportscaster with CBS) and trips to Wrigley Field. The Gumbel family - Bryant has two sisters as well - lived in a racially mixed neighborhood near the University of Chicago, attending Catholic parochial schools. Gumbel was once an altar boy for the Rev. Andrew Greeley, now the best-selling author (and frequent guest on ''Today''). At Bates College in Maine, which he chose because it was certain to be a completely different experience from an urban Chicago high school, he majored in Russian history.
After college, Gumbel briefly took a sales job in New York at an industrial paper company, then decided to try some freelance sports writing, ending up at a now-defunct magazine called Black Sports. He had already quit that job and was prepared to join The Baltimore Sun when his father suddenly died of a heart attack in 1972.
Gumbel's admiration of his father has been the subject of some amateur psychoanalysis, notably in the Sports Illustrated profile. But Gumbel more or less invites it. ''I always tried to please my father,'' he admits. Richard Gumbel, who put himself through college and law school while working two jobs to feed his young family, and went on to become a Chicago judge, set a standard daunting to be measured against - and colleagues say Gumbel does measure people against it, especially himself.
In the months following Richard Gumbel's death, his son's life abruptly shifted in its ultimate direction. Before he ever got to Baltimore, Gumbel, then 23, was hired by KNBC-TV in Los Angeles to be its weekend sportscaster. And the following year he married June Baranco, whom he'd met during a college break on a blind date set up by his brother.
Gumbel acknowledges that the job offer likely sprang from the station's need for a black on-air presence. But his ability emerged instantly. The station, conceding the inevitable slip-ups on the air and anticipating barbs from the press like ''Fumble-Gumbel'' or ''Stumble-Gumbel,'' asked him to change his name. It's not likely that Gumbel would ever have considered it anyway, but the concern turned out to be absurd. The nickname actually got turned around: ''Never-Fumble Gumbel.''
Almost overnight, Gumbel was broadcasting sports news better than anyone in the country. When the Dodgers played in the 1974 World Series and Gumbel showed up to do his local sports reports, network executives took one look at the chubby kid with the enormous Afro doing his stand-ups on the field with breathtaking precision and started asking for his agent's phone number.
Network assignments followed, first as a co-host of a weekend sports show called ''Grandstand,'' eventually as the host for every important NBC Sports event. When NBC began contemplating how to replace Tom Brokaw on ''Today,'' Gumbel was already on the show three times a week doing sports reports. On Jan. 4, 1982, Gumbel joined the show as part of a troika with Pauley and the newsman Chris Wallace. Within eight months, Wallace was gone and Gumbel had vaulted past Pauley as the main host of the program.
As anchor, gumbel says it is his role to step in when the show seems to be drifting. ''Do I have a certain input? Yes. Am I driving the car? No. I may make a comment from the back seat: 'We're going awful slow.' But it's my car!'' But after a year of costly upheaval, the question raised by many inside NBC, including some strong defenders of Gumbel, is whether his zeal in pushing the show forward did not, directly or indirectly, lead to its being pushed over the edge.
One incident in particular stands out - a meeting Gumbel called in January 1989 - after he'd written the memo but before it had been made public. As he himself describes that meeting: ''It wasn't a let's-take-a-vote democracy. It was certainly one-sided.'' From his point of view, the pep talk had the desired effect. The show became ''energized,'' he says. But he adds that it may have created some vengeful ill will. ''Do I think it was coincidental that the memo came out about the same time? No, I don't.''
Gumbel's defenders say that his dressing down of the staff amounted to his seizing the authority to resuscitate the show, and that it was a necessary move because the senior management of NBC News was unwilling or unable to do so. According to one NBC executive, the entire series of disasters, particularly the Pauley-out/Norville-in fiasco, was tied to Gumbel's frustration with the NBC News president Michael G. Gartner. ''Everything that happened was tied to the fact that a news show could not be dealt with by the president of the news division,'' the executive says.
Both Gumbel and Gartner acknowledge that their relationship was strained. And in the fury that arose after the memo, Gumbel felt completely betrayed. ''I didn't feel there was a proper expression of support from the executive side,'' Gumbel says. ''It started from there and deteriorated.''
Last July, Dick Ebersol, who was already president of NBC Sports, was named to the executive position in charge of ''Today,'' and the move had the immediate effect of creating a desperately needed bridge between Gumbel and Gartner. After an exchange of memos with Gartner that Gumbel describes as ''acrimonious,'' Ebersol stepped in to set up a meeting between the two men. Gumbel was not impressed with Gartner's explanations of why NBC had chosen to respond to the memo controversy with a press statement and nothing much else, but the meeting helped the men find a means of communication. Now they both say they have a respectful relationship.
It was Dick Ebersol, along with Gartner, who concluded last summer that though ''Today'' was still top-rated, it needed repairs. ''It was certainly cracked,'' Gartner says. NBC's concerns focused on the makeup of the show's audience: too many younger women were watching ''Good Morning America.''
The answer they came up with was Deborah Norville; and the ultimate result was the departure of Jane Pauley. Ebersol wound up publicly taking the blame for the decision to bring on Norville, and left the show last month.
''I miss Jane,'' Gumbel says, with a bit of a faraway look in his eye, but even longtime co-workers say that Gumbel's true feelings about Pauley are hard to read. Everyone agrees they respected each other, but were not unusually close.
''Jane was the stabilizing force on Bryant; he still needs that,'' says one veteran production executive. The coming of Joe Garagiola, a kindred sports spirit, is seen by many as an attempt to bring back some of that stability.
What can't be solved by Garagiola, however, is a lingering feeling among some viewers (and former viewers) that Gumbel did not intervene to keep Jane Pauley right where she was, right where they liked her. Even the day of Pauley's departure left some viewers dissatisfied with Gumbel, wondering why he said goodbye with only, ''You know how I feel, Jane.''
Pauley says she hadn't expected Gumbel to intervene. As to his undemonstrative goodbye, Gumbel says he'd planned to say something meaningful but simply ran out of time. ''That was just Bryant,'' Pauley says. ''I probably knew what he meant. I'm not 100 percent sure, but I think I know.'' Then she adds, ''What none of the viewers saw was how his hands were shaking.''
Gumbel says he never takes his work problems home. ''Home is a place for him to really relax,'' June Gumbel says. ''I want him to live a long time. I don't want to stress him out.'' And while he has been known to say that staying married is a challenge - ''And June would say it's not a picnic at certain times''; ''It has its ups and downs,'' she says - he talks often of their family life, with their two children, Bradley, 11, and Jillian, 7. In one of his typical memory tricks, Gumbel can cite the exact number of days he and June have been married any time he's asked. The family lives during the week in a Manhattan apartment and on the weekends at an eight-acre home in Westchester, trying, Gumbel says, to live as normal a family life as possible, under the circumstances.
As for ''Today,'' even in the most roiling moments during the last year, its survival was never in doubt. As Steve Friedman puts it, ''The 'Today' show is like Kleenex and Jell-O. It's the brand name. You do your job well and it works.''
That brand-name status makes the show's importance - both to the network and its affiliated stations - enormous. ''The station managers regard it as joint ownership with NBC,'' says the network president, Robert Wright. ''It goes beyond any entertainment show.''
What convinced the NBC hierarchy - if not all its affiliates - to keep Gumbel in place at ''Today'' was nothing more than his talent, which even his sternest detractors concede. One senior executive at a competing network says: ''Even with all the baggage, if he became available, we'd have to go after him.''
Gumbel has a little more than a year remaining on a three-year contract, a deal that pays him more than $2 million annually. He is not talking about signing a new contract with NBC yet, but he now says, ''I have every intention of seeing this show win again.''
Michael Gartner, whose opinion of Gumbel has risen over the last several months, says the network needs to ''keep playing to his strengths - and trying to humanize him a little more.'' It was partly the humanizing motivation that led to Gumbel's work as host of NBC Sports' golf coverage this year - that, and Gumbel's passion for the sport. No one yet is talking about what role, if any, Gumbel might play in NBC's coverage of the 1992 Olympics from Barcelona. For one thing, that would be after his current contract runs out. Still, with Dick Ebersol running the NBC Sports division, the odds favor important participation by Bryant Gumbel.

 BODY:
It was a nice touch that our more important clients appreciated, and one that didn't cost us anything,'' an executive at a New York bank recalls. He is bemoaning the fact that his bank can no longer offer a guaranteed supply of crisp, new bills as part of its check-cashing services. 
Some tellers consider clean money a nuisance: the bills often stick together, creating a potential for costly mistakes behind bank counters. But automated teller machines love fresh lucre; many of the machines - and almost all dollar-bill changers - cannot handle dirty or wrinkled money. Thus much of the supply of pristine bills is being channeled to machines. Therein lies just part of the problem.
The other factor is a phenomenon economists refer to as ''velocity'' and that is attributable to rising prices. Dollar bills and fives are being circulated more rapidly than ever before and, consequently, are wearing out faster.
The Federal Reserve Banks that distribute paper currency to local banks are hard put to accommodate requests for crisp bills, ''because the demand is so great,'' says an officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
''Secretary of State Baker left the Treasury in August of 1988,'' the Fed officer explains, ''and now, less than two years later, very few dollar bills carry his signature.'' He predicts that the average dollar bill bearing Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's name will be in circulation for only about 18 months.
No wonder the Washington-based Coin Coalition is lobbying to bring back dollar coins. ''A coin costs 3.5 cents to make and lasts about 20 years,'' says James C. Benfield of the coalition. Indeed, Canada has almost completely converted from paper dollars to the one-dollar coin -nicknamed, for the engraving on its flip side, the ''Loon.''

HEADLINE: AT MERRILL, A FRUSTRATING HUNT FOR PROFIT

BYLINE: By ELLYN E. SPRAGINS; Ellyn E. Spragins, a columnist for Inc. magazine, writes about business from Maplewood, N.J.

 BODY:
As their limousines streamed toward Arizona's CamelbacK Mountain on a Friday in February, en route to Merrill Lynch & Company's junk bond conference, few of the 800 guests could have missed the various ironies surrounding the event. For one thing, there was the conspicuously lavish site of the conference, a 130-acre spread called the Phoenician Resort; it seemed strikingly at odds with an announcement just 12 days earlier that Merrill had taken a $470 million writedown during the fourth quarter of 1989. Then there was the curious fact that this flashy celebration of junk bonds was taking place just as the red-hot market for the high-yield securities was flaming out. And finally, there was a sense of deja vu, as Merrill's C.E.O., William A. Schreyer, announced, ''We aim to become No. 1 in the high-yield market.'' Not many months before, he had shut down businesses in New York and London for which he had once proclaimed a similiar goal. 
For The Thundering Herd, it is not the best of times. Merrill lost money in 1989, the first such blot on its 105-year ledger. Since 1987, special charges, writedowns and one-time losses have totaled more than $1 billion, nearly a third of the firm's current net worth. The public perception of the company is reflected in its stock price, which as of a month ago was trading at about $21 a 42 percent drop from its 52-week high of $36. Some indication of the industry's attitude can be found in the decision by Moody's Investors Service to downgrade Merrill's long-term debt ratings and in the comments about top management by analysts like Lawrence W. Eckenfelder, of Prudential-Bache Securities: ''We know they've not been successful with this firm. The question is, do they have what it takes to turn it around?''
Merrill is far from being alone in its problems. Wall Street has been battered by the end of the seven-year bull market and the dramatic slow-down in investment banking. Kidder, Peabody & Company and Prudential-Bache joined Merrill in the red last year. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Merrill's chief rival, announced a first quarter loss of $915 million. Drexel Burnham Lambert, whose junk-bond conferences could have been a model for Merrill's extravaganza in Arizona, is bankrupt. As Schreyer suggests, his company has done well to emerge from the 80's with its independence and its integrity intact. In Merrill's 32d-floor executive offices at New York's World Financial Center, ''We're a survivor'' is a frequent refrain.
Schreyer has battened down the hatches. With the end of his tenure approaching - he will be 65 in 1993 - he has taken to proclaiming that profitability should take precedence over market share. A tough cost-restructuring campaign - Schreyer calls it ''Merristroika'' - has helped the firm to an 11 percent increase in first-quarter earnings over a year earlier. Strategies are in place for all of the dozens of pieces of this huge enterprise, whose 10,050 brokers and 700 investment bankers are No. 1 in so many segments of the industry, from selling stocks to underwriting. Beginning in 1991 or 1992, Schreyer says, ''we'll have a return on equity of 15 percent, minimum; in better years, I can see 20 percent. It all boils down to execution, to people, to getting the results.'' And yet . . . .
And yet the record of the six years since Bill Schreyer became chief executive is so uneven and so puzzling that many Wall Street analysts and industry leaders remain unconvinced that Merrill can achieve such results. During that time the stock market raged, the bond market surged, debt issuance exploded, corporate mergers soared - and Merrill's revenues ballooned, from $5.7 billion in 1983 to $11.3 billion last year. But profits languished. As measured by several analysts, Merrill's return on average equity between 1985 and 1989 lagged substantially behind its peers.
During those years, Merrill suffered through some remarkable blunders. Unanticipated expenses involving the firm's new headquarters at the World Financial Center accounted for about $110 million of the $470 million writedown. Merrill lost $377 million while trading mortgage-backed securities. A grandly ambitious effort to establish an international presence proved costly. Veterans of the London campaign estimate that during 1987 and 1988, alone, Merrill's operation there lost an estimated $100 million; the company's estimate is $30 to $40 million.
What is Merrill's problem? In conversations with dozens of present and former employees, the same answers emerged again and again. They pointed to Schreyer's insistence that Merrill be the biggest factor in all of its markets - a go-for-broke mentality that tends to overwhelm cost controls and profits. They also talked of a hierarchy of like-minded executives who look out for each other, with the result that key assignments too often go to unqualified people. (''Merrill is like an orchestra made up of the best violinist, the best cellist, the best on every instrument,'' says a former senior executive. ''You've got to make them play together. Merrill's way is to get somebody who has never conducted before - or someone who's tone deaf.'') Under Schreyer, Merrill has split its securities business into two sectors. Consumer Markets encompasses the brokerage business - where Merrill has for generations been the nation's leader - and a host of financial products for the consumer, including cash management accounts, mutual funds and insurance. Capital Markets, a more recent Merrill business, covers a broad range of investment banking activities. But the company is run primarily by men whose ideas and attitudes toward business have been shaped by decades as brokers, thereby frustrating some of the bankers. Asked to explain why Schreyer and President Daniel P. Tully have not produced better bottom-line results, a former international banker at Merrill responds, ''The simple reasons are 1, 2, 3 - they don't understand the business. They're stock brokers.'' Says Dean Eberling, an analyst at Shearson, ''Management has a way to go.''
Still, Bill Schreyer was all confidence as he faced some of his more vocal critics last April at the annual shareholders' meeting. The setting was the sprawling headquarters and training center of the Consumer Markets sector in Plainsboro, N.J. Schreyer often works out of a wood-paneled office here, not far from his home in Princeton.
Balding, round-faced, a bit pudgy, Schreyer stood in the pit of the amphitheater, a pair of half-glasses perched on his nose. He had the master salesman's engaging grin and gregarious, folksy manner, and he worked hard to win over his audience. At one point, a particularly pugnacious stockholder asked the chairman about a $160 million writedown of Merrill's high-yield bond portfolio: ''The junk bond markets - shouldn't you take a hard-nosed attitude toward these? Unless you like living where Mike Milken's going to be living, which, judging from the country club surroundings here, I'd say you wouldn't.''
Schreyer, deadpan, responded, ''I think you're quite right about that,'' stirring laughter throughout the auditorium. Then he went on to present a serious answer. It included his rationale for pursuing the junk bond market - the expectation that the high-yield instruments would eventually play an important role in the restructuring, the so-called ''re-equification,'' of companies burdened with massive debt.
''There is junk and there is garbage,'' Schreyer said. ''The idea is to avoid the garbage. Our challenge is to work with companies to re-equify and rebuild.'' And then he spoke the rallying cry that has echoed all through his reign at Merrill: ''We want to be the leader.''
Thomas H. Patrick stands framed in the 12-foot-tall window of his office in the World Financial Center. Last year, Schreyer called Patrick in from Merrill's Chicago office to become the firm's chief financial officer. On this day in March, the 46-year-old, barrel-chested C.F.O. is talking about his company's struggle for profits: ''It's a simple story - you're standing in it. If we had stayed in the same building, we would be making more money than anybody on Wall Street.''
In 1984, Merrill's New York-based operations were feeling growing pains. The staff worked in 11 offices scattered around lower Manhattan. The headquarters building at One Liberty Plaza was overcrowded, especially on the trading floor. ''We literally could not route another cable to the trading floor,'' recalls Herbert M. Allison Jr., executive vice president for administration. What's more, there were projections that the firm's Manhattan head count would be increasing by 13 percent a year. But beyond such practical considerations, a senior Merrill executive says, the company longed for ''a focal point for a new global firm that has come of age. Those are hard things to get a bookkeeping hand on, but they are Schreyerlike concerns.''
A key figure in the search for a new home was Charles M. Manzella, a former branch manager with no background in commercial real estate, and he ended up talking with Olympia & York. The big Toronto-based developer was planning to construct an office complex of four towers in lower Manhattan to be called the World Financial Center. In August 1984, Merrill signed a 25-year lease on two of the towers, also receiving an option to buy a 49 percent equity interest in each. The rent would be $28.56 per square foot for the first 15 years and $40 per square foot for the next 10 years. The firm also agreed to sell One Liberty Plaza, which it had bought for about $100 million, to Olympia & York for some $375 million. In addition, Olympia & York agreed to take over a number of Merrill's lease commitments at other locations. The sale of One Liberty enabled Merrill to book a pretax gain of $127 million. Without it, the firm would have had an operating loss of $57 million for the year.
Before the deal could be completed, Merrill's board of directors had to approve. According to a Merrill spokesman, the board received an estimate of $30 to $40 per square foot for ''fit-out'' costs. These expenses included some of the basics: heating, ventilation and electrical systems as well as studs, walls and ceilings. The board approved the plan.
In 1985, an outside firm gave Merrill very different projections of the fit-out costs. The figure for the North Tower, where Merrill's three deluxe trading floors are housed, was approximately $200 a square foot. Finishing the South Tower, it was estimated, would cost $137 a square foot. All told, by mid-1985, the fit-out of the two towers looked as though it might cost the firm more than $600 million. According to a Merrill spokesman, these projections included expenses that are not normally counted as fit-out.
In September of that year, an ad hoc group of Merrill executives, including some from the real estate finance department, made a presentation to the executive committee of the board. They proposed that Merrill could save money by simultaneously selling the South Tower lease back to Olympia & York and buying back and renovating One Liberty Plaza. An executive vice president responsible for facilities planning issued a memo authorizing new negotiations with Olympia & York, according to executives who received the document, but the idea died. A Merrill spokesman denies that new negotiations were authorized.
In 1986, Merrill had a change of heart and started looking for a tenant to sublet more than 1 million square feet, about half, of the unfinished South Tower. The area, scheduled to house back-office workers, had been judged too expensive. The search for a tenant did not end until September 1987, just as Merrill executives were moving into the North Tower. Olympia & York sublet 600,000 square feet of the space for 25 years and bought Merrill's option on the 49 percent equity interest. The sale enabled Merrill to book a pretax $120.2 million gain for 1987, which came in handy. It offset nearly a third of a $377 million trading loss earlier in the year. But under the sublease, Merrill would have to continue leasing locations in Manhattan, including space in One Liberty Plaza - now owned by Olympia & York.
Merrill is still trying to sublet 420,000 square feet of the South Tower in a dismal market. Some $220 million of Merrill's $470 million writedown last year was related to excess office space, most of it in lower Manhattan and overseas. About half of that is specifically tied to those nine floors still unrented. In addition, the managerial misjudgments involving the World Financial Center have steadily punished Merrill's bottom line. Occupancy and depreciation costs for the firm as a whole have soared over the last five years from $325.8 million to $774.8 million.
In 1936, when Schreyer was 8 years old, his father, also named William, became manager of the Williamsport, Pa., office of one of Merrill's predecessor firms. Eventually, the father's 16-year career at Merrill enabled him to repay family debts accumulated during the Depression; the last debt was discharged just before his death of a heart attack at the age of 53. A deep affection tinges Schreyer's voice as he remembers his father: ''I could talk about him for hours.'' He commissioned a painting of his father that hangs in his New Jersey office; when Schreyer posed for a photograph for this article, he wore a brown suit to match the suit his father wears in the portrait.
For both generations of Schreyers, Merrill has been much more than a meal ticket. ''There was Mommy and Daddy and Merrill,'' says Charles D. Peebler Jr., chief executive officer of Merrill's advertising agency, Bozell, and a longtime friend. ''I don't know what Bill Schreyer is without Merrill.''
While still in high school, Schreyer sometimes helped out in his father's office - and wrote his senior class theme about the New York Stock Exchange. He graduated from Pennsylvania State University, with a B.A. in business administration, and joined Merrill in 1948 at the age of 20.
The firm was still fresh from the blueprint that Charles E. Merrill and Winthrop H. Smith had drawn up eight years earlier when they merged Merrill Lynch & Company with E. A. Pierce & Company. Chief among their goals was to establish a reputation for scrupulous honesty. Nothing less, they felt, would gain the confidence of Main Street investors in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash and the Depression.
The firm's business guidelines, dubbed ''The Ten Commandments,'' led off with: ''The interests of our customers MUST come first.'' And that included all customers, big and small. Schreyer remembers having the commandments drilled into his head, and today's recruits are still expected to learn them. Bill Schreyer was ready for the discipline, ready to be part of the team. Merrill was the kind of place with which bright, hard-working young men were proud to identify. Says Schreyer: ''If you took a group of I.B.M. salesmen and Merrill Lynch brokers and mixed them up, you couldn't tell one from the other. Their principles were so similiar. When people came with Merrill Lynch in those days, they never thought about going anywhere else.''
While Schreyer worked his way up through the branch system, Donald T. Regan, with Harvard and the Marine Corps behind him, was ascending Merrill's management ranks. He became C.E.O. in 1971, in time to prepare Merrill for the consequences of May Day, 1975, when the Government abolished fixed commissions on stock sales, sparking cut-throat competition in the brokerage business. The changes wrought by the iron-willed chairman are still felt at Merrill and through the industry.
Regan fathered the Cash Management Account, or C.M.A., which combined the characteristics of a debit card, money market checking account and brokerage account. He also led Merrill on its first major diversification drive. He envisioned the company as a ''three-legged stool'' supported by businesses in the securities, insurance and real estate industries. Merrill would offer customers one-stop shopping for all their financial needs, and relieve the company's dependence on the cyclical brokerage business. To establish the investment banking division, Regan tapped Schreyer, who had run the Government securities business and the New York branches, a very visible post. The division, later to be Capital Markets, encompassed underwriting, mergers and acquisition services and institutional sales, trading and research; it did not achieve critical mass until 1978 when Merrill acquired the old-line investment banking firm of White, Weld & Company.
Still, retail commissions continued to provide the lion's share of Merrill's revenues, and the brokers' expansive outlook prevailed: As long as the commissions kept rolling in, financial controls could take a back seat.
A few months ago, in the chairman's private dining room, which has a flawless view of the Statue of Liberty, Daniel P. Tully, Merrill's president, and Schreyer shared a hearty laugh, as they recalled what it was like in the old days.
Tully, a 58-year-old salesman's salesman, tall and amiable, sets the scene: the managers of Merrill's business units sitting around the boardroom table. ''The question would be, 'Well, Bill, how's your business doing?' And Bill would say, 'Great, we're going to make $10 million.' And then the next guy would say his business was doing great, too; it was going to make $12 million. Well, guess what? By the time we finished going around the table the numbers weren't anywhere near what the firm was actually making.''
In 1981, Roger E. Birk, who had come up through the operations side of the business, succeeded Regan, who became Secretary of the Treasury. Schreyer was named C.E.O. three years later. By that time, the costs of Merrill's expansion into real estate, capital markets and insurance had mounted dramatically.
Don Regan had eased Merrill's brokers into the brave new world of financial services; Bill Schreyer accelerated the process. The time had passed when a broker could spend his day simply dispensing market wisdom (mostly provided by his research department) and booking buy-and-sell orders. Brokers were to be known as ''financial consultants,'' and they were expected to learn how to sell the new products, including life insurance and mutual funds, into which Schreyer was pouring Merrill's money.
Like the Cash Management Account, these products were intended to lure the customer into putting all his money under Merrill's care, enabling the brokerage to obtain a steady stream of fees. Individually, the fees were small, compared to the commissions a bull market could generate, but discount brokers had cut commission margins to the bone. And when a firm has $334 billion of its customers' money under its roof - nearly double that of its nearest competitor - the fees add up.
The old-fashioned customer's man had trouble adapting to the asset-management strategy, and Merrill is still developing approaches to cope with this problem. The selling skills and knowledge a broker needs in daily contact with customers are very different from those called on to book a single order for a life insurance policy or to persuade a customer to set up a trust. ''I think it's very difficult to be good at all these areas at once,'' says Ronald E. Vioni, a veteran Merrill broker. The company has adjusted its hiring and training policies to develop a cadre of new-look brokers, and has dispatched 200 so-called ''specialists'' to the branches to help sell the non-securities products.
Today, with the investment banking business in the doldrums, Schreyer and Tully are counting on Consumer Markets chieftain John L. (''Launny'') Steffens to help them make good on their profitability promises. Steffens, a 48-year-old Dartmouth grad, has spent 27 years at Merrill. An excitable leader, he has more than once had heated disagreements with Merrill investment bankers over how his people will distribute products crafted by Capital Markets. And he flushes at the suggestion that Merrill's retail sector has not been as profitable as its investment banking sector in recent years. ''Our return on equity is very good, and would compare quite favorably to Capital Markets,'' he says.
Merrill's investment bankers tend to be skeptical. ''Even if we have a home-run year,'' one says, ''if the brokerage business continues to lose money, we can't make any money.'' But many analysts believe the retail side of Merrill was very profitable last year. Commission revenue was $1.8 billion, below its peak of $2.4 billion in 1987. From 1987 to 1989, asset management and custodial fees, the hope of the future, grew 22 percent to $598 million.
Merrill's target customer has at least $50,000 in household income. By the year 2000, with the baby boomers at their top earning capacity, the number of households above the $50,000 level is expected to double, as is the total of their assets. Something to shoot for, but will the asset-management strategy carry Merrill to its profit goals? Shearson's Dean Eberling, among other analysts, has his doubts. ''Retail will produce earnings,'' he says, ''but it won't, on a sustainable basis, push them into the return they want.''
One afternoon in 1979, while Donald Regan still held sway at Merrill, Bill Schreyer shared a Manhattan taxicab ride uptown with John C. Whitehead, then co-chairman of the management committee of Goldman, Sachs & Company, a powerhouse of investment banking. At one point, Schreyer recalls, Whitehead observed that Merrill was ''coming along'' with its fledgling investment banking activities. Then the Goldman executive asked, ''Why don't you just be satisfied with being the largest co-manager of securities offerings?'' That would have meant having the Merrill name forever in the place of an also-ran on the tombstones, the newspaper ads that bankers place to trumpet their underwriting coups. As Schreyer recalls, ''I said, 'First of all, that wouldn't be any fun. Second, that's not what we want to be.' ''
What Schreyer and Merrill wanted to be was No. 1. In the brokerage business, that argument had much to recommend it: larger volume generates more commission income. But the investment banking business was different. The richest margins went to firms that had long-standing relationships with the nation's major corporations. How could the giant broker break into the club?
Merrill's answer: sheer financial muscle. ''It has always been that profitability follows market share,'' says Tully. ''We did not have the school ties; we did not have 200 years of experience. We therefore had to show municipalities and governments and institutions around the world that we were a factor.''
From a standing start in 1976, Merrill has bolted to the top of the debt and stock underwriting tables, winning first place in 8 of the 11 underwriting categories tracked by IDD Information Services in 1988. It has been the No. 1 underwriter of all securities, worldwide, for two years in a row.
Underwriting is the traditional bread-and-butter of investment banking, and Merrill, with its massive distribution system, has an advantage. But competition has trimmed underwriting profits over the years, and the immediate prospects for richer margins are limited. When the volume of all stocks and bonds underwritten last year fell by 15 percent, fee revenues declined 21 percent.
Capital Markets also fought for a piece of what is potentially the most profitable corner of investment banking, mergers and acquisitions. Corporations traditionally give such plum advisory assignments to their longtime banking friends. But in the takeover frenzy of the past decade, many companies were willing to join hands with any trustworthy stranger who could rescue them - Merrill Lynch, for example.
The company became a pioneer in 1980's-style merchant banking, putting up its own capital to facilitate takeovers. These temporary ''bridge loans'' would eventually be replaced with junk bonds and other debt, also provided by Merrill. Sometimes the firm made equity investments as well. Merrill's huge capital base provided a potent competitive weapon. Merrill became a player in some of the largest and most lucrative leveraged buyouts, from the $4.23 billionBorg-Warner deal to the $25 billion RJR Nabisco bonanza. Investment banking revenues soared from $720 million in 1985 to $1.1 billion last year.
The firm's strongest relationships are with financial engineers and buyout groups, such as Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company. Unhappily for Merrill, their activities have markedly dwindled of late. What Capital Markets still lacks are the close ties to many C.E.O.'s of major corporations. ''The only reason we got any M. & A. business is because we bought it with our capital,'' says a Merrill banker.
Investment banking managers are generally accustomed to conducting their businesses without much oversight. ''Your average senior banker doesn't know what expenses look like,'' says a former Merrill banker. ''He knows what revenues look like. Bonuses are based on revenues.'' But if Schreyer's profit goals are to be achieved, the bankers will have to learn new habits.
In 1987, a lapse in managerial control in the trading of mortgage-backed securities left Merrill with a $377 million loss, an event Schreyer once referred to as ''my Chernobyl.'' As Daniel Tully explains it, Howard A. Rubin, a senior trader whom Merrill had lured away from Salomon by tripling his salary, took a risky position with an exotic derivative of a mortgage-backed security. The firm knew about the position, says Tully, and deemed it ''tolerable.'' Then Rubin increased his bet, according to Tully, but failed to disclose the new position immediately.
When Rubin's action was learned, traders and salesmen started trying to unwind the firm's position discreetly by selling the securities to customers. But very quickly, a group of executives led by Jerry Kenney, head of the Capital Markets group, and Tully, took control of the situation. First they tried to hedge the firm's position, with little success. Then they began canvassing other dealers in the securities for possible buyers. Kenney called Alan C. Greenberg, the chairman of Bear Stearns & Company, who agreed to buy a big chunk at a bargain-basement price. Kenney says the price was ''fair.''
Merrill dismissed Rubin; Bear, Stearns hired him. Last March, the Securities and Exchange Commission suspended Rubin from working on Wall Street for 9 months. When asked about its $377 million loss, Merrill blames most of it on Rubin. On the other hand, Martin A. Kuperberg, associate regional manager of the S.E.C.'s New York office, says, ''It's our opinion that Merrill's loss related to the unauthorized trading was $85 million.''
Merrill's push for market share extended abroad as well. Along with dozens of American investment bankers, Merrill wanted to be on hand in force for Big Bang - the deregulation of London's financial markets in October 1986. But few spent so grandly as Merrill. And when the invaders began to suffer - because they were unfamiliar with the operations of the local markets and because of the intense competition - few hurt more than Merrill.
Merrill has now withdrawn completely from the European commercial paper and gilts markets, and cut its trading in European equities. In addition, the company has been consolidating its facilities in London and Zurich.
And the London office has a new strategy. It is focusing on debt and equity underwriting and advisory work, particularly on so-called cross-border transactions - mergers and acquisitions, for example, that involve companies in different countries. Merrill wants to be ready for the economic integration of Europe in 1992.
During the six years since Bill Schreyer took over the reins, he has repeatedly talked of his determination to control costs. Yet total expenses, 92.3 percent of net revenues in 1985, actually increased to 94.6 percent for 1989 - and that figure does not allow for the special $470 million charge. Still, there are signs that Merrill is in fact taking a harder line on costs. One of those signs was the arrival last year of Tom Patrick as C.F.O. Patrick jokes that he was a noisy in-house critic for so long that Schreyer finally invited him to come to New York to try his hand at fixing Merrill's problems. He is thought to be an important force behind Schreyer's decision to focus on profitability.
Schreyer's Merristroika restructuring is basically a hard-nosed review of each business unit and its budget. The units are placed in one of three categories: ''special situations,'' which need to be nurtured; ''core businesses'' and ''burden of proof'' businesses with poor returns. Merrill says that it can now confidently calculate each unit's return on equity. Says Tully, ''It gives us the ability to manage other than by the seat of our pants and gut reaction.''
Merrill has sold off a portion of Broadcort Capital Corporation, a securities clearance operation, thus trimming 300 employees from Merrill's books. Its Canadian brokerage operation, with 800 people, has also been sold. In fact, since 1987 Merrill has reduced its head count by 8,000.
Schreyer's focus on profitability, and his decision to subject his company to a $470 million writedown, are signs that Merrill may be changing. What remains to be seen is whether a man so shaped by the old culture can fully embrace the rigors of the new.
Last March, looking to the years ahead, Schreyer told of meeting an East bloc official. The visitor asked how one of his nation's companies might get listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The prospect of yet another world for Merrill to conquer brought a delighted grin to Schreyer's face as he told the story. Around the world, he still expects Merrill to be No. 1: ''I think the biggest problem for my successors - and I'm going to enjoy reading about it - will be an antitrust problem.''

HEADLINE: A CROWBAR FOR CARLA HILLS

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE; Louis Uchitelle covers economics for The Times.

 BODY:
The office of the United States Trade Representative is housed in a 19th- century building that once served as Union Army headquarters. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant occupied the spare, high-ceilingedroom that now is the office of Carla A. Hills, the nation's chief trade negotiator.
Hills has filled the narrow room with framed family-style snapshots; some of herself with her husband and four children, others of her with President Bush - as if he, too, were family. One photo, taken at her swearing in on Feb. 6, 1989, has been blown up to poster size and hung in the conference room adjoining Hills's office. It records a scene in which Bush hands Carla Hills a crowbar. They are laughing, and Hills's hand rests lightly on the President's back. The inscription, scrawled in black felt pen: ''To Carla, I know you'll use this with finesse and strength.''
No foreign trade negotiator, looking across the table at that photo, can miss the point. Hills speaks for her friend the President. She is the ally Bush selected from his political retinue in December 1988 to pry open foreign markets. As the nation's Trade Representative, or Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary (her ceremonial title), the 56-year-old California attorney has been thrust into some of the most troublesome political and economic issues in the world today. 
An intractable trade deficit has become emblematic of the nation's slide as an economic power - and of the often unsuccessful struggle of American corporations to outsell the Japanese, the Germans, the Italians, the Koreans and other vigorously industrial nations. Hills, a persistent, fiercely competitive, sometimes thin-skinned, workaholic, leads the campaign to increase American sales abroad. For most of her 16 months as Trade Representative, Congress has been goading her to concentrate particularly on Japan, which accounted for 44 percent of the nation's $113 billion trade deficit last year.
''Trade is the goose that laid Japan's golden egg,'' Hills comments. ''And Japan just happens to be the bad boy of trade internationally.''
Hills is under pressure to make full use of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, which enhanced the Administration's power to retaliate against unfair traders. With the Act's new Section 301, called Super 301, Congress in a sense created for Hills her own crowbar, the authority to cite Japan, among others, as unfair trading partners: countries that seize an advantage by breaking American trade rules. Under the new 301 the punishment is a tariff of as much as 100 percent if the country doesn't mend its ways within two years.
One month after taking office, Hills named Japan, Brazil and India as unfair trading partners, but recently the Bush Administration decided that Japan apparently was mending its ways and should not be cited further. Just weeks before the Trade Representative's office was due to take another look at the situation, the Japanese agreed to purchase from the United States more finished-wood products, supercomputers and communications satellites, the three areas for which Japan had been cited under 301 last year. Many critics argue that these agreements, as negotiated by Hills's young staff, are vague and that the Japanese will backslide, as they have in the past. But for the Bush Administration, eager to avoid friction with Japan, the new commitments appear to be sufficient.
''The President is guided in his priorities by defense and foreign policy considerations, and not trade issues,'' says Pat Choate, vice president for policy analysis at TRW Inc., a defense contractor. Choate urges stepping up pressure on Japan to buy American goods.
Whatever the President's priorities, he has given Hills another task with Japan: the pursuit of a revolutionary strategy in trade policy. This effort, bureaucratically dubbed the Structural Impediments Initiative, is aimed at getting the Japanese to change the very nature of the way they do business.
Talks have produced an interim report in which the new Japanese Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, says he will seek ways to speed the stores in Japan that carry American products, in competition withthe small shops that now dominate retailing and handle mostly domestic merchandise. Kaifu will also encourage his nation to buy on credit, tighten antitrust and patent laws and take other steps that would make the Japanese marketplace friendlier to American companies and products.
''We have never had these commitments before from the Japanese,'' Hills says. ''If the Japanese do the things that they say they will do, that will make a difference.''
If not, Congress may take matters into its own hands. Hills says that Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee's trade subcommittee, has told her, ''Either you get results or I'm going to convert the Structural Impediments Talks into a mandatory Super 301 action.''
While the Bush Administration must mollify Congress, its own preference on trade is neither Section 301 nor the Structural Impediments Initiative. The President's chosen forum is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, which functions, United Nations style, mostly out of the headlines. GATT operates on the assumption that a body of rules will open borders for American products and for those of other countries as well. In this setting, neither Japan nor any other country gets blamed for the United States trade deficit. Instead, delegations from 97 countries seek ways to notch down everyone's tariffs and remove other obstacles to trade.
Hills heads the American GATT delegation that is trying to do this in drawn-out talks known as the Uruguay Round, named for the country in which these sessions began in 1986. The talks, carried out mostly in Geneva, and intended to end in December, are the first major GATT negotiations in a decade, but Hills sometimes despairs of awakening Americans to their importance: ''I've had too many bright people - I mean this not in a disparaging way - ask, 'What's the Uruguay Round?' You say, 'We're trying to develop international law governing trade in 15 areas.' It sounds so technical. It's just very difficult for the human mind that's not fascinated by arcane details on trade to get enthusiastic about that.''
Hills herself was no expert on trade when she accepted the job as chief negotiator. She had been Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Ford Administration. In private life, she was a lawyer with a specialty in antitrust and she served on the board of directors of several major corporations, gaining a name for herself as perennial nominee for a top post in any Republican Administration. With Hills and Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Bush made women visible in his Cabinet.
In the Bush Administration, trade policy is set at the highest levels. Hills is included in the deliberations of the Economic Policy Council, a select half-dozen people who decide trade issues along with President Bush. Armed with marching orders from these deliberations, Hills then wades into the arcana of trade: the quotas, tariffs and talks that define her office. ''I negotiate,'' she says. ''That's my life.''
President Bush announced last July 25 that he would extend for two and a half years the quotas that since 1984 had limited foreign steel imports to less than 20 percent of the American market. The decision apparently surprised Hills's staff. ''I was talking to Mrs. Hills's people after the announcement, and they had been preparing for a four-year extension,'' says an aide to Senator John Heinz, a Pennsylvania Republican and the co-chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus. ''They were caught short.''
According to several accounts, Hills had sought two two-year extensions of the quotas, during the first of which her staff would negotiate agreements requiring each of the 19 nations participating in the quota program to phase out their unfair trading practices: low-cost government loans to steel companies and other subsidies. During the second extension the 19 nations - including Britain, Brazil, France, Italy, Spain and Portugal - would then phase out those practices. The argument was that the steel industry needed the longer period of protection.
Even before the issue reached the Policy Council, lower-level aides from various agencies had developed position papers on the alternatives. There was the steel industry view - extend the quotas for another five years - which Labor Secretary Dole and Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher favored. The more orthodox free-traders among Bush's top people - in the steel case, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Richard G. Darman, the budget director - wanted the quotas extended for two years, at most. Their view reflected in part the pressure from a coalition of steel users, led by Caterpillar Inc., that wanted no quotas at all. By eliminating quotas, they said, supply would increase and prices come down.
''Mrs. Hills did not carry our case,'' says Timothy Elder, a Caterpillar executive. But Hills did endorse one of the major steel users' requests: an easing of import restrictions on specialty steels not available from domestic producers. And Elder praises Hills's analytical skills: ''She goes around the table and she says, 'Now wait a minute, he said that and you said this. Which is it?' She has an unnerving ability to ferret out facts.''
Bush was present at one of the three Economic Policy Council sessions at which the steel case was argued. A few days after the last session, the President announced his decision, one that he reached in the privacy of the Oval Office. Bush did incorporate Hills's main idea: a 19-nation negotiation to phase out unfair trading practices, but they could last only two-and-a-half years, not four. Most of the agreements have in fact been achieved.
Soft-pedaling any disagreement on duration, Hills, the team player, says that the steel quota debate was ''a perfect illustration of working toward a round consensus.'' Her chief of staff and counselor, Gary Edson, who sat in with her at the Policy Council meetings, insists there was no disagreement: ''Ambassador Hills never took a position on duration in the Policy Council meetings.'' What was all-important to Carla Hills, he says, ''was to make increases in quotas conditional on country commitments to eliminate unfair trading practices.''
Hills acknowledges the communal nature of making trade policy in the Bush Administration. She says that she never issues a policy pronouncement nor does she take an action that will surprise the upper reaches of the Bush Administration. ''I think that I have a lot of running room on trade,'' she says, ''and the reason that I do is that my style is to consult.''
Carla Hills Remembers herself as a tomboy who excelled in sports. She rode five-gaited horses, sailed and, at the private girls' high school she attended in Los Angeles, played varsity basketball and volleyball. In college she became a champion tennis player. An Alexander Hamilton biography that she read at the age of 12 propelled her toward the legal profession. ''Law represented capability to me,'' she says. ''You look at people like Hamilton, great contributors to our history, and many of them have been trained in the law.''
After an undergraduate degree at Stanford, Hills defied her father by traveling East and entering Yale Law School. The dean of Stanford's law school had praised Yale, and she wanted the best, she says. She paid for the first year out of her savings until her father, who had made a fortune in his own building supply business, gave in.
''Her father became very proud, once he understood that a woman could succeed as a lawyer. But his first reaction had been to keep her close to home,'' her husband, Roderick Hills, says. ''He also did not want her to marry me. He was suspicious of lawyers.''
Carla Anderson graduated from Yale Law in 1958, 21st in a class of 167, and married Hills, a graduate of Stanford Law, soon after. She took a job as an assistant United States Attorney in Los Angeles, doing trial work. Private law firms, she says, offered women only routine jobs. ''I did not want to find myself not having an opportunity down the road,'' she says.
Her first child, Laura, who is now also a lawyer, was born in 1961. The next year, Carla and Roderick Hills formed a Los Angeles law firm -Munger, Tolles, Hills & Rickershauser - with three others. Though eventually she negotiated a full salary, initially Carla was paid far less than Roderick - because she was a woman.
''She was just furious privately, but publicly she said forget it,'' says her son, Roderick Jr., a Yale law student. ''My mom tends to be very quiet about grievances.'' While working 12-hour days, she raised three daughters and a son. It is simply, Carla Hills says, a matter of managing one's time.
She arrived in Washington in the dying days of the Nixon Administration and took a job at the Justice Department as head of the Civil Division. Roderick Hills, who by now was known as a corporate trouble-shooter, became chairman of the S.E.C. in the Ford Administration and Carla Hills became Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the third woman in history to hold a United States Cabinet post.
Carla Hills did not practice law again until a year after leaving H.U.D. in 1977, more than fulfilling Government ethics requirements for former officials. But in 1985, as a partner at Latham & Watkins, she went to see Samuel R. Pierce Jr., then H.U.D. Secretary, on behalf of her client, DRG Funding. DRG, a major mortgage lender, was the largest in H.U.D.'s $5 billion co-insurance program but had run afoul of H.U.D. standards and was having trouble obtaining new loan guarantees.
Shortly after Hills's visit, Pierce issued a nine-page letter summarizing DRG's sins. Nevertheless, he renewed the loan guarantees - on which H.U.D. now has a liability of $769.5 million and has paid claims of $122.5 million. Hills's visit to Pierce surfaced last year during a Congressional investigation into the H.U.D. scandal. Trade Representative Hills spent nearly six hours answering questions before the House Employment and Housing subcommittee.
She pointed out that there had been no payoff, only $33,500 in fees for 150 hours of legal work. She argued that in 1985 DRG was still a respected mortgage lender, and that she had worked through proper channels. ''I can tell you, never in a million years did I think this case would come back and haunt me,'' she says.
Although Congress did not censure her, the episode casts a shadow. ''It was unfair to put her in the Hall of Shame, as Time Magazine did,'' says Stuart Weisberg, staff director for the subcommittee. ''But I wouldn't put her in the Hall of Fame either.''
If Hills is the flag bearer in trade, her authority is hard to pinpoint in the process of negotiating trade agreements. One of her deputies, Julius Katz, recently negotiated a new Long-Term Grain Agreement with the Soviet Union. The United States position was developed almost entirely at the interagency level - Katz meeting with his counterparts at Agriculture, State and Commerce - and in consultation with farm groups.
Katz led the delegation to Vienna that negotiated the final terms, and he carried with him instructions that gave him enough power to settle on an agreement that allows the Soviets to purchase a minimum of 10 million tons of grain a year and a maximum of 14 million tons.
Although the Trade Representative's office has only 150 staffers and a meager $18 million annual budget, Carla Hills won a turf battle last year with Mosbacher and his much bigger Commerce Department over the right to negotiate a new Russian Trade Treaty. Last year, the United States had a trade surplus of about $3 billion with Russia. Here, too, Katz has been the lead negotiator, and again details have been worked out at the interagency level. But some issues have required decisions by Hills, among them how long the Soviet Union can take to pass legislation governing intellectual property rights, such as copyright and patent protection.
In weighing alternatives, Hills operates like a newspaper editor, Katz says. ''Some editors can take on more authority than others,'' he says. ''They know what decisions their reputations can sustain and what has to be referred to higher authority. Hills has to make this sort of judgment.''
Skilled lawyer that she is, Hills has worked out a way to make the two contradictory thrusts in the Bush Administration trade policy sound like components of the same logical strategy. One is the effort to pry open the Japanese market and the other the Bush Administration preference for multilateral negotiations.
''My objective is to get the world's trading system open,'' Hills says, ''so that entrepreneurs, wherever they are located, can sell and buy and expand trade without government interference.'' For Hills, the avenue to open markets runs through the multilateral GATT negotiations.
The 97 signatories to GATT account for two-thirds of the $3 trillion in merchandise traded each year. Since the original agreement in 1947, GATT has been altered six times, with tariffs reduced each time - from an initial 40 percent to an average of less than 5 percent for most items traded today. For 30 years, that reduction benefited the United States, which filled the world with its superior and low-cost manufactured goods.
But after the last GATT revision - the Tokyo Round, which started in 1976 - many American industries were outclassed by others. During the 1980's, the United States trade deficit ballooned, leading to protectionism in this country and such rules as Section 301, which is intended to force others to buy American.
Free trade, however, means that governments remove the tariffs, subsidies and other protectionist measures that give one nation's goods an advantage over another's. In spirit, Hills is a free trader, but one who prefers not to use the label. ''Those are words that are loaded with emotional baggage,'' she says. She prefers ''open markets.''
''If you open the Japanese market, you will not necessarily create an opportunity for U.S. entrepreneurs,'' she says, in effect applying the GATT negotiations to the Japanese problem. ''I do not open their market to create sweetheart deals for American entrepreneurs. I open markets so that we can trade in a competitive fashion.''
But many in Congress are not satisfied with this reasoning. Senator John C. Danforth, the Missouri Republican who has taken a hard line on Japan, accuses Hills of trying to fool Congress. ''The Administration is really trying to finesse trade policy into something that is vague and indefinite,'' he says.
Whatever the thrust of the trade policy, a third theory is jostling for Hills's attention: managed trade. Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a Japan expert and a former Commerce Department official, argues that the Japanese go at business differently than Americans. One of their goals, he says, is to gain leadership in certain industries - autos, semiconductors, VCR's, machine tools, supercomputers. They try to prevent American manufacturers from selling these products in Japan, while they flood the world with their goods.
The solution, says Prestowitz, is managed trade: making deals with the Japanese. The Japanese, for instance, sell cars in the United States through Chrysler, Ford and Chevrolet dealers, so American auto makers should have similar rights in Japan. Currently they cannot sell through Japanese dealers.
The Hills reply draws on her skill in steering between the two thrusts in trade policy. ''I do agree with Clyde that you have to be constant, firm and decided in dealing with the Japanese,'' she says. ''But that doesn't mean that I have to be strident and shrewish in my approach. I don't belong to the Japan-bashing school.''
But Hills might not be free to indulge the Bush preference for free trade, if the Japanese fail to keep their 301 promises. The agreements on satellites and supercomputers, for example, make bidding more open to American companies, but do not require Japanese companies to buy many more American products.
Nevertheless, Congress raised little protest this spring when the Bush Administration decided not to cite the Japanese again under 301. One reason is that the nation's trade deficit has declined. Another is Hills's success in convincing Congress that the agreements constitute progress. Carla Hills is not a deal-making, back-slapping politician like her predecessors, Clayton K. Yeutter and Robert S. Strauss. She is formal, precise, ever ready to testify on the Hill and thoroughly briefed on each trade issue.
''I find her very logical, very legal, very rational in her explanations to the committee,'' says Senator Robert W. Packwood, ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, which has oversight on trade. ''You can ask her for a detailed explanation of some matter that someone only in the bowels of the negotiations would be expected to know, and she knows it.''
Maybe she is too wrapped up in details, says Strauss, who was President Carter's Trade Representative. ''The only thing I would say critical of her I have said to her directly,'' Strauss says. ''I told her, 'I would like to see you make a speech every day, and go all over the world.' '' As it is, Hills speaks or makes public appearances at least eight times a month and has traveled twice to Japan and to Europe.
If Japan continues to abide by 301 and mend its ways under the Structural Impediments Initiative, if the Trade Representative gets everything she wants out of the Uruguay Round, does that mean the United States trade deficit will decline? Not necessarily, says Hills: opening markets and reducing the trade deficit are different kettles of fish. Explaining the point during an interview, she jumps up from a stuffed armchair in her office, takes a legal pad and outlines an economic theory that seems unassailable to her.
''The budget deficit creates a big problem for me because it creates a bad political climate in which to make good trade policy,'' Hills says. ''But if I were to tell you that I had a bag of fairy dust, and I could open all markets tomorrow, the question would be, 'Would we necessarily have a zero deficit in that year?'
''I couldn't answer that question. I would have to ask, 'Are we, in that year, going to spend more than we save? Are we going to invest more than we save?' If we are going to use last year's standard of investing about 15 percent of our gross domestic product, but only save 13 percent, then we will have a gap of about $110 billion that we have to import from overseas to finance our investment.''
Hills, in sum, is reciting Economics 101. If Americans spend more than they save, they have to go overseas to borrow the shortfall. The way they do that is to import on credit - import more than they pay for with exports.
Others say that this argument ignores a more important point - that the United States should develop high-tech industries that would be competitive in world markets. Akio Morita, chairman of the Sony Corporation, would agree. As he said in a television interview: ''If your business runs shortsighted, and if your industry is buying Japanese products, the imbalance of trade will never decrease.''
Hills's staff promotes and embellishes her image as a persistent and hard-working trade chief. Victoria Clarke, the assistant trade representative for public affairs, displays her boss's daily calendars, which show frequent 14-hour days. There are countless briefing papers to read, numerous visitors. And sometimes her negotiators barge in on Hills for help in resolving a crisis.
The relentless pace continues most weekends. On Sundays, Hills can often be found at the office, where if necessary she will wash out the coffee cups. ''Carla's favorite expression is that she likes people who do windows,'' says Gary Edson, her chief of staff. ''She is not a prima donna.''
In the future, Hills will undoubtedly become a candidate for another high Government job. If one does not materialize, there is always the private sector. Pat Choate, of TRW, charges that many trade officials take private-sector jobs, working for Japanese and other foreign companies.
That is not likely to happen in Hills's case. When she took her current position, she and her family went to great pains to avoid conflicts of interest. Her husband, operating these days as a lawyer and consultant, dropped Japanese clients. Her daughter, Laura, steered clear of trade cases, although that is her legal specialty. And Hills herself set up a procedure to withdraw from trade issues involving clients of her former law firm.
Carla Hills's name has cropped up in recent years on speculative lists of potential Supreme Court candidates. In the 1970's, in fact, Hills says President Ford asked her if she would be interested in going to the Supreme Court. She replied that she liked her job at H.U.D.
She gives a similar answer now, insisting that she cannot think beyond her present post. ''I don't know how to dispel the Supreme Court rumor,'' she says. ''I guess that once you're on a list, you can't get off it.''

HEADLINE: BETTING THE FARM ON BIOTECH

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER; Keith Schneider is a New York Times national correspondent based in Washington.

 BODY:
The sun beats down on green fields of corn that have never seen chemical insecticides or weed killers. Over the ridge, docile Holsteins are producing more milk on less feed than has ever before been possible, and piglets are growing into lean adults at uncommon speed. The air is free of dust from eroding topsoil and a stream drains the gentle slopes, its waters as sweet and pure as a mountain spring. Supermarkets are jammed with the bounty of a skillful, careful farming that is as safe as it is productive.
This is the agricultural landscape of the 21st century as envisioned by Howard A. Schneiderman, senior vice president of research and development and chief scientist at the Monsanto Company. In the past decade the St. Louis-based chemical manufacturer has invested over $800 million - more than any other company in the world - in agricultural biotechnology, the business of altering plants, animals and microbes by artificially mixing and matching their genes. It is the 63-year-old Schneiderman, a Manhattan-raised scientist who learned his farming from textbooks, who has set Monsanto on a course that could forever change how food and fiber are produced. ''Monsanto is developing a way to use Mother Nature to modify organisms to serve us better,'' says Schneiderman, whose favorite word for the technology is ''fantastic.'' 
Eleven years after Schneiderman came to Monsanto to reinvent farming, the company remains one of the most profitable in the chemical industry, even though it has yet to reap the first dollar of pay back from its genetic-engineering efforts in agriculture. Monsanto is standing ready with its first biotechnology product, a genetically engineered growth hormone for dairy cows, and is eager to follow up with a similar product for pigs. In the mid-1990's, Schneiderman says, Monsanto plans to introduce gene-altered crops capable of resisting viral diseases, insects and - to the alarm of environmentalists - Monsanto's own weed killer. In all, the company has 15 farm-biotechnology products in the pipeline, and Monsanto executives believe the combined sales and royalties could approach $1 billion a year by the end of the decade.
Yet strewn across Monsanto's path to the next century are a variety of cultural, political, scientific and economic barriers. As the acknowledged leaders in farm biotechnology, Schneiderman and his Monsanto colleagues find their work at the center of an international debate. The controversy, which once focused solely on the prudence of releasing new life forms in fields and feed lots, has broadened to include questions about the technology's impact on farm economy and food safety. critics are also challenging Monsanto's assertion that biotechnology will make farming more profitable and less destructive to the air, water and soil.
''The kind of biotechnology that Monsanto has embarked upon is silver-bullet technology that will prolong the system of agriculture we have now,'' says Jack Doyle, director of the agriculture and biotechnology project at Friends of the Earth, an environmental group in Washington. ''We have the potential to understand biological systems in agriculture like never before, such as understanding the entire cycle of how pests attack crops and how crops respond. But the way the technology is being capitalized and developed, we're intervening for the convenience of a product.''
Monsanto has spent $300 million developing the genetically engineered growth hormone for cows, bovine somatotropin, or BST. The hormone, which three other companies have also been racing to bring to market, has been shown to increase milk production by 10 percent to 25 percent. But BST is the target of a furious philosophical and economic struggle in dairy states across the upper Middle West, New York and New England - where many dairy farmers argue that BST will cause a milk glut and force prices down.
Several of the nation's largest supermarket chains barred experimental use of BST in their suppliers' herds last summer, pending approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Last March, Wisconsin lawmakers voted to ban BST temporarily in the nation's largest dairy state - the first time a product of genetic engineering had been restricted by a legislative body.
According to the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, more than 400 American companies may be spending as much as $2 billion a year on biotechnology research and development, not only for farming but for medical and industrial uses as well. The major players in agricultural biotechnology include American Cyanamid, Dow Chemical, Du Pont, Eli Lilly, Upjohn and W. R. Grace.
It is a business requiring huge investments that offer no immediate, or certain, return. Many small biotechnology startups, especially those concentrating on agriculture, have been forced to merge with or sell out to bigger companies - or have failed altogether. The pressure to show results is even falling on corporations the size of Monsanto, the nation's fourth-largest chemical company, with sales last year of $8.68 billion.
One Wall Street investment house, Mabon, Nugent & Company, estimates that research for BST alone is costing Monsanto up to $50 million a year, and Mabon analysts predict that Monsanto may abandon the project if the company is not at least breaking even on BST sales by 1993. But Monsanto's Schneiderman, who expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve BST next year, insists that Monsanto will not waver on the cow hormone and other farm biotechnologies.
This is a company with a history of patience: its best-selling agricultural product, the herbicide Roundup, was approved for the market in 1974, a full 23 years after investigators set out to find an antidote to Johnson grass, a rugged weed. With biotechnology, Monsanto is once again thinking long term.
''Let's imagine the year 2030 or 2050,'' says Schneiderman. ''Where will food come from? We're going to have to have a sustainable, renewable agriculture forever.''
The progenitors of biotechnology were two California scientists, Stanley N. Cohen of Stanford University and Herbert W. Boyer of the University of California at San Francisco. In 1973 they managed to isolate fragments of a gene from one bacterium and insert them into another to create a bit of living cellular material that had never before existed. Their work, and all genetic engineering since, has focused on the substance that controls the growth and behavior of every living organism: deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.
A long, twisting molecule, DNA consists of linked pairs of chemicals that are identical in the cells of a virus, a frog, a person and every other living thing. These so-called ''base pairs'' form the ladder-like steps of DNA's characteristic double-helix strand. A single gene is a section of DNA made up of 1,000 to 1 million base pairs.
Though the number of genes varies among organisms - viruses have 10 genes or fewer, humans have as many as 100,000 - all of life, in effect, is assembled from the same parts department. This biological unity enables genetic engineers to bypass natural evolution and create whole new varieties of living organisms.
The Cohen-Boyer breakthrough came at a pivotal moment for the chemical industry. John W. Hanley, who was then Monsanto's chairman, recognized that core elements of the company's business faced a limited future. The basic ingredient of many Monsanto products was petroleum, and the 1973-74 Arab embargo provided graphic evidence that oil was growing more costly. The use of farm chemicals, moreover, was coming under attack by environmentalists and consumer groups.
Hanley saw potential salvation in the emerging field of genetic engineering. But Monsanto, an old hand in the making and marketing of chemicals, knew next to nothing about the branch of science that had conceived gene splicing - molecular biology. The company went shopping for expertise.
Schneiderman was dean of the School of Biological Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, when Hanley invited him to Monsanto headquarters for a job interview in March 1979. As a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and a recognized expert in the techniques of genetic engineering, Schneiderman struck Hanley as the ideal person to oversee Monsanto's biotechnology efforts.
''We spent $170 million on research in 1978,'' Hanley told Schneiderman. ''We probably should have spent $275 million. Do you have any good ideas?'' It was a striking proposition, Schneiderman recalls. ''If you're a red-blooded American who has chosen research as a career, and a guy comes and says, 'Do you have any good ideas for $100 million worth of research?' it's a fantastic temptation.'' Howard Schneiderman came aboard and helped Monsanto spend its money.
A major outlay has been more than $165 million to construct and outfit the Life Sciences Research Center, a 210-acre campus 25 miles west of downtown St. Louis in suburban Chesterfield, Mo. The center is known around the company as the House That Howard Built.
In the center's four buildings and 250 laboratories, 900 researchers spend their days hunched over petri dishes and centrifuges.
Richard J. Mahoney, Monsanto's current chairman, hopes that the products these scientists create will account for half of the company's sales 20 years from now. Fervor and portent give this place the kind of electricity that must have charged the atmosphere at Columbia University in the years just before World War II, when Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard were testing theories for sustaining a nuclear chain reaction. Indeed, genetic engineering could be as pervasively influential - and as enduringly controversial - in the 21st century as atomic energy has been in the 20th.
One of Schneiderman's star recruits was Robert T. Fraley, a farm-raised Middle Westerner with a doctorate in biochemistry and microbiology from the University of Illinois, who joined Monsanto in 1980 at the age of 27.
Fraley was put in charge of the plant molecular biology group, whose task it was to develop better crops through genetic engineering. Since gene-altering techniques had never been successfully performed on plants, the group started out with a more basic problem: how to move genes through a plant's cell walls without destroying the cells.
Fraley's group settled on the novel approach of harnessing bacteria, which have the natural ability to invade plant cells. The bacterium chosen, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, causes an infection called crown gall. The scientists reasoned that if they could disable the disease-causing genes in Agrobacterium, it could provide a wagon for hauling foreign genes into any plant.
Like watchmakers attempting to repair a precision timepiece they had never seen before, the young scientists disassembled Agrobacterium's genetic code and studied its parts. They identified those regions of the DNA that produce crown gall and proceeded to remove them. This took the better part of two years.
It was now time to devise a system for testing their theory. Using another bacterium, E. coli, Fraley and his colleagues isolated the gene that makes E. coli immune to an antibiotic called kanamycin. They tinkered with that gene so that it could make petunia cells resistant to kanamycin, which is normally lethal to the plants. They inserted this gene into the Agrobacterium. Fraley's group then put cells from a petunia - a simple species, well suited to experimentation - into a petri dish containing kanamycin. They added the altered Agrobacterium. If the system worked properly, the Agrobacterium would transfer the immunity gene to the petunia cells and they would survive.
In a few weeks, Fraley recalls, new, healthy petunia cells began to appear in the petri dish. ''I was looking at the plates in the laboratory one day and saw the colonies growing there and ran down the hallway yelling, 'It worked! It worked!' ''
In 1983 Fraley announced that Monsanto had produced a petunia that was the world's first genetically engineered plant. Since then, Fraley's group has used the same system for more elaborate, and commercially important, plant transformations. Monsanto has conducted 28 of the 77 outdoor experiments in the United States approved by the Department of Agriculture since July 1987, more than any other company. Its first successful gene-altering experiment with a staple crop came in 1987 with soybeans, which were modified to resist damage from the company's herbicide, Roundup.
Monsanto scientists also have developed an array of crops - tomato, potato, alfalfa, tobacco and cucumber - that are resistant to viral infections. (See diagram.) And the company has altered cotton, tomatoes and potatoes with bacterial genes that produce proteins fatal to budworms, bollworms and other pests.
The insect- and viral-resistant plants are intended to sharply reduce a farmer's need to use insecticides. According to Monsanto, genetically engineered cotton could save farmers hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
''Two years from now every crop in the world will be easily manipulated,'' says Fraley. ''Ten years from now, in some plant we'll know every gene, every protein, every function. There are no longer any technical restraints.''
There may be other types of restraints, however. Many environmentalists, for example, oppose Monsanto's decision to create crops immune to its Roundup herbicide. ''Monsanto's rhetoric is a low- or no-pesticide agriculture,'' says Margaret Mellon, a molecular biologist and lawyer with the National Wildlife Federation in Washington. ''But in fact, what they are delivering is a whole new generation of herbicide-tolerant plants that will shackle us to chemicals for the foreseeable future.''
Monsanto contends that Roundup is an environ mentally sound way to do what crop plants cannot - eliminate the weeds that compete for nutrients and sunlight. Roundup's active ingredient is glyphosate, a substance the Environmental Protection Agency considers to be among the safest farm chemicals. But Roundup does contain other substances that opponents say can be toxic to fish, if it makes its way into ponds and streams.
Because Roundup does not discriminate between weeds and crops, farmers currently must use it with extreme care - and avoid it altogether in soybean, corn and cotton fields. The development of Roundup-resistant crops could allow farmers to spray the herbicide freely; that troubles environmentalists. Monsanto executives maintain, however, that planting Roundup-proof crops could let farmers abandon other, more environmentally threatening herbicides.
Mellon remains unconvinced that Roundup will be as good for the environment as it may be for Monsanto's profits. Sales of the weed killer, approaching roughly $1 billion a year, yield more than 30 percent of the company's annual profit. Because Monsanto's patent for Roundup has already expired in some countries, and expires in the United States in the year 2000, the company must prepare for the coming competition. Roundup-resistant crops would help the company to create a larger market.
''Rather than needing new kinds of pesticides,'' Mellon argues, ''we need methods of cultivation that avoid the use of pesticides.'' The problem, she says, is that ''the private enterprise system, which does so many things so well, has no incentive to come up with new processes; they have every incentive in the world to come up with new products.''
Last summer the ''Branches of Promise,'' a 15-foot-high abstract sculpture of a grove of trees wrought in glass bonded with Monsanto's Saflex plastic interlayers, was erected at the center of the courtyard outside the office of Monsanto's 56-year-old chairman, Richard Mahoney. The sculpture is meant to impress the viewer with the company'svision of fusing nature and technology.
Mahoney, the former vice president and managing director of Monsanto's agricultural products division, became company president in 1980, C.E.O. in 1983 and chairman upon Hanley's retirement from that post in 1986. He has continued his predecessor's campaign to take the company in new scientific directions.
During the 80's, Monsanto prepared for the future by sloughing off the past. From 1980 to 1987 the company sold or shut down $4 billion worth of businesses in markets deemed too cyclical: commodity chemicals and basic oil and gas exploration. In 1985 bulk petrochemicals comprised 30 percent of Monsanto's assets; by 1988 the figure was 2 percent. Last year the company sold its silicon manufacturing operation, saying it did not fit into Monsanto's plans for the future.
In 1985 the company - which was founded in 1901 to make the artificial sweetener saccharin - paid $2.8 billion to buy G. D. Searle & Company, the Chicago-based pharmaceutical manufacturer and developer of the artificial sweetener, aspartame, better known by its trade name Nutrasweet. Monsanto spun off the Nutrasweet Company into a separate division that same year.
Monsanto's $679 million profit last year was a company record, but 1990 has started poorly: first-quarter sales were flat and profit down 13 percent from a year earlier. Mahoney pegs the problem to the soft automotive market (Monsanto chemical compounds are used extensively in auto manufacturing) and a seasonal shift in agricultural chemical sales - temporary setbacks, he insists. All the same, he is anxious for Monsanto's biotechnology investment to begin paying off.
Mahoney expects Monsanto to have the first of its genetically engineered plants on the market by 1994 or 1995. Instead of selling whole plants or seeds to farmers, the company intends to establish royalty agreements with seed companies, food manufacturers and other buyers and sellers of agricultural products - providing gene-altered parent plants in return for a share of future profits from the progeny.
The first-generation inventions have focused on changing single genes to make plants resistant to disease, pests and pesticides. The second generation, expected shortly after the year 2000, will focus on improving what plants produce - bigger seeds, better oils, more nutrients.
''The real value added is when you improve properties,'' says Mahoney. ''Changing oil ratios for food processing - that's big money. Changing the structure of grains for processors - that's big money.''
Long before its gene-altered plants hit the market, however, Monsanto hopes to start reaping big money from the genetically engineered veterinary drug BST, the dairy-cow hormone that can stimulate milk production. But those hopes were put on hold in late April when Governors Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican, and Rudy Perpich of Minnesota, a Democrat, each signed legislation banning use of BST in their states until mid-1991.
Proponents of the ban, including thousands of dairy farmers, see the genetically engineered drug as the latest example of increasingly sophisticated tools that keep farm output high and prices low for urban consumers, enriching only the chemical and drug companies.
Monsanto and BST's three other manufacturers - American Cyanamid, Eli Lilly and Upjohn - spent tens of thousands of dollars in Wisconsin battling the legislation. Wisconsin State Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Democrat who led the charge against BST, says the manufacturers chose the wrong defense strategy. ''They ruled out social and economic arguments, claiming that the only valid issue for us to consider was whether a product is unhealthful. What Monsanto has learned the hard way is that farmers and consumers and environmentalists take a broader view.''
''It was not great news for biotechnology to have two major dairy states pass this kind of legislation,'' observes Paul T. Leming, a principal in the equity research department at the investment bank Morgan Stanley & Company. ''I've contended for some time that BST is the litmus test of biotechnology products getting into the human food chain.''
''It's not a good sign,'' concedes Walter P. Hobgood, the 41-year-old director of Monsanto's Animal Nutrition and Health division and the man in charge of BST development. ''It says you can invest in technology and meet all of the regulatory hurdles - only to have a political decision be made just prior to commercialization. If that were to be a continuing trend, the uncertainty is a huge disincentive to do any research in agriculture.''
Monsanto's work on BST began in the mid-1960's. The hormone could be extracted from the pituitary glands of slaughtered animals and injected into live ones, but the process proved too expensive for commercial applications.
The advent of genetic engineering in the 70's, however, made it possible for scientists to isolate the appropriate cow gene and produce unlimited quantities of BST. In 1979 the newly hired Schneiderman struck a deal with Genentech, a young biotechnology company in South San Francisco, Calif. In return for rights to the bovine growth hormone, Monsanto paid Genetech $990,000, agreed to make several subsequent milestone payments and promised royalties on future BST sales.
Genentech delivered the first 600 milligrams of BST in December 1981, and initial tests showed that it worked like natural BST. Monsanto launched an aggressive field-testing program in the United States, South America, Africa and Europe. Two years ago, at a cost of $50 million, Monsanto completed a factory in Austria to produce the hormone.
The United States Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve the drug in 1991 - perhaps around the same time the Wisconsin and Minnesota bans expire. Yet opposition to BST seems to be increasing. Dr. Samuel Epstein, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago, has raised questions about BST's effect on humans. Epstein contends that its chemical structure is sufficiently different from natural bovine somatotropin that its risks are unknown. The F.D.A. takes the position that the man-made hormone is a protein nearly identical in chemical structure to natural BST and, just as any protein, will quickly break down in the stomachs of adults and children. The F.D.A. intends to take an unusual step to assure the public of BST's safety by publishing an article in the journal Science later this summer.
The loudest, most effective opponent of BST - indeed, of all agricultural biotechnology - is Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends in Washington. It was Rifkin who, in April 1986, organized a coalition of farm groups and environmentalists in Wisconsin and other states into the first formal crusade against BST and its manufacturers.
''Monsanto sees all living creatures as resources to be subject to whatever manipulations are required for the market,'' says the 45-year-old Rifkin. ''That type of strict utilitarian mentality has created the global environmental crisis.''
Rifkin and Monsanto have clashed on other biotechnology fronts. In 1986 the company announced it was ready to field-test genetically engineered bacteria designed to live among the roots of corn plants and kill destructive worms. The Environmental Protection Agency, which was still establishing rules for such outdoor experiments, blocked Monsanto after Rifkin bombarded the agency with a series of petitions and threatened a lawsuit. Monsanto shelved the field test after an investment of roughly $2 million, saying it had never intended to create a marketable product from the microbes, but the episode - like the more recent BST flap - helped convince Monsanto of the need to sell biotechnology to the American public.
''I think the ability to communicate in plain language to nonscientists hasn't been a fine art,'' says Schneiderman, ''and a lot of people in the industry haven't thought it was very important. There has been a certain arrogance about science, sort of like the church in the Middle Ages.''
Moreover, Monsanto, like many other chemical companies, is dogged by a checkered public-safety record. In one of several lawsuits, for example, Monsanto, was accused of polluting the soil and air of Sturgeon, Mo., in a 1979 train accident that leaked a toxic chemical along a half-mile of track. A jury assessed $16 million in punitive damages, which Monsanto is still appealing.
Last August Monsanto created a new position, vice president of public policy. Filling this poase as official corporate conscience is Dr. Virginia V. Weldon, a 54-year-old pediatric endocrinologist and a former deputy vice chancellor at the Washington University School of Medicine.
''The public gives us the privilege to operate,'' says Weldon, ''particularly in the case of a company that makes the products that we do. It's absolutely essential that management decisions, business decisions, are made in the context of knowing what the public is thinking about.''
It was also Monsanto that, beginning seven years ago, called for the Government to spell out the Federal rules for biotechnology. In June 1986 the Reagan Administration responded by giving the F.D.A. responsibility to review and license genetically engineered drugs for people and animals; assigning similar responsibilities to the Environmental Protection Agency for biotechnology pesticides, and empowering the Department of Agriculture to oversee gene-altered crop plants and livestock.
''A lot of our competitors thought we were out of our ever-loving minds,'' remembers Will D. Carpenter, a Monsanto vice president who led the company's drive for regulations. ''But it was the right response, and it is the accepted position of the industry today.''
Will the future uphold Monsanto's vision of profits and plenty or, instead, confirm the critics' worst fears about the technology? ''In the modern age, we continually attempt to produce and consume nature's bounty faster than the environment can recycle the pollution and replenish the stock,'' says Jeremy Rifkin, who believes biotechnology can only accelerate this trend.
But for Monsanto's designated seer, Howard Schneiderman, biotechnology represents the best means for feeding tomorrow's multitudes. ''There are five billion people in the world today,'' he says. ''Some people say there should be two billion. Well, that's great. That's wishful. But that's not the way it's going to be. In the year 2030 there will be ten billion people.''
Indeed, regardless of how Monsanto proceeds, the biotechnology horse already may be out of the barn. The United States currently holds the international lead in most phases of biotechnology research and development. Yet according to Mark D. Dibner, director of the information division of the North Carolina Biotechnology Center, an economic development organization, only 90 or so American companies have made major investments in genetic engineering - compared with 230 large Japanese corporations.
Dibner worries about the consequences of further regulatory or legislative delays in this country: ''The bleakest scenario I can imagine would be to see our substantial investment in biotechnology R&D translated into more revenues for Japanese companies than for U.S. companies. Fortunately, the race has only just begun.''

HEADLINE: COOKING

BYLINE: By RICHARD FLASTE; Richard Flaste, the deputy editor of The Book Review, is the co-author of ''Pierre Franey's Low-Calorie Gourmet.''

 BODY:
Suddenly and for no apparent reason, on a recent azalea-brightened late spring day, I started to think about barbecued ribs, spicy-sweet and moist, and was captured by the thought of them.
Like anyone in the hot grip of an obsession-compulsion - like a serial killer or a crazed lover - I could not get the image out of my mind until I'd done something assertive, something cathartic. Fortunately, the cure in this case is benign: you cook the things slowly and well and then you devour them. But I wasn't going to eat ribs and nothing else (I wasn't that crazy), so I decided to surround them with vibrant Southern dishes. Here's that rib-provoked menu: Missouri ribs Buttermilk biscuits Tidewater coleslaw Honeyed tomatoes Mint julep peaches All those dishes came from this season's cookbooks, which, as a group, show distinct signs of the conservative retrenchment in cooking. The trend hallows regional tastes, the freshest ingredients and traditional techniques that are often pleasingly simple to execute. Servings can be large, and they don't have to be pretty. A warm-weather advantage is that this sort of cooking so often lends itself to outdoor activities: grilling, picnics and parties. 
There is no one true Southern food, since it varies so much from Maryland to Texas, but taken as a whole, Southern cooking is among the most enduring regional fare we have. Stubborn to the point of being oblivious, it relies on fats that are frequently scorned these days, but its earthiness and its bountiful use of seasonal vegetables give it a wholesome feeling, anyway.
The buttermilk biscuits I made came from Bill Neal's BISCUITS, SPOONBREAD, AND SWEET POTATO PIE (illustrated, 334 pp., Knopf, $19.95), an authoritative journey through the baking and related confectionary cooking of the South. Mr. Neal, the chef at Crook's Corner, an exuberant restaurant in Chapel Hill, N.C., is maturing into one of the most interesting and readable spokesmen for Southern cooking, which he likens more to Mexican than European cuisines.
Before I got going on those buttermilk biscuits I was led by Mr. Neal toward a deep appreciation of them. In a clear and lively writing style he expounds on the appeal of sour over sweet biscuits and explains the chemistry of why they rise (it's the carbon dioxide that emanates from the combination of cream of tartar and bicarbonate of soda in the commercial baking powder that is a staple of Southern baking). The astonishing thing about biscuits, if you've never made them before, is that they are baked in a matter of just a few minutes, ready long before the kitchen has had a chance to break into its sauna routine.
Other recipes here are authentic guides to the likes of shortbread, peach pudding and fried mush. An earlier book, ''Bill Neal's Southern Cooking'' (University of North Carolina), revised in 1989, is broader in scope, and the sensible companion to the current volume. (He has also edited a collection of Southern garden writing, ''Through the Garden Gate,'' reviewed on the facing page.) The Missouri ribs in my menu have their provenance partly in Missouri and partly in Cambridge, Mass., where Chris Schlesinger is the proprietor of the East Coast Grill. In a book they've titled THE THRILL OF THE GRILL: Techniques, Recipes, & Down-Home Barbecue (illustrated by Laura Hartman Maestro, photographs by Vincent Lee, 395 pp., Morrow, $24.95), Mr. Schlesinger and John Willoughby offer a wide-ranging, informative and inviting survey of grilling possibilities. Mr. Schlesinger is a professionally trained chef and a wellspring of practical tips. For instance, if you want to grill duck, a bird with enough flammable fat to qualify it as an incendiary device, it should be roasted first to remove most of the fat, and then finished on the grill.
The book manages to take you the considerable distance from sake-marinated grilled frogs' legs to grilled ham hocks and black-eyed peas. The section on barbecuing (a time-consuming process that is distinct from grilling) is written casually - it's a bit too folksy for me, actually - but it is an intense excursion into traditional approaches. It's all here: the pungent spare ribs of Kansas City as well as the smoky chopped pork of eastern North Carolina, the latter anointed as Mr. Schlesinger's ''personal favorite'' and the ''real original.'' The dish Mr. Schlesinger calls Missouri-style ribs (the ''style'' is there to signal a departure from traditional smoking in favor of more convenient first-stage cooking in the oven) is rubbed with dry spices and then very gently baked at 180 degrees for three hours before it is finished on the grill and doused in a vinegary sauce. The result is crusted on the outside and a miracle of tenderness inside. The Tidewater coleslaw I prepared also came from Mr. Schlesinger. It is a simple, biting mayonnaise-based slaw whose main flavorings are celery seed and vinegar.
A book that is more narrowly focused than its title might indicate is LEE BAILEY'S SOUTHERN FOOD & PLANTATION HOUSES (photographs by Tom Eckerle, 176 pp., Clarkson N. Potter, $30). What Mr. Bailey, a prolific food writer, did this time is go back to his aunt's home in Natchez, Miss., and - along with the Pilgrimage Garden Club there - create a collection of recipes inspired by that one small region of the South. Some are true to the letter of tradition, others true to no more than the spirit.
He offers elegant Southern menus, each framed by one of the grand houses of the area: ''Lunch Under the Trees at Edgewood'' is centered on an artful arrangement of shrimp, crawfish and crabmeat that he calls Natchez seafood salad. The photos here are, as they have been in Mr. Bailey's other books, stunning, with an emphasis in this volume that is as much on the mansions as it is on the food. Although he frequently diverges from strict Southern approaches (soy sauce and ginger on the barbecued brisket!), I will always have him to thank for my introduction to those honeyed baked tomatoes, Natchez-style (honey is drizzled over seeded tomato halves, and then they are topped with tarragon and bread crumbs).
The mint julep peaches - fruit quickly warmed in butter, sugar, bourbon and mint - came from a book with no Southern intentions at all, Betty Fussell's HOME PLATES: A Shopping, Cooking, Eating & Wine Guide for Everyday (illustrated, 224 pp., Dutton, $12.95), which will be available in a few weeks. In the past, Ms. Fussell has often demonstrated her scholarly appreciation of American regional cuisine. Here she offers up an idiosyncratic small book of efficiently written recipes that are meant to be lively but not exhausting. Ms. Fussell likes variations on a theme. So you get a recipe for beef strips cooked quickly with a Chinese-style star anise sauce, and then she urges you to use the same cut of beef with a Mexican sauce or a green sauce or brandied butter with peppercorns. It's all very simple, and playful, too.
As I continued to read and cook from the summer books, that simplicity of execution and playfulness kept popping up as themes. One of the happiest of the current books is THE YACHTING COOKBOOK: Glorious Menus and Quick Dishes Afloat and at Home by Elizabeth Wheeler and Jennifer Trainer (photographs by Kristen Brochmann, 160 pp., Crown, $30). No one actually needs a yacht to cook the dishes in this book. Cooking on boats forced these authors to use space and ingredients economically, and that sense of discipline is, of course, useful in small urban kitchens as well as mountaintop campsites. An offering that seems to please them especially - they testify that their ''friends are crazy about this dish'' - is a grilled butterflied leg of lamb with a mustard vinaigrette.
Although a boned leg of lamb is awkward to maneuver on a grill, everything else in the preparation and cooking is usually a snap, and the finished dish is almost always impressive no matter whose recipe you're following. This one calls for a heavy mustard marinade and then a thick mustard sauce (accented with mint). It's pungent, wholly successful, and it gave me the confidence to keep working my way through the book and its other, often splendid, straightforward recipes. The recipes are couched in menus that emphasize fruit and fresh vegetables and often minimize the cooking. For instance, there's the ''cozy cabin dinner'' with its chili, corn bread, green salad, sliced tomatoes and banana crisp.
Mark Charles Miller's COYOTE CAFE: Foods From the Great Southwest (illustrated, 192 pp., Ten Speed Press, $24.95) arrived on bookshelves earlier than some of the other books, but it looks as if it were meant for summer all along. On nearly every page, brilliantly colored illustrations evoke the American desert, its people, wildlife and vegetation. Mr. Miller owns the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M. He appears to be an extraordinarily skilled chef, and he writes well. The food he offers here is Southwestern, which is to say it is strongly influenced by the lusty peasant cooking of Mexico: refried beans, chicken tamales and the like. But since Mr. Miller has evidently scaled the heights of cuisine, there's a lot of elegance here as well: lobster and scallops with vanilla in corn husks or confit of duck tamale begins to show some of his creativity at work. One of the most popular dishes at his restaurant is a lot simpler, a fried steak with red chili onion rings, and a recipe for that is included, too.
A book that's bound to be welcomed by many cooks this summer is THE LOAVES AND FISHES PARTY COOKBOOK by Anna Pump and Sybille Pump with Gen LeRoy (illustrated by Melanie Parks, 238 pp., Harper & Row, $19.95). It's organized around the seasons, and the section on summer parties includes recipe suggestions and menus for occasions ranging from a brunch for six to a wedding reception for 40. The dishes are often intended for early preparation, like the chilled veal rolls, filled with a mixture of veal, bacon, mushrooms and onion, or a lemon-basil chicken salad. The aim is to help you plan an event so well that when the guests arrive ''you should be free to be outside with them,'' soaking up as much good weather as everyone else.
The book is written with the kind of enthusiasm that often degenerates into treacle in recipe books, but in this case it escapes that pitfall and is cheerfully reassuring instead. Maybe too reassuring. That wedding reception for 40 calls for serving a shrimp salad that begins with 10 pounds of shrimp, poached and shelled. Now, let's see. That's about 300 shrimp to shell. Better get help.

They're Just Wild About Trail Blazers

BYLINE: By NAOMI KAUFMAN

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Ore.
Hillary Bella could manage only a hoarse whisper after four hours of surgery on the night last week when Portland took on Detroit in Game 1 of the National Basketball Association finals.
''What happened in the game?'' she asked as she awoke.
Then there's the synchronized-swimming team that has had practice on game nights. They swim to the play-by-play, and dive when the Trail Blazers make a basket. 
Such is the extent of Blazermania, the rabid devotion here to the home team.
Forget Californians moving in by the condo-loads. Forget drug-dealing youth gangs. Forget the inexorable drip, drip, drip of the rain. Forget even ''Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles.''
''The Blazers are doing good now, and the Ninja Turtles were a hit a long time ago,'' explained 10-year-old Sean Meehan.
Blazermania started here in 1977, the last time the Blazers won the championship or even went to the finals. It has barely abated for 13 years, but this year has reached a pitch that transcends divisions of class, race and politics.
''How about those Blazers?'' a demonstrator asked Officer Derrick Foxworth between throwing eggs and spitting during a protest of President Bush's visit last month.
''It's something that just brings the city together: it's pride,'' said Foxworth, who has taken to wearing a Blazers baseball cap to work.
The team is counting on its rabid following to help it against the Pistons today as it begins the first of three games here with the series tied at 1-1. The fervor of the Portland fans is widely credited with helping the team to a 44-6 home record, including playoff games, this season.
Part of Blazermania is the city's location. Portlanders are a parochial lot, isolated from big-city attention. The Trail Blazers are the only major league team in the city, which has a population of 432,000 in a metropolitan region of 1.36 million.
The city's relative obscurity in times zones east of the Mississippi prompted The Detroit Free Press to run a locator map on its editorial page; that led the Portland daily, The Oregonian, to respond that when the Detroit Tigers won the World Series in 1984, its ''fans celebrated by setting the city on fire.''
''We're a medium-size city that wants some of the benefits of the big city, like recognition, which we envy, without some of the problems,'' said Elliot Weiner, executive director of the Oregon Psychological Association. ''This is boosting our civic ego.''
''It's like your high school team going to the state finals,'' said Kevin Kelly, a former all-state forward who is president of U.S. National Bank of Oregon. ''No matter what size we get, Portland will always be a small town.''
While no one expects Roger Smith to up and move General Motors to Portland if the Blazers beat the Pistons, the city sees an economic boost from the games.
Mayor J. E. (Bud) Clark said the championship ''heightens the excitement about the city of Portland off the top of the scale more than you ever see it.''
''The team,'' said Kay Bryant, marketing manager of the Oregon Economic Development Department, ''represents the state of Oregon extremely well: tough individuals who know how to come together when it counts.''
It's almost impossible to avoid the team colors, black and red. The Compleat Fan can start with a cap with the signatures of the starters on it; a T-shirt showing Portland's Clyde Drexler going up against Detroit's Isiah Thomas; black and red sweatpants; boxer shorts with the Blazers' logo, or, for women, panties emblazoned with ''Red Hot'' on one side and ''Rollin' '' on the other. Key chains. Earrings. Refrigerator magnets. A clothes hamper bearing the logo that is called a Dirty Dunk.
''It looks like a goal and backboard and net, so a kid can dunk his clothes in,'' said J. Isaac, the team's director of game operations.
The city is so excited and engrossed, said Weiner, the psychologist, that if the team loses, ''we're going to need a Blazers loss crisis hot line.''
''Those people who are so up now are going to be so down,'' he said.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Long-Magical Charm Is Wearing Out

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
My first encounter with Saab's 900 Turbo was not a case of love at first sight. For one thing, the car looked like nothing else on the road. For another, it was different in the way that it approached almost everything.
But it did zero to 60 in less than 10 seconds, and it grew on me quickly. 
That was in 1982, and I had taken a gray 900 Turbo to Vermont for a class in high-speed driving. It was me and about a hundred cops, and I learned, among other things, that the reason you get stopped on the road is that your driving or your car is somehow different from that of the otherwise boring parade.
So, in truth, I should know better than to be driving 1990's eye-catching red version of that long-ago standout. But I have been careful, and as much as this year's Turbo Saab wants to get down and flat-out go, I haven't had any official conversations.
The tester was a top-of-the-line SPG, a moniker that stands for Special Performance Group, and the accouterments of its 2-liter four make the limited-production hatchback quite different from lesser 900's, of which there is a quartet.
The SPG has a new Mitsubishi turbocharger and it puts out 175 horsepower, the most for any Saab ever to visit these shores. That is 15 more than the standard Turbo and a whole herd more than the 128 horses available in the naturally aspirated Saab.
All the same, economy is up, and a week of driving averaged 27 miles per gallon, considerably better than the Federal estimate of 20 m.p.g. in the city and 28 on the highway. The new car also has a larger fuel tank, which now holds 18 gallons of gas, which in the SPG's case is spelled p-r-e-m-i-u-m.
In keeping with the car's speed, there are standard antilock brakes and an airbag in the hub of the four-spoke wheel, although it should be said that those items are standard on all of Saab's models. And the company is to be complimented. It is high time that someone recognized an across-the-board need for ABS, which shortens braking distances and allows retention of steering control in panic stops.
Pretty much everything else is standard on the SPG, too, and the car - which comes only in Talladega Red and black - is a symphony in leather-smelling technology.
That is the good side. And on that side, there are the other things that will please Saab aficianados: the odd hood that slides forward and then tips vertically to expose the longitudinally mounted engine, the ignition lock on the floor between the front buckets, the concave swoop of the huge hatch.
There is the craftsmanship and the solidity. The implied ''but,'' however, may be a big one these days, when far less expensive cars offer many more toys to a buyer. And, frankly, the car that appealed to me in 1982 is a car that feels outdated today.
For 1990, the SPG has aerodynamic lower panels and a slick look that extends to its special wheels, smoothly molded in a three-spoke aluminum exercise. There is central locking and the usual power equipment, but the car lacks a lot of the niceties.
There are no lighted mirrors in the sun visors. There is no electronic display, no systems check or driver information center to tell you instantaneous fuel economy or average speed. Unlike a lot of automobiles today, this car can't estimate your time of arrival.
The top of the dash slopes all over the place, and there is a shelf that is useless because its bottom slants. Electric window buttons are on the floor and the temperature controls are mismatched arrows that tell you nothing. The 900 is a vehicle that makes the owner's manual required reading.
The airbag in the leather-wrapped and four-spoked wheel has resulted in two small and hard-to-find buttons for the horn. At that wheel, you discover a seat that is manually adjusted, and the fore-aft lever and large round knob for seatback position leave much to be desired.
The seats are firm, and they gang up with a very stiff suspension to make potholed pavement a serious trial.
Cargo capacity is awesome, but the hatch that covers it is equally awesome and as heavy as it is high and hard to pull down.
None of this will much matter to true Saab fans, though. The 900's design is one that you love or hate. It has been around with few changes since the mid-70's, and the company has counted on what it calls ''the unique Saab soul'' to win converts.
That has worked for a long time, and the magic was surprising eight years ago when the price of a Turbo seemed hefty at $16,550. Today, the sticker on an SPG reads $28,995, and that pits the car against some truly heavy competition. It might be that Saab needs to come up with a new car, one that is, well . . . different.

HEADLINE: GYMNASTICS;
Spirited Comeback Has Its Rough Side

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, June 9

 BODY:
What a wonderful drama it almost was.
In 1988, Charles Lakes became the first black American, man or woman, to compete in Olympic gymnastics. He placed 19th in the Olympic all-around competition, the highest by an American man in Seoul, South Korea.
Then he stopped competing for 19 months to earn a living. Six weeks ago, he started training again. This week, ready or not, he competed in the United States championships, at age 25 the oldest in the field. 
It would be nice to report that his comeback was a smashing success. It was not. He was enthusiastic and exciting. He was also rusty.
He had three comparative disasters, and this afternoon he finished 31st among the 47 senior men with 104.88 points. John Roethlisberger, a 19-year-old Minnesota sophomore from Minneapolis, won with 114.30. Fourteen-year-old Kim Zmeskal of Houston won the women's title.
In Thursday night's compulsory exercises, Lakes had low scores on the horizontal bar (8.15 of a possible 10 points) and the pommel horse (7.15). On the horizontal bar, the judges and a jury of appeals said he had left out a required move.
 
Disaster on Horizontal Bar
Today, in the compulsory exercises, he scored only 8.2 on the horizontal bar after falling twice.
Still, Lakes said he had no regrets about his return. He obviously loves gymnastics, a love that began with the 1976 Olympics.
''I was 11 years old then,'' he said. ''I had a bed with slats, and I kept breaking it with front flips. Then I watched the Olympics on TV and I said, 'Oh my God, all that stuff I've been doing all these years at the playground and at home, it's a sport.' The next year, I started training with Dan in Van Nuys, Calif.''
After the 1988 Olympics, Lakes decided to take at least a year off.
''But I always planned to come back,'' he said. ''I was far from reaching my potential, and I thought I had a lot more to offer America and the sport. There was no important competition for me in 1989, anyway.
''But coming back hasn't been easy. I had been on the road all of 1989, flying almost weekly, talking to kids and corporations, giving autographs, doing exhibitions, making appearances, lots of things.''
Lakes intended to resume training in January. Then he learned a basic lesson in economics.
''I discovered it's very expensive to try to train full time without funds,'' he said.
Six weeks ago, Lakes decided to return to the gym. Three weeks later, he qualified for the nationals. But Dan Connelly, Lakes's longtime coach, said time was too short.
''You have to have meet experience,'' he told Lakes. ''Certain things have been missing here. You should have been in two other meets before this one.''
Others agreed with Connelly that this was not the Charles Lakes of old. Lakes hardly heard. ''I'm strong,'' he said. ''I've been going all out. We're playing a comeback game. We're doing well. We're on track. So I can't possibly be discouraged. I may be down, but I'm not out. I will be back.''
 
 JOHNSON DROPS TO THIRD
 Seventeen-year-old Brandy Johnson of Altamonte Springs, Fla., the women's defender, led until her last two events. Then she fell off the balance beam and tumbled off the mat in the floor exercise. She finished third with 76.97 points behind 77.42 for Zmeskel and 77.00 for Betty Okino of Elmhurst, Ill.
Behind Roethlisberger were Chris Waller of Mount Prospect, Ill., with 113.90 and Lance Ringnald of Albuquerque, N.M., with 113.78. Bill Roth of Mohegan Lake, N.Y., scored a 10 on the horizontal bar, the first ever by a man in these championships.
The junior champions were 13-year-old Hilary Grivich of Huntsville, Tex., among the women and 18-year-old Jair Lynch of Washington among the men.

 BODY:
DRUGS, violence and death may be all too familiar on the streets of Hartford, but hope is there, too. That is what art students at Weaver High School say in ''The Streets of Hartford: An Exhibition of Provocative Art and Information.''
The exhibition, which opened on Thursday evening and runs through June 20, fills the auditorium lobby at Weaver, where 95 percent of the students are black, and 5 percent are Hispanic.
Among the exhibition's works are life-size statues, including a young man crucified by the drug economy; large painted panels, with one depicting a ''drugmobile''; a work 8 feet high and 25 feet long on preventing AIDS; photographs, and posters on topics like ''Black Females and Their Life Chances.'' 
The works feature dismaying images and statistics. One poster says, for instance, that one black girl in five drops out of high school.
''We wanted to give something to the community, and at least make them aware of what's going on,'' a senior, Jacqueline Lock, said. ''Our peers are committing the crimes, selling the drugs. We want to make the young people think twice about doing it.''
The works are mainly group projects by 40 students of John Karrer. Mr. Karr has taught art at Weaver since he arrived 23 years ago as an intern pursuing a master's degree in teaching.
Mr. Karrer said that two years ago, after seeing the movie ''Cry Freedom,'' his students organized a large exhibition on apartheid. It included life-size statues from plaster casts of the students' bodies.
This year, the students wanted to present another large exhibition, focusing on their city, ''including apartheid closer to home,'' said Mr. Karrer. He noted that ''Streets'' dealt with many of topics in the earlier show, like health care.
''Streets,'' which took two months to prepare, is dedicated to the children of the community.
''It is to them that we present this exhibit,'' a poster says. ''For without a determined effort on our part, they will inherit the same problems that we illustrate.''
 
'I Look for Reality'
An eight-foot-square panel introducing the exhibition shows a little boy sitting on a step. The panel is based on a photograph by a senior, Trina Cashaw. Several of her other photographs are on view, including one of a teen-age mother playing with her child.
''I don't look for beauty,'' Miss Cashaw said. ''I look for reality.''
Many panels represent a grim reality. ''Chariots of Death,'' eight feet square, in red and black, shows a drug dealer's van. Students wrote that such vehicles, with their booming speakers, ''announce the merchants of death'' and that their presence ''robs the community of the right to use city streets without fear of being killed.''
On another panel is a life-size statue of a young man, hanging as if on a cross. The ''skin'' is made of brown-washed newspaper clippings with headlines like ''Shooting Kills City Youth.''
The students covered the panel with paintings of $5 bills. Mr. Karrer said that the young man was sacrificed not so much to drugs as to ''the economy of drugs.''
An art student, Derrick Perkins, said: ''This shows an inner-city youth who thought drugs were the only way of life. The money represents death.''
 
Infant-Mortality Rate
A panel on infant mortality has numerous black footprints painted on it, with three marked in red, ''Deceased.'' Mr. Karrer said that in some neighborhoods in the state capital, the infant-mortality rate was worse than in some third-world countries.
An eight-foot-square panel depicting a bright yellow school bus deals with integration. Mr. Karrer noted that some city parents were pressing to regionalize schools, which could disperse the students who now attend Weaver.
''We have mixed feelings about that,'' Mr. Karrer said. ''We're quite quite proud of Weaver.''
A poster near the bus panel has a quote from Mr. Perkins, ''The world is really paisley, but somehow the white always shines through.''
Another panel is largely blank. ''We brainstormed and discussed the streets of Hartford for months,'' the text says, ''and only then, we thought of them - the elderly. This panel represents the 'invisible' elderly residents in our community.''
Also in the exhibition is a full-size copy of an 8-by-25-foot billboard on AIDS prevention. The original, by students of another art teacher, Genie Odoms, visited high schools around the state for the State Department of Health until it wore out.
 
'Famous Last Words>
The billboard's colorful panels include ''Famous Last Words.'' The quotes, like ''Let me borrow your works,'' and, ''It won't happen to me,'' are in yellow letters on gray tombstones.
Other works in the exhibition, which was mounted with a grant from Aetna Life and Casualty Company, deal with law enforcement, housing and ''black males and life chances.''
As the show's opening drew closer, students pasted text onto posters, drew Hartford skyscrapers on a large panel and prepared other statues, including one of a young drug dealer bedecked with gold jewelry and another of a more experienced dealer wearing shackles - painted bright gold.
Mr. Karrer smiled when a metal-shop teacher presented a sample shackle and said other colleagues had helped, too. He also ground a pair of ears, trying to make them smooth before attaching them to a statue.
''Each statue takes 60 hours to do,'' Miss Lock said. She described the procedure - making a mold and wood frame, modeling with automobile-body putty, letting the statue dry and then painting it.
A poster - ''Where Do We Go From Here?'' - was printed with the names of colleges where members of the high school's Class of 1990 have been accepted, including the University of Connecticut, the University of Hartford, Harvard and Howard Universities. ''They're super kids,'' said Mr. Karrer. The show can be seen during school hours.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Neglected To Cite Lilco Deal

 BODY:
The article by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo (''Helping the Island Helps the State,'' May 6) mentions the amounts of money that the state is spending on high-tech industries, research and transportation to help the Island's economy. But it neglects to mention the much larger amount that will be removed from the Island if the Governor's deal with Lilco sticks.
This state is the most heavily over-taxed in the nation, and we are the most debt-ridden, with three times more debt than the runner-up (California). But the deal with Lilco tops even those figures. Island ratepayers now pay the highest rates among the 800 or so United States utilities; and while the average U.S. utility rate will show a slight decrease by the year 2000, ours will increase by another 60 to 100 percent. 
There never was any technical reason for Shoreham, especially in this hydro-rich area. New York may be the worst among 50 states when it comes to debt and taxes; but thanks to an Islander (Robert Moses), we rank no. 2 in hydro-power, and we border the largest hydro region in the world: Quebec. Hydro would be the ideal source of electric power for the Island, especially since we already paid for part of it. New Jersey was even able to win a share of this power from New York by suing in Federal court, but we on the Island who are part of the Governor's ''Great Family of New York'' receive only a trickle (about 6 percent). And while this part of the state has the highest national rates, the other side of the state (Solvay, N.Y.) has the lowest, on hydro. Hydro that we all paid for.
In the past, the Governor has rightfully complained about the largest Federal scandal in history: the savings and loan mess, but the Shoreham mess impacts the Island even more than savings and loan. Compare the numbers:
Savings and loan cost $300 billion for 240 million Americans Shoreham cost an easy $10 billion for 3 million Islanders Now we are to believe that the state is actually helping us, and the numbers mentioned in the article look impressive; but they are chickenfeed when compared to the damage that has and will be done by the Governor's Lilco sellout.

HEADLINE: Surprise Charges Upset Condo Buyers

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Apartment buyers in the expensive new Belaire condominium in Manhattan's Upper East Side got the news in April that their monthly common charges were going up 16 percent, and when the annual meeting of owners convened last month, many were in a mood to argue.
''A lot of people showed up and the general tone was one of griping,'' said Richard H. Truitt, a member of the Belaire's board of managers, and president of Gavin Anderson Doremus & Company, the public relations firm. ''Among the gripes were statements that people didn't anticipate that common charges would go up this much.''
The disgruntled owners were not alone. The New York State Attorney General's Bureau of Real Estate Financing reports that complaints of condominium sponsors' underestimating monthly common charges - which pay for upkeep, insurance and building-staff salaries - come in regularly. 
''We get frequent complaints about it,'' said Frederick K. Mehlman, the assistant attorney general who supervises cooperative and condominium sales. ''As a general rule we don't get too involved in it because these costs are projections, and it's difficult to be exact. Otherwise it comes down to showing that fraud has been committed in the projections of carrying costs.''
The law, Mr. Mehlman added, lets owners rescind their purchase contracts if common charges have been underestimated by more than 25 percent.
Buyers of newly developed or converted co-ops should expect the same unpleasant surprises, said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, whose members are officers of co-ops and condominiums throughout the city.
''It's typical in a conversion co-op that the budget set by the sponsor is not the budget that will be passed by the board,'' she said.
''You see maintenance charge increases in the first year on the order of 15 and 20 percent to bring things up to the level the owners want.
''They may want the floors cleaned more often or better materials used or an extra employee - there are any number of extra expenses that may be needed to bring the building up to snuff.''
Mrs. Rothman cited her first rule of buying a co-op or condominium: Have an expert read the offering plan, and if monthly common charges are an important part of a buyer's budget, the sponsor's estimated costs should be scrutinized with special care.
But among some of the buyers in the Belaire, at 524 East 72d Street, between York Avenue and the East River Drive, as well as in some other new buildings, there is a sense of having been snookered. Managing agents say that particularly hard hit are the many foreigners who do not speak English and who plan their budgets by the sponsor's monthly cost projections.
THEIR budgets go out the window with the projections after the first year when the elevator and air-conditioning and garbage compactor warranties expire, among other things, and additional tens of thousands of dollars that were unbudgeted in the sponsor's offering must suddenly be raised.
''It's not just the elevators,'' said Michael Graff, president of the board of managers of the Alfred, a three-year-old condominium at 161 West 61st Street between Broadway and Columbus Avenue. ''It's the boiler, the air-conditioning, the compressors, the marble and brass polishing. All of the routine maintenance charges had been tremendously underestimated.''
Charges at the Alfred rose modestly, by just 5 percent, in the first year of apartment-owner control, Mr. Graf said, but only because the sponsor had greatly overestimated insurance costs, producing savings in the new budget that largely offset about $70,000 in unexpected maintenance costs.
Annual budget increases at condominiums and co-ops are running about 5 percent, driven largely by increases in labor costs and, in the case of co-ops, by tax increases, said Allan Rogers, managing director of Douglas Elliman, the management firm.
As for fights between sponsors and owners of recently sold-out condominiums, they are part of the real estate landscape, said Edward Coleman, managing director of Brown Harris Stevens, another of the city's leading management firm.
''Generally any time the board of directors takes control from the sponsor there are complaints about everything,'' Mr. Coleman said. ''It's the general nature, because once they take control, they see things differently.''
At the 181-unit Belaire, the budget in the final amendment to the offering plan was $1,195,302. The second-year budget - the first controlled by the owners instead of the sponsor - had to be raised to $1,324,634.
Among the increases were $129,600 in previously unbudgeted building repair and maintenance expenses. Of that amount, a $25,000 increase in insurance costs - to $98,300 - was an unforeseeable product of a ''volatile'' insurance market, said Arthur W. Zeckendorf, the building sponsor and a member of the prominent family of New York developers.
Most of the rest of maintenance and repair increases were for costs that were either unbudgeted or involved items that the offering plan showed costing very little. Elevator costs rose from $3,500 in the first-year budget to $30,000 for a half-year's maintenance contract in the second - meaning that a full year's cost will be $60,000. The $20,000 for plumbing and heating repairs in the new budget, $38,000 for window cleaning, $8,600 for air-conditioning service contracts and $5,000 for painting were not even budgeted in the offering plan.
Speaking of the offering-plan budget, Mr. Truitt said: ''I am not able to tell whether these were just promotional figures, which the sponsor knew would go up later, or simply bad guesses. Some people in the building see this as a plot to attract buyers by advertising the lowest common charges and making a kind of bait-and-switch.''
In fact, two owners are withholding their monthly common charges, in an action reminiscent of a tenant rent strike, to protest the building's management. A total of 167 condominiums have been sold, and 14 are still on the market. A typical two-bedroom apartment in the Belaire costs about $500,000, with monthly common charges averaging $525 before the increase and $609 after.
Mr. Truitt believes the complaints of a deliberate underestimate of monthly charges are unfounded.
''I don't see it that way,'' he said. ''I've been involved in starting up two other buildings and I went into this building expecting it to happen. It's like building a house or anything else: You don't know what things are going to cost until you move in.''
Monthly common charges have become an integral part of many condominium developers' advertising campaigns. A few year ago, when the market was still rising, typical ads featured elegant couples in evening clothes posing with lush automobiles in front of the project.
These days, the condominium ads are just as likely to look like an accountant's spreadsheet, with rows of figures showing purchase prices, financing, taxes, monthly common charges and mortgage-interest tax savings to the buyer.
Mr. Zeckendorf defended his building's fiscal record by pointing out that the offering plan warned buyers of the expiration of the elevator guarantee and the consequent need for a service contract. Labor and insurance costs are unpredictable, he went on, and their volatility was also disclosed in the offering plan.
As for the $38,000 window-cleaning charge, Mr. Zeckendorf, whose family has built other expensive condominiums in Manhattan, said, ''You can't think of everything.''
''When you're just starting construction of a building,'' he said, ''your biggest concern is getting the windows in. You don't think about cleaning them.'' He said the common window-cleaning contract would prove to be a benefit to all the owners.
As it happens, the new owners of another Zeckendorf Company condominium, the three-year-old Copley at 68th and Broadway, also experienced a surprise over window cleaning. The offering plan stated that the windows would be cleaned, said Steven Sklar, president of the condominium's board of managers, but no money was budgeted for the work there either.
Co-ops are subject to the same problems, the experts say, although co-ops operate differently from condominiums in their management and in the fact that monthly maintenance charges, as they are known, include payments on the building's mortgage and taxes. In a condominium, each unit is taxed separately, and owners pay for their own mortgages, if they have one.
''So the only good news in this is that carrying charges for a condominium are reasonably modest, compared to a co-op,'' said Mrs. Rothman of the Council of New York Cooperatives. ''Twenty-five percent of $200 may be painful but not back-breaking, but 25 percent of $700 is much more serious.''
Richard Clurman, head of real estate law practice for the firm of Phillips Nizer Benjamin Krim and Ballon, said that common charge shock was more likely in the current soft market for condominiums because sales people are pressing harder to make sales. Mr. Clurman, who wrote the state's modern co-op and condominium law during his tenure as an assistant attorney general in the early 1960's, added that vigilance is the only prevention for surprise.
''There's a general pattern of high-pressure selling in condos,'' he said, ''and sales people are doing a lot of talking and promising that they never used to do. So I always warn my clients to expect higher charges, because you can't rely on projections.''
MR. GRAFF, the president of the Alfred's board of managers, said all misunderstandings would be solvable by having offering plans include second-year budget estimates.
''There should have been estimates of the costs after the one-year guarantees expire, and there weren't,'' he said. ''That's a question that the Attorney General should easily be able to make part of the process and there would be fewer surprises.''
Mr. Graff noted that ''a careful reading'' of the offering plan would have revealed the expiration of the manufacturer's warranty on the building's three Otis elevators, and the consequent addition of more than $50,000 in annual costs.
The principals at Carroll Management, the Alfred's sponsor, are out of the country, said a woman who took a request for comment. She refused to give her name, but said that ''a 5 percent increase [in charges] after one year does not seem like particularly bad budgeting.''
Two-bedroom apartments in the Alfred have sold for about $400,000, Mr. Graff said. There are 214 units in the building, and common charges run about $530 a month.
Among the frustrations of being an unpaid director of a new multimillion-dollar housing corporation are the elevators. At both the Alfred and the Belaire, the elevators employ new, proprietary computer systems whose technical mysteries their manufacturers refuse to share with independent repair firms. A result, as Mr. Graff put it, is that boards are handed elevator service contracts on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.
''We're completely at their mercy because they can charge whatever they want,'' he said. ''In fact, they made us take a five-year contract and there was not much we could do. We can either go along with them or install new elevators.''
The servicing controls that modern elevator manufacturers are putting on their products show up in the maintenance charges. While a new, computerized elevator in a high-rise condominium tower may cost upwards of $20,000 each to service, a service contract for a manual elevator in a midrise prewar building, using a technology serviceable by several companies, costs about $6,000 a year.
MR. TRUITT, of the Belaire, made the point that problems over steep cost increases can be more difficult to handle in a condominium than in a co-op, since co-op boards exercise much more power over the operation of the building, starting from governing the admission of new owners.
''Speaking as the public relations man, I have always argued that communication is the best way to head off these problems,'' he said. ''Too often sponsors go from no communication at all to a kind of militaristic approach to owners.'' As for the costs, they will not stand still. ''I wouldn't be surprised at all if the rates have to go up again, inflation being what it is,'' he said.
''All members of the board are concerned about keeping those rates down, but it is not a mature building yet, and rates are going to bounce around a lot.''

 CORRECTION:
Apartment buyers in the expensive new Belaire condominium in Manhattan's Upper East Side got the news in April that their monthly common charges were going up 16 percent, and when the annual meeting of owners convened last month, many were in a mood to argue.
''A lot of people showed up and the general tone was one of griping,'' said Richard H. Truitt, a member of the Belaire's board of managers, and president of Gavin Anderson Doremus & Company, the public relations firm. ''Among the gripes were statements that people didn't anticipate that common charges would go up this much.''
The disgruntled owners were not alone. The New York State Attorney General's Bureau of Real Estate Financing reports that complaints of condominium sponsors' underestimating monthly common charges - which pay for upkeep, insurance and building-staff salaries - come in regularly.
''We get frequent complaints about it,'' said Frederick K. Mehlman, the assistant attorney general who supervises cooperative and condominium sales. ''As a general rule we don't get too involved in it because these costs are projections, and it's difficult to be exact. Otherwise it comes down to showing that fraud has been committed in the projections of carrying costs.''
The law, Mr. Mehlman added, lets owners rescind their purchase contracts if common charges have been underestimated by more than 25 percent.
Buyers of newly developed or converted co-ops should expect the same unpleasant surprises, said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, whose members are officers of co-ops and condominiums throughout the city.
''It's typical in a conversion co-op that the budget set by the sponsor is not the budget that will be passed by the board,'' she said.
''You see maintenance charge increases in the first year on the order of 15 and 20 percent to bring things up to the level the owners want.
''They may want the floors cleaned more often or better materials used or an extra employee - there are any number of extra expenses that may be needed to bring the building up to snuff.''
Mrs. Rothman cited her first rule of buying a co-op or condominium: Have an expert read the offering plan, and if monthly common charges are an important part of a buyer's budget, the sponsor's estimated costs should be scrutinized with special care.
But among some of the buyers in the Belaire, at 524 East 72d Street, between York Avenue and the East River Drive, as well as in some other new buildings, there is a sense of having been snookered. Managing agents say that particularly hard hit are the many foreigners who do not speak English and who plan their budgets by the sponsor's monthly cost projections.
THEIR budgets go out the window with the projections after the first year when the elevator and air-conditioning and garbage compactor warranties expire, among other things, and additional tens of thousands of dollars that were unbudgeted in the sponsor's offering must suddenly be raised.
''It's not just the elevators,'' said Michael Graff, president of the board of managers of the Alfred, a three-year-old condominium at 161 West 61st Street between Broadway and Columbus Avenue. ''It's the boiler, the air-conditioning, the compressors, the marble and brass polishing. All of the routine maintenance charges had been tremendously underestimated.''
Charges at the Alfred rose modestly, by just 5 percent, in the first year of apartment-owner control, Mr. Graf said, but only because the sponsor had greatly overestimated insurance costs, producing savings in the new budget that largely offset about $70,000 in unexpected maintenance costs.
Annual budget increases at condominiums and co-ops are running about 5 percent, driven largely by increases in labor costs and, in the case of co-ops, by tax increases, said Allan Rogers, managing director of Douglas Elliman, the management firm.
As for fights between sponsors and owners of recently sold-out condominiums, they are part of the real estate landscape, said Edward Coleman, managing director of Brown Harris Stevens, another of the city's leading management firm.
''Generally any time the board of directors takes control from the sponsor there are complaints about everything,'' Mr. Coleman said. ''It's the general nature, because once they take control, they see things differently.''
At the 181-unit Belaire, the budget in the final amendment to the offering plan was $1,195,302. The second-year budget - the first controlled by the owners instead of the sponsor - had to be raised to $1,324,634.
Among the increases were $129,600 in previously unbudgeted building repair and maintenance expenses. Of that amount, a $25,000 increase in insurance costs - to $98,300 - was an unforeseeable product of a ''volatile'' insurance market, said Arthur W. Zeckendorf, the building sponsor and a member of the prominent family of New York developers.
Most of the rest of maintenance and repair increases were for costs that were either unbudgeted or involved items that the offering plan showed costing very little. Elevator costs rose from $3,500 in the first-year budget to $30,000 for a half-year's maintenance contract in the second - meaning that a full year's cost will be $60,000. The $20,000 for plumbing and heating repairs in the new budget, $38,000 for window cleaning, $8,600 for air-conditioning service contracts and $5,000 for painting were not even budgeted in the offering plan.
Speaking of the offering-plan budget, Mr. Truitt said: ''I am not able to tell whether these were just promotional figures, which the sponsor knew would go up later, or simply bad guesses.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Times Square Novelty;
North of Duffy Sq., a Butler-on-Every-Floor Hotel

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
THE Latin Quarter. Cotton Club. Coca-Cola. Castro Convertibles. With its hot nightclubs, dazzling signs and sprawling showrooms, the block at the northern end of the ''bowtie'' formed by Broadway and Seventh Avenue was always an important part of old Times Square. The developer Jeffrey Katz is betting that a $220-a-night hotel with butlers on every floor will suit the new Times Square, as well.
Five years after Mr. Katz bought the first of two parcels on the trapezoidal block between 47th and 48th Streets, demolition has begun on the small buildings and enormous signs that have been there for decades.
By the end of 1991, if all goes according to plan, the 25-story Ramada Renaissance Times Square hotel will be standing in their place, with a 310-foot-high sign tower at its ''prow.'' Mr. Katz, who heads Sherwood Equities of Manhattan, will develop the building, with financing from the Chase Manhattan Bank. Ramada International Hotels and Resorts of Hong Kong, a division of the New World Development Company, will lease the hotel space for 49 years, with a 50-year option. Mr. Katz would not discuss the terms. 
The architects reponsible for the design were Mayers & Schiff Associates of Manhattan, who worked with Costas Kondylis Architects, also of Manhattan.
The building will have about 200,000 square feet of space. Zoning rules prescribe a floor-area ratio of 14.4 on the 14,000-square-foot lot. Mr. Katz briefly entertained the dream of building at a floor-area ration of 21.5 (about 301,000 square feet), taking advantage of West Midtown zoning incentives, plus a subway improvement bonus. But the incentive expired in May 1988, before he could begin work.
Mr. Katz said he ''never expected to beat the zoning deadline,'' although he thought that the floor-area ration would be reduced to 15 -not 14.4 - when the bonus ended. ''We got nicked a little bit,'' he said, ''but the loss of 0.6 F.A.R. in a project of this kind had little impact. What would have killed us would have been if they had prevented signs.''
While other developers in an around Times Square have looked for lots that would permit large floor areas and balked at large signs, Mr. Katz said his project ''always was a completely different animal.''
''From the inception, it was about signage and retail,'' he said. ''The third leg - and the least important, financially - was what happened upstairs. The concept was maximum retail value and maximum signage value.''
Mr. Katz's involvement in Times Square began in 1985, quite unexpectedly. As he recalled it, ''I got a call from a broker on a Friday afternoon in summer - you know the feeling, when you think your're the only person left in New York City?''
The broker, Stanley H. Kovak of Julien J. Studley, told Mr. Katz about a 10,000-square-foot parcel on 48th Street. The two-story building on the site had been the Latin Quarter, and before that, the downtown home of the Cotton Club.
The attraction was immediate and within two weeks, Mr. Katz had signed a contract. That left a 4,000-square-foot parcel on 47th Street, overlooking Duffy Square, where the Coca-Cola sign had long been a fixture and where Castro Convertibles did business until 1983. But the sellers of the 48th Street lot discouraged Mr. Katz's ambitions.
''We were told that the owner, who was then in his 80's, had promised his father on his father's death bed that he would never sell the property,'' Mr. Katz said, ''and that if we had any expectations of getting this parcel, we should just forget them.''
In approaching the owner, the team from Sherwood Equities was prepared for extremely tough bargaining. ''Just the opposite happened,'' Mr. Katz said. ''We came to an agreement in 20 minutes and went to contract in a few days.''
SHERWOOD purchased the north parcel in December 1985 for $6.85 million and the south parcel in April 1986 for $5.1 million, a land cost that amounted to about 60 a developable square foot.
''We knew we had just about the most extraordinary site in Times Square,'' Mr. Katz said. But for all its prominence, it was not very large. The developer first envisioned a multiple-tenant office tower called Two Times Square. ''If this were to be viable,'' he said, ''it would have to wait for the small users that follow large users into an area'' - int his case law offices or advertising agencies.
That meant that the building was not likely to attract tenants until it was clear who was moving into the larger skyscrapers, and when. ''In our holding period,'' Mr. Katz said, ''the hotel market was heating up. We were approached by a number of people asking, 'Are you interested in a hotel?'''
''I was hesitant,'' he conceded, ''because we're real estate people, not hotel people.'' But with the help of the Laventhol & Horwath accounting firm, a deal was structured that made Mr. Katz comfortable. ''I have zero to do with operating the hotel,'' he said, ''which is what I needed until I get as brave as Harry Macklowe.''
The 310-room Ramada Renaissance is intended for ''upper-end'' travelers who want a more intimate environment than the nearby Marriott Marquis or Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza afford, said Mark F. Kaiser, vice president of development in Ramada's North America office.
''There is 5.5 million square feet of office space under construction'' in the vicinity, he said. ''When we open will be right when that market starts to fill up.''
Among its features the hotel will have a butler-concierge on each floor, who will do everything from unpacking a guest's bags to arranging for theater tickets. ''We're like 21 15-room hotels,'' Mr. Kaiser said.
Given that the hotel was striving for a ''very residential, kind of Old World style,'' to use Mr. Kaiser's words, Ramada executives looked for ways to distinguish their property from the blazing sign tower.
''What we've done is pushed all of the signage over on to the Broadway side of the buiding or the dead end facing Times Square,'' Mr. Kaiser said. ''Our side of the building - the Seventh Avenue side - is very, very clean. We don't have an entrance on Broadway. We're positioning ourselves as a hotel that's on Seventh Avenue.''
But, he added, ''we understand the economics of signage and are not necessarily opposed to it. We think it will draw a lot of attention to the building.''
The total surface of the seven signs - five stacked vertically over Duffy Square, two jutting obliquely from the Broadway facade - amounts to 23,000 square feet, or about 4,700 more than required under zoning rules. Two signs are already leased, one to Suntory whisky, the other to Coca-Cola, which has had a sign at the spot for 58 years.
''WE wanted very much to stay there,'' said Mark E. Preisinger, a spokesman for the Coca-Cola Company of Atlanta. ''It's our belief that the Coca-Cola sign in Times Square has become quite a well-known landmark. It's just tremendous visibility for the company and the trademark.'' The old sign was 40 by 44 feet. The replacement willbe 41 by 65 feet. How much will Coca-Cola pay for this prominent spot over the Times Square crossroads? ''We don't talk about that,'' Mr. Preisinger said.
Beneath these signs, at the narrow, southern end of the building, will be a 2,500-square-foot entrance to the major retail space. From there, escalators lead to an additional 11,500 square feet on the second floor.
''It's the world's most visible store,'' Mr. Katz said, by way of marketing the space. ''People still refer to this as the Castro Convertible site. And they haven't been there for years.''

HEADLINE: When You're Older and Out of Work

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
THERE is a dark side to capitalism. Take the experiences of the 20 educated, skilled, out-of-work executives who recently participated in a job-search workshop program in an effort to find jobs.
The free seven-session workshop was part of an employment-planning pilot program sponsored by the American Association of Retired Persons for unemployed people older than 50. It was held at MONY Financial Services headquarters in Purchase from April 23 to May 23.
Most of the members of the group were executives, still at the peak of their productivity, who were victims of the down-sizing, mergers and acquisitions that has led to a thinning of executive ranks in the county and surrounding area. 
The program was conducted by an A.A.R.P. employment-planning volunteer team and representatives from community agencies. Explaining why MONY donated the space to the group and provided a farewell luncheon, Salina Wilson, director of corporate relations, said: ''We believe that A.A.R.P. is doing an important job. We're glad to be part of it.''
The program, called the A.A.R.P. Works Workshop, is designed to help participants return to the job market. It was set up after several surveys of retirees, including one by the organization, that revealed that one-third of all retirees preferred to work. Other polls have reported that 51 percent of all workers surveyed said they would like to work past the age of 65.
''Yet, most do not,'' said Clair Watsky, who headed the volunteer team. ''Even though mandatory retirement has almost been eliminated in this country, many employment policies and practices discourage older workers from extending their careers.''
The organization sponsors the program at 12 locations nationwide. Westchester was chosen as one of the locations, Miss Watsky said, because of the low unemployment rate here - and the fewer available jobs.
''The focus of the program is to prepare people to find jobs that meet their needs and abilities,'' she said. ''All have college degrees or professional training and want to work. But many have been forced into early retirement or terminated when their jobs disappeared. They come into the program still in shock. And because Americans tend to identify people's worth with their job, those who lose them, although through no fault of their own, still suffer from low self-esteem.''
The team members - Myra Fisch, Janet Lillienstein, Gerry Michael, Mortimer Newburg and Miss Watsky - all are volunteers, who help participants assess and redefine their skills and work experience, and teach them how to conduct effective job searches. Speakers, such as Roslyn Tanner, a State Department of Labor employment counselor in White Plains, address the group and make additional suggestions and recommendations.
The participants evaluated the program in a discussion after the last session.
''We learned how to re-evaluate ourselves and our goals,'' said Robert Mundie, a 57-year-old research engineer. ''I, for instance, came away with a much better understanding of how to sell my experience and skills to prospective employers.''
Another member, a 61-year-old former bank president, said he lost his job after a policy dispute with his boss, the chairman. ''When I signed up for the program, I admit I was skeptical,'' he said. ''But I've found that this program was better than the out-placement services I was offered by the bank. At the bank, there was no healing process, and after you lose a job that's really what you need. Here, I feel I have support. We've all shared a common experience and it makes it easier for us to talk.''
Yet, when the conversation turned to his prospects, the bank president, who asked to remain anonymous, was not optimistic about a new job.
 
Process Can Get Complicated
''Part of my problem is that I was very good at my job,'' he said. ''My bank outperformed the competition for five years running. I've been told by people in the industry that the people who could hire me perceive me as a threat.'' Also, he added, ''At age 61, there aren't a whole lot of opportunities in banking for me out there.''
But he said he did learn during the workshop sessions that there were other opportunities in the financial industry for former bankers.
''We heard about companies that place executives in short-term assignments. They sound interesting,'' he said. ''And so does the organization that heads a retired-executive corps and financial people on assignments overseas. I intend to explore both avenues.''
Charles M. Anson, 57, spent 33 years as an engineer in the service operations department of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in White Plains.
''My job was highly technical,'' Mr. Anson said. ''I was field director of the new equipment inventory. But when the technology began to change, we were able to do more with less - and then equipment, and people with skills like mine, began to be phased out and I was offered early retirement. I wasn't surprised, but I admit I was a little bitter.''
Mr. Anson said he received a ''golden parachute,'' generous severance benefit, when he retired. ''I have no money problems,'' he said. ''My wife and I like to travel and we've been doing a lot of it since I retired. But my wife is still working, she has a good job and she won't retire for eight years. What am I going to do with that time? I want to work.''
The job-search program, he said, ''showed me how to put all my experience in perspective and make an assessment of what I can do. I realize now that the general-management skills I have can be applied to other industries.''
Mr. Anson also said he felt the A.A.R.P. program did more for him than the out-placement counseling he had received as part of his early-retirement package.
''Talking to the other people in the group has made me feel better,'' he said. ''When you're unemployed, everything takes on a different hue. I, like so many others, miss the camaraderie the job afforded. A group of us keep in touch. All of us retired from A.T.& T. meet on Fridays for lunch at the Elks Club in White Plains.''
Dr. John Hayes, 54, has four degrees, including his doctorate in chemistry. Yet, he said, he has found getting a job extremely difficult.
''I'm here because I'm weary of hearing I'm over-qualified,'' said Dr. Hayes, who worked as a chemist in product development at the General Foods technical center in Tarrytown for more than 17 years.
''I was one of those in the first wave who were terminated by General Foods. We were working on advanced new product development, namely developing high protein meat-like food from soybeans, when General Foods changed direction and new product development became market-driven.''
Dr. Hayes recalled that he was offered out-placement counseling and took it. ''But jobs in the food-chemistry industry were scarce. I finally got a job teaching high school chemistry at a private school in Tarrytown, but I was advised by the headmistress that if I wanted to keep it I'd better get a teaching degree, so I added a fourth degree to my resume.''
Shortly after he got his teaching certificate, he said he had a serious accident that hospitalized him for several months.
''When I was able to go back to work, I had no job. The school had replaced me. So, here I am. I've got some very good ideas out of this workshop, and I am hopeful now that I will be able to land something soon.''
Louise Snow Brodsky, one of the three women taking the program, said she had a varied business background. Mrs. Brodsky said that the workshops were useful to her and ''forced me into self-assessment.''
''I didn't know how to go about presenting my past experience in the proper context to a prospective employer,'' she said.
Another participant, a sanitary engineer who did not want his name published, noted that he had received valuable advice from members of the group. ''The kind of brainstorming that went on during the sessions helped me clarify my own ideas,'' he said. ''I wanted to go about setting up my own business, but I guess I was scared. During the sessions, suggestions were made that I try a new industry, recycling, and I'm going to explore the possibility.''
 
Team Wins High Marks
The group unanimously gave the A.A.R.P. volunteer team high marks.
''Not only did they explain to us in detail how to go about finding a job and take us through all the necessary drills, but they also gave us confidence,'' Mr. Mundie said. ''And when you're unemployed, that's what you seem to need the most.''
Ms. Lillienstein, a member of the team, is an occupational counselor at Mount Vernon High School. ''There is enough talent in this group to run the country,'' she said. ''I hate to see it go to waste. That's what makes this work so satisfying, helping these people get back on track. This is my second year with the A.A.R.P. program, and it's the kind of volunteer work I thoroughly enjoy.''
Miss Watsky noted that according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, America's work force is aging. ''Given current economic and business trends, we have to make better use of the knowledge and experience older workers have if we're going to remain cometitive with the rest of the world,'' she said.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Sisters Torn Apart by the Holocaust

BYLINE: By LEAH D. FRANK

 BODY:
OCCASIONALLY, the story that a play tells transcends its plot, characters and quality of production. The audience fills in pauses in dialogue with personal or familial memories that expand whatever is unfoldling on stage.
Such is the case with Barbara Lebow's affecting drama, ''A Shayna Maidel,'' now at the Studio Theater in Lindenhurst through Saturday.
The play is about the reunification of two sisters at the end of World War II. One of them, Rose Weiss, has been fortunate enough to have been raised by her father, Mordechai, in America. The other, Lusia, was prevented by illness from leaving Poland with Rose. She and her mother stayed behind. 
But by the time they could join Rose and Mordechai in New York, economic misery had given way to the horrors of the Holocaust, and the family was ripped apart by much more than distance.
In ''A Shayna Maidel,'' Mordechai has been searching lists of war refugees for the names of members of his family. He has finally located Lusia and has arranged for her to come to New York.
By using a dramatic structure in which time is fluid, Ms. Lebow weaves together the past and present lives of Rose, Lusia, their mother and Mordechai to create a vivid and multitextured family tapestry.
The play does not dwell on details of atrocities suffered in the concentration camps. Rather, by illuminating moments in the diverse pre- and postwar lives of Rose and Lusia, it incorporates audience memory and knowledge of world events of the 1930's and 40's.
It is a form of involuntary fill-in-the-blanks audience participation, and it is very effective. By the time Lusia recites the names of murdered relatives, her list silently includes the names of departed beloveds of everyone in the theater.
By the end of that scene, there is not a dry eye in the house. The tears are not so much for the Weiss family as for those who are missed by each individual listening to Lusia's grim recitation.
So, too, the tears at the happy ending are not as much for the on-stage family as they are over whatever memories of friends and family members the audience evokes.
''A Shayna Maidel'' is a play full of love, understanding and forgiveness that has the power to transcend its own story by embracing the myriad personal stories surrounding it. By the time Lusia and her father check off names on the list of relatives who may have survived the Nazis, the cellophane-wrapped candies that have been occupying the audience during the first few scenes remain in pockets and purses, and the gum snapping and casual chattering have stopped.
The quality of this production is not up to the level of the playwrighting, but it does not matter in the long run. Nuances and subtleties in the script remain out of the grasp of the director, Reva Kaufman, but she does manage to provide an unimpeded flow of action to the multiple scenes.
Ruthie Pincus does a fine job as the somewhat shallow Rose, who matures as her sister brings to life memories of their mother. Sally Kaye Kaufman, as Lusia, misses in the development of the full range of Lusia's anger, pain and fear, but she is nonetheless tender and touching as this brutalized war survivor.
Howard Mann is believable as the stern father, a man who can never compensate for the loss of his wife and family. John Ferry as Duvid, Lusia's husband, and Kasey Hawkins as Hanna, Lusia's childhood friend, both do solid yeomen's work. Evelyne Lune is warm and loving as the ill-fated mother. Jett Matteo's set design turns the tiny Studio Theater stage into a three-room New York apartment, and Marvin Lune's lighting design enables that apartment to become, as needed, various locations in Poland.
''A Shayna Maidel'' is a play that will make you feel and, in the process of catharsis, probably even cry. What more can you ask of an evening of theater?

HEADLINE: Indians Bill New York Town As Its 99-Year Leases Expire

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALAMANCA, N.Y.

 BODY:
In 1892 it seemed like an idea with a future.
The people of Salamanca, a railroad town in western New York that had been illegally established on Indian land, received leases to rent the property, each lasting 99 years. The Seneca Indians, in turn, received total payments of $17,000 a year.
Today, however, only eight months are left to the Salamanca lease. And the once bright future of this town has become a grim obsession. 
Hoping to make up for the inflationary decades they spent collecting 1890's rents, the Senecas have set the price of a new lease at $800,000 a year. They have also asked for an immediate payment of $60 million to make up for the inequities of the original lease.
 
Homeowners Alarmed
Already a tentative agreement has been reached that would grant the Senecas their requests, and that has alarmed the town's white residents, who have been paying as little as $1 for the land under their homes. Many say they would rather burn down their houses than pay the price of the new lease.
''I shouldn't say this, but I have no intention of paying $2,000,'' said Nancy O'Brien, who owns a dry-cleaning store with a $24-a-year lease.
As for the immediate one-lump payment of $60 million the Senecas are seeking, Mrs. O'Brien said, ''the whole town isn't worth that much.''
What makes the Salamanca lease situation different from most modern-day Indian causes is that the Senecas clearly have the upper hand. And they say that while they were badly taken advantage of in the last round of lease negotiations, they have no intention of giving up their advantage this time.
''When they negotiated the original leases, they thought we weren't going to be here at the end,'' Dennis Lay, president of the Seneca Nation, said. ''I guess we fooled them.''
Anyone who does not like the terms of the new lease can leave town, he said. ''We're not going any lower,'' he said. ''It's either go or no go.''
Perhaps the situation in Salamanca, a quiet town of 6,600 people, would be easier to resolve if it had a precedent. But it does not. While ranchers out West often lease grazing land on Indian reservations, no other town in the country is built on land leased from an Indian nation, experts say.
''The situation up there is rather unique,'' said Steve Gleason, a staff assistant at the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington.
 
Tensions Always There
Roughly 90 percent of Salamanca -1,700 acres - lies inside the Allegany Reservation, which is nestled against the Pennsylvania border south of Buffalo. The rest of the 22,000-acre reservation, New York State's largest, is home to 3,400 members of the Seneca Nation.
The Seneca Nation does not own the stores and houses in Salamanca, just the land under them. That means the 2,700 lease owners can buy and sell houses but never hold title to the land.
Tensions between the whites and the Indians have always been present in Salamanca, though not always spoken about. A main source of friction has been taxes. Many Senecas have moved into Salamanca over the years, but because Indians are exempt from state and local taxes, their presence has increased the tax bill for the town's white residents.
Now, with the leases about to expire, the hostility is coming out into the open.
 
Government Help Sought
A pamphlet being circulated among whites says: ''White man, you pay Federal, state, county and city taxes, plus $800,000 rent on pieces of earth that the Indian made with his own two hands. Indian, you get a Free Ride!!'' Recently, the consternation over Salamanca's future has begun to spread beyond the town's borders. In Albany and Washington, Salamanca's representatives are pressing the state and Federal governments to split the initial $60 million payment.
Both of these governments have pledged to help resolve the situation. But both are constrained by financial problems of their own.
A first-time visitor to Salamanca might have a hard time understanding what all the fuss is about. The town's economy deteriorated long ago, in part because the uncertainty of the lease situation made it impossible to get a mortgage. Half the stores on Main Street are closed, giving the place a half-asleep look, and many of the young people have already left to find jobs elsewhere.
 
Nowhere Else to Go
To many residents, however, Salamanca is the only home they have ever known. The stagnant economy and the uncertain lease situation make it an inexpensive place to live - many homes sell for less than $20,000 - and a large proportion of residents are older people on fixed incomes who have nowhere else to go.
''People are very uptight about it,'' said one lifetime resident, who identified herself only as a retired school teacher.
The earliest Salamanca leases were negotiated between the Seneca Indians and white settlers in the mid-1800's when the first railroad companies began to lay tracks through the Allegheny River valley. By many accounts the leases were illegal, but by the time anyone got around to questioning them, Salamanca had become an important railroad hub, and in 1875 Congress, responding to intense lobbying, validated the leases for five years.
When the five years were up, Congress extended the lease for another 12 years, then for 99 years. The last extension is to expire on Feb. 19, 1991.
 
Countdown Begins
Salamanca has been jittery about its future for years now. Municipal officials have been negotiating a new lease with the Senecas off and on for more than a decade, and for the last three years the local paper, The Salamanca Press, has been printing the number of days left before the lease expires.
That anxiety only worsened last month, when the team negotiating the new lease announced that it had struck the best deal it could with the Senecas. The deal calls for payments on a new 40-year lease to total $800,000 a year, and it asks the Federal and state governments to pick up the $60 million initial payment. It contains an escalation clause under which payments would increase in tandem with Salamanca's land values.
Whites in Salamanca greeted the deal with rage, and its fate remains uncertain. For a white owner of a home or business in Salamanca to extend his lease, he will have to sign on to the deal himself, and many whites say they simply will not do so.
''I think we should say forget it,'' said Shirley Weast, a real estate agent whose lease payments would increase from $7 to $4,700 under the new lease. ''What they're proposing is an absolute death sentence.''
Just what will happen in February if white residents have not signed new leases is unclear. Some say that their cases would then go to arbitration, while others say it is possible that the land would revert to the Senecas.
Whatever the whites in Salamanca decide to do, Seneca leaders say they are confident that they will not be cheated this time around. And if the town is frustrated with them, they say they do not have much sympathy.
''These guys had 99 years to think about the future,'' Mr. Lay, the Seneca president, said. ''It's just poor planning.''

HEADLINE: Flaming Oil Is Spilled Into Gulf as Blasts Rack Tanker

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GALVESTON, Tex., June 10

 BODY:
Five explosions in 10 minutes aboard a Norwegian tanker spewed flaming plumes of oil into the Gulf of Mexico this afternoon, about 36 hours after a large section of the 853-foot vessel first burst into flames.
Coast Guard officials here said the fire on the tanker Mega Borg was still burning out of control, not only on the ship, 50 miles off the Texas coast, but in the oil on the water as well, and was expected to burn through the night.
Until the ship could be boarded and the damage assessed, they said, it would be unclear how many gallons had been released and what effect the spill would have on the environment.
''We have a potentially serious situation,'' said Lieut. Comdr. F. L. Whipple, the commanding officer of the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office here. ''We are trying to prevent a catastrophic loss of oil.'' 
 
A Giant, Unstable Hulk
A Coast Guard spokesman said firefighting efforts were hampered because the nearest equipment to spray foam onto the burning hulk was in Louisiana. It was on its way to the fire scene this evening, and additional equipment and crews were being sent from the Netherlands.
The 38 million gallons of oil carried by the 15-year-old Mega Borg is more than three times the amount spilled by the Exxon Valdez off the coast of Alaska last year in the largest oil spill ever in the United States. The fire and explosions on the Mega Borg, which is burning and tipping toward stern, make her less stable than the Valdez was when she ran aground on Bligh Reef in March 1989. But the fire is a benefit as well: it appears to be consuming much of the oil spilling from the Norwegian tanker.
 
Stern Reported Stable
The ship's stern has dropped 58 feet since the first explosion on Saturday, indicating either that the cargo has shifted or that the Mega Borg is taking on water, Commander Whipple told a Sunday evening news conference. But by 9 P.M., the stern had stablized with 5 feet of it above the water, said Petty Officer Howard J. Holmes of the Coast Guard.
The explosions today on the Mega Borg, coming three days after the 260,000-gallon oil spill in the Kill van Kull in New York Harbor, are sure to focus new attention on legislation pending in Congress addressing the ability of the oil industry and government to prepare for and respond to such accidents. An effort to require and pay for more aggressive responses has been bottled up in Congress for months.
Officials are wary of making too much of comparisons to the Valdez accident because the Mega Borg was carrying a different type of oil, light crude, which is brown and evaporates more quickly than the heavier crude carried by the Valdez. If it washes ashore, it is not as likely to heavily coat beaches, birds, sea creatures and animals.
 
A Small Sheen Now
The Valdez spill eventually stained about 1,100 miles of coastline. The sheen of oil behind the Mega Borg was a mile long and half a mile wide this evening.
''A layer this thin will not cause serious, extensive damage,'' said Richard Golob, publisher of Golob's Oil Pollution Bulletin of Cambridge, Mass. ''The real concern is if this tanker was to start losing a large amount of crude oil and form a slick that would not be able to evaporate.'' That slick would be potentially toxic to marine organisms like fish larvae and plankton, said Mr. Golub, who is recognized as an authority on oil spills. ''It also could prove problematic for sea-going birds.''
Oil has been flowing from the tanker since the initial fire and explosions killed two of her crew members and injured 17 others Saturday. Two were missing and presumed to be dead and two others from the 41-man crew remained hospitalized this afternoon.
The containment effort is being coordinated by Smit American Salvage, a Galveston-based company, which was hired by the ship's owner, K. S. Mega Borg II of Norway.
 
Willing to Take Over
The Coast Guard, which was criticized for not stepping in to supervise the containment efforts after the Valdez spill in Alaska, is monitoring the actions of Smit American Salvage. ''We've been meeting with them all day,'' Commander Whipple said. ''As long as they do what they're supposed to be doing, we will simply advise.'' If the Coast Guard differs with the company, he said, ''we will federalize the process and do it ourselves.''
Early this evening, there were eight ships circling the Mega Borg, equipped with skimmer booms and fire-fighting equipment. More than a dozen other ships were on their way. An aircraft owned Elf Acquitane Petroleum Company of Houston, a subsidiary of Societe Nationale Elf Acquitaine, the French energy company. and the owner of some of the cargo spread dispersants within five miles of the ship late this evening.
Dispersants are detergent-like chemicals that disperse oil by breaking it into microscopic droplets that settle in the water. A Coast Guard spokesman, Todd Nelson, said the dispersant aboard the plane. which is known by the product name of Co-Rex It 9527, has never been used near a flaming spill before.
There was criticism after the Valdez spill that dispersants were not used soon enough. ''This is the same product that was used, or, more to the point, that wasn't used, during the Exxon spill,'' said John Leonard, the Coast Guard's liaison with the scientists who are advising firefighters.
 
Letting It Burn
Mr. Nelson said that there was no effort being made to stop the oil from burning on the surface. ''We're going to let it burn,'' he said. ''We're not going to fight the fire on the water.''
The fire, he said, causes much of the oil to evaporate into the air. ''It causes some air pollution, but that dissipates,'' he said. ''What would be worse would be for it to sit on the surface and drift toward shore.''
The rescue ships owned by Smit are expected to start pumping foam onto the Mega Borg on Monday morning. ''If we can stop the fire, we can board the ship, and that's the only way we can stop the spill of oil,'' Mr. Nelson said.
''It's far away, there isn't a fire department on every section of the ocean,'' he said. ''Maybe that's a deficiency. I'm not sure. It sure would have been nice to have it here a day earlier.''
Tankers are inspected by the Coast Guard, which performs yearly official examinations and random unofficial examinations. The last recorded inspection of the Mega Borg was in April, said Chief Petty Officer Rich Muller. ''The indications we have from its case history shows there have been no problems on any of its boardings,'' he said.
Asked if a double hull might have reduced the damage of a spill, Petty Officer Muller said, ''In this case, I don't see where it would have made a difference.'' There has been renewed debate recently on whether double hulls should be required on tankers to minimize the risk of major spills.
''Right now, as far as we can tell the oil that's escaping is from the double pipes in the pump room,'' Petty Officer Muller said. ''We think those were damaged in the initial explosion.''
 
Too Large for Port
The spill began at 1 A.M. Saturday, when the Mega Borg, which was too large to come all the way into port, was unloading some of its cargo onto another vessel. The tanker began its voyage in Palanca, Angola, and was scheduled to travel to Aruba after unloading the oil off Galveston.
The bodies of the two dead crew members were taken off the deck of the ship this morning. Their names have not been released, and the Norwegian Embassy is attempting to contact their families.
The cause of the explosion has not yet been determined, Mr. Nelson said. ''The people who were in the pump room at the time and were in the best position to tell us were among the injured,'' he said.
At first, officials said they were not concerned that the tanker would sink, resulting in a disastrous spill, but the five explosions between 12:05 and 12:15 this afternoon changed their thinking.
''The danger has certainly increased as a result of the events this afternoon,'' Mr. Nelson said. The explosions caused the cargo to shift toward the hole blown in the stern of the ship, increasing the rate at which it is spilling oil into the gulf, he said.
Good weather that has favored the effort to put out the fire and contain the spill was expected to continue for at least a day, forecasters said. Light winds and waves of two to three feet posed no extra danger to the burning tanker.
Weather and ocean currents, in addition to the amount of oil released, were thought to be important factors in how much damage the spill causes.
Environmentalists said several species of vegetation and fish in Galveston Bay could be at risk.
Should the oil reach the bay, it could jeopardize a national wildlife refuge there, as well as several oyster reefs and salt marshes, said Brandt Mannchen, who serves on the National Sierra Club's subcommittee on the off-shore continental shelf.
''I hate the thought of it,'' Mr. Mannchen said.
Alan Allen, the executive director of the Sportsmen Conservationists of Texas, an environmental group based in Austin, said he is particularly concerned about a reed-like plant, Spartina alterniflora, that grows in tidal flats and shallow water. ''It's a very good cover for larval forms of game fish and other marine species,'' including shrimp, speckled trout and southern flounder, he said.
''The entire Galveston Bay is extremely valuable for both recreational fishermen and commercial fishermen,'' Mr. Allen said.
Mr. Mannchen said the beaches along Galveston Island, a barrier island that serves as an entrance to the bay, are popular tourist attractions that might be in the path of the slick, depending on its direction.
''Tourism is one of Galveston's main industries,'' Mr. Mannchen said. ''This really couldn't have come at a worse time for the city, economically.''
 
In the Spotlight Again
Even though the causes of the most recent spills remain unknown, the blazing ship off Texas, has called attention once again to the continuing delays in addressing tanker safety issues.
Comprehensive oil spill legislation passed by both houses of the Congress has been held up for months in a Congressional conference committee, where House and Senate members have failed so far to resolve such issues as how soon to require double hulls on tankers. Another divisive issue has been whether to join an international liability fund to help clean up major spills caused by foreign vessels.
The proposed oil spill legislation would establish several new Federal response teams around the country. The teams would have special equipment, such as booms and skimmers, for containing the spread of oil slicks.
An oil company group announced a year ago a similar plan to establish emergency response teams to react to spills, but none of the teams are in place and the industry is still studying how to carry out the plan.
One oil company, Conoco Inc., has acted on its own to order two new tankers with double hulls.
The Coast Guard, for its part, has dozens of new regulations and programs under consideration that would affect oil shipping, but most of them are far from being put into effect. They would address such issues as the certification of local harbor pilots, the qualifications of ships' officers, the equipment that should be carried by ships or used in harbors for safe navigation, and the need for more thorough inspections of vessels entering United States waters.
 
Using Dispersants
 
A dispersant is a detergent sprayed on oil spills from planes or boats. It breaks up oil into tiny droplets that sink below the surfact and are diluted in the water. The droplets are gradually degraded by the natural action of microorganisms.
 
Advantages
 
Inexpensive.
Remove oil quickly from the water's surface.
Work well in rough water.
Can be used on very large spill.
 
Disadvantages
 
Must be applied within 24 hours of a spill to be effective.
Slightly toxic. Effect on marine life is not fully understood. May cause damage to organisms that ingest them.
Do not work well in calm water. Wave action is needed to mix them with the spilled oil.

The plant, the over-burdened Newtown Creek plant in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, has been accepting more sewage and waste water than allowed by state permit, and passing more inadequately treated waste into local waterways.
Under the permit issued in September 1988, the state can bar new sewer hookups in the plant's service area after July 31 if the plant exceeds its design capacity of 310 million gallons of sewage a day.
 
Development Could Be Disrupted
Such a move would stop construction in the neighborhoods served by the plant, like the multimillion-dollar Battery Park City on the southwest edge of Manhattan, and curtail plans in downtown Brooklyn. Moreover, a sewer-hookup ban would disrupt planning for large-scale developments of all kinds. 
The state has said that imposition of a moratorium is not an idle threat, and has already shown that such bans can be costly. It only recently lifted a 30-month moratorium on sewer hookups in 26 municipalities in Westchester County, which had been penalized for operating the Yonkers sewage-treatment plant beyond capacity. Builders in Westchester say the ban cost them $50 million.
Even if New York escapes a state ban in the coming months, the threat indicates that serious troubles lie ahead for the city's sewage-disposal system, which is stretched beyond the limit in many quarters.
City officials and the real-estate industry say they are taking the threat of the ban seriously.
 
More Waste, Dirtier Discharges
''We knew the ramifications when we put the permit conditions in,'' said Carol Ash, regional director of the Department of Environmenal Conservation. ''We anticipate that it is fully enforceable.''
A hookup moratorium in New York City could have far-reaching economic effects at a time when the area is already in a slump. And the threatened cutoff has implications for building throughout the city. All but one of the permits for the city's 14 sewage-treatment plants contain sewer-hookup provisions, and several plants are operating at or near capacity.
Built 23 years ago, the Newtown Creek plant accepts sewage from downtown Brooklyn, parts of Queens and from Manhattan below 12th Street on the West Side and below 72d Street on the East Side.
When a sewage-treatment plant operates above capacity, the waste receives less treatment, resulting in dirtier discharges, which violate state and Federal law.
 
Could Get Eight More Months
Ms. Ash said the state expects to begin talks with the city on what steps can be taken to reduce the flow to the Newtown Creek plant. The city could be given up to eight more months from the end of July before a ban would be imposed if it is found ''currently engaged in an effective remediation program,'' according to the permit.
Some environmental groups and one government regulation agency are watching the situation closely. They won a lawsuit last year forcing hearings to determine whether permits should be tightened in areas like discharges of toxic metals. The groups see the Newtown Creek issue as a test of how serious the state is about cleaning up New York's waters.
''We certainly would expect the state to uphold whatever is in the permit,'' said Alan I. Mytelka, director of the regulation agency, the Interstate Sanitation Commission.
Last year, the state and city signed a consent order modifying a permit for the Wards Island sewage-treatment plant that removed the threat of a sewer-hookup ban until 1996 if the city pursued stronger water conservation measures and added plant capacity. #16 Million Gallons Over Capacity The average flow at Newtown Creek for the 12 months between April 1989 and March 1990 was at least 326 million gallons a day, 16 million gallons over capacity, according to estimates by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. Joseph T. Miller, chief engineer for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, also put the flow in the 320-million-gallon-a-day range. The plant serves about 1.1 million people.
''Such conditions, over a long period, may lead to premature failure of plant equipment and water-quality violations,'' according to testimony last year from Richard L. Newman, regional water engineer for the Department of Environmental Conservation.
New York has undertaken a big water conservation program, including a vast metering effort. One of its goals is to reduce waste water that flows to plants like Newtown Creek.
The city is also planning a $1.2-billion, 50-million-gallon-a-day expansion of Newtown Creek that will take almost 10 years. At the same time, the plant's treatment process will be upgraded to comply with Federal law requiring 85 percent of pollutants to be removed from waste water. New York fought unsuccessfully for a waiver to the requirement.
 
Blunt Instrument to Get Attention
Besides Newtown Creek, four of the city's 14 treatment plants - North River, Coney Island, Bowery Bay and Wards Island - are accepting sewage and waste water beyond or near permitted levels. Groups have opposed new development projects that would hook into the Coney Island and Bowery Bay plants.
A ban on sewer hookups is a blunt instrument aimed at getting the attention of local officials. To end the Westchester County ban, officials agreed to correct leaks, broken sewer mains and illegal sewer connections.
The two-and-a-half-year ban had a severe impact, builders say. ''The economic effect was devastating,'' said George Frank, executive vice president of the Builders Institute of Westchester and the mid-Hudson region.
The Westchester example has city officials and the real-estate industry worried about whether the state would impose a similar ban in New York.
 
'I Take It Pretty Seriously'
''I don't think it can be ruled out,'' said Albert F. Appleton, commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, which operates the city's sewage-treatment plants. ''It's clearly a remedy.''
Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said, ''I take it pretty seriously.''
Mr. Spinola said few projects would be immediately affected by a ban. But planning by builders for future developments would become much more difficult, he said.
City officials have more than just the state to answer to about the Newtown Creek plant.
 
Answering to Residents
Neighbors say they are disturbed by the prospect of increasing the plant's capacity. Some residents say they resent that a plant in a Brooklyn neighborhood has to accept so much Manhattan waste. ''I think that really burns a lot of people,'' said Deborah Lalor, a member of Greenpoint Against Smell and Pollution, which formed to protest plant odors.
Mr. Appleton did not offer specifics about what the city might do to better control flow to Newtown Creek. But he said he hoped that some agreement could be worked out with the state.
''Everyone is acutely aware of what you're talking about here is using the atomic bomb,'' he said, ''and you don't use the A-bomb unless you're pushed to the wall.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the Newtown Creek sewage treatment plant in Brooklyn referred incorrectly to the area it serves. It accepts waste from much of northern Brooklyn, but not from downtown Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: Too Little Deregulation

SERIES: Second of two articles.

 BODY:
Deregulation has worked. Over two decades, consumers of airline, transportation and telephone services have benefited from lower prices and improved services as new companies were allowed to enter, old companies allowed to exit and prices allowed to reflect competitive pressures. The net benefit to the economy totals tens of billions a year. 
Yet there are plenty of grievances, and they are not all inescapable consequences of deregulation. Egregious mistakes were made in deregulating cable television and the savings and loan institutions. Some mistakes can be corrected with tinkering. Others will require radical measures. But in no case is re-regulation Congress's best option. In fact, many of the problems are explained by too little deregulation, not too much.
Airport congestion could be alleviated if Federal regulations would allow airports to levy higher takeoff and landing fees for peak-hour travel. That would spread flights evenly throughout the day, making more effective use of existing capacity. The higher fees could then be used to build new capacity. In this case, less regulation is the answer. Congress can also guarantee bus and railroad service to rural towns without re-regulating surface transportation. Direct subsidies would accomplish the task, without wreaking havoc on the rest of the industry. Cable television is more troubling. Rates were deregulated even though cable operators faced little effective competition. No wonder that fees skyrocketed. Here, prudent re-regulation, perhaps along lines already proposed in Congress, is an option. But even that may be unnecessary.
Roger Noll, a telecommunications expert at Stanford University, holds out the tantalizing prospect that satellite broadcasters could effectively compete with cable if existing regulations were different. That seems increasingly likely with new low-cost satellite technologies coming on line in the next year or two.
Residual regulations also hamper the ability of cellular phone companies to compete effectively for local residential phone customers. Here, too, regulation has needlessly crimped competition by blocking the installation of non-mobile cellular phones in homes.
Deregulation is not a panacea. Without adequate safeguards, it can backfire. Nor does the experience of removing restrictions on entry, exit and price suggest that it would be wise to relieve other types of regulations - like environment controls or rules about workplace and consumer product safety. These remain important duties of government.
Even so, the experience of deregulation under Presidents Carter and Reagan suggests that Congress has been too timid. Given all the halfway measures, it's a wonder deregulation has worked as well as it has. That knowledge whets the appetite for Congress to finish the job.

HEADLINE: Past, Present Clash in Race To Be Mayor Of Trenton

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 7

 BODY:
History fits comfortably on the streets of this city, where the Hessian barracks stormed by George Washington still stand and the 18th-century home of William Trent, the city's namesake, is open to all.
But the recent past - dark years of fear, factory closings, and neighborhoods shred to tatters - has been more difficult for the city to bear. And a central issue in Tuesday's runoff election for mayor is how closely Trenton is connected to that past.
On the surface, Carmen J. Armenti, a 61-year-old former restaurateur and City Council President, would seem to represent the old order. Last November he was selected to finish the unexpired term of Mayor Arthur J. Holland, who died after serving in the office for nearly three decades. 
Douglas H. Palmer, a 38-year-old Mercer County Freeholder who would become Trenton's first black Mayor, uses ''A new vision for Trenton'' as his campaign slogan and might be assumed the candidate champing for a break with the past.
 
Many Residents Confused
But in a city where a nominally nonpartisan election nonetheless spotlights each candidate's party affiliation, it is Mr. Palmer, a Democrat, who says his new vision is ''no more than making Trenton what it used to be in the 50's and 60's, a city of safe streets and decent housing.''
And it is Mr. Armenti, a former Democrat turned Republican who served as Mayor from 1966 to 1970, who insists Trenton can never go back to what it once was.
''We're not an old industrial town where they make pottery, steel and wire anymore,'' Mr. Armenti said. ''We're a governmental city, the state and county capital. That's where we have to gear our energies.'' Many residents are confused. ''To be painfully honest, I'm not sure what differences there are between the two of them,'' said Martin P. Johnson, executive director of Isles Inc., a community organization.
Mr. Armenti and Mr. Palmer, both lifelong residents of Trenton, were the highest vote-getters in a field of four candidates in the municipal election May 8. #2 Candidates Run Closely Mr. Armenti took as much as 75 percent of the vote in Trenton's Italian and Polish neighborhoods, finishing second with 8,787 votes, or 280 behind Mr. Palmer.
Pedro Medina, a police detective, won 3,537 votes. The fourth candidate, a former lottery director, Barbara Marrow-Mooring, received 461 votes. Because no candidate received 50 percent of the vote, a runoff is necessary.
Mr. Medina later endorsed Mr. Armenti, and a big question now is how many of Mr. Medina's supporters, many of them Puerto Rican residents who live in the old downtown section near the imposing maximum-security walls of the New Jersey state prison, will follow his lead.
Some politicians believe Hispanic voters, most of them Democrats, might reject Mr. Medina's endorsement and vote for Mr. Palmer. Despite the nonpartisan nature of the election, Mr. Palmer's campaign literature clearly identifies him as a Democrat. Mr. Armenti's literature does not mention his party affiliation.
 
Small-Town Politics
The campaign so far has been low-keyed and decorous. The advertising is restrained in tone and limited to bus posters, lawn signs and a few commercials on radio and cable television. Race has not become a major issue. Some people say that is because Trenton, despite being the state capital, harbors a small-town look on life.
''People pretty much agree that race was not foremost in the campaign,'' said Ingrid W. Reed, assistant dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University and chairwoman of the Capital City Redevelopment Corporation, a downtown revitalization organization.
''One might have expected it to be, but Trenton is more of a small town. People do know each other, and they do know these candidates.''
With roughly 90,000 people, Trenton is clearly no country village, although it is shrinking. It has lost about 14 percent of its population since 1970, when more than 104,000 people lived here.
Trenton suffers all the ills of other major Northeast cities: drugs, crime, poor schools and high unemployment. It has no movie theaters and no major supermarkets.
 
Rise of State Offices
To fight competition from suburban shopping malls in the early 1970's, the city blocked off West State Street through the downtown shopping district and created an outdoor mall, called the Trenton Commons. It flopped. The city plans to reopen one of the streets in the fall.
By the early 1980's, downtown Trenton seemed so incapable of helping itself that the state government stepped in. The Capital City Redevelopment Corporation was formed to encourage new construction, and new state office buildings were built on downtown streets.
It was a controversial move that in some ways signified a surrender of the city's identity to the state. New office towers, built at a cost of more than $200 million, have transformed the downtown area, but some merchants contend business is worse than ever. West State Street remains desolate after the state workers go home at 5 o'clock.
Mr. Palmer, a bachelor and longtime Little League coach who wears a Gucci watch on one wrist, believes Trenton has become too reliant on the state. He said that during the 1980's, when new office buildings were sprouting alongside Route 1 near Princeton, about 10 miles away, Trenton was unable to attract either jobs or housing because the city was not aggressive enough in seeking development.
Mr. Armenti - chubby, bald and partial to pinstripes - said the state and its 20,000 daily workers must, by necessity, remain the power behind Trenton's economic engine. But he also said current agreements required that at least 20 percent of new downtown buildings be occupied by private businesses. Before those agreements took effect, he lost his own downtown restaurant to a new state office building.
 
Education Issue Raised
Other current concerns in Trenton are homelessness and the lack of affordable housing, drugs, street crime and the battered state of Trenton's schools.
At a League of Women Voters debate this week at the Mercer County College campus in downtown Trenton, Mr. Palmer, who works for the Board of Education as director of purchasing, criticized Mr. Armenti for not paying attention to education except during budget time.
Mr. Armenti, who is legislative liaison for the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, in turn charged that Mr. Palmer lacked experience and had been criticized by community groups for mismanaging the purchasing department.
In January the Trenton Council of Civic Associations, consisting of 39 community organizations throughout the city, reviewed the Board of Education budget and found the purchasing department overstaffed and inefficient.
Trying to keep cool before a noisy debate crowd of about 150 residents, the candidates traded barbs several times. Mr. Palmer said Mr. Armenti had done little in his six months in office to solve any of the city's problems.
 
Competence Debated
''The past six months proves Carmen believes in the Greyhound bus tour school of management,'' Mr. Palmer said. ''Instead of sitting down with people and solving problems, he takes tours.''
Mr. Armenti said repeatedly that Mr. Palmer was not competent to run the city. In one exchange, Mr. Armenti said to the audience, ''I'd wager now that if you ask Mr. Palmer the tax rate, he doesn't know.'' Mr. Palmer replied that the rate was $4.84 per $100 and said ''If it's wrong, it's because it went up since you took office.''
The city's effective tax rate, which takes into account Trenton's assessments at just 20 percent of real value, is $3.32 per $100 according to county tax officals. It was $4.85 in 1986.
The campaign has attracted some attention from outside Trenton. Last Sunday Mayor David N. Dinkins returned to the city where he was born. His family lived on Spring Street, where Mr. Palmer now lives.
Mr. Dinkins campaigned with Mr. Palmer. ''He told me to hang in there, to hang tough,'' the candidate said later.
Mr. Armenti said he was working hard to be elected mayor, but he pledged that he and Mr. Palmer would join in an embrace the day after the election no matter what the results, because neither wanted racial rivalries to divide the city.
''Nothing,'' Mr. Armenti said, ''is more important than having a city that is together.''

HEADLINE: With More Say in Budget, City Council Finds a Guide

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

 BODY:
The finance director for the New York City Council, Marc V. Shaw, looked too tired to get up from his chair the other day. The late nights and cigarette butts were beginning to accumulate.
''I have two children,'' he sighed, ''ages 5 and 1 1/2, the last time I was home.''
This is the busiest time of year for Mr. Shaw - budget time. And it is his job to supply the Council leadership with the numbers and the analysis - the ammunition - that they will use in their annual budget battle with the Mayor over what is included in the sprawling document and what is not. 
For years the battle was one-sided, in favor of the mayor, in part because the Council lacked detailed budget information of its own. Its budget analysis was superficial at best. Instead, the main policy goal of many of its 35 members was ''adding on as many goodies as possible,'' said Paul Dickstein, a former city budget director.
 
'How Can We Pay for It?'
By most accounts, Mr. Shaw, who is 35 years old, is trying to change that. In his 18 months as director he has worked to improve the finance staff and to provide the Council with better budget information.
Politics and parochial interests still have a strong influence in the wood-paneled Council chamber. But since Mr. Shaw arrived, Mr. Dickstein said, Council members have been asking, '' How can we pay for it?''
The changes in the Council come at a time when its powers are expanding. Under the new City Charter, the Council for the first time will have sole authority to approve the city's $28 billion budget, a duty it had shared with the Board of Estimate, which will be phased out by late summer.
The new budget leaves little room to maneuver. The Dinkins administration and the Council have to fill a budget gap of nearly $2 billion for the fiscal year beginning July 1.
Both sides say reduced city services and higher taxes are as inevitable as fireworks on the Fourth of July. The question is what combination of taxes and cuts they will finally agree on.
''If one likes chaos, this is the place to be,'' Mr. Shaw said as his telephone rang almost incessantly. ''I happen to like chaos, but I think it's reaching the limits for even my tastes. We have a new Charter, a new Mayor and a new fiscal crisis.''
Mr. Shaw joined the Council after eight years as an analyst and assistant director of fiscal studies for the State Senate Finance Committee in Albany. Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker, who hired Mr. Shaw after a one-year search, said Mr. Shaw is a keen guide through the fiscal woods because he not only knows the most influential leaders and their top aides in Albany but ''also what taxes they're likely to pass or reject.''
About $550 million of the $859 million in taxes proposed by Mayor David N. Dinkins to help fill the budget gap must be approved by the Legislature.
No one, Mr. Shaw said, can be entirely certain what taxes will be acceptable in Albany. Taxes are a bad word in any legislative body. But Mr. Shaw said he hopes to help put together a tax package that ''provides the best beginning for a dialogue that will get us the money we need to balance the budget.''
Three taxes suggested by Mr. Shaw and his 30-member staff have been incorporated into the Mayor's budget proposal - an estate and gift tax, a wine tax and a tobacco tax. And for about two weeks the two sides haggled, sometimes bitterly, over $116 million in alternative taxes the Council wanted. On Thursday the Mayor agreed to drop his proposals for a tax on gasoline and a higher auto use tax and to replace them with a compromise package.
 
Democracy in Nervousness
Mr. Shaw is not an apolitical number cruncher. The line between public policy and politics is thin, and the nature of his job forces him to cross and recross that line every day. Each morning, he and several other senior staff members meet with Mr. Vallone and Herbert E. Berman, the chairman of the Council's finance committee. Over coffee, the group studies the budget and discusses its strategy for negotiating with Mr. Dinkins's office.
Although the leadership ultimately determines the Council's political direction, Mr. Shaw and the staff have an influence on it.
''It is the job of the budget person to provide the numbers to substantiate what we want to accomplish,'' Mr. Berman said.
Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said, ''Shaw and his staff are every bit as good as the folks at O.M.B.,'' referring to the City's Office of Management and Budget. ''That has O.M.B. very nervous. And that's a good thing for democracy.''
But Mr. Russianoff said Mr. Shaw's final report card would not be complete until after the budget was adopted. ''Then I'll be able to say whether we've been seduced and abandoned,'' he said.
These are hectic but heady times to be working for the City Council with its expanded powers, Mr. Shaw said. He is paid $105,000 a year. But lately, he said, his 16-hour work days have denied him time with his family. He lives in Bayside, Queens, with his wife, Mary, who is a lawyer, and their two children.
 
A Real Legislative Body
The Shaws met while they were students at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where Mr. Shaw majored in anthropology. He has a master's degree in urban anthropology. In 1979 he took a job with an economic forecasting concern owned by the University of Pennsylvania. He then went to work for the State Senate and its finance committee.
His goal, he says, is to help turn the Council into a legislative body that is taken seriously as a full partner in governing the city.
But some think Mr. Shaw may be too optimistic.
''I think he's capable of giving them professional support,'' said Charles Brecher, the director of research for the Citizens Budget Commission, a private monitoring group. ''The question is how much they want to use it. That remains to be seen.''

HEADLINE: COMMENCEMENT;
Valedictorian at Dartmouth Cites College's New Diversity

 BODY:
In the valedictory address at Dartmouth College yesterday, Michael Lowenthal, a senior from Chevy Chase, Md., cited himself as an example of the school's new diversity, but he questioned whether its students had unified into a community.
''Through need-blind admissions, coeducation and minority recruitment, our doors have been increasingly open,'' Mr. Lowenthal said at the college's 220th commencement, in Hanover, N.H. ''And today, Dartmouth is 'integrated' in a new way, as I am its first openly gay valedictory speaker.'' 
But Mr. Lowenthal said the new groups had ''too often been viewed as mere add-ons to the existing Dartmouth, rather than as equal participants whose presence necessitates a new, different community.'' His classmates gave him a standing ovation.
In a commencement speech, Jill Ker Conway, a former president of Smith College, prodded the school's 987 graduates to look for rewards beyond the starting salaries of their first jobs.
''Here you are, conscious of gifts and talents, burdened by student debt, by family expectations, ready to rush to wherever the fashionable place may be, to the nearest consulting firm, to the best specialty,'' Ms. Conway said yesterday. ''But I am here today to tell you, Don't do it.''
Ms. Conway, president of Smith from 1975 to 1985, said she was not advising the graduates ''to scorn the market and capitalist incentives,'' but rather to ''search for your real vocation,'' and find ''that connection between your moral and spiritual self.''
Dartmouth presented honorary degrees to Ms. Conway; David S. Broder, the syndicated political columnist for The Washington Post; Donald Knuth, professor of computer science at Stanford University; Robert Solow, professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who won the Nobel Prize in economic science in 1987, and Reggie Williams, a Cincinnati City Councilman and former linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals.

HEADLINE: Concerned Coaches Are Wondering, Why So Few Blacks?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

DATELINE: OMAHA

 BODY:
AS college baseball continues to make major strides toward more widespread popularity, the virtual invisibility of black players at the sport's college level has raised a concern about its future growth.
In this year's College World Series, which ended here Saturday with a victory by Georgia over Oklahoma State, only 6 of the 176 players were black. (The series involves 8 teams of 22 players each.) Last year, 8 of the 176 were black.
A study by the American Institutes of Research found that 7.2 percent of all Division I baseball players are black. When the predominantly black schools in Division I are removed, the figure drops to 2.6 percent. 
That number is particularly striking when compared with the percentage of blacks in Division I football, 37 percent, and basketball, 56 percent.
''The pool of talent is much smaller than coaches would like it to be,'' said Gene McArtor, the Missouri head baseball coach and chairman of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I baseball committee. ''Many of the talented black athletes are heading in directions other than baseball, and it's been a loss for the sport.
''We have to convince more kids at an early age that baseball offers as many or maybe more opportunities than the other sports they are being attracted to. That's our challenge.''
With the exception of coaches in the two predominantly black conferences, there are no black head baseball coaches at any of the 269 Division I programs that field baseball teams.
The survey seems to indicate that Division I college baseball is in a position similar to that of college football and basketball in the 1960's. But while the lack of black athletes then was a result of biased traditions and of laws in some states barring the admission of black students, the reasons for the current low number of blacks in college baseball are more complex.
''A lot of people have asked me why there aren't more blacks,'' said Skip Bertman, the head baseball coach at Louisiana State. ''In fact, one chancellor came up to me before a game and asked, 'Where are the black athletes?'
''It's not a racist thing. It's harder to get blacks into college baseball because there are fewer of them attempting to do it, compared with basketball and football.''
The reasons given for the strikingly low numbers are several: lack of youth baseball programs, particularly in poor urban areas; the steering and gravitation of these same youngsters into basketball and football, and a scarcity of full scholarships, which forces families to foot part of the bill for a college education.
But the most commonly cited reason - and one of the most compelling - is the fierce competition for high-school athletes from major league teams.
In fact, pro baseball teams legally do what many big-time college football and basketball programs have been punished for doing: They offer money and other inducements to attract choice players.
''We have something in baseball that football and basketball don't have,'' Bertman said. ''We have the pro baseball draft, and that takes many of the good high-school black kids right into the professional ranks. That's the biggest point.'' Not surprisingly, money is a strong lure.
''Because of the economic situation that many of them are in, when they get offered $20,000, they're gone,'' said Ron Polk, the head coach at Mississippi. ''We signed three black athletes in the last three years, and they ended up signing pro contracts out of high school. The ones we've gone after ended up being pretty good drafts and they ended up signing. That happens to a lot of us.'' It's not difficult to see the attraction. Darryl Strawberry received a $210,000 signing bonus from the Mets in 1980. Kiki Jones, a pitcher from Tampa, Fla., signed for $175,000 with the Los Angeles Dodgers last year.
''Personally, I've seen those blacks who are good at baseball, and they want to achieve instant success,'' said Jeff Hammonds, Stanford's all-America freshman center fielder and one of the few black players in the Pacific-10.
Hammonds, who starred at Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School in New Jersey, was a ninth-round pick of the Toronto Blue Jays and turned down a reported $250,000 bonus and signed with Stanford.
But some observers feel there may be more behind the lack of blacks in college baseball than the pull of pro baseball.
''I don't think it's a matter of blacks not wanting to go to college,'' said Don Buford, the Baltimore Orioles' director of instruction. ''I don't think they're being recruited in the numbers that whites are.'' Buford, who is black, played baseball at the University of Southern California before embarking on a 10-year major league career.
Bertman said that argument might have some merit.
''Here's what we're guilty of as white middle-class coaches,'' he said. ''I'm guilty of it, my counterparts at The Citadel and Mississippi State and Stanford are guilty of it: We don't scour the inner-city schools for the best black athletes in baseball. Why? Because we don't have to. ''There are so many kids that want to come to play college baseball who send letters and get scouts to send recommendations and whose parents can afford to accept a half-scholarship.''
Bertman said Louisiana State recently recruited a diamond-in-the-rough type of player from a Baton Rouge inner-city high school. The player is talented, but Bertman said he had to hunt for him.
Gary Ward, the Oklahoma State coach, disagrees with the premise that white coaches do not seek out black athletes. Before becoming the Oklahoma State baseball coach in 1978, Ward, who is white, coached junior-college basketball and came close to being assistant basketball coach for Eddie Sutton at Arkansas.
''I've been in the inner city, in Savannah to St. Louis, Chicago to Dallas,'' Ward said. ''Obviously, these kids have great skills. You watch those 5-8, 5-9 kids play basketball and you say, 'Gee, I'd like to have them for two or three years with a bat.'
''But in the inner-city areas in the North, where the weather is bad and there's no opportunity to play, when these 8- and 9-year-old kids go to city parks and play the hoops game, there's no baseball diamond. If there is a baseball diamond, there's not a local sponsor.
''When you get into the white affluent sections, they have the real nice city parks, the real nice uniforms, and 1,000 sponsors who give kids the chance to play from T-ball on up.''
Lyle Mouton Sr., whose son is the only black player on Louisiana State's team, attributes the situation not to a lack of black players in Little League, but to their lack of involvement at the American Legion level.
''That's where your college coaches go to recruit in the summer,'' said Mouton, who played in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization and has coached in several youth leagues in Louisiana. ''They don't go to the high schools. From all of my coaching, youth baseball, from T-ball through high school, has been dominated by black players.
''American Legion is where blacks get shelved. And if you don't play American Legion ball, slim chance you'll get to play major college baseball.''
At the same time, players like Hammonds concede that personal preference and the prestige of a given sport can play a major role in diverting black talent from college baseball. Four of the black players who participated in this year's College World Series admitted that baseball was not their first choice as a sport.
Mouton's son, Lyle Jr., played basketball for Louisiana State for two season before dropping the sport after last season to concentrate on baseball.
''I made a decision of the heart,'' he said. ''I wanted to play baseball and wasn't able to, and it hurt me to not be able to play a sport that I loved. So I had to make a life decision. I want to play this sport, and that's what I did.''
Hammonds was a running back in high school and played until suffering an injury during his senior year. He figured baseball was the most injury-free sport and focused his attentions there.
Another major factor in the low numbers is the scholarship situation. Unlike big-time college football and baseball, most baseball programs are unable to grant many full athletic scholarships. That means the average recruited athlete will need outside help to pay what the partial scholarship does not cover.
''A kid who plays baseball has got to have help from home,'' Bertman said. ''So kids go to a community college for less money and stay at home.''
For a growing number of black families, the opportunity to give a son a college education outweighs the short-term money.
Last year, Calvin Murray, an outfielder at W. T. White High School in Dallas, turned down a $300,000 bonus offered by the Cleveland Indians and accepted a scholarship to play for Texas.
When his mother, Virginia, was asked by a reporter how she could resist the lure of a six-figure bonus, she replied that she had told her son to think of the long haul.
''I tell Calvin I don't care how good he is,'' she said. ''If you're black, you need the education.''

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Birth of a Global Book Giant

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Over the last two years, an amiable Scotsman with a tough glint in his eye has transformed one of America's oldest publishers, the sleepy house of Harper & Row, into a dynamic global conglomerate.
The work of George Craig has stirred keen enthusiasm as well as anger and skepticism, through the creation of a British-American publishing house. He has effectively buried the old house of Harper, which published Herman Melville's ''Moby Dick'' in 1851.
Last month, Mr. Craig completed the merger of Harper & Row and the British publisher William Collins, bringing the two venerable houses under the new name of HarperCollins. The new company is expected to have revenues of approximately $1.5 billion. 
 
Time of Reckoning
With the emergence of HarperCollins, the time of reckoning has come for Mr. Craig, whose aggressive -some say extravagant - purchases of books have made Harper perhaps the most talked-about publisher in America.
As chief executive of the new company, Mr. Craig must prove that HarperCollins is worth the more than $1 billion that his boss, Rupert Murdoch, spent to assemble it.
This amounts to a challenge in relatively unchartered waters. HarperCollins is committed to global publishing, both general and educational, at a time when the idea is still questioned by many people in the industry.
''The whole idea of global publishing like HarperCollins is crazy,'' said Roger Straus 3d, managing director of Farrar, Straus & Giroux. ''A book is about as personal as a deodorant. You can count on one hand the authors who can really be sold globally.''
But William Shinker, publisher of Harper's trade book division, said, ''Publishing for the world English market simply makes sense.''
HarperCollins must test its strategy at a time when its owner, Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, has encountered difficulties. Burdened with more than $6 billion in debt and still pouring money into Sky Television, an emerging British satellite-television service, the News Corporation posted a net loss of $24 million in the last quarter and its net income fell 76 percent, to $93 million, in the nine months to March 31.
 
Cutting Debt
To cut its debt, HarperCollins sold the medical publisher J. B. Lippincott last month for $250 million. After the sale, the company had debt of $550 million.
This does not not appear to perturb Mr. Craig, who is 50 years old and the son of a Glasgow steelworker. Mr. Craig, who is on the board of the News Corporation, exudes good cheer. It is only his tendency to chain-smoke that belies the driven executive lurking beneath the bonhomie.
''Mr. Murdoch has not told me that I must avoid new acquisitions or produce a certain profit,'' he said. ''But the News Corporation as a whole is now pursuing internal growth and improved profitability. Harper would not suffer from a period of stability.''
The last few years have indeed been hectic. Mr. Murdoch's purchase of Harper & Row for $293 million in 1987 was followed by that of the religious publisher Zondervan for $56.7 million in 1988 and the textbook publisher Scott, Foresman & Company for $407 million in 1989.
Last year, the News Corporation, which had owned 40 percent of William Collins since 1981, acquired the remainder of the British publisher for $717 million.
 
Distinct Traditions
Harper and Collins began merging their operations last July. By insisting on a full merger, Mr. Craig is trying to wed two long and distinct traditions. The houses were born on different continents in 1817 and 1819 respectively.
Harper, which published Thornton Wilder and John F. Kennedy's ''Profiles in Courage,'' was the embodiment of the American establishment publisher. If there were distinguished ambassadorial memoirs to be published, Harper was the place. And Collins - which started with Bibles and moved on to publishing Agatha Christie - had an equally strong image in Britain as a house with a wide range of books and a strong commercial sense.
Mr. Craig is convinced that he has taken the right course. ''Harper was old-fashioned, a bit dull, very bureaucratic, and it suffered from a lack of direction,'' he said of the house he took over in 1987, after more than 10 years as an executive at Collins. ''What has happened since the News Corporation came in has been unbelievably good.''
 
Increased Profits
Operating profits at Harper's American business have indeed gone up, reaching $58.1 million last year, compared with $5.6 million in the company's last fiscal year before the News Corporation bought it.
Several best sellers - including ''Barbarians at the Gate'' by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar and ''The 8-Week Cholesterol Cure'' by Robert Kowalski - have improved the image of a house that seemed to many editors to be in quiet decline during much of the 1980's. A mass-market paperback division has been started with such successful titles as E. L. Doctorow's ''Billy Bathgate.''
Armed with slides featuring such words as ''Pride,'' ''Excitement'' and ''Achievement'' to portray the new Harper, Mr. Craig appears to have inspired a genuine enthusiasm, at least among many of his American employees.
Brenda Marsh, a senior vice president for sales, typified the tone of employees by saying: ''We believe we can be the best publisher. That, quite simply, is what we are trying to do.''
But Mr. Craig has clearly taken on a lot. He has spent tens of millions of dollars on books - including $9.6 million alone for the rights to Agatha Christie's works, $1 million for ''Billy Bathgate'' and another $1.5 million for books by the thriller writer Clive Barker.
Over all, some publishers believe, Mr. Craig has shifted HarperCollins toward a more commercial image. This has drawn sharp criticism from former employees and others in the industry.
''The house has gone savagely down market,'' said a former executive of Harper who now works at a rival house.
 
Global Publishing
The drive toward global publishing has also provoked the scorn of several people in the industry, including the former chairman and the former managing director of Collins.
''By trying to create the true international publishing conglomerate, all George has done is destroy two great publishing traditions,'' said Sonia Land, who quit in anger as chief executive of Collins in March.
Referring to the former logotypes of the two companies - the torch of Harper and the fountain of Collins - which were replaced last month by a new blue-and-red, water-and-fire symbol, she added, ''Somebody should tell him that fire and water do not mix.''
Ian Chapman, the former chairman of Collins who resigned last year and was once Mr. Craig's mentor, was equally skeptical. ''Of course there is resentment at Collins,'' he said. ''Under no circumstances would I have agreed to their names being merged. No editor in England can tell an editor in New York what to publish.''
Mr. Craig prefers not to comment on his falling out with his former colleagues. But Terry Kitson, who succeeded Ms. Land as chief executive of HarperCollins U.K., called her criticism ''disgraceful remarks.'' He contended that morale in Britain was high.
Behind these salvos lies the controversy over whether global publishing is a feasible idea or a panacea dreamed up by conglomerates trying to justify big investments and homogenize the erratic world of books.
Some publishers, generally from smaller houses, argue that very few authors or general-interest books can be marketed worldwide, because what succeeds in the United States may well fail in Britain.
Others, from big houses like Simon & Schuster, believe that risk can be spread, economies of scale achieved and profits increased by selling a book throughout an increasingly small world.
 
Moving Cautiously
Mr. Shinker, the publisher of HarperCollins's trade division, said the company intended to move cautiously to exploit its global reach.
Starting this fall, Grafton, an imprint of Collins, will publish and market general-interest hardcover books and paperbacks in Britain, selecting titles originally published in the United States by Harper. ''We will begin with 20 titles this fall and aim for 75 to 100 by 1991,'' he said.
There are also far-reaching plans to sell Collins's reference books and dictionaries in the United States and to market new versions of Roget's Thesaurus throughout the world.
Meanwhile, Mr. Craig said, ''The diversity of our portfolio is extremely helpful because we are not as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the glitzy trade business.''
Unlike Random House, which has also bought publishing houses in Britain in recent years, HarperCollins has extensive religious and educational publishing operations. Indeed, of its approximately $725 million in annual American revenues, about $465 million comes from school, college and religious books. And only about 40 percent of its British revenues of more than $300 million comes from general-interest publishing.
William Baker, the chief administrative officer and a 30-year veteran of the company, says he believes this mix offers a sound base for future growth.
Certainly, although Harper is publishing more commerical authors, it continues to publish the likes of Paul Johnson, Marguerite Duras and Milan Kundera.
''They have done some terrific deals,'' said Lorraine Shanley, a publishing consultant. ''George has brought out the best in people.''
The question now is how quickly can this galvanized enterprise bring in returns to justify Mr. Murdoch's bold investments and reorganization.
In a sign that financial pressure has mounted, operations in Australia and Britain are expected to be sold for $250 million. Last week, the Australian retail bookstore business, Angus & Robertson, was sold for $15.2 million.

HEADLINE: Americans Seek to Improve Transportation for Soviets

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
The United States and the Soviet Union are trying to build a new commercial relationship across the spectrum of transportation - moving goods by land, by sea, by air, or even into orbit.
In recent months, there have been proposals and deals in the Soviet Union with American companies like United Parcel Service Inc., the package-delivery company, Sea-Land Service Inc., the international shipping concern, and Honeywell Inc. and Northwest Airlines, which will sell satellite-based navigation technology. The companies say they anticipate no objections from the Defense Department, which developed the American satellite.
The transportation ventures and other types of deals like the General Motors Corporation's agreement to sell car parts to the Soviets indicate Moscow's desire to become more involved in the world economy and its willingness to be open to American businesses.
Experts say international transportation presents an important opportunity for the Soviet Union to earn dollars and other hard currencies. 
But the Soviets desperately need to improve their creaking transportation network if foreign trade or the domestic economy are to have any hope of prospering.
''Their internal transportation network is breaking down,'' Marshall Goldman, associate director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard University, said last week. ''Their infrastructure is disintegrating.''
But free enterprise can only deliver so much in the changing Socialist state, as is shown by U.P.S.'s venture in Moscow and Leningrad. The company's familiar brown trucks and uniformed drivers are making their rounds in the Soviet capital, under a joint-venture partnership with Sovtransavto, a Soviet company. But laws still on the books prohibit parcels from being sent to or received by individuals. For now, the service is restricted to businesses.
The latest evidence of the burgeoning bilateral transportation relationship came last week when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush met. The leaders signed accords expanding the air routes between the nations and restoring shipping activity to each other's ports for the first time in a decade.
 
Some U.S. Carriers Critical
Airlines and shipping companies in the United States expressed some dissatisfaction with the agreements, saying American objectives like provisions for currency conversion had not been fully met.
The maritime agreement came under especially harsh criticism from ship owners, who said it would be hard for them to compete with the subsidized Soviet merchant marine in carrying goods between the United States and third countries.
But Government officials defended the agreements and said it was in the American interest to make some concessions so that economic changes in the Soviet Union could be put on a more solid footing.
''I think in cases like that, we have to err in favor of the new entrant, the East bloc country that is trying to move into a new era,'' said Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, when asked about objections to the aviation and maritime pacts.
''There are going to be some tough times before they do it, but I think they want to make it happen,'' he said, adding, ''We are going to do everything we can'' to encourage the changes.
The Transportation Department has for more than a year been accelerating the exchange of technical data between the Governments, with several missions back and forth by agencies like the Federal Railroad Administration.
 
Soviet Team in Washington
In a typical exchange between the Governments, a Soviet team was in Washington last week visiting the laboratories of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is laying plans for joint investigations of accidents that might occur as transportation trade increases.
But the big changes are happening in the transportation industries, where some grand plans are in the works. Sea-Land, for example, signed an accord in May with the new Association of Soviet Railways to improve the Trans-Siberian Railway.
Sea-Land, a unit of the CSX Corporation, has proposed other ventures, making it the first American transportation company to propose a partnership with all of the large Soviet rail, sea and air organizations.
It has concluded an agreement with Sovmortrans, a new international joint-venture company that will serve as Sea-Land's general agent in the Soviet Union for its cargo service.
Sea-Land, based in Iselin, N.J., described the agreement as the first time a foreign carrier had chosen as its agent a Soviet transportation company, organized as a profit-making enterprise under the continuing economic reforms in the Soviet Union.
The company has also been studying with Aeroflot a proposal that would expand cargo services by combining ocean and air shipments between Asia and Europe, through the Soviet Union. The idea is to use Aeroflot's extensive cargo capacity to link Eastern and Western ports by air. To make it work, Sea-Land says, extensive investments would be required in handling centers, tracking systems and marketing networks.
 
Many Obstacles Abound
Professor Goldman of the Russian Research Center, who describes himself as a pessimistic observer of the Soviet system, said achieving such aspirations faced several obstacles. First, he said, political change is occurring so fast in the Soviet Union that nobody knows exactly who is in charge. Deals struck in Moscow may be challenged at the local level, while arrangements made with independent enterprises are still subject to central veto.
Second, he said, labor unrest could pose a critical problem in the transportation industry; it has been especially acute in the railroad industry, which in the absence of a good road system is essential to tying together the Soviet economy. Finally, the fundamental obstacle of currency conversion exists, as well as the repatriation of profits, he said.
Still, the deals keep getting signed.
 
Satellite Pact Set
A few days before President Gorbachev visited Minnesota to meet with business leaders there, Honeywell and Northwest, which are both based in the state, announced a deal to use satellites to navigate aircraft.
Airliners of the future are expected to navigate across open oceans by taking precise fixes from satellites. Under the agreement with Honeywell and Northwest Airlines, an American and a Soviet satellite system will be tied together into the same network by the middle of the decade.
The companies have held test flights using the American Navstar satellite, and tests with Soviet technicians are scheduled for next year.
Some aviation agreements are straightforward sales, but even they might have been impossible until the military competition between the nations suddenly waned.
For example, the General Electric Company recently agreed to sell the Soviet Union engines for Aeroflot's newly ordered Airbus Industrie A-310 jetliners, the first such planes ever purchased by the state carrier from foreign suppliers. Because the engines have at their core a military design, export licenses must be granted, and the engines will have to be maintained outside the Soviet Union.
Meanwhile, G.E.'s competitor in the jet-engine business, the Pratt & Whitney Inc. unit of the United Technologies Corporation, said last month that it would enter the Soviet aviation market through a deal with the Soviet Government and a West German engine maker, Motoren und Turbinen Union. Pratt & Whitney said the deal could lead to the codevelopment of a new engine for use on airframes built in the Soviet Union.
 
Daring Jet Proposal
Perhaps the most startling plan put forth so far is the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation's proposal to design a corporate jet capable of flying faster than the speed of sound, in a partnership with the Sukhoi Design Bureau in Moscow, which makes advanced jet-fighters for the Soviet military.
Gulfstream, based in Savannah, Ga., would provide marketing and avionics, while the Soviet group would build the airframe. The deal was announced several months ago.

HEADLINE: U.S. Avoids Germany's Ground Floor

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST BERLIN

 BODY:
Shortly after the Berlin wall burst open in November, the International Business Machines Corporation was on the move in East Germany. Within two months, Johann Weihen, one of the company's top young executives, was assembling a unit to rebuild business in the ''other Germany,'' which had severed ties with the world's leading computer company in 1952.
Operating out of the West Berlin offices of the company's West German subsidiary, I.B.M. Deutschland G.m.b.H., Mr. Weihen and a handful of young, aggressive managers hit the ground running, traveling all over East Germany to evaluate its computer industry, assess market potential and interview prospective business partners and employees in hopes of sealing joint-venture agreements with software and hardware producers and to set up a distribution network for I.B.M. products.
''You can no longer delineate the European economic area with political or national borders,'' Mr. Weihen said. ''That opens up enormous potential. Given the European Community's plan for a single market in 1992, a European market from the Atlantic Ocean to the Urals is conceivable.'' 
 
Americans Moving Slowly
But I.B.M. is an exception among American companies. ''Where are the Americans?'' asked Kurt Kasch, a director of the Deutsche Bank Berlin A.G., who is leading the bank's drive into the East German market. ''Naturally, West German companies will take the lead. One would think Americans would at least be here on fact-finding trips. I've spent weeks in East Germany and have yet to run into any.''
Indeed, business executives from West Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, France and Britain are rushing into East Germany to get in on the ground floor of what many say will be a second German economic miracle and into a market that could be the cornerstone for the economic reconstruction of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
But most American companies have shown either no interest or are moving extremely slowly, experts say. The few American companies entering East Germany, including I.B.M., the General Motors Corporation, the Coca-Cola Company and Levi Strauss & Company, are those with strong West German bases.
Many economists and business executives say the Bush Administration is setting the example for American companies by channeling money into Eastern European countries like Poland and Hungary rather than into East Germany, where it expects the West Germans to take the lead.
Another reason, some believe, is that American banks, already burdened with huge and nonperforming loans to third-world countries, are reluctant to finance companies' pursuits in East Germany.
Some companies are also probably waiting for clarification of important factors for doing business in East Germany, such as ownership of private property and reconstruction of the country's infrastructure.
 
'The Demand Is There'
But deals are being made and market share snapped up. Companies that wait may miss out.
''All our competitors - Hitachi, Siemens, Bull - are in East Germany,'' Mr. Weihen said. ''Every one of them is convinced that now is the time they must stake a claim.''
I.B.M. is not discouraged by the East German economy's accelerating decline. ''Short term, we don't expect big profits from East Germany,'' Mr. Weihen said. ''The demand is there. I have no doubt that East Germany will achieve a remarkable economic recovery.''
What is more, East Germany has the strongest economy in Eastern Europe and a number of other selling points, including a skilled work force.
''In software, I am constantly astonished by what they have achieved, relative to the poor hardware they have,'' Mr. Weihen said.
For I.B.M., results have come quickly. In the last several weeks, the company has signed contracts with VEB Kombinat Datenverarbeitungszentren, the state-owned arm for computer training and software research and development. The pacts authorize the Datenverarbeitungszentren to sell a wide range of I.B.M.'s products in East Germany. I.B.M. would not disclose further details of the agreements.
In mid-March, I.B.M. signed a letter of intent to establish joint ventures with VEB Kombinat Robotron, East Germany's computer builder. Negotiations are still under way. ''Robotron,'' Mr. Weihen said, ''has no products that can really compete successfully in the global market,'' But it could conceivably distribute I.B.M. products in East Germany.
On March 18, the results of East Germany's first free, democratic elections were tallied on I.B.M. computers on loan to the Government from the company.
The East German election brought in the Government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, which is preparing for the merger of East and West Germany's monetary, economic and social policies on July 2.
Once that is accomplished, Mr. Weihen and his 11-man team expect to complete many of I.B.M.'s plans for joint ventures, including opening retail shops. He would not discuss details.
 
Overcoming History
But Mr. Weihen and many other European business executives worry about the perception of a united Germany as the strongman of Europe.
While 40 years of peace and democracy in West Germany have made the prospect of a unified Germany less threatening, West German Government and business leaders still look to corporate America's involvement as a way to allay fears.
They complain privately that the United States Government's diplomatic team in East Germany has been very slow to grasp the economic implications of German unity, or the democratic revolution that has swept Eastern Europe.
Robert A. Mosbacher, the United States Commerce Secretary denies that the Administration and American businesses are being overly cautious and praised Washington's representatives in West Germany. He cited the opening in March of a Foreign Commercial Service Office in West Berlin to promote American business in East Germany as an example of American interest.
''We intend to help United States business in East Germany, as we have and do in many other countries,'' he said.
''But I think you have to separate East Germany from Eastern Europe,'' the Secretary added. ''East Germany has a special predisposition toward West Germany. Although we're going in and will be working directly with East Germany and will be working with West German companies in joint ventures in East Germany, our involvement in Poland, Hungary and other Eastern European countries is on another level.''
Indeed, American investment in Eastern Europe was about $500 million in 1989, and virtually none of that was in East Germany, he said. The total United States investment in Eastern Europe is dwarfed by a single deal, worth $3 billion, between West Germany's Volkswagen A.G. and the East German auto maker VEB Ifa Kombinat Personenkraftwagen.
 
'Pretty Small Pickings'
But the Administration's actions may be discouraging Americans from entering East Germany and that could be costly, according to Martin McCauley, a private consultant and economics professor at University of London's School of Slavonic and East European Studies. He said the next two years will be decisive for companies wanting to do business in East Germany.
''If they are not in by then, they will be left with pretty small pickings,'' he said, adding that East German companies will soon be looking for financial help rather than joint ventures. But, he said, ''it will get very expensive to buy in.''
To Mr. McCauley, the economic implications are clear. ''If the Americans don't get involved now,'' he said, ''in 10 years we will see Germany completely dominating Europe economically, a Europe that will be the largest market in the world. Then the Germans will begin talking very tough indeed to the United States. And they may not be asking; they may be demanding.''

HEADLINE: Little Risk in G.M.'s Soviet Foothold

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 10

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation's $1 billion contract to supply catalytic converters and engine parts to the Soviet Union's Volga Auto Works, known as VAZ, has gained attention from economists and experts on Soviet industry mostly because the Soviets have promised to pay in hard currency, something the country painfully lacks.
Even if the Soviets are able to pay for the parts, they will have to build a car that is twice as popular as the model they now sell in Western Europe to meet the minimum order in the G.M. deal.
The agreement starts in 1992 and runs for five years. VAZ has agreed to buy enough parts, used for systems that make fuel burn efficiently with low amounts of pollution, to build 100,000 to 150,000 cars. The Soviet car, the Lada, will face growing competition from Japanese auto makers, who are gaining strength and forcing European companies to improve their products as well. 
Mary Ann Keller, an automotive analyst for Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney, says the Lada can make it in Western Europe, but only if it sells at a low enough price.
The potential benefits for G.M. are as uncertain as the future of perestroika, but the deal also poses relatively little risk, and it permits the giant auto maker to gain an early foothold in what one day may develop into a healthy economic environment.
''The Soviet Union announced this deal at a time when it doesn't really have the dollars,'' said Marshall Goldman, associate director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard University. ''But it doesn't start for a few years, and perhaps the economy will kick in by then.''
From a public relations perspective, G.M. may derive some immediate benefit by portraying itself as a patron of emerging capitalism in Eastern Europe.
Unofficially, G.M. executives concede that any payoff will not come quickly.
G.M. executives traveling to the VAZ operations in Togliatti had trouble communicating by telephone with their associates in Detroit. The problems may require G.M. to establish a private sattelite network that would bypass the Soviet telephone system.
 
'Pursuing New Frontier'
Speaking of G.M.'s growing investment in eastern Europe, Lou Hughes, managing director of G.M.'s Opel subsidiary said: ''Some thought the frontier spirit was dying in America, and that G.M. has its share of difficulties. It says a lot for our company, in the midst of our challenges, that we are aggressively pursuing a new frontier.''
The Ford Motor Company last year decided against a more risky venture to upgrade an auto plant in Gorky, partly because of the uncertain financial condition of the Soviet Union.
G.M. is really not risking much capital at this stage and will not have to build any plants; one G.M. executive referred to their agreement as essentially a purchase order. The Soviets, however, eventually want a joint manufacturing venture, which would cost at least several hundred million dollars. G.M.'s financial resources are not unlimited, but its pockets still are deeper than Ford's G.M. believes consumers in Poland and Romania have the greatest potential as future car buyers, and the company already is setting up dealerships in these countries. In Hungary, East Germany and Yugoslavia, G.M is setting up some joint manufacturing ventures. Mr. Hughes of G.M. said that the company was less interested in how to repatriate profits than in being a force for economic development, which will have a greater long-term effect on G.M.
 
A Different Problem
The Soviet Union, however, presents a different problem for G.M. than in Eastern Europe because its consumer economy is not as well developed. Therefore, G.M.'s approach is more cautious there. The main uncertainty is whether the Soviet Union can pay. Companies all over the world - Australian wool merchants, Japanese steelmakers and American granaries - have recently stopped shipments to the U.S.S.R. because bills have not been paid, Mr. Goldman noted.
Still, the Soviet auto industry has little choice but to press forward with new agreements. The industry is technologically backward. Indeed, G.M.'s parts will be installed in the Lada, a derivative of a 20-year-old Fiat model, so it can meet pending western European clean-air standards. Exporting large numbers of Ladas, which could generate desperately needed hard currency, is not possible without pollution controls. The Lada has received praise for utilitarian sturdiness, but few compliments for esthetics or comforts like a quiet, smooth ride.
Beyond the need to buy components, G.M. executives say Soviet automotive engineers need to learn about more sophisticated technologies, like electronic and emission controls. For example, all Russian car engines currently feature carburetors, a technology that is growing obsolete in the West; while few, if any, have on-board computers, routinely used in the most ordinary American-made vehicle.
Mr. Goldman warned that upgrading the Lada to Western European standards could create an backlash in the Soviet Union. Soviet consumers, he said, may demand a chance to buy the products for themselves.
Already, he pointed out, certain Soviet-made appliances like refrigerators are not exported as agressively as they could be, giving up some opportunities to generate hard currency in order to satisfy the Soviet consumer demand.

HEADLINE: Free-Trade Talks Seen For Mexico

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
President Bush is expected to announce this week that the United States will begin preparing for free-trade talks with Mexico, senior Administration officials said over the weekend.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari arrived here today for his third visit in less than a year for discussions with Mr. Bush and other American political and business leaders.
American officials have long favored the principle of free trade for the two countries, but opposition in Mexico has made the issue moot until recent months.
 
Abrupt Call for Pact
Mr. Salinas abruptly reversed the situation this spring and called for free-trade talks, giving pause to the Bush Administration. The Mexican President sees a free-trade agreement with the United States as an essential complement to the bold reforms he began in 1988, including privatization of banks and other state enterprises, and a crackdown on corruption. 
Mexico, which is already the United States' third-largest trading partner after Canada and Japan, would gain greater access to American markets and in turn become more attractive to investors.
Some of Mr. Bush's closest advisers have urged him to move warily with Mexico, given the immense hurdles to be overcome. Strong opposition is expected from organized labor in the United States, because of the prospect of low-priced Mexican imports that could threaten jobs. The prospect of a free-trade pact is also expected to worry members of Congress with constituencies producing textiles, footwear, base metals and other import-sensitive products.
 
Divided Administration
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, who would have to negotiate the agreement and sell it to Congress, has been among those taking the more cautious approach. The Secretary of Commerce, Robert A. Mosbacher, and the Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, both Texans, want faster action.
The Administration officials said Mr. Bush was eager to respond positively to the initiatives of Mr. Salinas, who was to began his visit here with dinner at the White House. The officials also noted that any agreement would take years to negotiate and put fully into effect. The general view is that unless the Administration backs Mr. Salinas's domestic reform program, it could fail.
''Clearly, the free-trade train has left the station, and now it's a question of when it arrives at its destination,'' a senior American trade official said. ''Down the line, we are going to have a free-trade agreement with Mexico.''
 
Tied to Uruguay Talks
The formal negotiations are unlikely to begin until next year, after the conclusion of four years of world trade talks known as the Uruguay Round. Those negotiations, which Mr. Bush has declared his highest trade priority, involve 106 countries that are pursuing mutual cuts in trade and investment barriers.
The United States already has a free-trade agreement with Canada in which tariffs and investment barriers are being progressively dismantled over the next nine years. The pact with Canada provoked much concern that the country would be overwhelmed by the United States.
Even without free trade, Mexico and the United States are doing substantial business together. In 1989, two-way trade surpassed $51 billion. The United States is Mexico's primary export market and its largest supplier of imports.
 
Delay Likely in Formal Request
Several American officials said Mr. Bush and Mr. Salinas would give their political endorsement to the idea of a free-trade agreement while delaying a formal request for negotiations.
This has been the recommendation as well of the Business Roundtable, an influential group of 200 chief executives of large American companies that would be among the beneficiaries of expanded trade with Mexico.
''These negotiations should commence after completion of the Uruguay Round,'' the group said in a recently adopted position paper.
President Salinas is expected to set forth his most comprehensive views to date about free trade with the United States at a dinner meeting of the Business Roundtable on Monday.
Mr. Salinas, a 42-year-old economist who took office in December 1988, was also scheduled to have a breakfast meeting Monday morning with Secretary of State Baker.
 
Visit With Congressmen
Other items on Mr. Salinas's agenda Monday include visiting with several members of Congress, including lunch with the Senate Democratic Majority Leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, and meeting with groups of American business people.
After a breakfast Tuesday morning with Vice President Dan Quayle, Mr. Salinas will return to Mexico City before beginning a 10-day Asian trip next week.
President Salinas is expected to set forth his most comprehensive views to date about free trade with the United States at the dinner meeting of the Business Roundtable.
Under 1988 trade law, a formal request for a free-trade agreement would cause statutory notice to the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees, which would then have 60 legislative days (at least four months) in which to determine whether such agreement would be in the United States' interest.
 
Early Canadian Crisis
An early crisis occurred in the move toward a Canadian pact when the Senate Finance Committee on April 23, 1986, voted 10-10 on a resolution to deny negotiating authority to the Administration. Under the rules of procedure, the negotiation was permitted to go forward, but by the narrowest of margins.
Any Mexican agreement invites similar crises, which is one reason Mrs. Hills has taken the cautious line.
''I think it's very important to talk very carefully about what is intended by the trade agreement, what is the coverage, and the analysis of how it would affect sectors of this country, as well as sectors of Mexico,'' she said recently. ''I think it is better to do your analysis before you start something like that than find yourself engaged in a negotiation and then have problems.''
The two countries are already involved in trade negotiations of a much less ambitious nature. Since last October, when the two Presidents signed the Understanding Regarding Trade and Investment Facilitation Talks, the United States and Mexico have sought improvements in specific sectors of their bilateral trade.

HEADLINE: New York City Chooses Firms for Bond Offering

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Ending a fierce competition on Wall Street, New York City has named the five securities firms that will serve as senior managers for its general-obligation bond offerings over the next two years.
City officials said on Friday that Bear, Stearns & Company, the First Boston Corporation, Goldman, Sachs & Company, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. had been chosen from among 53 companies that had sought to manage the offerings.
As senior managers, the five firms will earn most of underwriting fees generated from an estimated $6 billion in general obligation bonds that are expected to be issued by the city over the next two years. 
In the course of the selection process, Mayor David N. Dinkins and Elizabeth Holtzman, the city's Comptroller, told the contestants that a firm's business connections with South Africa would be an important consideration.
In a joint news release, Mr. Dinkins and Ms. Holtzman also said efforts by firms to promote equal employment opportunities would be taken into account as well.
Based on the list of senior managers, however, it appears that economic considerations carried more weight with city officials in the decision-making process than worries about social responsibility.
The five firms selected all have various ties with South Africa. But they also have the ability to underwrite and distribute the city's securities at far lower interest rates than smaller firms with no ties to South Africa could be expected to deliver.
''Having a policy that is socially responsible has to be balanced off with the administration's responsibility to be fiscally prudent,'' said a senior city official, who asked not to be identified.
''At current rate levels, one basis point on $100 million is worth about $90,000 in present value terms,'' he said. (A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.) ''When you consider the magnitude of our program and what those savings mean, you are talking about tens of millions of dollars,'' he said. ''We have to go out and find the best people to sell our bonds. We have a fiscal responsibility to do that.''
In their news release, the Mayor and the Comptroller said the city reserved the right to replace any of the senior managers selected if they ''fail to demonstrate progress'' in curbing ties to South Africa or in promoting equal opportunity employment.
The Mayor and Ms. Holtzman also announced that Grigsby, Branford & Powell, a minority-owned securities firm, and the Artemis Capital Group, a firm owned by women were named as co-senior managers for a new equipment financing program. It is the first time that a minority-owned firm or one owned by women has been named senior managing underwriter on a city debt offering.
The names of the co-managers for the City's general obligation bond issues will be announced this week.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
More Foreign Buying Is Expected

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Some credit market analysts say that although foreign investors for the most part shunned Treasury securities in the first quarter, they have been active buyers in recent weeks and are likely to continue buying in the near term.
Most of the evidence about a recent increase in foreign buying is anecdotal. But word of any sort of increase is somewhat surprising, because interest rates in most of the world's large financial markets are extremely competitive with those in the United States.
''Right now, the American fixed-income market is extremely expensive'' relative to other markets, said Roger Portnoy, chief global strategist for Technical Data, a bond market advisory and analysis firm in London. 
''You can move from a 10-year Treasury note into a 10-year German bond and pick up about 15 basis points in the process,'' he said. ''If you moved out of two-year Treasuries into two-year German notes, you would pick up 60 basis points. The only other time you could do that was in the early 1970's.'' A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Late last week, the Treasury's 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price to yield 8.45 percent. By comparison, West Germany's 7 3/4 percent bonds of 2000 were offered at a price to yield 8.63 percent.
For the most part, foreigners have been willing to forego higher yields elsewhere because the risks of investing in the United States are considered lower than in West Germany or Japan.
 
A Positive Perception
''The perception among foreign investors of the political and economic climate in the United States is positive,'' Mr. Portnoy said.
''Also, since the Federal Reserve Board moved sooner and more aggressively to deal with inflation than other central banks, there is a perception abroad that inflation is not as bad here as it is elsewhere,'' he said.
At the moment, the benefits of a more stable political climate and lower inflation risk amount to a premium of 50 to 75 basis points for Treasury securities over debt issued by other Governments, Mr. Portnoy said.
 
Further Rate Decline Seen
Mr. Portnoy said a further decline in American interest rates is likely during the next month or so.
As a result, he has been advising his firm's clients, primarily large European, Australian and Japanese pension funds and insurance companies, to increase their holdings in Treasury securities to 70 percent or more of their total portfolio.
A ''neutral'' weighting toward the Treasury market would be about 55 percent of the total, he said.
Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montague Economics, said, ''Around the globe, there is a fairly broad anticipation that investors who put money in dollar-denominated fixed-income securities are more likely to see interest rates decline along with economic weakness, and therefore sustain a capital gain.''
''The fear in other countries - Germany, and to a lesser extent in Japan and the United Kingdom, is that rates may rise,'' he said.
Foreign investment in Treasury securities is likely to remain healthy because the uncertainties about a united Germany will remain for some time after the East German ostmark is unified with the West German mark on July 2. As a result, Mr. Fabbri and others said, the dollar is likely to remain stronger than economic fundamentals might warrant.
Because of the dollar's strength, ''global investors may be forced to keep a bigger part of their portfolio in the United States than they otherwise might,'' Mr. Fabbri added.
 
Markets Could Be Rattled
The almost numbing stability that characterized the credit markets last week could be rattled somewhat in the next few days, as several reports on the economy and inflation are scheduled to be released.
Analysts are expected to give scrutiny to Wednesday's report on retail sales figures for May and the back-to-back reports on producer prices and consumer prices on Thursday and Friday.
By most accounts, the retail sales figures are not likely to show that consumers are providing much stimulus to the economy.
''Retail sales are flat,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
The inflation figures will be the most closely watched, not only by the markets but by the Federal Reserve Board.
Producer prices, which have declined each month since a 1.8 percent spurt in January, probably rose by a modest two-tenths of a percentage point in May, analysts said.
And consumer prices, which galloped ahead at an annual rate of more than an 8 percent in the first quarter, also moderated in May.
Analysts at Salomon Brothers said the continued declines in retail energy and food prices probably limited the rise in consumer prices to two-tenths of a percentage point last month.
Even if the inflation figures are encouraging, few analysts anticipate that the Fed will move to ease monetary policy.
''The inflation numbers will be friendly,'' said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. ''But the only way they make sense is to combine them with what went on before. You need numbers in the 3 percent to 4 percent range to bring down the numbers we had in the first quarter.''

HEADLINE: Fed Officer Sees Dangers

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BASEL, Switzerland, June 10

 BODY:
A member of the Federal Reserve Board warned today of the dangers posed by the weakness of the United States economy and urged a relaxation of the central bank's monetary policy by the end of the year.
There have been isolated weak spots before in the seven and a half years of American economic expansion, but now several important sectors are showing a slowdown at the same time, said Martha R. Seger, the Fed official, who is attending the annual meeting of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. ''I personally believe that before this year is out we shall have to ease,'' she added.
But she said she did not know if a majority of the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, which decides American monetary policy, would agree with her.
Warning of the dangers of keeping monetary policy too tight, Ms. Seger said, ''There are a lot of sleepers out there, and any mistakes could put the economy into recession.''
She added that she did not share the anxiety of some economists that an easing of policy might unsettle financial markets.

Caution Replaces Glamour As the Key Word in Books

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell

 BODY:
MANY book publishers would normally mount eye-catching exhibits of their fall books at the American Booksellers Association's convention. But at this year's gathering, most of the displays were unusually subdued.
Gone were the caged animals, the hot-air balloons and the preoccupation with Hollywood stars. A few celebrities were on hand, but for most publishers it was back to basics. 
The reason for the low-keyed approach, some visitors assumed, was that the convention was being held in Las Vegas, Nev., where any attempt to get attention could only pale alongside the erupting volcanos, storybook castles and tropical rain forests at the city's hotels and casinos.
That may indeed have inhibited some publishers at the event last week, but there seemed to have been something more fundamental at work, something that appears to augur well for book publishing: the understanding that smoke and mirrors, glitz and glitter are no substitutes for quality books.
Most publishers have always known this, of course. But with the rise of the blockbuster book, they either lost sight of it or chose to ignore it. Nowhere was that more apparent than at previous booksellers' conventions, where the promotions and pronouncements of huge first printings were raised to a pitch that Barnum would have envied.
This frenzy by itself was not too bad, because enthusiasm is essential to successful publishing and bookselling. What was bad was that publishers began to believe their own hyperbole and tried to persuade bookstores to believe it as well. So after paying unrealistic advances for many books, publishers leaned on booksellers to double and triple their orders.
When the books were returned, sometimes in the hundreds of thousands, the publishers had to write off not just the unearned authors' royalties but also the cost of producing and warehousing the unsold books.
At last week's convention, however, there were signs of change in the desert air. Despite what is generally regarded as one of the strongest fall book lists in years, few publishers were boasting about the size of their first printings. Instead, they were talking about ''the hand sell,'' industry jargon for selling books individually rather than like soap. And they were talking about writing quality - a departure from the recent past and a welcome recognition that books, after all, are to be read and savored.
While both the new Jean Auel and Sidney Sheldon novels are likely to have first printings of a million or more, other books will start out much more cautiously - even books by best-selling authors.
For example, in one case B. Dalton and Waldenbooks have already ordered more than 100,000 copies of a new book. Orders from the other chain stores and independent booksellers could eventually double that number. But instead of printing 350,000 to 400,000 copies, as many houses would do in similar circumstances, this house - whose executives did not want to be identified -plans to print an initial 250,000 copies to minimize the risk of heavy returns.
''I don't care how many orders we get; I'm not going to be overruled on the initial printing,'' the publisher of that house said. ''If we see a gigantic runaway, I can reprint quickly.''
One thing in the publishers' favor is that reprinting is simpler than in the past. ''Paper is widely available and there are a lot of presses with big capacity,'' said Parker Ladd, a director of the Association of American Publishers. ''It used to take as much as three months to reprint; now it can be done in a few weeks.''
Moreover, computers allow publishers to keep closer track of their book sales. ''If they find they aren't selling in Colorado, for example,'' Mr. Ladd said, ''they can move them down to stores in Florida.''
When publishers have been cautious in previous years, their caution often reflected a sluggish economy. So it would be foolish to predict that the relative absence of glitter at last week's convention represented a permanent condition. But there are reasons to think that the caution may last a bit longer than usual.
For one thing, the book chains are reducing the size of their orders. They will still place big orders for certain titles, but publishers say the chains are reluctant to fill their stores with stacks of the same titles.
''They don't get hurt as much as we do if a book doesn't blow out of the store,'' one publisher said. ''But by cluttering stores with lots of copies of books that didn't move, they have missed sales on books that will sell.''
Finally, the new-found caution reflects corporate realities.
''When publishing houses were privately owned, a big mistake was chalked up to experience,'' said the publisher of a quality house owned by a conglomerate. ''But when you're talking to absentee landlords, and they say, 'How come your revenues were up but profits were down,' they and their accountants don't want to hear about write-offs for unsold books - at least they don't want to hear about it two or three years in a row.''
So, at least for now, caution is the word.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Is Europe A Common TV Market?

BYLINE: By Randall Rothenberg

 BODY:
IF Marcella Rosen is right, the ''Hallmark Hall de Celebrite'' could soon be a fixture on French television - and perhaps, in the appropriate languages, on video screens across Europe.
The worldwide media director of the Ayer advertising agency thinks advertisers will be regularly sponsoring television programs for much or all of Europe by the end of the decade.
In a speech last week to French broadcasting executives and Government regulators, as well as journalists, clients and agency executives, at Ayer's Paris office, Ms. Rosen said the proliferation of broadcast, cable and satellite television franchises in Europe would lead to advertiser-supported programming on pan-European television networks.
By asserting the inevitability of pan-European media, Ms. Rosen has inserted herself squarely in the middle of a continuing debate in the advertising industry. Some executives, like Martin Sorrell, the group chief executive of the WPP Group, have repeatedly said local differences are becoming more important to global marketers. Others, Ms. Rosen among them, believe that in Europe, political and economic integration will bring a significant degree of cultural homogenization as well. 
In her Paris talk, Ayer's media director noted that program preferences differed from country to country in Europe, with the Spanish, for example, preferring operas and novellas, while the British taste runs more to documentaries and mysteries.
But she added, ''as viewers across countries get the opportunity to sample other programming options, the viewing tastes will become more similar.''
As that happens, she said, the use of sponsorships for programs in individual countries, as well as for pan-European programs, will grow.
Under a sponsorship arrangement, a marketer pays for the development of a show and owns all of the national commercials during it. Such support, which has been common in the United States since the inception of network broadcasting, gives advertisers greater flexibility in choosing shows and audiences. It also enables them to use different advertising forms, like the long, cinematic commercials Ayer has created for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.
In a telephone interview from Paris, Ms. Rosen pointed out that sponsorship has been all but nonexistent in Europe because in most countries broadcasting was so strictly controlled by national Governments that commercials were restricted to limited blocks of time - if they were allowed at all. Most television channels in Europe have been state-run.
Unable to choose the shows on which they would advertise, marketers could not pick their target audiences.
''People could always target in print, because there were many different magazines for different audiences,'' Ms. Rosen said. ''But they could not target in broadcast, for the most part. Now, with private channels, they will be able to pick programs for specific audiences and to sponsor programs.
Ayer, which has 70 offices in 41 countries, has a stake in promoting pan-European television and program sponsorship. Five months ago, the agency formed WIN Ayer, a venture with a consortium of broadcasting companies to produce and distribute original programming around the world. The project allows Ayer to develop programs on behalf of clients for worldwide broadcast.
Ms. Rosen said some European broadcasters were hesitant about program sponsorship because ''they worried that it implies cultural control.''
''We have had to tell them it doesn't work that way,'' she said. ''In the United States, you sponsor, but you don't have editorial control, because the marketplace won't let it work. All you want is a program good enough to get the audience.''
While a strong believer that European tastes will grow together, Ms. Rosen nevertheless emphasized that nationalism also will rise in importance.
''There is a trend and a countertrend,'' she said. ''You won't be able to use only pan-European media, just as you can't in the U.S. You can use national, but you also have to adjust for local, or add local. It's the same concept in Europe.''

HEADLINE: Loan Reported, Giving Trump Time to Raise Cash

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Donald J. Trump and the banks that have backed his empire with billions in loans reached a tentative agreement yesterday that would give Mr. Trump an additional $60 million in loans and temporarily suspend some interest payments on other debt, bank officials said.
In exchange, Mr. Trump, who bankers said pressed them to lend him at least $100 million, would pledge some of his assets as collateral and is expected to give up part of his ownership in some of his major properties.
Mr. Trump is also trying to sell a stake of up to 49 percent in one of his real estate or casino assets to ease his cash problems, according to both bankers and a person close to Mr. Trump's negotiators. The developer is also trying to sell most of his smaller, high-profile assets, including planes and helicopters, they said. 
Mr. Trump and the banks, which began negotiations two weeks ago, have not determined which assets will become collateral for the $60 million loan, but people close to the talks said all the developer's properties were being reviewed. Negotiations on details of the deal continued last evening.
The agreement with the banks is intended to give Mr. Trump time to sell some assets and raise cash to pay off some of the billions of dollars of bank debt that his various companies carry.
''The premise in doing this is to give him more breathing room to sell some of his assets and come up with the cash he needs rather than have a fire sale of assets,'' said a banker involved in the negotiation.
By some estimates, his operations carry $2 billion of bank debt, which would produce interest costs of about $17 million a month at the prime rate. In addition, Mr. Trump's various gambling companies have $1 billion in high-yield ''junk bonds'' outstanding with monthly debt costs of about $15 million. Most immediately, he faces a $30 million payment this Friday on an issue of bonds used to finance his Trump's Castle casino in Atlantic City.
The banks were concerned that if Mr. Trump failed to meet this coming interest payment, it could threaten his casino licenses. Mr. Trump owns three Atlantic City casinos, the maximum allowed by New Jersey regulators, and any default on his casino bonds could force him into court and threaten his entire casino business.
 
Industry Downturns
Mr. Trump's real estate and gambling empire has been squeezed by the downturns in both those industries and the developer has been strapped for cash to meet the interest payments on his debt. Recent purchases, like the Trump Shuttle and the Plaza Hotel, have added to the strain on his finances because neither has yet produced a profit sufficient to cover its large debt-service expenses.
In the past, he has always tried to keep sole ownership of many of his main assets, including the Plaza Hotel and the three casinos.
Mr. Trump has also said that he is paying about $20 million in annual interest costs on a 72-acre parcel of vacant land in Manhattan that produces no income.
The security behind existing bank loans varies greatly. Some are secured by specific assets, and have no guarantee from Mr. Trump, while others are personal obligations of the real estate developer but not backed by any specific asset. The new loans will, in effect, be second mortgages on some assets.
 
Banks Led by Citicorp
According to one banker, Citicorp has about $300 million in loans outstanding to Mr. Trump, Bankers Trust has over $100 million and Chase Manhattan and Manufacturers Hanover each have about $100 million.
At least $40 million of the new loan will be provided by Citicorp and Bankers Trust, and $20 million will be provided by the other large banks. In addition to the New York banks, Midlantic Banks Inc. and First Fidelity Bancorp, two New Jersey banking companies, also have substantial loans outstanding to the developer.
Among the assets that Mr. Trump is considering selling are minority stakes in one or more of his main holdings - like the Plaza Hotel, Trump's Castle and the Trump Plaza. He has already announced that the Trump Shuttle, which he purchased last year, and his $30 million yacht are for sale.
''There are people who are out shopping the boat, the plane and the helicopter, amongst other of the smaller assets,'' said an executive familiar with Mr. Trump's business plans. ''There are also talks going on regarding a sale of a piece of the larger assets.''
 
Persuading Smaller Creditors
Bankers involved in yesterday's negotiations said they focused on persuading many of Mr. Trump's smaller creditors to approve the plan. Agreement for the plan must be given by all the creditors because the banks that first lent money against Trump properties must now approve the added collateral for those assets.
In addition to his cash squeeze, Mr. Trump faces several lawsuits, including a class action suit filed last week by Trump's Castle bondholders. The bondholders accused Mr. Trump of fraudulent misrepresentation of the financial condition of the Castle when the bonds were sold in 1985, violating his fiduciary duties, and hurting their investments by illegally transferring the client lists of the Castle to the Taj Mahal, the developer's newest casino.
News of the loan agreement caused the junk bonds linked to the developer's Atlantic City casino companies to rally yesterday. The Trump Castle bonds, which pay interest of 13 3/4 percent annually and mature in 1997, were being offered at about $60.50 per $100 of face value, up $2 from Friday.
The Trump Plaza bonds, which pay 12 7/8 percent, rose about $2, to about $83.50 per $100 of face value. The Trump Taj Mahal 14 percent mortgage bonds that come due in 1998 rose about $3, to about $59.50 per $100 of face value.

HEADLINE: THE SAVINGS DEBACLE: A CASE STUDY - A SPECIAL REPORT:
How One Savings Institution Came Apart

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 11

 BODY:
Carl M. Rheuban founded First Network Savings Bank in 1983, and for six years poured its Government-insured deposits into questionable real estate deals, a solar energy company and even a ''museum of magic'' in the savings and loan institution's headquarters here.
Earlier this year, First Network collapsed into insolvency amid mounting losses and civil and criminal fraud investigations. After the Government seized the failed savings and loan, regulators calculated the cost to the taxpayers of cleaning up the mess to be $100 million, or nearly 25 cents for every dollar deposited there. The $100 million represents the shortfall that the Government must pay, after all of First Network's assets have been sold, to make sure depositors suffer no loss.
Mr. Rheuban, who paid himself $11 million in dividends over six years as the owner of 97 percent of First Network, filed for personal bankruptcy last month, listing few assets and tens of millions of dollars in debts. He has not been accused of a crime, but his role in the institution is under investigation. 
The rise and fall of First Network is a case history of how one institution, like hundreds of others, rushed to take advantage of the savings industry's deregulation during the early 1980's, only to end up contributing to the most costly financial crisis since the Depression.
The First Network example also helps explain why regulators and law enforcement officials often failed to detect possible fraud and mismanagement sooner, allowing the savings crisis to grow undetected. Government officials, lawyers and other experts see a pattern in the First Network case that has become all too familiar as they sift through the wreckage of the industry.
Unlike the failure of many savings institutions in economically troubled states like Texas, the death of First Network was not primarily a result of the collapsing real estate market. Instead, First Network's troubles appeared to have stemmed from overly opti-mistic, overly aggressive or, in the view of regulators, potentially fraudulent real estate deals. The case has been referred by Federal and state regulators to the Justice Department for possible prosecution on fraud charges, and it may be years before the case is resolved, all of the money is traced and the blame can be properly apportioned.
Under Mr. Rheuban, a real estate developer with no previous experience running a savings and loan, First Network shunned home-mortgage lending, the traditional mainstay of the savings industry. Rather than establishing a large and elaborate network of branches to solicit deposits, he advertised high interest rates on deposits to attract funds from all over the country by mail, phone and computer. For most of its existence, First Network never even had a branch or tellers.

Mr. Rheuban invested First Network's federally insured deposits in complicated and risky real estate deals, often in joint ventures with a small circle of real estate developers, lawyers and other associates and friends.
George Hale, a specialist in troubled savings and loans who was brought in by regulators to run First Network, calls Mr. Rheuban ''a very bright person'' whose main expertise was in real estate and partnership law. ''He did a masterful job, if I can use that term, in structuring these deals so they went undetected for a long time during a period when savings and loans were being highly scrutinized,'' Mr. Hale said.
Citing the current criminal fraud investigation, neither Mr. Hale nor the state and Federal regulators would discuss the details of the problems they discovered at First Network. But broadly speaking, these intricate deals allowed First Network to hide some of its risks, by sidestepping Federal rules that limit how much of a savings institution's assets could be invested in real estate, according to court documents and people involved in the investigation. To date, Mr. Rheuban has not been charged with fraud.
Documents filed with a bankruptcy trustee by the Government say the regulators have evidence that First Network engaged in a variety of fraudulent loans and transactions. Among them are what regulators suspect were circular transactions in which First Network may have made or arranged loans to borrowers that were then funneled back to First Network and used to create the appearance that its financial strength was greater than it really was.
The Office of Thrift Supervision, the primary Federal regulatory agency, noted a litany of problems last month as it placed First Network into receivership including ''an excessive amount of delinquent commercial real estate loans'' and ''extensions of credit beyond the institution's legal lending limits.'' In the Beginning A Developer With Charm The demise of First Network is a stunning reversal for the 41-year-old Mr. Rheuban, whom former associates describe as young-looking for his age and charming. Mr. Rheuban declined to be interviewed.
For most the of 1980's, Mr. Rheuban lived well on his sizable income. He lived in a multimillion-dollar house in the affluent suburb of Pacific Palisades.
As his wealth grew, Mr. Rheuban became increasingly prominent in political circles. The recipients of his largesse included Senator Alan Cranston, the California Democract who also had close ties to Charles H. Keating Jr., the owner of the now-insolvent Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
But Mr. Rheuban's donations, once eagerly sought, have now become a source of embarrassment to California politicians and his personal assets are being auctioned to pay off debts. His Pacific Palisades home, along with the adjacent property, has been put up for sale under bankruptcy court supervision for $12 million. He was recently forced to sell five of his cars and five of his motorcycles, for a total of $50,000, to pay his bills. Mr. Rheuban now spends much of his time with his lawyers, and has told creditors he plans to file suit challenging the Government's actions in seizing and starting to dismantle First Network.
Seven years ago, when he founded First Network, originally called the Deauville Savings and Loan, the savings and loan business seemed a lucrative arena for aggressive entrepreneur like Mr. Rheuban.
The savings and loan industry, once a bastion of simple, conservative home mortgage lending, was transformed during the early 1980's by the sweeping new investment freedoms granted it by Congress and state legislatures. After deregulation, the business became a magnet for a new breed of owners who saw federally insured savings deposits as an irresistible source of funds for investments in office buildings, shopping centers, residential developments, ''junk bonds,'' fast-food chains and virtually every other kind of venture imaginable.
 
No-Lose Propositions
Only half-jokingly, industry executives have taken to describe the business as ''heads I win, tails you lose,'' reflecting the fact that owners could pocket the profits when risky, complex or unorthodox investments paid off - and leave the Government and the taxpayers to pick up most of the tab when those ventures failed, were mismanaged or turned out to be fraudulent.
Mr. Rheuban was exactly the kind of entrepreneur being attracted to the business. A successful developer of mobile home parks and other projects, he was also well known in legal circles as one of the primary authors of California's limited partnership laws, a very useful specialty in the complex world of real estate financing.
At First Network, he put his deal-making skills to frequent use. Mr. Rheuban made commercial real estate loans and set up partnerships that took ownership stakes in office buildings, residential developments and a chain of ''store and lock'' personal storage warehouses. While regulators believe some of the deals through which First Network invested its funds may have been fraudulent, the institution had a large portfolio of loans and investments for real estate that was for the most part of good quality.
''The types of partnership loans and investments they were doing were far from what a traditional savings and loan would be doing,'' said William D. Davis, the deputy commissioner of the California state savings and loan department.
 
''
First Network grew rapidly, reaching $120 million in assets at the end of 1985, $205 million two years later and $517 million by the end of 1988. The strategy appeared to be highly successful. First Network reported substantial profits through its first four years, including reported net earnings of $2.9 million in 1987, one of the best performances in the nation among institutions of its size.
Even Federal regulators, who by then were already coping with an avalanche of failures, considered First Network sufficiently strong and stable at the end of 1988 to arrange for the institution to acquire Tahoe Savings, a small, insolvent savings and loan in Northern California, with more than $30 million in Government aid. In the End Transactions Seem to Unravel First Network certainly appeared to be paying off for Mr. Rheuban, who in 1987 alone voted himself more than $3 million in dividend payments. In addition to his extensive political contributions, Mr. Rheuban served on the boards of various charity organizations and, along with his wife, Deborah, was a regular on the Beverly Hills charity-social scene.
Life was also good for those working at First Network. The institution maintained a fully equipped gym on the premises for the 40 or so employees at the headquarters in the Century City section of Los Angeles, complete with two fitness trainers on the institution's payroll. The walls of the spacious offices were hung with colorful and valuable posters depicting magicians, daredevils and circus performers, reflecting the boss's passion for magic. Mr. Rheuban is an avid amateur magician.
In 1985, Mr. Rheuban spent $850,000 of First Network's money to acquire the world's foremost collection of magic-related books, artifacts and artwork, regulators said. The collection, known as the Mulholland Library of Conjuring and the Allied Arts, was housed at the headquarters. Mr. Rheuban hired Ricky Jay, one of the world's top magicians, to work as curator of the collection on First Network's payroll.
While he built up his magic collection, Mr. Rheuban was also weaving an increasingly intricate web of real estate investment partnerships and joint ventures through which First Network lent and invested much of its money. By the end of 1988, the institution had more than $65 million invested directly in the partnerships, mainly in real estate.
In addition to investing money directly into the partnerships, First Network engaged in highly complex transactions that regulators say allowed the institution to invest more funds in owning real estate than Federal rules permit. For example, people invovled in the investigation said the institution had set up a number of joint ventures, with outside investors acting as general partners and First Network being a limited partner. First Network issued letters of credit to other financial institutions, backed by some of First Network's mortgage-backed securities or other assets. With the letters of credit acting as collateral, the other financial institution would make a loan to the general partners of the joint ventures.
 
Mechanics of a Deal
The general partners would then use the loan proceeds to acquire property, perhaps undeveloped land, and transfer it to the joint ventures. The joint ventures then secured financing for the development of the properties from another set of financial institutions.
The complex transactions did not at first raise any flags with regulators. But last year, as they conducted their annual examinations of the First Network's books, Federal and state regulators found that documentation for many deals was missing or incomplete, and that Mr. Rheuban and other executives were unable or unwilling to answer questions, regulators said.
Together, the state and Federal regulators strongly recommended to Mr. Rheuban that he hire someone to shore up the company's management and resolve the record-keeping problems. The regulators specifically recommended Mr. Hale, a former accountant and real estate consultant who, since 1985, has been working with troubled savings and loans in California.
''We emphasized to Mr. Rheuban that he needed a highly qualified managing officer in there,'' Mr. Davis said. ''We made some strong suggestions to him, and the strongest was George Hale.''
Mr. Rheuban acceded to the request and hired Mr. Hale last fall as president of First Network. Mr. Hale technically reported to Mr. Rheuban, but as a practical matter he was to go in with a strong mandate from the regulators to make an independent assessment of the situation and recommend whatever actions were appropriate. At the time, even Mr. Hale said he believed that all First Network needed was a dose of management discipline.
 
'A Six-Month Turnaround'
''I thought it was going to be a six-month turnaround,'' Mr. Hale said in an interview. ''The shop was considered reasonably clean and well capitalized.''
Within a few months, however, Mr. Hale started discovering transactions and accounting practices that he said did not seem proper to him. Mr. Hale eventually became sufficiently concerned about what he was finding that he hired an outside law firm, Fine, Perzik and Singman, to study some of the transactions.
On Friday, Jan. 19, Mr. Hale received the law firm's report, which Mr. Hale said recommended that criminal referrals be made to regulators. Mr. Hale said he informed Mr. Rheuban of the report's conclusions immediately. Over that weekend, Mr. Hale and Mr. Davis said, Mr. Rheuban acted on his own to dismiss Mr. Hale and the institution's three other board members.
On Monday morning, Jan. 22, Mr. Rheuban, through his lawyer, sent a letter via fax to the California state regulators, suggesting that they move to seize First Network. Regulators are not certain what Mr. Rheuban hoped to accomplish by inviting seizure, but they accommodated him almost immediately. The state savings and loan department took control of the institution that same afternoon, immediately removing Mr. Rheuban as chairman and reinstating Mr. Hale to run the company under government supervision. Federal officials formally took possession of First Network last month. The Aftermath The Accountants Tally the Damage After examining First Network's loans and investments, regulators decided recently added $76 million to the institution's reserves to cover potential losses on loans and investments. The loss provisions, combined with a large operating loss, led to a net loss for the year of $110.9 million, according to preliminary figures compiled for regulators by an outside accounting firm. The auditors recorded a loss on the partnership investments of $21.7 million and a provision for losses on letters of credit, issued by First Network as part of the partnership deals, of $13.4 million.
Regulators and Federal prosecutors are investigating a number of the partnerships, seeking to determine why some of the partnerships do not have title to the property they were purportedly developing among other irregularities. The Government is also trying to force Mr. Rheuban to return $4 million in dividends he paid himself early last year, court documents say.
For now, First Network continues to operate under Government ownership, with all deposits insured up to $100,000, the national ceiling. Officials of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the new Federal agency formed to sell the assets of failed savings institutions, are compiling lists of First Network's office buildings and residential developments, even the solar energy company and an asparagus farm, which will be sold.
The magic collection may prove to be more of a problem. Mr. Rheuban seems certain to claim at least a portion of it as his personal property, and the collection could be tied up in litigation for years. If there is any good news, Mr. Hale says, it is that the magic collection is likely to have been a good investment, worth more now than Mr. Rheuban and First Network paid for it.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND MEXICANS CAUTIOUSLY BACK FREE-TRADE IDEA

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
The United States and Mexico agreed in principle today to move toward negotiating a ''comprehensive free-trade agreement'' but, in an acknowledgment that substantial economic and political hurdles remained, the two nations stopped short of announcing the start of formal talks.
Officials of both nations said any agreement to dismantle barriers to the free flow of goods, money and labor was likely to face significant opposition in the United States.
Labor, business, political and immigration groups fear a huge influx of Mexican labor and of wages in Mexico that are only a fraction of the American level. With those concerns in mind, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is in Washington on a three-day visit, immediately began lobbying here on behalf of the move. 
 
Calls Were Resisted by Mexico
Until this spring, when Mr. Salinas decided that quicker integration of the two economies was the only way to compete with emerging trading blocs in Europe and East Asia, Mexico had resisted a decade of calls by Republican administrations in the United States for a single market ''from the Yukon to the Yucatan.'' Having made the commitment, however, he now finds Washington hesitant about the timing and extent of an agreement.
In a joint statement issued this morning, President Bush and President Salinas said such an accord would be ''a powerful engine for economic development, creating new jobs and opening new markets'' on both sides of the border. But a separate American statement also noted that while ''the announcement endorses the concept'' of a free-trade pact, it ''does not initiate negotiations toward that goal.''
Officials of both countries said that preliminary ''consultations and prepatory work,'' with Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, representing Washington and the Minister of Commerce and Industrial Development, Jaime Serra Puche, representing Mexico City, were likely to continue until Mr. Bush and Mr. Salinas meet again in Mexico in December.
 
No Timetable Offered
The joint statement said the two Governments hoped eventually to eliminate not only tariff barriers but also ''import quotas, licenses and technical barriers'' and would seek ''means to improve and expand the flow of goods, services and investment between the United States and Mexico,'' but offered no timetable for an agreement.
Mr. Salinas said during a meeting with American reporters here that he hoped a free-trade agreement could be concluded in less than three years. Ms. Hills said that this timetable was possible ''if we do a very good job on consultations'' but added that she would ''rather have the vote be unanimous'' in Congress than rush the process and risk rejection. ''We want this to be a success when we embark on it,'' she said.
Trade between the two countries last year amounted to more than $50 billion. Mexico ranks as the third-largest trading partner of the United States and the United States is the largest market for Mexican goods.
 
'Biggest Market in World'
''The Europe of 1992 will be the biggest market in the world,'' Mr. Salinas said. ''But if we can reach a free-trade agreement, North America could be the biggest market in the world.''
Reservations about a free-trade agreement have been expressed by industries in both countries that fear rival companies across the border would have a competitive advantage. But the strongest condemnation of any accord has come from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, which last month called on Mr. Bush to reject negotiations on the grounds that ''a free-trade agreement will only encourage greater capital outflows from the United States and bring about a further increase in imports from Mexico, further harming the United States industrial base.''
The industries most likely to be affected are textile companies and steel producers.
 
Formal Request Required
Under a 1988 trade law, any country wishing a free-trade agreement with the United States must make a formal request to that effect, which then is submitted to the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. Those two panels then have 60 legislative days in which to determine whether such an agreement is in the interests of the United States and authorize the President to proceed.
''Now that we have the approval of our Senate to negotiate, I think the real problems in getting an agreement through are going to come on the American side,'' said one Mexican official likely to be involved in the talks. ''We are going to have to deal not just with Congress, but the labor unions and industries that think they are going to be hurt, as well as anti-immigration groups that don't want to open up the flow of labor.''
Aware of the long political battle that lies ahead, Mr. Salinias met this morning with members of the ''border caucus,'' a group of 23 members of the House of Representatives from districts on or near the United States-Mexican border, and later lunched with the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, and several other senators. Tonight he also addressed the Business Roundtable, an influential group of corporate leaders, to lay out the Mexican position.
 
Less Immigration Seen
''We want to export goods, not labor,'' Mr. Salinas said earlier to reporters. ''To us, free trade means more job creation and less immigration to the United States.''
Failure to conclude a free-trade agreement would have a negative impact on the Mexican economy, Mr. Salinas argued, and the export of Mexican labor ''will actually increase.'' If the United States were to withhold free-trade benefits from an Asian country, he said, ''they will not swim across the ocean to come to the United States, while Mexicans will merely walk across the border to look for jobs in the United States. Therefore I consider it to the benefit of both countries to increase the flow of goods in order to avoid increasing the flow of manpower.''
Addressing the business group, Mr. Salinas also rejected the argument that his country would benefit from a free-trade agreement at the expense of the American wage-earner. ''The strengthening of the Mexican market would mean additional opportunities for American exporters,'' he said, adding that an increase of $10 billion in American exports to Mexico during the last two years had already ''created thousands of new jobs.''
An adviser to Mr. Salinas said that the preliminary discussions between Mr. Serra and Ms. Hills were likely to focus on ''the reach of the agreement.''
 
Exclusion for Oil
''Obviously,'' he added, ''from our point of view the key question is what types of services and investment should be included, while from the American side the labor factor is the most sensitive matter.'' Mr. Salinas said that ''certainly oil'' would also have to be excluded from the talks.
In theory, a free-trade agreement between the United States and Mexico, combined with a similar accord between the United States and Canada that is already in place, could pave the way for formation of a North American common market. Mr. Salinas, however, made it clear today that he favored a more limited linkage among the three countries.
''We merely want free trade, not a common market'' he said. ''That would mean a common parliament, a common currency and even a common army.''

The Land Amin Seized Now Preoccupies Uganda

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KAMPALA, Uganda

 BODY:
For sale or repossession: $1 billion worth of commercial buildings, tea and coffee plantations, residences.
Location: war-battered African country, now rebuilding; World Bank favorite. Contact: scandal-ridden Government agency.
On the face of it, the impoverished Ugandan Government, broke because of a sharp drop in coffee prices and the cost of trying to repair its economy, should be able to make a fortune from nearly 7,000 properties seized from Asian owners 18 years ago by Idi Amin. Indeed, the best buildings in the capital, Kampala, stand dilapidated and encrusted in dirt from war and neglect, awaiting either their old owners or new ones. 
But despite urging from the World Bank and the United States, both enthusiastic backers of President Yoweri Museveni, the Government's action to divest itself of the confiscated properties is proving extremely slow.
The properties include virtually all of downtown Kampala, as well as potentially high-grade farms and tea plantations. All told, according to a Washington concern, the Privatization Center, which valued the properties on the basis of potential revenue, the real estate is worth $1 billion. Pride or Prosperity? At stake in the Government's move to turn the property back to private hands, say Western donors and many senior Ugandan officials, is the recovery of this East African country. Without the rehabilitation of this property, these officials say, the engine of the economy will never get started.
Yet for many Ugandans, there is something much deeper at stake: the reappearance of the dominant Asian trading class that ran the economy before the 1972 expulsion.
About 80,000 Asians were expelled by General Amin because of what he called ''economic imperialism.'' Most of them were Indians, and they dominated the trading and economic life of Uganda, causing enormous resentment among the Africans not only because of their wealth but also because they were thought to have taken on the air of superiority.
Since the expulsions, all the property owned by the Asians have been put in the hands of the Departed Asian Property Custodian Board, a Government body with no money to keep up buildings since fallen into disrepair, without water or working sewage systems.
Many have been rented at low rates to political favorites. The Ugandan press has almost daily revelations about corruption at the board. Amid increasing scandal, the head of the board was recently forced out.
 
Attracting Capitalists
Ugandans in decision-making positions say they know that they have two choices. The first is to encourage the Asians to return and bring with them the capital and entrepreneurial skills the country lacks. About 100 Asian families are thought to want to return because they can see the money-making potential.
The second choice for the Ugandans is to continue the current situation of making it extremely difficult, through red tape and bribes, for the Asians to come back. This would mean much slower economic growth but would insure that African Ugandans hold the upper hand, albeit in a tumbledown economy.
Many Ugandans are said to look nervously toward neighboring Kenya, where they know about 70 percent of the economy is dominated by Asian families.
Mr. Museveni's position on the confiscated properties is not clear.
''At first, Museveni was taking the position the all the properties should be distributed among all sectors of society and not to foreigners,'' said a Western official urging speedy divestiture. ''Where he is today, I don't know.''
Asian Ugandans who have come back from Britain, Canada or Australia also detect ambivalence from Mr. Museveni. Mumtaz Kassam, now a British-trained lawyer, was a 16-year-old schoolgirl when her Ugandan passport was torn up by Amin immigration officials in 1972. She has been working for the last few years to reclaim 45 properties that belonged to her parents and uncles.
 
Effect on 'His People'
''I think Museveni is very sincere and has good intentions,'' said Miss Kassam, who met the President at a session of the Uganda Women Lawyers Association. ''But he also has reservations about the Asians, because a lot of his people will be hurt.''
For example, said Miss Kassam, who now practices law in London, the Third Deputy Prime Minister, Abubakar Mayanja, had been given the right to work a dairy farm that belonged to one of her uncles at the time of the expulsion.
About 30,000 of the Asians living in Uganda chose to take Ugandan passports instead of British passports at the time of independence from Britain in 1962, only to be expelled 10 years later. As one of those who chose to be Ugandan, Miss Kassam feels that she and her parents and uncles - also Ugandan passport holders at the time - should be able to regain their properties.
After nine years of trying to complete the task, first started by her uncle, Miss Kassam recently won back the family sock factory. She drove to the industrial area to look over the plant. It had been idle since 1972, but the machines, decrepit and partly broken, remained. An engineer was on his way from India.
''Uganda is currently importing all its socks,'' she said. ''We want to start making them here - starting with the army.'' She would like to remain in Uganda herself.

HEADLINE: Thailand Defense Minister Quits Just Before Premier Flies to U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, June 11

 BODY:
Hours before the Thai Prime Minister left for a long-planned visit to Washington, his Government was thrown into crisis today by the resignation of his Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
The aide, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, retired only 10 weeks ago as army Chief of Staff and acting supreme commander, and his decision then to join Chatichai Choonhavan's faltering coalition Government was regarded as a boon for Mr. Chatichai, the first elected Prime Minister in 12 years.
Mr. Chavalit's resignation today, however, prompted concern about a military coup, as the army staged rallies in his support in various parts of the country. The Thai stock market fell 42 points, losing 4 percent of its value. 
Mr. Chavalit, as supreme commander, had sharply accused Thai politicians of being corrupt and called Thai political parties ''trading companies.'' But it is widely assumed that he wants to be the next prime minister, and he needed a leg up in politics. Mr. Chatichai, in what appeared to be a clever move, put Mr. Chavalit in charge of the Counter-Corruption Commission.
 
Chavalit and Wife Accused
But a junior minister in the Government, stung by charges of corruption, made thinly veiled charges that Mr. Chavalit and his wife, Khunying Phankrua, were themselves corrupt, comparing her to ''a moving jewelry box.''
A flamboyant figure, she then called the junior minister, Chalerm Yoobamrung, ''a moron,'' and wondered whether his wife had no love for jewelry. Mr. Chavalit's former colleagues in the military, which retains crucial influence in Thai political and economic life, leaped to his defense with emotional warnings to politicians to hold their tongues and stop insulting the army and its sons.
The Supreme Commander, Gen. Sunthorn Kongsompong, said: ''Human patience is limited. We've been trying to be patient to help maintain the country's peace and order. But if the infringement becomes more serious, then some lessons have to be taught.''
Mr. Chavalit did not show up at a Cabinet meeting this morning, but instead delivered a resignation letter to Mr. Chatichai, in which he said, ''Present conditions do not allow me to carry on serving my country in the spirit I had intended.''
The timing of the letter, just before Mr. Chatichai's weeklong trip to the United States, seemed intended to put pressure on the Prime Minister to dismiss Mr. Chalerm, perhaps even to drop his small party from the coalition.
 
Meeting With the King
Given that Mr. Chavalit represents no political party, his departure does not threaten the governing coalition, unless it results in a coup attempt. Apparently in an effort to forestall that possibility, Mr. Chatichai went this afternoon to the nearby resort of Hua Hin, where King Bhumibol Adulyadej has a summer palace. The King has calmed down the military before.
Mr. Chavalit's successor as army Chief of Staff, Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon, returned to Bangkok from a trip to Singapore and Brunei and met with Mr. Chavalit and Mr. Chatichai.
According to a deputy Government spokesman, Likhit Hongladarom, ''Suchinda reassured Chatichai he could travel in peace,'' and said Mr. Chavalit is ''a very good soldier'' who would not do anything ''drastic.''

HEADLINE: Election Victor in Peru Plans Drug Appeal to U.S.

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, June 11

 BODY:
Marking a change in Peru's anti-drug policy, President-elect Alberto Fujimori said today that he planned to visit the United States this month to argue for development aid to wean Peruvian coca leaf growers from the illicit crop.
Peru is the world's largest supplier of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine. The United States, the world's largest consumer of cocaine, has long supported crop eradication programs here. 
''The fight against drug trafficking should not be seen only in its repressive dimension,'' Mr. Fujimori said in an interview. The 51-year-old agricultural engineer advocated foreign aid for crop substitution.
On Sunday, Mr. Fujimori, a political unknown three months ago, defeated Mario Vargas Llosa, the writer, by as much as 20 percentage points, exit interviews with voters indicate. Although no official returns have been made public, Mr. Vargas Llosa has conceded.
Today, Mr. Fujimori, who is to be inaugurated on July 28, his birthday, outlined a centrist blueprint for governing Peru through the first half of the 1990's.
The President-elect, the son of Japanese immigrants, said he had no illusions about the task facing him.
''It's a difficult post, probably the most difficult post in Latin America because the situation we face is almost catastrophic,'' he said. ''In addition to the problems of terrorism, illiteracy, poverty and hunger, you add the natural disasters,'' he said, citing a drought that he said affected 40 percent of agricultural production and an earthquake in the Amazon region of Peru last month that killed 137 people.
Mr. Fujimori will head a nation of 22 million people with only $150 million of reserves in the central bank. Half the country is under military rule because of the Shining Path insurgency, and a yawning gap between Government spending and receipts is causing prices to jump by 1 percent a day.
Coca cultivation, however, contributes an estimated $1 billion a year to the Peruvian economy.
To promote crop substitution, Mr. Fujimori said he would offer growers free market prices for farm products, better roads to take produce to the cities, and schools and health clinics to raise living standards. He proposed that cocaine-consuming countries contribute to a development fund.
After visiting the United States and Canada later this month, he plans to visit Europe.
''Rebuilding roads is nothing for the United States compared to the $120 billion paid for the illegal drug,'' Mr. Fujimori said, estimating the cost of cocaine to American society. American officials here say they have not discovered a crop that can be grown in Peru's remote interior that can compete in price with coca leaves. Almost all the anti-drug efforts here focused on coca bush eradication.
''A repression program is also necessary,'' Mr. Fujimori said today. ''Obviously if you adopt repressive actions, you discourage cultivation.''
He was noncommittal about another unresolved aspect of Peruvian-American relations - a $35 million American military arms and training package intended to help Peru's Government wrest control of the coca-growing areas from the Shining Path. The President-elect said he did not know the details of the plan, but added, ''I don't accept participation in military operations of foreign military forces.''

Poll Finds Americans Give Soviets Priority Over the Chinese on Trade

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY

 BODY:
The American public approves of the way President Bush is handling foreign policy by nearly 3 to 1, but the public disagrees with the Bush Administration's priorities on trade with China and the Soviet Union, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
Sixty-two percent of the 1,084 adults interviewed last Tuesday through Friday approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling foreign policy, a rise of five percentage points since a Times/CBS News Poll taken in May, just before the President's summit meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
 
Soviets Over Chinese
But when asked, ''When it comes to international trade, should the United States give more favorable trade privileges to the Soviet Union, or to China?'' the public split 49 percent for the Soviet Union and 16 percent for China.
This is in disagreement with the priorities of the Bush Administration, which set no conditions on continuing favorable trade status to China but has tied more favorable trade status for the Soviet Union to a liberalization of Soviet emigration policy. 
The latest poll reflected the impact of the summit meeting, which ended two days before interviewing for the poll began.
Mr. Gorbachev reached his highest standing with the American public since the Times/CBS News Poll began measuring this factor in 1987. For the first time a majority of 51 percent said they had a favorable opinion of the Soviet leader, up six percentage points since the pre-summit poll in May. Nine percent held an unfavorable opinion. How Essential Is Gorbachev? At the same time, there was a drop in the proportion of the public seeing Mr. Gorbachev himself as essential to American interests. Fifty-five percent said it was ''very important to the interests of the United States that Mikhail Gorbachev, and not someone else, remains in power in the Soviet Union,'' a drop of five percentage points since the pre-summit poll in May.
The nationwide telephone poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Other findings related to the summit included these:
* 81 percent said the summit meeting had contributed to world peace, including 24 percent saying it contributed ''a lot.''
* 57 percent said the United States and the Soviet Union had gained similar advantage from the summit talks, while 8 percent said the United States had gained more and 23 percent said the Soviet Union had gained more.
* 41 percent said the cold war was over, an increase of seven percentage points from April, but a majority of 52 percent disagreed.
* 26 percent said the summit meeting had been intended mainly to reach agreement on important matters, while 54 percent said the it had been ''intended mainly to help the political interests of President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev.''
President Bush's rating on his handling of the American economy stood at 43 percent approval, a drop of four percentage points since April and six pecentage points since January.
Mr. Bush's overall approval rating for his handling of his job as President remained unchanged at 69 percent approval, the same level as in May.
 
How the Poll Was Taken
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted last Tuesday through Friday with 1,084 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to insure that each region was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, telephone numbers were formed by random digits, permitting access to unlisted as well as listed numbers. The numbers were screened to limit calls to residences.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephone lines and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

BULGARIAN VOTING STUNS OPPOSITION

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria, June 11

 BODY:
Stunned by the Bulgarian Socialist Party's decisive victory in Sunday's parliamentary elections, leaders of the main opposition group told a rally today that they would keep up their fight against the former Communists, refusing all offers to form a coalition government.
''We will enter the National Assembly as an opposition that will confront the Communist Party with its crimes, and insist that it take responsibility for everything it has done under its rule,'' vowed Zhelyu Zhelev, head of the Union of Democratic Forces, before a crowd of about 50,000 people who gathered to protest the election results.
Official results on the elections to the 400-seat Grand National Assembly were not complete today. But preliminary results show the Socialists ahead with about 48 percent and the Union of Democratic Forces with 34 percent. 
Many Bulgarians are still absorbing the news that after 45 years of Communist rule, almost one in two voters gave the Communists' successor, the Socialist Party, a mandate to lead the country again.
Although Bulgarian Communists have shed their old name and eased their grip on economic and political life, their victory still set a precedent -it was the first time that a ruling Marxist party has competed in multiparty national elections and won since the collapse of Communist rule began in Eastern Europe last year.
 
Socialist Leader Urges Calm
In a television appearance tonight, Andrei Lukanov, the Socialist Prime Minister and an architect of the party's changes, appealed for calm. He called the election ''the first step toward the creation of a democratic society.''
At a news conference, representatives from several international observer teams declared that the elections had been free and fair, although a separate, unofficial group of monitors, led by Americans, maintained that ''fear is still a factor.''
The opposition accused the Socialist Party of resorting to fraud and intimidation to win the elections, but its leadership stopped short of calls to invalidate the vote. A second round of voting will be held on June 17 in districts where no candidate won more than 50 percent.
Tens of thousands of disappointed opposition supporters paraded peacefully for several hours through the capital tonight, without any interference from the police, who in some cases moved to the sidewalk to let the chanting, flag-waving protesters pass by.
A breakdown by Bulgaria's 28 electoral districts, based on a tally drawn from 1,300 selected precincts, showed the Socialists winning in all but three districts.
 
Ethnic Turks Give a Pledge
Sofia, the capital, was captured by the Union of Democratic Forces, while the Turkish Rights Movement won in Razgrad and Kirdzhali, two regions where ethnic Turks make up a majority. The Turks' leader, Ahmed Dogan, pledged cooperation with the Union of Democratic Forces in the second round.
Projections for the 200 Assembly seats apportioned by proportional representation show the Socialists with 100 seats, compared the the Union's 67 and the Turkish Rights Movement's 17. The Bulgarian Agrarian Party has so far captured only 16.
Results from the 200 single-member districts were still not available.
The Assembly, which will sit for 18 months, has the responsibility of rewriting the Bulgarian Constitution. But the new Government first must tackle the worsening economic situation, in particular a $10.3 billion debt and a severe cutback in factory orders from the Soviet Union.
To deal with these problems, the Socialist Party has said it will seek a broad-based coalition. But the rejection by the Union of Democratic Forces, a group made up of 16 parties and movements, means the Socialists' narrow majority will be put under considerable pressure.
The victory by the former Communists in Bulgaria, the last country in Eastern Europe to hold free elections, was in part a reflection of people's reluctance to embrace change, some people here said.
 
Living Standards Improved
Members of the Socialist Party said the vote was also an indication of the people's loyalty to a Government that since World War II has increased the standard of living and kept the peace, although with an iron hand.
But many people who were out demonstrating in the streets of Sofia said the vote showed the continued hold that local Communist authorities still have on the population, particularly in the countryside.
''People think the Communists are omniscient,'' said Filip Dmitrov, deputy chairman of the Bulgarian Green Party. ''That is how they are intimidated.''
At back-to-back news conferences, two groups of observers differed over the fairness of the Bulgarian elections.
Although repeatedly given second-hand accounts of intimidation, Geoffrey Tordoff, a member of the House of Lords and head of the British team, said he could find no corroboration of a single instance of political pressure.
But a team of 60 observers from 23 countries led by the National Democratic and Republican Institutes in Washington, D.C., reported finding evidence of the legacy of dictatorship -''psychological and sociological'' pressures ''not visible to the naked eye.''
''One could smell it,'' said Tibor Vidos, director of the Alliance of Free Democrats, a major Hungarian party, who came here as an observer. ''People coming from Eastern Europe have a nose, and we can identify how people behave.''
The official United States delegation did not issue a statement in Sofia. A spokesman said it will be delivered first to the White House.
Reports of intimidation by local Communist authorities, who continue to have considerable control over jobs, housing and other necessities, had surfaced before the elections in interviews to opposition figures, journalists and human rights monitors.
Today, speaking to the protesters, Mr. Zhelev said such behavior should have been expected. ''It would have been strange and naive to expect any other way of proceeding on the part of a party that came to power by fraud and violence and kept power for 45 years by fraud and violence,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Apathy and Disaffection on the Rise Among California Voters

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 11

 BODY:
California voters may have made national waves by nominating Dianne Feinstein to run for governor and passing a ballot proposition to raise taxes, but Ethan J. Henderson had nothing to do with it.
To Mr. Henderson, a 22-year-old college student from the San Francisco suburb of Richmond, voting is a waste. ''I look at my parents voting,'' he said. ''The candidates they vote for make promises and promises and promises and nothing ever changes.'' 
California may often set the national pace in politics, but it has also become a national leader in political disengagement. Living far from the seat of power in Washington, Californians seem more than ever to be turning away from government as a means of solving problems.
In the week since the California primary, political analysts have been poring over the election turnout statistics, which were even lower than forecast. Nearly three-quarters of eligible adults did not vote last Tuesday, a new low, despite a hotly contested Democratic primary for governor and several controversial ballot measures.
 
'Totally Useless'
In interviews conducted in Northern and Southern California since the election, nonvoters offered a variety of reasons, from sheer apathy to anger over the government's perceived ineffectiveness. ''I find voting totally useless,'' said William H. Sanhueza, a 38-year-old physical education teacher from the Los Angeles suburb of Highland Park who has not voted since 1980. ''The big wheels are going to manipulate the system anyway.''
Whatever the reasons, the result is a widening gulf between voters and non-voters. White, educated and affluent Californians have long tended to vote at higher rates than others, but this distinction is dividing the state into two political tiers. Even as the state's population grows more diverse and the percentage of minorities rises, political power is becoming more concentrated in the hands of older whites.
Although black, Hispanic and Asian people make up more than 40 percent of the population and more than 30 percent of adult citizens, they typically now make up only 15 percent of voters, said Mervin D. Field, director of the independent California Poll. Likewise, while whites over age 60 represent 21 percent of the adult population, they are nearly 30 percent of voters.
 
'Trend of Disengagement'
Voting participation has been declining in California since a high of 67 percent of adult citizens turned out in 1938 for the general election, even though barriers to registration and absentee voting have been lowered in recent years. The June gubernatorial primary drew 44.8 percent of adult citizens in 1966, 28.5 percent in 1986 and only 26.6 percent last Tuesday, according to still unofficial figures from the secretary of state. ''Unquestionably, there has been a gradual trend of disengagement, disconnectedness, withdrawal on the part of the public,'' Mr. Field said.
Some voices of the disengaged in shopping malls last weekend:
Maria G. Reyes, 18, a student and clothing salesclerk from Pinole: ''I don't know anything about politics. I was going to vote, but then I thought about it and thought I didn't know anything about it. If you don't understand it and you vote, then you're going to mess things up. I don't watch news. I don't read. It's full of problems; it's one more headache.''
Edward J. Laroche, 20, a software salesman in Glendale: ''It's hard to vote for something you don't believe in. They give you certain choices, but what if you don't like any of the choices? I hate to say it, but I felt like my vote didn't really matter. I didn't know much about the candidates or the propositions. But to tell you the truth, I probably wouldn't have voted anyway.''
Danny Marmolejo, 28, a hair stylist from Sherman Oaks: ''I didn't see this as an important election. It's just the primary. I always vote in Presidential elections, and I will vote for governor because those are important elections.''
 
Losing Confidence
Some older people said they used to vote regularly but have lost confidence in the political system. ''I just got fed up,'' said Lee G. Silva, 68, a retired man from San Pablo. ''We passed Proposition 103, and then they're fooling around with it,'' he added, referring to the measure passed in 1988 to roll back car insurance rates, which has stalled in litigation and political wrangling.
And there were immigrants who feel remote from the American political process even though they are citizens, like Yong Wilt, a 35-year-old woman who emigrated from Korea 10 years ago. ''I have an English problem,'' Mrs. Wilt said. ''Whatever they say, I don't understand anyway. Sometimes my husband explains to me.'' She said she turns to religion for political help. ''I pray for things to change,'' she said.
Others resented the seeming uniformity of views among the main candidates. Ms. Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco, and her main opponent, Attorney General John K. Van de Kamp, as well as the Republican nominee, Senator Pete Wilson, all favored a woman's right to choose on abortion. ''I would have thought about voting if one had been pro-life,'' said Joyce Davis, a 45-year-old post office counter clerk from Altadena.
And to Wayman G. Henry, a 36-year-old custodian in Richmond, who said he was a cocaine addict for several years, the government has failed to deal with drugs. ''I made it out by the grace of God,'' he said. ''No politicians did anything. It seems like such a big game. They promise you the world and then don't do anything. I just listen now.'' Sign of Contentment? Some politicians and political scientists find nothing alarming about the non-voting trend, asserting that it is a sign of contentment. George Deukmejian, the Republican Governor who chose not to run again, told the Sacramento Bee just before the primary that people are not motivated to vote unless they are suffering economically.
''If the younger voter and the person who's not as interested as other aren't going to the polls, I don't know what else can be done to encourage them to participate,'' he was quoted as saying.
Others disagree. Mr. Field, in a recent speech at the University of California, Los Angeles, said: ''The more that non-voters become different than voters in color, in class, in attitudes toward life, we create and build threatening pressures which could easily explode and alter for the worse the future course of our precious democracy.''

HEADLINE: Let the Wealthy Pay Their Fair Share of Taxes;
Not Just Capital Gains

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''New Taxes Without Fear'' (editorial, May 27) attempts to propagate the myth that inflation affects the taxation of capital gains more than it affects shorter-term income. This is not true and can be seen in the following examples:
The usual argument for indexing capital gains goes like this. If inflation is 5 percent a year and an investment of $10,000 yields a return of 5 percent a year, then there will be no real gain from this investment. After 20 years the investment will be worth $26,532.98. If it is sold at this point, an investor in the 28 percent tax bracket will pay $4,629.23 in taxes and will be left with $21,903.75. This represents a real loss of 17.4 percent. 
The example that is never given shows that inflation hurts income that is taxable yearly even more! If an investment is placed in an interest-bearing account that yields 5 percent a year, and if inflation is also 5 percent, then there will be no real gain from this investment. However, taxes will be collected every year.
The first year's income of $500 will be reduced by the $140 that must be paid in taxes. After one year the investment will be worth $10,360. After 20 years the investment will be worth $20,285.94. This is less than the $21,903.75 that the long-term investor would have and represents a real loss of 23.5 percent due to taxes alone.
Because the investor in the second example must pay her taxes as she goes along, she loses more to inflation than the investor in the first example. If we index income to inflation, we must keep in mind that in addition to capital gains, income that is taxed yearly must be protected. It would be unfair to have indexing only for capital gains, an investment vehicle much more readily available to the richer than the poorer.

HEADLINE: 'I'm Convinced That Gorbachev Wants A Free-Market Democracy'

BYLINE: By Ronald Reagan; Ronald Reagan, the former President of the United States, plans to visit Berlin, Poland and the Soviet Union in the fall.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Three years ago today I stood in front of the Berlin Wall and urged Mikhail Gorbachev to tear it down. This was not a spur-of-the-moment idea. Rather, it reflected my belief that both my relationship with Mr. Gorbachev and the effects of his policy of glasnost at home had reached a point where I could publicly call for this act of East-West reconciliation.
Although the wall did not come down then, most of the elements for its demise were in place by 1987. Its destruction, beginning last December, has now become a symbol for the tide of democracy that has covered what had been the Soviet bloc. 
Glasnost had let the free speech genie out of the bottle in the Soviet Union; Mr. Gorbachev's call for perestroika, or reform, held the promise of better times for his citizens. Democracy's stirrings were getting stronger in Poland and beginning to be felt in other parts of the Soviet bloc. West Germany's decision in 1983 to deploy cruise missiles and our decision to begin work on the Strategic Defense Initiative had signaled to the Soviet military that the West had not only the resources but also the political will to make any Kremlin effort at military superiority a fruitless one.
Today, the political map of Europe has changed utterly. The two Germanys will soon be unified, first with a common currency, then with an increasingly unified economy and, not far in the future, political unification through an all-Germany election. Little more than half a year has passed since the people of East Germany took to the streets of Berlin, Leipzig and other cities to demand their freedom. At first, the Communist leaders sought to mollify them with minor concessions. But the people wanted real freedom and they went back to the streets again and again until they got it.
Already, the market system is beginning to bring its positive lessons to East Germany. West German companies are providing needed capital and technology to joint ventures in the East. Volunteerism, or efforts by private citizens, is an important factor also in the coming together of the two Germanys.
Democracy and the market system are moving ahead full-speed in Poland where the Government, backed by a popular mandate, is shifting the economy ''cold turkey'' to free enterprise. The Polish people have gone into this with their eyes open, knowing they will have to make initial sacrifices to reap greater rewards down the road.
Hungary and Czechoslovakia are close behind. While Romania's democracy seems more fragile than the rest, there is no question that its people cherish freedom.
Mr. Gorbachev was probably the immediate catalyst for the bursting forth of democracy throughout the former Soviet empire. A realist, he knew that the old ways did not work and that the old-generation of hard-line leaders in the satellite countries needed to be replaced. In allowing this to happen (indeed, encouraging it), he expected to replace the Honneckers and Ceaucescus with Gorbachevites. But, just as glasnost could not be confined to free speech about minor bureaucratic inefficiencies, so the dropping of support for satellite dictators unleashed a process that Mr. Gorbachev could not control.
There is an air of unpredictability about the future of Central and Eastern Europe that makes everyone somewhat uneasy.
This is especially true as we look at recent events in the Soviet Union.
The other day over coffee in San Francisco, I saw Mikhail Gorbachev. He was every bit as warm, earnest and optimistic about his country's future potential as I remembered him from our previous meetings.
Yet, back home he faces an array of problems that would daunt a less vigorous man: a surge of nationalism (and in the case of the Baltic republics, which were incorporated into the Soviet Union against their will, a determination to be independent); a drumbeat of criticism over the lack of consumer goods; complaints about the lack of hard currency with which to make needed purchases of machinery and equipment; and, not least, a challenge to his leadership from Boris Yeltsin.
I am convinced that Mr. Gorbachev is sincerely determined to convert the Soviet Union to a free market democracy. In a country so large and complex, the transition from centralized control will inevitably involve some delays, errors and false starts. We are limited in the things we can do to help this process.
Basically, it must come from Mr. Gorbachev's leadership and the will of his people. We certainly can and should provide encouragement to the Soviet people as they go through it. But we can do more than cheer them on.
Let us assume the cold war is over, although that, in itself, does not mean we can afford to dismantle our defenses. Even though we see ourselves as the victors, we must not humiliate the other side. The Soviets still have raw memories of the millions of lives lost at Nazi hands in World War II. But one thing we and our Western allies must convince them of is that a newly united Germany's membership in NATO is Moscow's best bet for a Europe that is both stable and secure.
There are many products and much know-how the Soviet Union would like from us. We should use the American impulse for generosity with some caution.
The concept of ''linkage'' can play a role here. For example, we might provide the Soviet Union with some things they want from us in exchange for their agreement to stop propping up their few remaining dictator clients. In due course, forces for democracy will do the rest in those countries.
Like the chips of the Berlin Wall that are being sold everywhere these days, democracy seems to be sweeping the world. When we look closely, however, we see that its work is far from done.

HEADLINE: New York Port Loses Top Spot To Los Angeles

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
New York has been eclipsed by Los Angeles as the nation's pre-eminent port, the result of surging trade with the Far East and changing shipping trends in this country.
The growth of maritime trade along the West Coast, which has been building since the 1970's, has been so strong that last year four of the nation's top five ports in dollar volume were on the Pacific.
New York still ranked second in the value of cargo it handled. But in the 1980's it has grown far more slowly than a half dozen other ports on both coasts. Some experts are worried that more and more of the nation's cargo will bypass New York's docks and terminals, costing the region an opportunity for economic growth. 
 
Port Not Keeping Pace
Still, despite a common belief that business in New York's port has been dropping, the port handled $49 billion in goods in 1989, $1.5 billion more than in 1988. But that was $6 billion less than Los Angeles and only $7 billion more than Long Beach, Calif.
In 1988 New York handled more than $2 billion worth of cargo more than Los Angeles. And in 1981 New York handled $11 billion more than Los Angeles and Long Beach combined.
''Our tonnage has remained relatively stable,'' said Anthony J. Tozzoli, president of the New York Shipping Association, the trade group that negotiates and administers labor contracts with dockworkers. ''However, you've had a global growth in cargo, and we have not shared in that growth.''
Economists and shipping executives say the New York port, which stretches from Brooklyn to Staten Island to Elizabeth and Newark, missed out on much of the Asian trade because of commercial, as well as geographic, reasons.
Many businesses around the nation have tightened inventories, and this has made faster delivery of goods - called ''just in time'' service - critical in determining how cargo is shipped. It is now common for cars, computers, television sets and other consumer goods to be shipped from Asia to West Coast ports, then loaded onto trains, sometimes in double stacks of aluminum containers, and sent to cities across the country, even in the East.
Many companies find this method of shipping, sometimes known as ''landbridge,'' cheaper, quicker and more dependable, and much cargo that would have moved in ships through the Panana Canal to eastern ports is now being sent across the country on trains instead.
As it competes for more of the world's cargo, New York is hindered by higher handling fees and, especially on the New York City side of the port, by traffic that delays trucks heading to and from the waterfront.
''The hassle factor in the New York metropolitan area is more intensive than in other ports in less populated areas,'' said Peter R. Moe, vice president of marketing and logistics for Sea-Land Service Inc., a large container-ship line.
 
Rise of Air Shipping
In a telling indication of the changes in the shipping industry and the regional economy, the value of international cargo moving in and out of the region by air exceeded that shipped through the waterfront by $7.5 billion in 1988 and $11 billion in 1989.
New York is still a vast market for goods, and imports have long dominated shipping activity here. Imports of general cargo, the more valuable goods, rose from 6.98 millon long tons in 1980 to 9.29 million long tons in 1989. (A long ton equals 2,240 pounds.) But as manufacturing declined -New York City alone lost 150,000 factory jobs in the last decade - exports have been hurt. They dropped from 4.25 million long tons in 1980 to 3.96 million in 1989.
In what some regard as an unfortunate commentary, the port's leading export is waste paper; 1.19 million long tons were shipped from New York in 1989, four times more than plastic materials, the runner-up. The paper goes out in containers that, because of the trade imbalance, might otherwise be empty.
 
'Sleepy Ports' Awaken
Such statistics, along with the markedly higher growth rates of other ports - not only Los Angeles and Long Beach, but also such smaller East Coast rivals as Boston, Baltimore and Norfolk - suggest that New York is shifting from a port that once served much of the nation's needs to one increasingly focused on its own.
''In earlier decades, if you wanted to ship foreign, New York was the name that came to mind, particularly on the East Coast,'' said Rexford B. Sherman, director of research at the American Association of Port Authorities in Alexandria, Va. ''Now, if you're in the South, it goes through Charleston or Savanah. The sleepy little southern ports aren't so sleepy anymore.''
Although the number of New York dockworkers has shrunk to 4,200 from more than 30,000 in the 1950's, a result of the rise of container ships, the port's impact ripples through the region. Maritime trade generates $14 billion in economic activity annually, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and it affects such major regional industries as wholesale trade, transportation and banking.
''The whole distribution system of the Northeast is hinged around the Port of New York,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University, who has studied the region's economy and its waterfront. ''We cannot afford to be a declining port.''
 
Containers Bring Change
New York was in the shipping forefront in the 1960's, when the use of containers ushered in what might have been the biggest change in the industry since sails gave way to steam engines. Hemp slings are gone now. Huge cranes hoist the 40-foot aluminum boxes off the ships.
New terminals were built on Staten Island and in New Jersey, and the finger piers that ring Manhattan were variously reincarnated as bus depots, Sanitation Department garages, parking lots and places for sunbathing. One of the relatively few Manattan piers still used for a maritime purpose, besides those that handle cruise ships, is home to a prison barge.
In exchange for allowing the port to automate, the International Longshoremen's Association won a guarantee of an annual income - now $34,200 - for its members, no matter how many days they work. The shipping industry says this provision, along with the rising cost of medical and other benefits, has pushed up the assessments charged on cargo in New York.
The labor agreement negotiated last year included an early-retirement program that further reduced the size of the work force, although the shipping association says there are still about 400 more dockworkers than are needed. Still, the organization cut assessments by $1, to $4.85 a ton, plus $65 for each container. If cargo originates from or is destined for points 260 miles or more inland, the assessment drops to $1.85 a ton, with no container charge. The Port Authority also has an incentive program.
 
Cheaper Labor in West
It is difficult to compare costs with those in other ports, because they are often calculated differently. But the consensus is that New York is a more expensive place to do business, sometimes significantly so.
Robert D. Dockendorff, director of research for the Pacific Maritime Association, said the cost of dockworker benefits on the West Coast was ''much, much, much cheaper,'' because the increase in cargo there had offset the labor-saving impact of automation.
Although the growth of shipping has been striking along the West Coast, especially at Los Angeles and Long Beach, Mr. Dockendorff played down the economic impact regionally, saying that much of the cargo was simply unloaded there from ships and then loaded onto trains for other parts of the country.
The surge of shipping has also had its price. ''Damage to bridges, highways - that's a problem,'' Mr. Dockendorff said of the increased truck traffic. ''On the other hand, more of the ports on the West Coast are starting to locate rail facilities right on the docks.''
 
Hopes for Expansion
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey plans to spend several hundred million dollars during the 1990's modernizing and upgrading its terminals, too.
The agency has its eye, of course, on increasing trade with the European Community. It also hopes to attract more ships westward from Southeast Asia through the Suez Canal, and perhaps increase business with Latin America.
''We will try to be better prepared, if we should be so fortunate to experience'' an increase in trade, said Kate J. Ascher, an assistant director of the authority's Port Department.
Professor Moss credits Stephen Berger, who last week said he would be leaving as the Port Authority's executive director after five years, with bringing in new managers, but adds, ''He's competing against global economic forces.''
''We did not recognize how much cargo could come in from the West Coast by rail,'' Professor Moss continued. ''We lost our national distribution pre-eminence. Unless we do something to get the cargo that comes in from Europe, it will bypass New York.''

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate in Connecticut, At 5.6%, Tops U.S. Average

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 11

 BODY:
Connecticut's unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in April, from 5 percent in March, exceeding the national average for the first time since May 1977.
A year ago Connecticut had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, at 3.3 percent. The national seasonally adjusted jobless rate was 5.4 percent in April. 
Economists said the new figure confirmed a sharp slowdown in the state's once-booming economy. But several said the greater significance was in the pattern of joblessness rather than the number of jobless workers.
The number of people employed in construction, one of the most depressed areas, rose by 6.8 percent, to 69,500 jobs from 65,100 in March. That increase was countered by declines in manufacturing, which employed 800 fewer workers, and by growth that was slower than expected across a spectrum of businesses.
 
'This Is Not Texas'
''The ultimate good news is that Connecticut's economy is not so dependent on any one sector - this is not Texas,'' said Richard H. Mattoon, an economist for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. ''The bad news is that it's a broad-based decline.''
Figures from the State Labor Department show that the total number of people employed in non-agricultural jobs rose slightly, to 1.671 million from 1.668 million in March and 1.669 million in April 1989.
The number of people listed as actively seeking work also declined, to 91,600 in April from 93,000 in March.
The higher jobless rate, the experts said, arose because the traditional spring increase in the number of jobs did not materialize with anywhere near the usual vigor.
 
Possibility of Revision
''One month does not a recession make,'' a professor of economics at Fairfield University, Edward J. Deak, said. ''But this is certainly different from what the state was experiencing in 1987 and 1988.''
Deputy Labor Commissioner Lawrence S. Fox said preliminary figures for last month showed a decline in the number of people receiving unemployment benefits. He speculated that the jump in April might have been a ''fluky'' result that could be revised as additional information arrives.
New York had a 4.9 percent unemployment rate in April and 5.1 percent last month. The New Jersey rate in April was 4.9 percent, falling to 4.8 in May.

HEADLINE: Daily News Announces More Cutbacks in Jobs

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT

 BODY:
With labor tensions rising, The Daily News announced yesterday that it was laying off almost a quarter of its 57 electricians.
It was the third wave of job cuts at the financially ailing paper in three weeks, and a management spokesman, John Sloan, said layoffs of other unionized workers were under study.
''We are looking at our production and distribution departments, where we have been mandatorily overstaffed for years,'' Mr. Sloan said. 
The laid-off electricians, all members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, do maintenance work in company buildings in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Kearny, N.J., with an average pay of $21.25 an hour, he said.
Mr. Sloan attributed the layoffs of 14 electricians to the need for savings amid ''New York's continuing poor economic conditions.''
 
'An Enviable Heritage'
''This newspaper is a world-class franchise with an enviable heritage, and its management has the responsibility to return it to the best possible financial condition,'' Mr. Sloan said.
But union officials characterized the cuts, which are permitted under the terms of contracts that expired March 30, as part of a continuing management campaign to provoke a strike by one or more of the tabloid's 10 unions.
Beginning late last month, the paper eliminated 21 of its 75 photoengravers, who help make printing plates, and 17 of its 49 machinists, who keep the presses in working order.
The News, vowing to eliminate what it has characterized as financially ruinous overstaffing, featherbedding and labor abuses, has been engaged in increasingly fractious contract talks with its unions since late January.
On Friday, Don Singleton, a negotiator for the Newspaper Guild, representing 750 advertising and newsroom employees at The News, walked out of a session after denouncing management for ''foot dragging.''
 
Contrast in Strategies
Labor leaders have accused The News and its parent company, the Tribune Company of Chicago, of seeking to provoke a strike in an effort to break the unions as part of a plan either to close the paper or to make it more attractive to a buyer.
In recent months, leaders of the paper's 2,414 unionized workers have sought to convince the rank and file that the best strategy is to avoid a strike in the hope of winning eventual legal judgments against the paper for unfair labor practices.
Mr. Sloan, saying eliminating the 14 electricians' jobs would save The News $570,000 a year in wages, said those laid off would receive up to six weeks of severance pay and three-month extensions of their medical insurance.
Union officials have charged that the savings are minimal when compared to what they assert is the $4 million a month that the paper is spending on strike preparations.
The company, which has said it will continue publishing in the event of a strike, has declined to say how much it is spending. But it has accepted job applications from more than 13,000 people willing to work as replacement workers, hired a Nashville law firm to conduct negotiations, trained hundreds of management employees to operate presses, and established an alternative newsroom in North Bergen, N.J.

HEADLINE: Boeing Gets Big Order For 747's

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
The Boeing Company, which has seen soaring demand from the world's airlines for its planes, announced today that Korean Air Lines had agreed to buy 23 of the aircraft maker's long-range 747-400 wide-body jets in a deal worth nearly $5 billion.
The order is the third for Boeing in recent weeks from Asian carriers. It recently announced sales to China's Civil Aviation Administration and to Japan Air Lines totaling more than $5 billion.
Boeing said the Korean airline had placed 12 firm orders for the planes and reconfirmed options for 11 more aircraft. It said a reconfirmation, though it could be canceled, was considered a firmer commitment than an option. 
 
Shares Jump in Heavy Trading
The planes are expected to cost $200 million each. The airline had previously ordered nine 747-400's.
Boeing's shares jumped $3 today, to $58.50, on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most active issue, with more than 1.8 million shares traded. The Seattle-based company announced a 3-for-2 stock split over the weekend.
Industry analysts said orders from Asian airlines for Boeing planes were likely to grow as the 747 continued to dominate long-haul routes out of Asia.
The four-engine, 393-seat Boeing plane has a range of more than 8,000 miles, enabling it to link Seoul with London or New York nonstop.
Spurred by rapid economic growth throughout the region, Pacific Rim air traffic is outpacing world growth, and Boeing's 747-400 will be the long-distance plane of choice throughout this decade, analysts said.
''The Boeing 747-400 is the biggest, fastest airliner flying, and it has the longest range,'' said Thomas Lloyd-Butler, a Montgomery Securities analyst.
He said its capacity and range made it ideal for handling nonstop intercontinental flights needed by the booming Pacific Rim economy. ''That market's going to keep expanding,'' he said.
''It's a very hot market right now, with a 15 to 20 percent annual growth rate,'' said Paul Nisbet, a Prudential-Bache analyst. ''It should average 9 to 10 percent throughout the rest of the decade.''
 
Airbus Not Considered
Other analysts said they expected new aircraft orders from other Asian carriers, including All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific and Korea's Asiana.
Korean Air Lines' senior executive vice president, Y. H. Cho, said the purchase would bring to 48 the number of 747's the carrier had committed itself to buy since its first purchase in 1970.
''The advanced technology built into this new airliner makes it ideal for the Pacific routes over which we operate,'' Mr. Cho said, adding that there was no question of buying Airbus Industrie planes because the European consortium does not make any similar long-range planes.
Boeing's chairman, Frank Shrontz, said the first delivery of the planes would be in 1994, reflecting Boeing's production backlog. But he said the company was slowly increasing its production capacity on all models.
Boeing said at its annual stockholders meeting on April 30 that its commercial airline backlog was worth $77.5 billion.
 
No Decision on Engine
Mr. Shrontz, noting that 1989 was a record year for the plane maker, said this year would not be as good. But he added, ''I didn't think we could keep up that rate.''
Korean Air Lines officials said that no decision had been made on which engines would power the planes but that talks were being held with United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney unit, the General Electric Company and Rolls-Royce Aeroengines. Pratt & Whitney engines power other Korean Air Lines Boeing 747's.
The new deal was announced at the end of a two-week visit to the United States by a delegation of South Korean businessmen to buy American goods as a way to help reduce Korea's trade surplus with America. Last year, Korea had a $6.3 billion trade surplus with the United States.

HEADLINE: Dow Rallies in 30.19 Rise On Light Day

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Led by Boeing and I.B.M., stock prices rebounded sharply yesterday in light trading, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 30.19 points - recovering much of the ground it gave up last week.
Traders said the faltering rally revived as bargain hunters sought blue chips, which had fallen off last week in four straight days of selling. Technology, oil and retailing issues were also stronger.
The Dow, which lost 38.59 points last week, finished the day at 2,892.57. Advancing issues totaled 918 as 563 declined. 
 
Broader Index Gains
The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks also rose, by 2.92, to 361.63.
Only 119.6 million shares changed hands yesterday, the lightest volume since April 19, and down from 142.6 million on Friday.
Program buying driven by computers buoyed yesterday's recovery. Birinyi Associates, a Wall Street research firm, recorded five buying programs, during which the market rose by 19.3 points, and a selling program that accounted for a 3.71-point drop.
The Seattle-based Boeing, which split, 3 for 2, effective with yesterday's trading, led the most-active list, rising by 3, to 58 1/2, on a volume of 2.3 million shares. Investors reacted favorably to news of a large order of its 747-400 jumbo jets from Korean Air Lines. The carrier plans to buy 23 747-400's worth nearly $5 billion. Two other Asian carriers have ordered the jets, and the trend of orders from the Pacific Rim is expected to continue, the analysts said.
I.B.M., which has been a sporadic market leader, finished up by 1 1/8, at 119 7/8. It was the fifth-most-active issue on the Big Board, with more than a million shares changing hands.
Many other technology issues were strong. Compaq rose by 1 1/8, to 120 1/4, and Texas Instruments gained 1, to 40 3/8. In over-the-counter trading, Microsoft rose by 1 3/8, to 74 7/8; Sun Microsystems by 1, to 31 5/8, and Intel also by 1, to 47 1/2.
 
Occidental Up to $27
Among oil issues, ARCO was strong, rising by 2, to 116 7/8. Occidental Petroleum, the Big Board's second-most-active stock, rose by 3/8, to 27, on a volume of 1.5 million shares. Chevron added 1 1/8, to 70 5/8, while Exxon picked up 7/8, to 47 7/8.
Other strong blue chips were Procter & Gamble, which rose by 1, to 81, General Motors, which was up by 5/8, to 49 1/8, and Merck, which gained 3/4, to 80 3/4.
''Obviously, this market doesn't want to go down,'' said Monte Gordon, the research director for the Dreyfus Corporation. ''With a cascade of economic news coming out at the end of the week, you would think the market would be stately, concerned and relatively careful.''
Among the reports scheduled to be released this week are the Producer Price Index on Thursday and the Consumer Price Index and data on industrial production, both on Friday.
Many money managers still have cash they can commit to the market, Mr. Gordon said, and that has cushioned the decline. ''This really has been a shallow, short-lived, well-constrained correction,'' he said.
But any surprises in the economic statistics, he added, could rock the market's recent optimism.
Retail stocks, which fell because of weak sales last month, showed some strength. The Gap, hit hard lately, recovered 1 7/8 to close at 58. Some of the analysts said that despite the company's May performance, it had a bright outlook.
A stock that did not benefit from the rally in technology issues was Microcom, a maker of data-communications equipment based in Norwood, Mass., which fell by 8 1/2 on the Nasdaq, to 9 3/4. The stock was the second-most-active issue there, with more than 1.7 million shares changing hands, and its 46.6 percent drop made it the Nasdaq's largest in percentage terms.
Microcom said on Friday that it expected a loss for its first fiscal quarter ending on June 30. The analysts also slashed the company's earnings estimates for the fiscal year.
In other gauges, the American Stock Exchange's market-value index gained 1.15, to 362.32, while the Nasdaq composite index rose by 1.92, to 462.79.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Soviet TV To Get U.S. Money Show

BYLINE: By JEREMY GERARD

 BODY:
During an installment of the television show ''Adam Smith's Money World'' last November, Donald M. Kendall, the president of Pepsico, speculated that perestroika and glasnost would translate into great opportunities for American business. He advised the business community to take advantage of those opportunities before Japan and Western Europe also got into the act.
One person well aware of the tremendous changes taking place and already acting on them was the show's host, whose real name is George J. W. Goodman. When ''Adam Smith's Money World'' begins its seventh season on public television in the fall, the weekly program focusing on connections between business and the larger world will also be shown in prime time on Soviet television. 
''Money World,'' which will be dubbed in Russian, will be the first American business program broadcast on Soviet television, where American shows of any sort are a rarity.
Mr. Goodman and his Soviet colleagues conceded yesterday that much of the information presented on ''Adam Smith's Money World'' would be beyond the comprehension of the typical Soviet viewer, who is generally unschooled in the ways of Western finance. But you have to start somewhere, they said. The show typically deals with one topic, like the savings and loan crisis or inflation, and looks at the larger impact of those situations.
''We anticipate that the vast majority of the population may have a very difficult time with much of the vocabulary and concepts,'' said Marek L. Bezzubov, the president of Soventure Group Inc., the American half of a joint venture that acquired the broadcast rights from the American producers for Co Star, a Soviet joint venture company that produces and distributes films.
''It is literally a must for them to start getting acquainted with the business world, and eagerness usually translates into trying to understand,'' he said.
The half-hour show will be presented on the Soviet Central Television Network sometime between 7 P.M. and 9 P.M., Mr. Bezzubov said. Its competition in that time slot may include news programs, cartoons, sports events and blocks of commercials. In type of programing, it will compete with ''600 Seconds,'' a late-night news magazine that sounds suspiciously like one-sixth of a popular American counterpart.
Soviet Central TV operates two television channels in Moscow. Two others, presenting similar programing, are Leningrad Program and Moscow Program. There is also a fifth, an instructional channel.
 
Talks Began Last Year
Mr. Goodman said talks with Co Star began last year when he was planning an hourlong special on perestroika and glasnost for the Public Broadcasting System. Because of preliminary work on the special, he said, ''Money World'' was familiar to executives at Soviet Central TV.
Under the agreement, Co Star will get the broadcast rights to 52 weekly installments of ''Adam Smith's Money World,'' which is produced by Alvin H. Perlmutter Inc. and WNET, the public television station in New York. Co Star will also sell 90 seconds of advertising to American companies doing business in the Soviet Union, like the General Motors corporation and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.
In return, the American producers will get technical support for the PBS special on perestroika and glasnost, as well as for segments of the weekly program. No money is being exchanged in the deal between Co Star and ''Money World,'' Mr. Bezzubov said.
 
'A Fabulous Turn of Events'
''It's just a fabulous turn of events.'' Mr. Goodman said yesterday in an interview at his midtown office, ''Adam Smith has come to theland of Karl Marx. I think there's enormous confusion because the signals aren't clear there as they go to a market economy.''
''Money World'' is underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance and Unisys, he said, but he hopes that ''some alert, forward-thinking foundation would put up the money so that we can do a prologue for each show about why we're doing it, a primer to let Russian audiences watch and then tell us what they think of it.''
Mr. Goodman said that the program's title presented some problems in the translation. ''We changed the word 'money' to 'finance,' '' he said, ''because they said 'money' had a dark financial tone.'' But given the changes taking place in the Soviet economy, Mr. Goodman added, that is likely to change as well.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 14, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Tuesday about the coming introduction of ''Adam Smith's Money World'' on Soviet television misidentified the organization for which the program is preparing an hourlong special on perestroika and glasnost. It is the Public Broadcasting Service.

HEADLINE: Lower Cigarette Sales Linked to Tax Rise

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
A new study suggests that raising taxes on cigarettes helps to reduce smoking, lending momentum to a movement in Congress to raise Federal levies on tobacco as a way to curb use and to ease the Federal deficit.
Researchers for the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private research group, studied cigarette taxes and their effect on sales between 1955 and 1985. They concluded that although smokers behaved as though they were addicted, their smoking could be reduced with higher prices.
Michael Grossman, an economics professor at the City University of New York and one of three authors of the paper, said ''there were studies that even heroin addiction was not unresponsive to price.'' He cited a 1977 paper in The Journal of Urban Economics that found that a 50 percent rise in heroin prices resulted in a 13 percent decline in consumption. 
In the case of cigarettes, whose addictive qualities have been strongly debated by scientists, Mr. Grossman and his colleagues, Gary S. Becker and Kevin M. Murphy, both economists at the University of Chicago, said they found a similar phenomenon when they studied the imposition of excise taxes in all 50 states. They adjusted the data for such factors as income and demographic trends.
The researchers said that after a permanent 10 percent rise in cigarette prices, adjusted for inflation, consumption was reduced 4 percent in the first year and 7.5 percent spread over five years. Temporary price rises for only one year were found to reduce consumption less, they said.
They also tested for the impact of ''stressful events'' like divorce and unemployment, on tobacco use and for whether a person's religion had any effect.
Rising unemployment did not seem to increase smoking, they found, but smokers' level of tobacco use did seem to rise with divorce. As for religion, states with many Mormons, who have a prohibition against smoking, showed less tobacco use; states with many Roman Catholics showed more, but the researchers did not explain the connection. $18 Billion Gain Seen In 1989, retail sales of cigarettes totaled more than $39 billion, according to the Tobacco Institute, a trade group. Of that total, $4.3 billion represented Federal excise taxes, $5.1 billion state taxes, and $200 million municipal taxes.
Texas has the highest state excise tax, at 41 cents a pack; North Carolina, a big tobacco-industry state, has the lowest at 2 cents a pack, according to the institute.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and other Congressmen have advocated doubling Federal excise taxes to 32 cents a pack. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that would add $18 billion to Federal revenue over the next five years.
Currently, the average retail price of cigarettes in the United States exceeds $1.60 a pack.
Walker Merryman, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, disputed the National Bureau of Research paper's characterization of smoking as addictive. He cited Federal statistics that more than 40 million people have quit smoking, 95 percent of whom have done so without help. ''These figures and common sense contradict any claim that cigarette smoking is addictive,'' he said.
John R. Nelson, a spokesman for Philip Morris USA, the domestic unit of the world's largest tobacco company, said that doubling the excise tax was regressive. ''Sure, higher taxes will reduce some consumption,'' he said, ''but it's more likely to just mean that more poor people will pay more taxes.''
The National Bureau of Research study does not cover the period after 1985 when the tobacco industry, partly in response to high excise taxes, introduced discount cigarettes on a wide scale. Many customers of such brands are the poor and working class.
 
Growth in Discount Brands
These so-called price value cigarettes had a 14.8 percent market share in 1989, up from 11.1 percent the year earlier, according to John C. Maxwell, Jr., a tobacco analyst with Wheat First Securities in Richmond.

HEADLINE: Talking Business; with Breeden of the S.E.C.;
Risks of Market Fragmentation

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Richard C. Breeden, the 40-year-old head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has a knack for making waves. In his short tenure, the Bush Administration appointee has taken a hard line toward people suspected of violating securities laws, has made overtures toward helping Eastern Europe develop stock exchanges and has made it clear he wants to eliminate creaky regulations that may inhibit United States companies in global competition.
One of his most controversial moves has been an effort to regulate some of the financial futures now under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. And he is strongly backing a measure introduced by Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, that would empower the S.E.C. to suspend some program trading and close the exchanges in an emergency. Mr. Breeden was in New York recently and discussed several issues. 
Q. Where do things stand legislatively on regulations for Wall Street?
A. The most important is the Administration's new legislation, which has three objectives. The measure would put the S.E.C. in charge of overseeing margins on stock index futures, would eliminate the ''exclusivity clause'' that has inhibited Wall Street's ability to develop new hybrid products, and would transfer the jurisdiction for regulating stock index futures from the commodity commission to the S.E.C. This is a significant step in dealing with instability in the current system.
Q. Is passage assured?
A. There's a vigorous campaign under way by the futures industry to block it. But the odds are very high that this step will be taken. The United States is the only nation that maintains this market fragmentation - and the risk and costs it entails. I don't think we're willing to see leadership in both the futures and securities markets move overseas.
Q. The Chicago markets see the bill as an effort by the traditional New York markets to assert their dominion. How do you respond?
A. That's absolutely groundless. The Secretary of the Treasury, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the chairman of the S.E.C. are urging reform. We've all watched severe risk in the stock and futures markets not once, but twice, in 1987 and 1989. Last Oct. 13, 50 million Americans lost $160 billion of value in their pension and retirement accounts in 90 minutes. The element that introduced the greatest amount of risk was that we went into that day, just as we did in 1987, with 97.8 percent leverage in the stock index futures market. And then, in the midst of the crisis, those exchanges were trying to dramatically raise margins, which sucked out liquidity and created further selling pressure.
Q. Had you been the S.E.C. chairman in October 1987, what would you have done?
A. We wouldn't have entered that day with margins of 2.2 percent on stock index futures. If you had a minimum margin of 15 percent, you then would have the flexibility to cut margins to 10 percent when the market was under stress to inject liquidity. Under the Markey bill, the futures exchanges would have the authority to recommend margins. But if they proposed going from 14 percent to 2.2 percent, we would have the authority to say ''that's too low.'' We'd expect to see margins set in line with those in the options market.
Q. Isn't computer index arbitrage almost always destablizing to markets?
A. I would not make a blanket statement. Index arbitrage is a symptom of an underlying problem and that problem is the vast differences in leverage rules that apply to the same products. If you have $100,000 you can buy $200,000 worth of S.&P. 500 stocks or $4.4 million worth of them through the index futures market, and the index futures market will react more forcefully to economic stimuli.
Q. What sort of sentence should Michael Milken get?
A. A substantial period of incarceration would be appropriate.
Q. Should we have a clearer definition of insider trading.
A. The basic prohibition against insider trading as elaborated by the Supreme Court and other courts is reasonably clear and probably more clear than if we had a long, tortuous statutory definition.
Q. Will the savings and loan crisis lead to securities fraud prosecutions?
A. It may. It is a matter of public record that several institutions that were customers of Mr. Milken have failed and involved losses to the taxpayers of several billion dollars.

HEADLINE: U.S. Exporters Wary Of Technology Accord

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Despite a lengthy briefing yesterday at the Commerce Department, representatives of American exporters of manufactured goods remain reluctant to assess the potential effect of last Thursday's agreement between the United States and other large industrial nations to relax cold war trade restrictions.
They want to see the final regulations for the agreement, which are due to be published on July 1. ''The devil is in the details when it comes to export administration,'' said Howard Lewis 3d, who oversees international affairs for the National Association of Manufacturers, the Washington-based industry group.
 
Soviets to Get Access
The agreement, reached at a meeting in Paris of the 17 nations that belong to the technology-transfer watchdog organization known as Cocom, will eliminate the need to seek export licenses for 30 types of equipment of limited strategic value, like electric furnaces and vacuum pumps. It will also grant the Soviet Union and Eastern European nations access to much more sophisticated computers, telecommunications equipment and machine tools. 
Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia were singled out for preferential treatment, which they will receive as soon as they pass rules preventing re-export of sensitive equipment, or information about it, to the Soviet Union and other former allies.
The final critical provision of the accord calls for a complete re-examination by the end of the year of all export controls to construct a new, and presumably more limited, list of items that will be subject to review by the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Exports Controls.
 
New Opportunities Seen
In theory, the changes should open new trade opportunities for a wide range of manufacturers. The reforms should be especially advantageous for those in businesses where the United States has technological leadership, including computers, telecommunications, medical equipment and pollution control, said Dennis E. Kloske, the Commerce Department's Under Secretary for Export Administration.
But business representatives who attended the briefing said yesterday that they were concerned about details that had not yet been settled. For instance, the pact says that export restrictions will be dropped on computers that calculate at speeds slower that 275 megabits a second and that Cocom members will be able to use their discretion in allowing exports of computers that operate at speeds up to 550 megabits.
The Commerce Department said in the briefing that the rules would mean decontrol of almost all personal computers, such as the PS/2 by the International Business Machines Corporation, Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh and the Compaq Computer Corporation's Deskpro 386.
Minicomputers that would be decontrolled include the Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP 11 machines and several I.B.M models. More powerful Digital and I.B.M. machines, as well as the Control Data Corporation's Cyber 180-850 model, would fall into the discretionary approval category.
Special consideration could be sought for large mainframes that might be used to process seismic data or in scientific research.
But processing speed is only one of about 20 specifications covered by Cocom restrictions. The rules limit the speeds at which disk drives operate or that computers can network with other machines, for example.
''Until we see all the parameters, we can't be certain,'' said Charles Hough, the director of trade administration in Washington for Honeywell Inc., a Minneapolis-based computer maker. ''It looks very promising for our process controls, but we don't expect a lot of relaxation in aviation controls.''
Business representatives said the July 1 target for putting the new rules into effect seemed optimistic, given that they would have to be drafted by the Commerce Department and then reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. Some said they feared that European and Japanese competitors would gain an advantage if the United States' version of the new rules was delayed.

Top Executive Retires At Citizens Utilities

 BODY:
In a long-planned move, Ishier Jacobson, president and chief executive of the Citizens Utilities Company, yesterday announced his retirement after more than 35 years with the company. Daryl A. Ferguson, senior vice president for operations and engineering, will replace him as president and chief operating officer, but the chief executive position remains vacant.
Citizens, a diversified public utility based in Stamford, Conn., has more than 475,000 customers in over 500 communities in 12 states, mostly in the West. Three weeks ago, it began Services Inc., a natural gas transmission and distribution company with revenues exceeding $150 million. 
James W. Swenson, chairman of Louisiana General, said he was ''thrilled'' with the planned merger and said the acquisition would be Mr. Jacobson's ''crowning jewel.'' Mr. Swenson added, ''This was his legacy.''
The company is highly regarded by market analysts, but some anticipate a change in attitude with the departure of Mr. Jacobson. ''The company is very successful but has a policy of not telling you anything,'' said Edward J. Tirello Jr. of Shearson Lehman Hutton, who has been following the concern for 15 years.
The company not only covers a broad geographic sweep from Hawaii to Vermont, but also handles a great variety of utilities, including water, electric and gas services as well as telecommunications.
Mr. Jacobson, who will be 68 later this month and whose retirement takes effect June 30, helped cultivate Citizens' diversification strategy, and the company has had 45 consecutive years of record earnings. Mr. Jacobson has been with the company since 1954, and has been president since 1970.
The next president, Mr. Ferguson, 51, was recruited by Mr. Jacobson for his extensive telecommunications experience. He holds a doctorate in business from George Washington University and a bachelor of science degree in economics and business from Augustana College.
Both Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Jacobson were in Arizona on company business yesterday and could not be reached for comment.
The company's board has left both the chief executive and chairman posts open. Richard L. Rosenthal retired as chairman in June 1989.

 BODY:
United States orders for computer chips reached a high last month as the semiconductor industry's leading indicator resumed its climb. 
 
The Semiconductor Industry
Association, based in San Jose, Calif., today reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.14 for the three-month period that ended in May, up from 1.09 in April and down slightly from a revised figure of 1.15 in March.
The ratio compares orders with shipments and is considered a leading indicator of the industry's performance. A ratio of 1.14 indicates that for every $100 in product shipped, $114 was ordered, indicating that demand is rising.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Security Prices Are Stable

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were essentially unchanged yesterday after moderate losses earlier in the day were erased toward the close. The declines after the opening in New York followed earlier weakness in the Tokyo and London markets for Treasury debt issues.
But with most of credit market participants expecting interest rates to decline, the Treasury debt market benefited from the near absence of short sellers. The bond market optimists expect to be rewarded by the flow of economic reports due out later this week. 
Dealers said that even those who expect the latest data to, at best, produce mixed signals did not care to challenge the bulls by selling Treasury paper short.
Meanwhile, the average discount rates at the Treasury regular weekly auction of bills increased modestly. The average rate on 90-day bills rose to 7.73 percent from 7.69 percent; the average rate on the six-month bills increased to 7.64 percent from 7.62 percent.
''The selling we witnessed at the opening resulted from a somewhat odd set of factors that developed overnight in Tokyo not any shift in market sentiment, as was seen by the recovery later in the day,'' said Philip Braverman, chief economist at the DKB Securities Corporation, an arm of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Tokyo.''
Mr. Braverman, who is bullish on the bond market, said the selling began in Japan after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party there lost an election. The lost seat was not important to the ruling party. But it was a surprise, not to mention an embarrassment to the pollsters, and this caused fair-size losses in the Tokyo stock and bond markets.
''Japanese portfolio managers try to avoid hurting their own markets even when they want to unload holdings,'' Mr. Braverman continued. ''It so happened that many Japanese investment managers had built up large profits in dollars and dollar-denominated assets. So rather than sell into their own declining market, the portfolio managers moved to offset losses in their stock and bond markets by selling dollars and dollar assets such as our Treasury paper.''
The resultant weakness in dollar assets carried over to the London market and when the New York market opened, some Japanese houses were still winding up their sales of Treasury paper and dollars.
After the selling ended, prices recovered and late in the session the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in 2020, was off 3/32, at 103 10/32, as the yield edged up to 8.44 percent, from 8.43 percent late Friday. The long notes, the 8 7/8's of the year 2000, dipped 1/32, to 102 23/32, with the yield unchanged at 8.46.
Among other representative Treasury issues traded in the secondary market, the 8.5's of 1992 were unchanged at 100 10/32, as was the yield at 8.32 perent; the 8.5's of 1995 lost 1/ 32, at 100 9/32, but the yield was unchanged at 8.41 percent.
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, intervened again in the money market to add reserves to the banking system with another set of three-day systemwide repurchase agreements. Fed watchers said the operation was aimed at providing the banking system with sufficient liquidity through the end of the two-week bank maintainence, or accounting, period, which ends tomorrow.
In any case, the key Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans, traded all day at 8.25 percent, which the credit market holds has been the Fed's target since last December. Any move by the Fed to lower (or raise) interest rates would immediately be reflected in the funds rate.
What has been less evident, but nevertheless important, factor in the domestic Treasury debt market is the turmoil in the Canadian credit markets. The crisis there over the possible secession of the province of Quebec has indirectly bolstered the market in United States Treasury paper.
Francis A. Scotland, managing editor of the Montreal-based International Bank Credit Analyst, said that ''there has been some flow of capital southward recently because of the uncertainty over the Quebec issue.'' He added, ''This uncertainty has, if anything, grown worse, as the June 23 deadline for resolving the issue nears.''
There was some euphoria in the domestic ''junk bond'' market after the Trump Organization obtained new financing from its bankers. Trump's high-yielding bonds posted moderate gains.
Following are the results of the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Lower in Light Day As Reports Are Awaited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was lower yesterday against most primary currencies except the Japanese yen. Trading was slow.
''It's been very quiet today, all day long,'' said Lorenzo Troni, the vice president for foreign exchange at Paine Webber International Ltd. in New York. ''I think everyone is waiting for some economic data.'' 
Later this week, the Government is to release reports on retail sales, producer prices and consumer prices. The market is anticipating lower inflation and lower retail sales that could prompt the Federal Reserve to push down interest rates, leading to a weaker dollar, Mr. Troni said.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar climbed in New York trading to 154.77 yen, from 153.49 late Friday. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar rose by 1.45 yen to close at 154.10 yen. In London, it was quoted at 154.45 yen.
One trader, Linda McLaughlin of Chemical Bank, attributed the dollar's strength against the yen to money from individual investors in Japan who have just received semiannual bonuses. The workers are apparently looking to invest in United States markets, she said.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6858, up from $1.6843 late Friday. The pound traded at $1.6860 late yesterday in New York, more expensive than $1.6840 late Friday.
The dollar also fell against the West German currency, closing at 1.6927 marks, down from 1.6975 marks late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Friday, included: 1.4430 Swiss francs, down from 1.4495; 5.6965 French francs, down from 5.7145; 1.1710 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1743, and 1,243.25 Italian lire, down from 1,248.00. Gold prices finished mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery rose by 70 cents, to $356.40 an ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $355.10 an ounce, up by 10 cents from late Friday.
In London, the metal was quoted at a bid of $354.45 an ounce yesterday, down from $354.50 an ounce late Friday. In Zurich, the bid price was $355, up from $354 late Friday.
In Hong Kong, gold fell by $1.28 to close at a bid of $355.75 an ounce.
Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.01 an ounce, down from Friday's $5.02. On the Comex, silver for current delivery rose 0.5 cent an ounce to close at $5.012 an ounce.

Bright Future Seen for Product Managers

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
A REFUGEE from the New York retailing scene, Mary Jane Schmuhl happily works in Andover, Mass., for a leading national retailer, and she lives in Boston, which means reverse commuting from the city to the small town. She also travels the world.
Her business card reads: ''Mast Industries Inc., Product manager -Limited Sweaters.''
Mast Industries is the ''sourcing'' and production arm that sells about $1 billion worth of apparel yearly to its parent, the Limited Inc., the largest apparel chain in the nation, with 78 stores operating under its name. On the side, the Limited also owns affiliates like Henri Bendel, the higher-priced New York apparel store; Lane Bryant, a chain that caters to large women, and Abercrombie & Fitch, a sports clothing and gift specialty store. 
Last week, Miss Schmuhl, who is 26 years old, described her job, emphasizing the word ''sourcing.''
''Sourcing within Mast Industries entails working with producers within various countries overseas and searching out production areas for a specific product,'' she said. ''My category is sweaters.''
She enjoys the diversity of the job. ''It is like running my own business,'' she commented. ''I also do yarn research, which means I often travel to Europe. I love to travel.''
Later this year she plans to make a business trip to Florence, Italy, for a trade show and to Milan, where her company has an office. ''My mother is coming along,'' she said, explaining that she has accumulated a large amount of frequent flier benefits.
''I have one customer,'' she stressed. That customer is the Limited, and more specifically its 25-year-old sweater buyer, Lisa Kamalsky, at the Limited's Columbus, Ohio, headquarters, to which Miss Schmuhl travels often.
''I consult with the buyer on what types of sweaters and what colors she wants for the various stores,'' she said. Then Miss Schmuhl works out the production details, which means that she sometimes travels to textile manufacturing centers such as South Korea, Thailand and Hong Kong.
The job involves plenty of competition, too, because outside vendors try to sell their sweater versions to the Limited's buyer. Much depends on Miss Schmuhl's ability to give the best prices, best delivery and the best fashion, including quality. It becomes a business decision on the part of the buyer as to how many thousands of sweaters to order and where to buy them, Miss Schmuhl explained.
Central buying is not new by any means for large retailers but the Limited officials believe they have carried it ahead further than most others. ''The situation changes daily,'' Mark G. Oswald, Mast's vice president of human resources, said last week. ''But last year Mast sold about $1 billion worth of apparel to our parent, the Limited, or about 40 percent of what the Limited bought.'' Outside competition ''keeps us on our toes,'' he added.
Miss Schmuhl thinks that her interest in design, along with a college major in marketing, has helped her career. ''My hunger or passion for design makes my use of it work for the business,'' she said. ''A lot of my design ideas were not welcome at first, but I think the trend of the market will require more designing. I think it is aiding the buyer.''
A 1986 graduate of Bowling Green University in Ohio, she obviously has moved ahead quickly in retailing, since her first job ($15,500 yearly) with Liz Claiborne Inc., where she specialized in sweaters. She stayed there for about six months until she found a somewhat higher-paying job with Ralph Lauren Women's Wear Inc. as a product manager for sweaters, specifically product manager for ''active label sweaters,'' meaning tennis and ski sweaters.
''I was not content at the time with the opportunities and my position was menial, and I wanted a change in my personal life,'' she said. Through networking she learned about possible openings at Mast and was interviewed. A year ago she landed the job with Mast in a salary range ''of $40,000 and over,'' according to Mr. Oswald.
In the hierarchy of Mast there are also about a dozen senior product managers, who earn $60,000 and over, and ''about 40 product managers like me,'' Miss Schmuhl said. Their specialities might be accessories or various types of apparel.
There are also about 30 assistant product managers in training, usually young people right out of college who earn in the ''late $20,000's,'' according to Mr. Oswald.
Looking ahead, Mr. Oswald pointed out that the outlook for doing business in Europe was good, and he pointed to the labor shortage in Hong Kong. ''There is only 1 percent unemployment there,'' he said.
By the late 1990's, when the Chinese are scheduled to finally take over in Hong Kong, he thinks European manufacturers will be in a strong position to compete with Far Eastern ones. Hong Kong might dwindle as a manufacturing center because of the labor problem, he suggested, but that meant there would be more of a focus on Europe, possibly Eastern Europe, for product managers like Miss Schmuhl.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
The Careers column in Business Day yesterday about product managers misstated the number of stores operated by the Limited Stores division of the Limited Inc., the nation's largest apparel chain. It is 780, not 78.

GORBACHEV YIELDS ON ALLIANCE ROLES IN A NEW GERMANY

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 12

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today removed one of the main conditions that his country had imposed on German unification. He agreed for the first time that West German troops could remain in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization without a corresponding role for the East Germans in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
His offer, made during a report to the Soviet Parliament on his talks with President Bush in Washington, falls short of Western demands that a united Germany be allowed to remain in NATO without conditions.
Mr. Gorbachev proposed that East Germany retain a vaguely defined ''associate membership'' in the Warsaw Pact, and that a united Germany ''honor all obligations'' inherited from the two Germanys. 
 
Formula for Germany in NATO
But Mr. Gorbachev's remarks clearly showed that he was striving to find a formula that would allow a united Germany to join NATO, and to prepare his Parliament and public opinion for such an eventuality. [In Washington, Bush Administration officials assessing Mr. Gorbachev's statement said they were growing increasingly convinced that the Soviet leader was slowly reconciling himself to the idea that a united Germany would be in NATO, provided that Moscow's economic, political and security concerns are met. Page A18.] Before Mr. Gorbachev spoke today, Soviet officials had previously suggested various approaches intended to prevent German unification from tipping the military balance in NATO's favor. They had proposed a neutral Germany, joint membership for Germany in both alliances, and the dismantling of the alliances, all ideas rejected by the West.
 
Dual but Not Equal Roles
Today the Soviet leader renewed his call for a broad, general security structure to supplant the two alliances, but he conceded that the rival blocs would continue to exist ''for longer than might be imagined.''
He again called for ''dual membership'' for Germany in the competing alliances, but this time it was clear that he was not insisting on an equal membership. The West German Army, or Bundeswehr, would belong to NATO, he said, while the East Germany Army would answer only to the unified German government, not to either alliance.
''United Germany could declare that for this transition period, it would honor all obligations it inherits from the Federal Republic of Germany and from the German Democratic Republic,'' Mr. Gorbachev said. ''For this period, the Bundeswehr would, as before, be subordinate to NATO, and the East German troops would be subordinate to the Government of the new Germany.''
 
Troops to Remain in Germany
That proposal would evidently leave a united Germany free to use East Germany's Army any way it saw fit - including, as some West Germans have proposed, abolishing it.
The Soviet leader said he had proposed to President Bush that during that period, Soviet troops would remain stationed in East Germany, a condition the West has already accepted, and Moscow would agree to the continued presence of American troops in Europe.
''I told the President that I think that the American presence in Europe, since it fulfills a certain role in maintaining stability, is an element of the strategic situation, and does represent a problem for us,'' Mr. Gorbachev told his Parliament.
Mr. Gorbachev's carefully worded statement on the intricacies of the German question was so murky in places that many diplomats spent the day puzzling over it before recognizing the new elements.
 
Narrowing of Differences
Western diplomats here said Mr. Gorbachev's comments reflected a rapid narrowing of the conceptual differences between East and West on the future of Germany, although the negotiations on concrete proposals remain excruciatingly complicated.
''He is no longer insisting that united Germany can under no circumstances be a member of NATO, something he had said two months ago was absolutely excluded,'' said one European diplomat.
But the two sides remain mired in the complexities of such questions as the numbers of troops, the command structure, compensation of the Soviets for possible loss of East German trade, and the creation of new political organizations that would give the Soviets some say in European affairs.
''Given the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to expect him to show more of his cards now,'' the diplomat said. ''He is still waiting to see some concrete proposals from us at the NATO summit,'' a meeting of the Western leaders scheduled for July, the diplomat said.
 
Threat of Hard-Line Assertions
Mr. Gorbachev's main concern is that German reunification not add to the threat - or the fear among his countrymen - of a decisive shift in the military balance, with NATO strengthened by the gain of a united Germany, while the Eastern alliance disintegrates.
If Mr. Gorbachev is not careful, his supporters say, hard-liners in the Government and military might use the loss of Germany to undermine the Soviet leader by asserting that his foreign policy is selling out Soviet security.
In the Communist Party Daily Rabochaya Tribuna today, Oleg Baklanov, the Communist Party official responsible for the military industry, warned that the Soviet Union was rushing into a position of disadvantage in Europe.
''In short, we are leaving and NATO is staying behind and, as far as I can judge, growing stronger every day,'' Mr. Baklanov said, in an interview reflecting the hard-line pressures on Mr. Gorbachev. ''I think we should stop and look around for a moment to understand the disposition of forces in Europe, and it is not tending toward parity.''
In a gesture apparently toward the hard-liners, Mr. Gorbachev today tersely rejected a written suggestion from one member of Parliament that Communist Party political cells in the military be abolished to make the army more independent of party control. ''No, I don't think so,'' he said. Mr. Gorbachev today also dismissed speculation that Moscow would welcome a united Germany that would be, like France, linked politically to NATO but not formally integrated into its military structure.
During the summit meeting in Washington, President Bush renewed the American insistence that Germany should remain in NATO, but offered a package of nine measures with a goal of alleviating Soviet security fears.
They included a promise not to extend NATO troops to East German territory, maintenance of 300,000 to 400,000 Soviet troops in East Germany at West German expense, revamping the NATO force structure to make it less threatening to Moscow, future discussions on limiting the German Army, and ways to institutionalize the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which would give the Soviets a voice in general European security affairs.
Mr. Gorbachev today welcomed those proposals as a show of good faith and said that if NATO continued to remake itself into a more purely political alliance, the unification of Germany may be accomplished without bitterness.

HEADLINE: The Home's Link To School Success;
A New Road to Learning: Teaching the Whole Child

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
For more than 20 years in this city of scholars and elms, schoolchildren and their parents have been studying a basic axiom: students in troubled schools learn better when families and educators work together.
In the process, these children of troubled schools and their parents, most of them poor and black, are discovering that schools need not be rigid institutions concerned only with academic performance, but can also be places that tend to a child's psychological and social growth. And when those two sides of a child's life are entwined, the child feels better about himself and learns more.
This is the essence of a program developed by Dr. James P. Comer, a Yale University psychiatrist, and carried out in New Haven. The results have been higher attendance, fewer behavior problems and improved academic performance. School systems around the country are eager to replicate it, and the Rockefeller Foundation has committed $15 million to that end. 
The process turns on a seemingly simple insight: that a child's home life affects his performance in school, and that if schools pay attention to all the influences on a child, most problems can be solved before they get out of control. The Comer process, as it is called, encourages a flexible, almost custom-tailored approach to each child.
Take the case of Ramon Cato. Ramon, a chubby, bright-eyed boy with a chipped front tooth, has known extreme family stress. For much of the last two years, Ramon has lived with his mother, described by relatives as a drug abuser, and her boyfriend, in one room in a condemned house known as a haven for drug users. He struggled in school and behaved badly, when he was there. He missed 57 of 180 days in the term that ended a year ago.
Educators at Grant Elementary School did not throw up their hands and write him off. When they could not get his mother involved, they found a great-uncle who cared. Now the uncle is a regular visitor to Ramon's classroom, and the boy is living with a foster family, doing well in school. He will graduate from fourth grade with his classmates Friday.
Not every child has problems as severe as Ramon's. But whatever the pressures on a family may be, a school using the Comer (pronounced COMB-er) process will be alert to discovering those problems and helping solve them, supporters say.
This common-sense melding of home life, school life and social service aid is what attracted the Rockefeller Foundation's attention and led it earlier this year to make a five-year, $15 million commitment to replicate the methods of Dr. Comer, the coolly charismatic father of the approach.
The Comer process has already been adopted by more than 100 schools in nine districts in eight states. In the last three years, the New Haven school system has expanded it to include all 42 schools in the 18,000-pupil system.
''There's a difference one can see almost right away once his principles are applied,'' said Priscilla Hilliard of Howard University in Washington, D.C., who heads a partnership between the college and that city's public schools to carry out the program.
For low-income students in troubled inner cities, and especially for black and Hispanic students, whose achievement-test scores badly trail the national average, Dr. Comer's program offers one of the greatest hopes, many educators say. In an economy increasingly incapable of absorbing unskilled workers, undereducation may sentence much of a generation to join an underclass marked by joblessness and the pathologies of the forgotten.
 
The Process
Relationships Based on Sharing
The Comer process, which Dr. Comer himself calls the School Development Program, emphasizes building relationships based on sharing that bring school administrators, staff, teachers and parents together regularly - in many cases daily.
The approach concentrates on the emotional, social, and psychological needs. His clearly-structured programs establish three goals: to induce parents to participate in the school's life; to force school administration, teachers, and other staff to share authority in managing the school; and to bring guidance counselors, mental health professionals and teachers into a team that meets regularly to combat behavior problems.
Parents, for example, are encouraged to become classroom assistants, tutors or aides. Some are encouraged, as are some teachers, to join their school's governance committee, which meets bi-weekly and includes the principal. The mental health and guidance professionals are part of the process of school management.
According to Dr. Comer, most administrators and teachers are not trained to recognize that a student's academic and behavioral lapses may be linked to the cultural and social gap between home and school.
''Some of these children come from families that cannot give them often the elementary things they need, like how to say 'Good morning,' 'Thank you,' 'Sit still' and all kinds of stuff,'' said the 55-year-old psychiatrist. ''On the other hand, you have staff that often doesn't understand that that is the problem.''
The children, Dr. Comer said, ''are in foreign terrority.''
When parents and educators work together in schools, social and psychological needs of students are not only better identified, but can be addressed to make students feel they are a welcome part of the school, say supporters of the Comer program. Their confidence is restored, and they are taught some of the things their families were unable to teach them.
 
The Bridges
Parent to School, School to Child
Interest in Dr. Comer's methods has never been more keen. Recently, the National Committee on Children, created by Congress and the President to be an advocacy group for children, visited New Haven to study Dr. Comer's program. And President Bush, while preparing last year for his meeting with the nation's governors on education, turned to Dr. Comer for advice.
For low-income students in troubled inner cities, and especially for black and Hispanic students, Dr. Comer's program may offer one of the greatest hopes, educators say.
''Dr. Comer's work builds bridges,'' said Hugh B. Price, a Rockefeller Foundation vice president. ''One is built from the parent to the school, and one out from the school to the children.''
For the next five years the foundation plans to spend $3 million a year to help schools implement the Comer process and train teachers in its tenets.
 
Effect on Educators
''Any educator who is exposed to his way of thinking emerges from that enlightened and empowered,'' Mr. Price said. ''We spent a good amount of time surveying all the possibilities and became struck by the fact that Dr. Comer's work was the most powerful we encountered. People who listen to him emerge saying, in effect, 'I knew it all along; he affirms my own best instincts.' ''
Unlike programs for economically disadvantaged children that limit their reforms to early childhood education, Dr. Comer's approach is a comprehensive, system-wide strategy for all ages.
Results of the Comer process have been especially impressive in reaching students considered ''at risk,'' Mr. Price said. In a study of some schools in Benton Harbor, Mich., that used Dr. Comer's approach, researchers found significant improvement in student performance and behavior. Suspensions in schools using the Comer approach dropped 8 percent - while rising 34 percent in the district as a whole. Similarly, students in the Comer schools excelled in reading and mathematics. In reading, the average gain in the Comer schools equaled that of the district as a whole at the second-grade level. But at the fifth and sixth grade levels the Comer schools, on the average, surpassed district-wide averages.
 
The Family
How Involvement Nurtures Esteem
Because Dr. Comer's program tries to reduce the sense of alienation some students and their parents feel for school, parents often welcome it as readily as do children.
Debra Kelly, who has three children, ages 6 to 9, in the New Haven system, said she is so pleased by what she has seen that she became active in her childrens' school and is now president of the Parent-Teachers Organization.
''In the last two years, I've done a lot of volunteer work here,'' said Ms. Kelly, who is 30. ''Now I promote it. It helps children and makes them feel more comfortable.''
Jacqueline Lecraft is 23 and childless. But she troops into her 5-year-old godson's kindergarten class almost every day.
A college student studying early childhood education, Ms. Lecraft said she got involved because her godson's parents could not get as much time off as she could.
''I want him to get a good start,'' she said. ''My mother was involved in my school, and it made a lot of difference. I want to do the same thing.''
 
Praise by Superintendent
Educators as well as parents say evidence abounds that Dr. Comer's methods work. ''We now have outstanding parent involvement, and youngsters are really focused on self-esteem and self-respect, and teachers are intimately involved in teaching,'' said John Dow Jr., New Haven's public school superintendent.
Jeffie Frazier, principal of the city's Helene Grant Elementary School, in an economically depressed black section of the city, explained: ''We have boys and girls who come into school who basically do not feel good about themselves. Our main job is to get them to feel good about themselves.''
That's what happened to Ramon Cato.
 
Living Proof
A Child Saved From Himself
Last year, Ramon lived on the edges of three worlds after his grandmother and grandfather, who were taking care of him, died within months of each other. Back with his mother and her boyfriend, he lived in a single room where soiled sheets served as window panes and the furniture consisted of a mattress and several milk crates. Often he roamed the streets at night. In the mornings, filthy and frustrated, he sometimes went to school.
''He was lost,'' said Ms. Frazier. She and her staff made contact with Ramon's great-uncle, Theodore F. Hogan Jr., an executive with the Southern New England Telephone Company.
Mr. Hogan said he grew particularly concerned after teachers at Ramon's school talked to him about the boy's absences and behavior.
''That really bothered me,'' he said, ''because I knew he was really smart, smart as a whip.'' With help from Ramon's teachers and principal at Grant Elementary, Mr. Hogan said, he was able to convince the city's Department of Children and Child Services that Ramon needed better care, and get him placed with a foster family.
''I do like my uncle tells me, act like nothing ever happened,'' Ramon said of his ordeal.
 
Another Success Story
Not all success stories are as dramatic, or as personal, as Ramon's.
About a year ago, Ms. Frazier, working with parents and teachers, decided to institute a school-uniform policy. Some parents had complained that some students appeared too concerned about the style of their expensive clothes and sneakers. And students whose families were unable to afford the clothes felt inadequate. A joint parent-teacher-principal management team - one of the components of the Comer process - decided on simple uniforms of Girl Scout-green and white and gray. Students and parents point to them as a source of pride and distinction. Even Ms. Frazier wears a variation of the green uniform to her office every day.
 
The Critics
The Sternest Tests May Lie Ahead
There are some, albeit only a few, detractors of the Comer program.
A professor of social work at a prestigious Southern university said Dr. Comer's program raises nearly as many questions as it answers. ''A crucial question is whether Comer's model can be replicated in any school district,'' said the professor, who asked not to be identified. ''Are there some school systems that are simply too large, such as New York City's?'' The professor also wondered if Dr. Comer's program can cope with fragmenting families, whose members may be unable to participate in school life because of poverty.
Dr. Comer maintains that with careful application his program can be adapted to the needs of any school system, although neither he nor his Rockefeller Foundation supporters are yet prepared to tackle New York.
And Dr. Comer agrees with his critics to a degree in acknowledging that the social deterioration in many major cities will force educators and parents to work even harder.
''We are beginning to see the first of our crack babies in our schools,'' Dr. Comer said, adding that their behavioral problems will present his program with special challenges.
Nonetheless, he said he is not shaken in his long-held belief that child development should be the centerpiece of education. For many black and Hispanic children, whose parents, Dr. Comer says, have had a ''traumatic social history,'' education must do more than teach the basics.
''Those families under stress are least able to give children the kinds of experiences they need to go to school and succeed,'' Dr. Comer said.
 
A Pupil's Two Worlds
At Katherine Brennan School, one of the New Haven elementary schools where Dr. Comer introduced his approach early on, there is a climate of calm and caring. The sight of parents in the school is almost as commonplace as that of teachers. Halls are quiet and clean. Bulletin boards celebrate black history and achievement in brightly-colored posters and hand-cut construction paper.
Outside, the school's double steel doors stand shut to a poverty-ravished neighborhood of public housing projects, graffiti-scarred streets and the ever-festering menace of drugs.
Brooke Rogers knows about the contrast. Recently, the fourth-graer said school represents her ''inside world,'' one quite apart from the ''outside world where people don't have anything in their heads but drugs and hurting people.''
With that, she pushed away from the table, stood up, thrust out her chin and said: ''I'm going to grow up and be somebody.''

HEADLINE: Strategic Interests Tie U.S. to Liberia

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
United States strategic interests tie Washington to the Liberian crisis, even as American officials privately voice criticism of the nation's embattled President and the leader of rebel forces moving on the capital.
Liberia grants the United States landing and refueling rights for military aircraft and ships on 24-hour notice, the only nation in sub-Saharan Africa that accords Washington such rights. The United States also controls a navigational station that emits low-frequency signals that guide ships and aircraft in the Atlantic. 
The installation in Liberia, one of eight in the world, serves as a backup guidance system for the American nuclear submarine fleet.
Washington also operates two communications relay stations outside Monrovia, the capital, that handle virtually all diplomatic and intelligence messages in sub-Saharan Africa and transmit Voice of America radio programming to most of the continent.
''They are important installations,'' said Herman J. Cohen, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. ''It would be difficult and very expensive to move them to another country.''
Asked if the 2,000 marines stationed in four ships off the coast of Liberia might be landed to defend the installations, he responded, ''I wouldn't want to reject any options.''
The installations have so far been untouched by the six-month civil war fought by the army of President Samuel K. Doe and the guerrillas of Charles Taylor.
While neither side has threatened to harm the installations, Mr. Cohen has said he was concerned that they could be damaged in crossfire.
Critics of Washington's long financial support for the Monrovia Government have asserted that the United States overemphasizes the importance of the installations in Liberia.
''I'm not sure there is any facility there that can't be replaced somewhere else,'' said Representative Ted Weiss, a Manhattan Democrat. ''When you are willing to overlook any kind of misdeed, from the most brutal to the most larcenous, to protect strategic assets, then those assets are not going to be very secure anyway.''
 
The Firestone Factor
Liberia has been close to the United States ever since it was founded in 1822 by freed American slaves. Its capital is named after James Monroe. Its 1847 Constitution was written at Harvard Law School. The descendents of the American settlers ruled over poorer tribal peoples for more than 150 years. The American dollar is the Liberian currency.
These ties fostered a special strategic relationship between the United States and Liberia. The United States Navy has long used the deep-water port of Monrovia when sailing in West African waters.
After World War I, when American strategic thinkers wanted secure supplies of rubber, Washington promoted the interests of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Liberia. Firestone won concessions of land at bargain prices, and developed the largest rubber plantation in the world.
''All the evidence suggests that a desire to maintain these installations and privileges has been a major factor in determining U.S. relations with Liberia's successive governments,'' said Gordon C. Thomasson, an anthropologist at Marlboro College in Vermont and president of the Liberian Studies Association.
Washington voiced criticism of the execution of members of the Tolbert Government by Doe forces, but provided Liberia with $500 million worth of military and economic aid between 1980 and 1985.

HEADLINE: Poorer Countries Are Hit Hardest By Spread of AIDS, U.N. Reports

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
The AIDS pandemic is spreading rapidly through the world and is switching from a disease of the industrial world to a disease of the developing nations, says Dr. Michael Merson, director of the United Nations' Global Program on AIDS. In an interview on Monday, Dr. Merson said that five years ago about half the world's known human immunodeficiency virus infections were in the developed countries, most in the United States. New estimates show that two-thirds of the HIV infections, which are known to cause AIDS, are in the less-developed countries, and that in 10 years three-quarters of all infections will occur in the developing countries. 
Dr. Merson, who succeeded Dr. Jonathan Mann earlier this year as director of the World Health Organization's Global Program on AIDS, said current estimates say there are now about 700,000 cases of AIDS, and six to eight million infections worldwide.
 
'Immense' Impact Seen
Among the consequences of the shifting burden of the disease, he said, is that for the first time in decades childhood mortality has stopped declining and will now begin to rise in some nations.
In addition, Dr. Merson said, ''the economic and social impact of a disease that kills people in their most productive years will be immense.''
''The selective impact on young and middle-aged adults, who include business and government workers as well as members of social, economic and political elites, could lead to economic and even political destabilization in some developing countries,'' he said.
Dr. Merson said that the pandemic would not level off for decades, and that it is likely that at least 15 to 20 million people will be infected in 10 years. As the spread of the disease is beginning to slow in the United States and other developing countries, it is just beginning to rise geometrically in other nations, including some in Asia, where the first wave of infection has passed through intravenous drug users and is now spreading rapidly among urban prostitutes.
 
Stark Figures
In India, less than 1 percent of prostitutes tested were infected in 1987. Now, up to 20 percent are infected in Bombay and other large cities.
In Thailand, less than 1 percent of intravenous drug users tested were infected in 1987; now, 50 percent are infected. Among urban prostitutes, the number has gone from less than one percent to 40 percent in some places. In those same three years, estimates say, the number of infected people in the nation has gone from a few hundred to more than 50,000.
In the early years of the epidemic in the United States and Europe, most cases were among homosexual men. Today, 60 percent of the infections worldwide are believed to have been spread by heterosexual acts. That proportion is expected to increase to 80 percent in the next 10 years.
Dr. Merson said it is not known how the disease will spread in Asia because it is unknown how much sexual activity, either heterosexual or homosexual, there is in the Asian nations that are now seeing an increase in the disease rates.
At the same time the disease is set to explode in Asia and elsewhere, Dr. Merson said, the Global Program on AIDS, a division of the World Health Organization at the United Nations, expects a $40 million shortfall in its budget for next year. The United States has cut back its contribution to the program from $25 million in fiscal 1989 to $21 million for 1990, and President Bush's request for $19 million in 1991.

HEADLINE: U.S. Urged to End Opposition to Ozone Aid

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
The head of the United Nations Environment Program strongly urged the United States today to reconsider its decision to oppose new financial aid to third-world countries to help them phase out chemicals that are destroying the earth's ozone layer.
The official, Mustafa K. Tolba of Egypt, executive director of the program, said that if the industrialized countries failed to provide the economic and technical help required by the third-world nations, the ''global bargain'' to protect the earth's environment would fall apart.
He said he was optimistic that the United States would change its position before a meeting in London this week called to strengthen an existing international treaty to protect ozone in the atmosphere from being destroyed by chlorofluorocarbons and other industrial chemicals.
But at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing today, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d reiterated that the Administration preferred to use ''existing resources'' to help the third-world countries adhere to the ozone treaty. 
Opposition to providing additional money to help the third-world countries phase out the offending chemicals originated with Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, Administration officials said.
While the American contribution would only be about $20 million, the White House officials reportedly feared that providing such additional funds would open the door to broad demands by those countries for assistance in solving their environmental problems.
The Bush Administration wants such aid to be provided from existing funds from the World Bank or other international lending institutions. The Administration also opposes the creation of a new fund at the World Bank for environmental programs.
Legislation has been introduced in Congress that would require the Government to contribute funds to help the poorer countries protect the ozone layer.
In a speech at the National Press Club today, Dr. Tolba called for a ban on the chemicals destroying the ozone layer when the nations gather in London this month. Under a protocol signed in Montreal in September 1987, those who agreed to the treaty committed themselves to a 50 percent reduction in the production and use of the chemicals by the end of the century.
Since then, new scientific information has shown that the destruction of the ozone layer is proceeding even more rapidly than previously recognized. A thinning ozone layer permits more ultraviolet radiation from the sun to penetrate to the earth's surface, causing skin cancer and cataracts in humans and harming crops and wildlife.
Dr. Tolba also said today that he expected the international community to adopt a treaty ''with teeth'' to address the global-warming problem when it gathers at a conference in Brazil two years from now.
Carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons and other industrial and agricultural gases are accumulating in the atmosphere and, by trapping radiation from the sun, will cause the earth to warm substantially in the next century through a process called the greenhouse effect, many scientists believe. Despite some lingering skepticism about the scientific issues surrounding the greenhouse effect, Dr. Tolba said, ''we are moving toward a truly global consensus on the need for action and action now.''
Although the Bush Administration has been stressing the need for more information about the scientific and economic implications of a global-warming treaty, ''the United States, I am sure, will not block unanimity'' but will meet ''its responsibilities toward its own people and the world at large,'' he said.
At the luncheon, which was sponsored by the World Resources Institute, the United Nations official also emphasized the need for a treaty through which the nations could cooperate to preserve the world's biological diversity.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
U.S. Thinks Gorbachev Might Give In on NATO

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials are growing increasingly convinced that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union is slowly reconciling himself to the idea that a united Germany will be in NATO, provided Moscow's economic, political and security concerns are met, Administration officials said today.
The officials said they were encouraged by the fact that Mr. Gorbachev was, in effect, dropping his demand for German forces to be equally divided between the Eastern and Western alliances in his latest compromise proposal, made today. They said he was gradually moving toward Washington's position with his plan, which calls for the West German Army to be part of NATO and for the East German Army to be under strictly German control.
 
Evolution and Negotiation
While expressing optimism about Mr. Gorbachev's views in light of the new plan, the officials said they thought that the overall change would be an evolutionary process and that there will be protracted negotiations about the terms as Mr. Gorbachev prepares the Soviet public for NATO membership for a united Germany. 
''You are very clearly seeing an evolution in Soviet views,'' a senior Administration official said. ''It wasn't all that many months ago when any form of German unification according to the Soviets would have had to be premised on neutrality, which had been their position since 1952. They now know and recognize that neutrality won't work. They are willing to concede in principle unified German membership in NATO. But they are trying to grapple with how you tie that to other arrangements.''
Another top official said: ''Gorbachev is clearly conditioning his environment by showing that he is ready to consider alternatives for Germany other than the ones he has presented up to now. It won't happen overnight but you can see that he is embarked on a process.''
Reacting to initial reports of Mr. Gorbachev's latest proposal, President Bush told reporters, ''Our position is well known to him, which is that a unified Germany should be in NATO with no conditions.''
The President said he expected Moscow to float more ideas and said, ''We'll listen and we'll discuss them without rancor.''
 
Addressing Security Concerns
Mr. Gorbachev said that if NATO leaders revamped their own military doctrines at the NATO summit meeting in London on July 5 and 6, ''then within this framework a new solution could be found for insuring security for a united Germany.'' That statement was viewed as a signal that the Soviet leader has been influenced by a nine-point program offered by Washington to ease Soviet security concerns about a united Germany in NATO.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, said: ''All of our Western European allies see the advantage of a unified Germany as a member of the NATO alliance, and so do at least three members of the Warsaw Pact. And the Soviet Union recognizes, and it has stated that they recognize, the important role that United States forces can play as a stabilizing factor in Europe.''
At the NATO summit meeting, Mr. Baker said, ''there will be debate among the heads of state of the NATO countries with respect to NATO's military strategy and doctrine.'' Among the basic NATO strategies that Mr. Baker hinted would be up for reconsideration was the longtime doctrine of the first use of nuclear weapons.
This doctrine, which has been central to NATO military planning, says that if a conventional Soviet attack on Western Europe cannot be halted at the German border, American short-range nuclear weapons could be used to disperse it. To back up the doctrine, NATO keeps short-range nuclear weapons in Germany, which is why the Germans, along with the Soviet Union, are among the leading advocates of abandoning first use of nuclear weapons.
 
Bush Position Hardening
The Bush Administration's public position on Germany and NATO has been hardening a bit lately, not softening. In the final communique at last week's meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Turnberry, Scotland, the United States refined one of the nine points in the program it has offered to Moscow on NATO membership for a united Germany.
Initially, American officials said, no NATO troops would be extended to the territory of what is now East Germany. But in the NATO final communique, and again during testimony before Congress today, Mr. Baker said that the American position was for not extending NATO forces into what is now East German territory ''for a transition period.''
American officials said that after that unspecified period, Germany and NATO could extend their forces over the entire area of German sovereignty. While conceding that this had not been their public position, Administration officials said that this was always how they had formulated their stand when speaking with the Soviet Union in private.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Gains for Babies of Low Birth Weight

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
The first large-scale study of a development program for babies who weighed less than normal at birth showed that it achieved striking success in raising their scores on intelligence tests and improving their social functioning.
Low-birth-weight babies, those five and a half pounds or less, are known to be at greater risk of developmental, medical and behavioral problems than are babies whoses weights are normal at birth.
But the researchers who conducted the study are reporting today in The Journal of the American Medical Association that the children who participated in the development program from birth were found at the age of 3 to have I.Q. scores that averaged up to 13 points higher than those of children who did not participate.
Although smaller studies have indicated that child development programs could help low-birth-weight babies to function better intellectually, experts said the new research was the first large, carefully controlled study on the subject carried out at multiple sites. Many of the children were from poor families living in inner cities. 
 
Similar Results Cited
Dr. Donna Bryant of the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Center at the University of North Carolina said previous studies led by Dr. Craig Ramey of the center, who was a consultant in the study being reported today, showed similar results for children from poor, uneducated families born at normal weights. One study showed a rise of 16 points in I.Q. by the age of 3, she said.
Dr. Duane F. Alexander, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md., said the latest study was ''extremely important,'' and added: ''What science has provided here is an indication that kids who are at risk of delayed development from low birth weight and economic deprivation can be helped. The gains were substantial. These were not little differences -they were major improvements.''
In the four-year, $33 million study, 985 premature babies who weighed five and a half pounds or less at birth were divided into two groups.
One group received the special intervention. The parents were counseled in groups that met every two weeks. The researchers visited the babies' homes each week, providing health and development information to the parents and a program of games and activities to improve the child's cognitive, language and social skills.
When the children were a year old they were put in an educational day care program, with one teacher for every three children from 12 to 23 months old and one teacher for every four children from 24 to 36 months old.
The second group of babies served as a comparison group and was not offered special help.
 
Substantially Higher Scores
By the time the children were 3 years old, those who had received special help had substanially higher scores on intelligence tests and better social functioning. The I.Q.'s of the heavier babies in the intervention program -those who weighed from 4.4 to 5.5 pounds at birth - were 13.2 points higher than those of comparable size in the control group. And the I.Q.'s of the lighter babies, who weighed less than 4.4 pounds at birth, were 6.6 points higher than those of comparable babies in the control group.
The babies in the control group as a whole were nearly three times more likley to be mentally retarded, the researchers found.
Nearly 7 percent of all babies born in the United States, or about 260,000 babies a year, are classified as low birth weight. More than half are born to poor women who had inadequate nutrition and prenatal care, said Dr. Sumner Yaffe, director of the Center for Research for Mothers and Children at the child health institute.
Dr. Julius Richmond, who was Surgeon General from 1977 to 1981 and is now the John D. MacArthur Professor emeritus of health policy at Harvard, said, ''The fact that the results seem to be so favorable has significance not only for the children and their families, but also in terms of policy.''
 
Programs Could Start at Birth
He said that recent legislation provides Federal funds for states to start programs for children at risk of learning disabilities and that the programs, at the states' discretion, could start at birth.
Dr. Alexander said the new study, directed by Dr. Ruth T. Gross of Stanford University and sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in Princeton, N.J., ''is the first one done with a very large population, in a very carefully controlled, prospective way and at multiple sites with very careful follow-up.''
Dr. Gross said she and the other researchers who conducted the study were ''surprised and ecstatic'' when they saw the results. ''It's exciting,'' she said. ''It tells us that improving the environment can go a long way'' toward helping children of low birth weight.
Dr. Ruby Hern, a vice president at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, who conceived the study, said the work was ''carried out in some of the most difficult circumstances we have in this country,'' and added, ''To me, the very encouraging thing is that by intervening early and frequently we were able to make substantial differences in the children.''
 
Some Questions Remain
The study was done at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and in centers in seven other cities: Boston, Dallas, Little Rock, Ark., Miami, New Haven, Philadelphia and Seattle.
Dr. Yaffee, the director of the child health institute's research center, said some questions about the study still remained. ''It is important to learn how long these differences will be sustained,'' he said.
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is continuing to follow the children, who are now about 5 1/2 years old, but it will not be known for years if the intervention program will translate into greater academic success and fewer social problems for the children.
If the effect is sustained, Dr. Yaffee said, it could make a big difference in the childrens' lives. ''Twelve I.Q. points makes a big difference when it comes to what you are capable of achieveing later in life,'' he said.
Dr. Hern said the study spent $9,000 per child per year just for the child development center services. ''Obviously, our costs were more than it would cost to deliver these services,'' she said.
Dr. Marc Bornstein, who is head of family and child research at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, said, ''We were schooled in the 1980's that there are certain problems that you can't throw money at to solve.'' But he added, ''This is an example of a problem that if we throw money at it in a certain way, we can make healthier children and, presumably, in the long run, have better citizens and a better society.''

HEADLINE: In Texas, a Look at a Deal Bringing Profit and Peril

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 12

 BODY:
The sight of an oil tanker ablaze provoked little surprise along the Texas coast, where many people have struck a bargain with industries that can bring both wealth and danger. But after watching the ship burn for four days, some officials and politicians say they are beginning to wonder whether the bargain should be re-evaluated.
As salvage crews struggled again today to contain the fires aboard the Norwegian tanker Mega Borg almost 60 miles from Galveston Island, several voices were asserting that lack of attention to environmental concerns had unnecessarily increased the dangers posed by such a tanker accident.
Since the oil spill from the Exxon Valdez off Alaska last year, the Texas Land Commissioner, Garry Mauro, has been warning that Texas is unprepared to respond to a major tanker accident. But he complains that he has drawn little attention from fellow elected officials and news organizations. 
 
'Public Has Been Lulled'
''The public has been lulled into a feeling of safety,'' he said today, ''because we have so many small spills every year that do not do major damage and because we've lived with so much oil for so long without ever facing the ultimate catastrophe.''
Since Saturday, when the first explosion occurred aboard the Mega Borg, the prospect of just such a catastrophe has been driven home by the image of fire belching from a ship loaded with 38 million gallons of crude oil.
''Everyone around here knows that there are disasters waiting to happen, but everyone has figured, 'It's not going to happen to me,' '' said Doug Matthews, city manager of Galveston, about 50 miles southeast of Houston.
''This event is a clear sign that we were wrong,'' he said. ''Now it happened in a big way that threatens the whole coast, and we've all been held hostage for four days so far while that ship sits there burning, and we have no control over what is happening out on the Gulf.''
Like Mr. Matthews, most critics have focused on the delay in firefighting efforts while equipment was brought from the Netherlands. Complaints also have been aimed at the rapidly growing and unregulated practice outside Gulf ports in which big tankers like the Mega Borg transfer all or part of their cargoes to smaller vessels that can navigate shallow ports.
 
A General Ambivalence
But interviews with people in business, public officials and others in this region reveal the deep ambivalence of those who want both a healthy environment and a healthy oil industry.
''It will be devastating if that crude gets into the bays, just devastating - a nightmare when you think of all the fine sea life that is threatened.'' said J. Link Smith, an avid fisherman and president of the Bay Oil Company, a family owned concern that distributes petroleum products.
Yet moments later, he argued: ''Every time something like this happens, you hear the same protests, but who is willing to do without all the things we get from oil, whether it is our plastic milk jugs or gasoline?''
Paradox seems to permeate the very landscape of the Texas coast, where sand castles sometimes share vistas with refinery towers.
Galveston Bay, which is far less polluted than it was 20 years ago, is at the heart of a vast estuary system that is a fertile home for a wealth of wildlife, including speckled trout, shrimp, oysters and waterfowl. But many of the people who spend their weekends enjoying the bay and its fruits work during the week at the harbors and the refineries and chemical and other industrial plants that line the shore.
 
Beachgoers and Barges
Along the coast beachgoers on barrier islands face a horizon dotted with offshore oil rigs, and barges laden with petroleum products press down channels dug out of salt marshes that host endangered species like the whooping crane. Despite earlier leaks and accidents, there has been no real pressure to make hard choices about this complex cohabitation.
''We've created a contradiction, a Catch-22, here, and I know we have to live with it, as much as I hate it when things like this tanker accident happen,'' said Mr. Smith. ''No one is guilty of anything, but the times are catching up with everyone.''
Jim Blackburn, chairman of the Galveston Bay Foundation, one of the leading environmental groups in the Houston area, said, ''I think the public has low expectations on the environment because so many people make their livings from oil and petrochemicals, but even though we are way behind the rest of the country, attitudes are changing.''
Even if the Mega Borg is salvaged with no further loss of oil, the massive environmental peril it has represented for four days is likely to contribute to that change, Mr. Blackburn said.
The tanker fire was only one of several recent incidents that have highlighted the environmental dangers. Just the day before the blast aboard the Mega Borg, there were three major industrial accidents in the Houston area that either caused injuries or forced the evacuations of residential areas, or both. But, before such events can change minds, they must overcome a long legacy.
 
A World Apart
As in so many other respects, Texas has considered itself a world apart in environmental matters. Both boom times and busts offered rationales for accommodations at the local level in favor of economic development.
''When big oil was paying 30 cents of every tax dollar, no one was going to go to the barricades when it did something unacceptable, and I believe a preponderance of Texans will still come down on the side of the buck rather than the environment, although clearly the standards are changing,'' said T.R. Fehrenbach, chairman of the Texas Historical Commission.
Oil exploration and extraction do not play the roles they did before the oil price cuts of the 1980's, but the economic recovery of the Houston area over the past two years has been aided by rapid growth in the petrochemicals industry, which has brought new environmental risks. Up and down the Gulf Coast, state and local governments have aggressively courted petrochemical companies with tax incentives and assurances that environmental permits would be expedited -all in hopes of seeing new plants and new jobs in their communities.
But no matter what the economic promise, new pollution threats are no longer accepted automatically and universally.
In Port Lavaca, abut 80 miles down the coast from Galveston, a small environmental group has successfully demanded that the expansion of a plastics plant be subjected to rigorous study before necessary permits are granted. A major project to deepen and expand the Houston Ship Channel faces a potential delay of four years because the Galveston Bay Foundation and other groups have successfully pressured Federal agencies to examine the environmental consequences.
 
'Change Is Coming'
''The change is coming from the bottom up,'' said Frances Farenthold, a prominent Democratic politician in the 1970's. ''It is the people working in hazardous plants or living near them that are raising a ruckus. Meanwhile you hardly hear about the environment in Austin or in political campaigns.''
The slowly changing attitudes are evident even among those in industries once guilty of environmental sins.
Jim Calaway, an independent oil man, said, ''I've been in the oil industry 35 years, and the change in environmental consciousness has been from utter blackness to light.''
He noted that after large capital investments in new wells, production is frequently delayed for months while environmental permits are processed. ''Even ten years ago,'' he said, ''we'd be pumping as much as we could as soon as we could and not thinking about the toxins we were dumping in the air or water, but now we know we can't do that and most important I believe we in the oil industry understand why we can't.''

It's a Wired, Wired World

BYLINE: By LEON V. SIGAL

 BODY:
Expatriate Iranians exported revolutionary ideas from Paris by videocassette. East Germans imported ideas from West Germany by television. Last year Chinese students used telephones, fax machines and laptop computers to organize their protest in Tiananmen Square and tell a watching world about it. 
Electronic communication is breaking down walls between countries and transforming those countries internally. Globally, cross-border telephone traffic increased sixfold in the 1980's. And the details of who's talking to whom, and how much, tell a lot about the pace of economic and social change.
Gregory Staple and Mark Mullins, consultants to the International Institute of Communications in London, have devised a statistic to gauge traffic flows - MiTTs, or minutes of telecommunication traffic. MiTTs measure voice, facsimile and data transmissions on public circuits.
Americans spend the most time reaching out to touch someone abroad, 5.3 billion MiTTs in 1988. But that's because there are lots of Americans with lots of phone lines. A better indicator of growing globalism is MiTTs per 1,000 people. Hong Kong leads with 56,296, one-third of them to China. The next most outward-reaching country is Singapore, followed by Canada, the Netherlands and West Germany. By this measure the U.S. ranks ninth, with 21,839 MiTTs per 1,000 people.
A fifth of that time was spent on outgoing calls to Canada and a tenth each to Britain and Mexico. Then come West Germany at 7 percent and Japan at about 4 percent. The next six, each between 2 and 3 percent, include some surprises: France, Italy, South Korea, the Dominican Republic, Colombia and the Philippines. That's a lot of business in the last three countries.
Such communication flows create a virtual map of economic interdependence. Nearly three-fourths of South Korea's time telephoning abroad and half of Taiwan's goes just to the U.S. and Japan. Singapore's calls, and business abroad, are less concentrated. Singaporeans spend the same portion of time, 13 percent each, calling Indonesia, Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S.
Europeans mostly phone each other, except for the British, who spend more than a fifth of their time ringing up the U.S. One of every four Japanese minutes of foreign calls comes to the United States, almost twice as many as go to South Korea.
In an era of global economic competition, a communication link is an axis of influence. That may be why West Germany is bidding to install phones in Eastern Europe. And that's why it's shortsighted for the U.S. and British Governments to block the installation by American and British companies of a fiber-optic cable across the Soviet Union.
The Soviet people, notwithstanding perestroika, are less connected with each another and less wired into the outside world than are the Chinese. Entrepreneurs from South Korea or Japan could soon fix that, allowing Soviet markets and democracy to function better.
As economies turn from manufacturing to services, measuring by MiTTs may also prove a useful way to track economic growth. So if geopoliticians and economists want to stay on the ball, they'll have to use their MiTTs.LEON V. SIGAL

HEADLINE: What Economic Decline? What Exported Jobs?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
That 9 out of 10 Americans are disturbed by developments such as economic decline and ''exported'' jobs, as discussed by the poll taker Louis Harris in ''Bush Isn't a Shoo-In for '92'' (Op-Ed, May 23), is no surprise. However, if government policies are to be based on these polls, it is important to know if those feelings are based on facts. In the case of America's economic ''decline,'' they are not. From 1981 to 1989, the United States enjoyed a real economic growth rate of 3 percent a year, lower than Japan's 4.1 percent, but higher that Britain's 2 percent, France's 1.9 percent and West Germany's 1.3 percent.
As for the jobs that have been allegedly exported abroad, it is difficult to see where they have ended up. Job creation in the United States has consistently outpaced that of Japan and Europe. American workers remain the world's most productive, and our standard of living is second to none.
Quite contrary to Mr. Harris's assertion, a Democratic strategy of exploiting fears of economic ''decline'' would play into the President's hands. Mr. Bush may not be a shoo-in, but a Democratic campaign based upon inaccurate economic perceptions will definitely improve his chances.

HEADLINE: In Public Schools, Class Will Tell

BYLINE: By Hodding Carter; Hodding Carter is president of Mainstreet TV Productions, which makes documentaries for public television.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
There is a consensus that public school education is either poised on the precipice or already dashed upon the rocks below. We are regularly barraged with admonitions, advice and policy proposals to remedy the situation. Depending on whom you trust, you may believe that what is required is more tax money, the same or less money spent differently, vouchers, more individual choice, more direct intervention by the private sector or a combination thereof.
It is a rich stew of agitated concern, bubbling furiously in the mass media and scholarly journals, but it is missing the one ingredient that the schools need most: the children of the influential. 
Until America's most affluent and best educated people offer their own children in large numbers to the public school mix, progress will come grudgingly if at all.
To the degree that class and income determine whether you are a public school or private school patron, the public schools will fall disastrously short of their potential, with all that means for wasted lives and diminished prospects for the nation's future.
The flight from the public schools is no respecter of ideology. Harvard professors no less than New Orleans bankers and New York editors long ago decided their children's future was too important to be entrusted to public schools.
Liberals on Capitol Hill rarely make common cause with conservatives. But they are often as one when it comes to the selection of schools for their children, and those schools frequently aren't public. And yet virtually all of them engage in endless public discourse on the tragedy of the public schools and the desperate need to save them. However, the disparity between the leadership class's rhetorical commitment to improving public education and the reality of its wholesale desertion of the public schools is the message that matters.
It is considered patronizing in some quarters to suggest that high-quality education can take place only in schools integrated by race and at least partially by income as well. And many people flatly reject the idea that they should risk their children's future for the sake of what they regard as nebulous social theories and generalized concerns about civic health. The fear of violence is widespread; the reality is far less widespread, but nonetheless real.
To which the answers are, first, the profile of the total school population matters in every way that counts. If white leadership has its kids in the public school system, that system automatically has political clout. It is clout that translates into attention and money, far more of both than a system without such participation can expect or will receive. It may not be fair, but it is nevertheless a fact of political life.
School systems whose patrons are drawn disproportionately from the powerless are themselves relatively powerless to improve. Resources will flow wherever the powerful send their children to school. So will innovation.
Why should the powerful care? Because the public schools are the place where most people receive their education. If they do as bad a job over the next 25 years as they have over the past 25, all of us can kiss America's current position in the world goodbye, along with economic prosperity. We're no longer a giant among pygmies. Our allies and friends now include ferocious competitors, all of whom are building their economic machines on firm foundations of well-educated and trained workers.
Second, protecting our children is an altogether human and logical impulse, but in this instance it is self-defeating. They are the ones who will inherit the society that a failed public school system is certain to produce.
There is no point in pretending that there will be no costs involved, or that public school education can easily be upgraded to match a Phillips Exeter Academy. Nevertheless, affluent families have the intellectual and financial resources to insure that learning takes place outside the classroom as well as in - if they are as willing to give time as they are to give lip service to their children's well-being. And their families, banding together, can help see to it that the schools measure up.
Moreover, the sheltering of upper income children in private schools not only accelerates the deterioration of public education, it hides its consequences from precisely those people who could do something about it.
As for violence, there is only one answer, not only for schools but for society. It is a problem that requires the wholehearted, cooperative effort of everyone. It will only grow worse as the affluent increasingly live like so many noblemen of the Middle Ages, segregated from the rabble in enclaves moated by elaborate security systems and safely removed from the poor's reach.
Violence within the schools cannot be overcome by its primary victims, the children of the nation's least powerful families. It could be controlled if those with the means to call society's institutions to account would stay involved long enough to make the calls.
Earnest lectures, learned articles and philanthropic largesse are no substitute for basic commitment. When it comes to the schools, a paraphrase of an old church saying is particularly pertinent: where your kids are, there is your heart.
When the white leadership abandoned the schools following total integration in my old home town in Mississippi, it hurt the schools and weakened the community. What happened there is little different from the effect of similar desertions in New York City and a thousand other American towns and cities. It seems likely to continue to occur.
Until the nation's leaders admit that what they do with their children matters more than what they say, America's public schools cannot and will not be turned around. If they are not turned around, the continued success of our great national experiment will be in grave doubt.

HEADLINE: Democracy on Hold

BYLINE: By Edward J. Markey; Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, is chairman of the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If the Bush Administration has its way, the people of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union will hear the sounds of democracy with one ear.
At a meeting in Paris last week, the Administration convinced U.S. allies to accept the bulk of its proposals to restrict high-tech exports to the former East bloc. The agreement is being touted as a major breakthrough in liberalizing high-tech export controls. Yet in the field of telecommunications, all it does is afford the new democracies in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary about the same access to technologies that we allow the old dictatorship in China. 
The Soviet Union, along with Bulgaria and Romania, would be held to an even lower level of technology. Already, a $500 million proposal by a U.S. telecommunications firm to install a fiber optic line to connect the Soviet Union, Europe and Asia - for civilian long-distance phone service and business data communications -is imperiled.
We Americans know about the power of communication. It is an article of faith among us that free and open communications is the best guarantee of democracy. The old Stalinist regimes that once ruled throughout the East bloc paid homage to that faith: they systematically denied their people access to modern telecommunications.
Yet the Bush Administration's shortsighted policy refuses to acknowledge the fundamental opportunity for democracy in tearing down the Sonic Wall that now divides Europe. The practical result of this policy will be that Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union will only be able to communicate with the world in the technological equivalent of whispers.
It is the U.S. intelligence community that represents the key stumbling block. Its representatives argue that eavesdropping on civilian communications systems in these countries will become more difficult if we grant them access to more modern, and more secure, telecommunications technologies. They are correct: it will.
While the interests of the intelligence community should not be dismissed lightly, we must remember that they exist to serve, not dictate, America's broader national interests. In Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, our overarching interest must be to actively encourage the transition to pluralistic, democratic societies with market-oriented economies.
Do we want to deny emerging democracies access to these technologies simply because it makes it harder for us to listen in on a civilian telephone line? The Soviets already maintain a separate, dedicated telecommunications system for sensitive Government communication; civilian telecommunications equipment is largely resistant to diversion for military uses.
We want to encourage democracy. If these nations are to succeed in making their transition to freedom and free markets, their antiquated civilian telecommunications systems - some consisting of rotary phone equipment dating back to the 1930's - must be upgraded. While the U.S. has about 90 phone lines per 100 people, and Western Europe has about 60, Eastern Europe averages only nine phones for every 100 people. Even today, a Polish citizen must wait 13 years to get a telephone in his home.
Telecommunications tools are a vital part of the infrastructure of a free, open and economically viable society. We should be encouraging Eastern European and Soviet citizens to shout democracy from the technological rooftops rather than eavesdropping on their every whisper.
Instead of the Bush Administration's half-hearted policy, we should enact the legislation adopted by the House of Representatives last week. Among other things, the bill would:
* Decontrol exports of less sophisticated civilian telecommunications products and technology. This would give Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union access to items already available to China.
* Allow the Western nations and Japan, at their discretion, to decide which sophisticated civilian telecommunications equipment and technology to export to Eastern Europe.
* Encourage continued progress toward reform in the Soviet Union by allowing exports of sophisticated equipment on the basis of national discretion. However, the lifting of more restrictive controls on technology transfer would be contingent on further democratization.
With these policies in place, America can take pride in laying the technical foundations of democracy in the modern world. We will have provided a precious gift to the people of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union: the power of communication.

HEADLINE: Wagner's Schools Legacy: Varied Grades and a Major Impact

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Robert F. Wagner Jr. will be ending his four-year presidency of the Board of Education at the end of the month, leaving behind a school system that he altered in important ways through both his artfulness as a politician and his scholarly grasp of the system's fundamental flaws.
His critics accuse him of seizing too much of the day-to-day operations from the chancellors, of snatching power for the central board from the community boards, of failing to follow through on his own criticisms. Some say that his personality, introspective to the point of diffidence, could not passionately project his own vision to the public.
But those who praise him say he is probably the best board president in two decades, and they fear that there is no one on the horizon who will match him when an almost entirely new board takes over on July 1. Mr. Wagner has not been reappointed to the board by Mayor David N. Dinkins.
After a series of board presidents whose roots were largely in politics, Mr. Wagner, though the scion of an illustrious political family, brought with him an intellectual's vision of how the system should be changed and a shrewd ability to work with governmental bodies and news organizations, his admirers say. 
Mr. Wagner's legacy includes the widely-praised Project Giant Step program for 4-year-olds, smaller classes for elementary schools, clinics that provide birth control advice to teen-agers, more attractive salaries for teachers, a more stringent custodians' contract, and a construction authority freed from some of its notorious red tape with a $4.3 billion plan for building new schools.
It was Mr. Wagner, supporters say, who created the search committees that brought leaders with national reputations - first Richard R. Green and then Joseph A. Fernandez - to New York City as Chancellors. And it was Mr. Wagner, in an advantageous climate created by a series of school scandals, who helped spur the State Legislature - many of whose members he knew personally - to keep politicians and school employees off school boards and to restrict tenure for principals.
After the revenue drought that followed the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, when moldering textbooks were not replaced and classrooms went unpainted, Mr. Wagner was able to extract perhaps $350 million a year more from the city and state beyond inflationary increases. The size of classes in the early grades fell from 28 to 25 pupils and, at many impoverished schools, 22.
''He started building back a system that for a decade had been left to rot,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers. ''It's still in a fragile state, but he started a momentum toward a viable school system.''
In assessing Mr. Wagner's tenure, the most elusive question is, What did it ultimately mean for the academic proficiency of the schoolchildren? Mr. Wagner says that dropout levels declined sharply, from 43 to 29 percent, and that reading levels gradually improved. But the methods of calculating both measures underwent revisions that officials acknowledge make comparisons difficult.
In a two-hour interview in his Brooklyn office, the 46-year-old Mr. Wagner, who first joined the board in January 1986, said he was proud that New York had become ''a major focus of school reform in the country.'' But he lamented that he was not able to reform special education - the program for handicapped and emotionally disturbed youngsters - so that it was not ''an educational ghetto'' from which many students ''never escape.''
 
'We Have No Choice'
''The school system has to do what it's never done before: provide an education for 100 percent of all kids,'' he said, noting that 85 percent of new jobs require at least a high school diploma. ''Maybe we're asking the schools to do too much, but as a city and as a society, we have no choice.''
The issue of Mr. Wagner's accomplishments was raised publicly two weeks ago by James F. Gill, head of the Joint Commission on Integrity in the Public Schools. He called the Board of Education ''a sleepy-eyed lumbering brontosaurus primarily interested in grazing,'' and singled out Mr. Wagner for what he said was a failure to respond to the commission's findings. There was a bitter irony to the attack because it was Mr. Wagner who created the commission.
Mr. Gill, a man whose temper is not always reined in, has indicated to mutual friends like former Mayor Edward I. Koch that he was goaded by a television reporter and did not intend to attack Mr. Wagner personally. Nevertheless, he said in a recent interview that Mr. Wagner and the board did not promptly overhaul an ineffective inspector general's office and did not replace what he said was an incompetent chief investigator at the Board of Examiners, the agency that licenses teachers.
Mr. Wagner's supporters reject this criticism as simplistic, and ultimately unfair to the overall Wagner record.
 
'Sometimes a Plotter'
''Bob is a very complicated man,'' said Stanley S. Litow, the deputy chancellor for operations. ''He's not a conventional spokesperson. If he were, he would probably be mayor. He's a writer and thinker and sometimes a plotter. But his expertise on the issues is absolutely unparalleled, and he succeeds to the extent that solving problems requires a sense of history, politics and the city's problems all at once.''
Detractors say Mr. Wagner, who worked almost full time as the $20,000-a-year president, undermined both Mr. Green and his predecessor, Nathan Quinones, even limiting their ability to hire their own staff. Even Ms. Feldman, who is generally complimentary, said Mr. Wagner ''was basically running the system as president and there was not a strong leadership role to be played by the chancellor, and that was not healthy for the system.''
Mr. Wagner rejects the picture of him as a meddler and argued that it was under his leadership that the board ''ceded'' the day-to-day business to the chancellor, ''despite what Jim Gill has said.''
Mr. Wagner, the son of a former mayor and the grandson of a United States Senator, brought to the board presidency long friendships with political figures - he regularly has dinner with Mr. Koch - and the mystique of a man who had almost been chancellor himself. The State Education Commissioner overturned his 1983 appointment as chancellor, citing a lack of credentials.
 
Koch Praises Board's Unity
Mr. Koch said Mr. Wagner, a graduate of both Harvard and Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School, was able to create a board with a unified philosophy, no mean feat, he said, considering that the board's seven members are chosen by five borough presidents and a mayor. ''The board has no philosophy, can't have a philosophy because you don't have a single appointing authority,'' Mr. Koch said. ''But what was substituted there was Bob Wagner's basic philosophy.''
Mr. Wagner, admirers say, was able to bring onto the board people like Edward L. Sadowsky and Richard I. Beattie, who had a citywide, rather than a provincial, borough perspective. They add he was able to advise the board how to approach legislators and prepare for editorial board meetings.
Early in his term, Mr. Wagner visited a bilingual class inside a boy's bathroom, its urinals still intact. Determined to relieve overcrowding, he put together the concept of a school construction authority. To cut construction time, the authority would be able to leapfrog many of the reviews needed for site approval and hire a single supervising contractor rather than four separate ones, as other agencies must do under the Wicks Law.
 
Press and Patronage Concerns
Politically, Mr. Wagner helped create a consensus for change, appointing a blue-ribbon study commission, gaining union support, then using his influence with state legislators to obtain passage of the bill creating the authority.
One of Mr. Wagner's severest critics is Dennis Coleman, a Bronx school board member who is president of the New York City School Boards Association. He says Mr. Wagner was ''successful in getting into the boardrooms of the major newspapers'' to create favorable editorials that then generated favorable stories and was able to squeeze money out of City Hall by giving jobs to ''high-level bureaucrats.''
Jeanne Frankl, the executive director of the Public Education Association, criticizes Mr. Wagner for not being a ''galvanizing leader.'' Mr. Wagner, she said, failed to involve parents and community organizations sufficiently.
''Although I think he feels very passionately about children, he hasn't made others share his passion,'' she said. ''He's too much of an academic. His ideas about what needs to be done tend to be theoretical rather than immediate and concrete.''
As to the future, Mr. Wagner is holding his plans close to the vest. He says he wants to continue teaching classes on urban affairs at Columbia and New York Universities and is exploring a book about schools. Friends occasionally urge him to run for the United States Senate. But Mr. Wagner, whose last race was a losing one for Manhattan borough president, is not sure he has a campaigner's personality.
''I'd love to be in the U.S. Senate,'' he said. ''But I'm not sure I'd love to be in a race for U.S. Senate.''

HEADLINE: Selling Authorities To Private Industry Is Backed by Rinfret

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 12

 BODY:
The Republican candidate for governor, Pierre A. Rinfret, said today that he favored selling several state agencies to private industry.
Mr. Rinfret, an economist, said he thought that private owners would run the agencies more efficiently. ''I think you can think about selling anything where the government is totally inefficient and incompetent,'' he said at a news conference here today.
Among the public agencies that Mr. Rinfret said he would like to sell to the highest bidder are the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Airports, and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which owns and maintains New York City's major bridges and tunnels. He also suggested selling several New York City subway lines.
''Sell them - they're worth a lot of money,'' he said.
In his remarks, Mr. Rinfret did not address the potential legal problems of such a huge sale of public assets. Nor was it clear whether Federal law would permit such a sale. Recently, Albany County tried to become the first municipality in the country to sell its airport to a group of private investors but was rebuffed by the Federal Aviation Administration.
 
'Going to Be a Battle'
Mr. Rinfret acknowledged that his plan was likely to face enormous political opposition. ''It's going to be a battle,'' he said, ''because all the people there don't want to be privatized. It may become efficient.''
Today's news conference came during Mr. Rinfret's first visit to the state capital since he accepted the Republican nomination two weeks ago. He was offered the nomination after at least 19 other potential candidates turned it down.

HEADLINE: Provost From Michigan Named to Head M.I.T.

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 12

 BODY:
Charles M. Vest, the provost of the University of Michigan and a former dean of engineering there, has been selected to be the new president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, school officials announced today.
Dr. Vest's selection, by the executive committee of M.I.T.'s governing board, ends an unusually difficult search process that began a year ago when Paul E. Gray announced that he would step down as president at the end of this month.
Two men initially considered the leading candidates, John Deutch, M.I.T.'s provost, and David Baltimore, a Nobel prize-winning biologist, both took themselves out of the running. In February, another distinguished biologist at M.I.T., Phillip A. Sharp, accepted the presidential nomination, but then stunned the school a week later by changing his mind and saying he preferred to remain a professor. 
Dr. Deutch, a chemist, withdrew his name after opposition surfaced from some professors and students critical of his ties to the military and to private business. He is now considering leaving M.I.T. for a new professorship at Harvard University, officials of both institutions said today. That switch would be a coup for Harvard, whose division of applied sciences has lagged well behind M.I.T., its neighbor down the Charles River.
Dr. Baltimore has accepted the presidency of Rockefeller University.
 
'The Right Choice'
The selection of Dr. Vest, 48 years old, still requires the approval of the full 65-member M.I.T. governing board, which is expected to meet in a special session in Cambridge next Monday, school officials said today.
A spokesman for the University of Michigan said Dr. Vest would have no comment until his confirmation. Dr. Vest has been provost and vice president for academic affairs there for 18 months. He was dean of engineering from 1986 to 1989, and was credited with helping develop a new $100 million industrial technology institute.
''M.I.T. made the right choice,'' said James J. Duderstadt, the president of the University of Michigan. He described Dr. Vest as a man of ''extraordinary vision and depth'' who is also ''very persuasive, with that rare ability to get people to do things by believing they want to do them.''
Dr. Duderstadt predicted that as president of M.I.T. Dr. Vest would emerge as a ''national spokesman for science and industry.'' He noted that Dr. Vest had developed close relations with leaders in both the automobile and aerospace industries.
Dr. Vest is one of a number of university presidents to come from the University of Michigan in the past few years. Harold Shapiro, who became president of Princeton University in 1988, had been president and before that provost at Michigan, and Linda Wilson was picked as president of Radcliffe College last year after being a vice president at Michigan.
 
'He Filled the Template'
Robert Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics and head of the M.I.T. faculty committee that helped pick a new president, said Dr. Vest was chosen because ''he filled the template of what an M.I.T. president should look like.''
Dr. Solow noted that Dr. Vest was both an engineer by training, which fits one of M.I.T.'s traditional strengths, and an experienced administrator. Michigan has 35,000 students, while M.I.T. has 10,000.
''I thought he was a reflective and thoughtful person with very broad academic sympathies, not just for engineering but for the humanities, social sciences and hard sciences,'' Dr. Solow said.
Dr. Vest has no previous connection with M.I.T., having received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from West Virginia University and master's and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan. Of M.I.T.'s 14 presidents, only three have had M.I.T. degrees, and six had no previous ties to the university either as students or as faculty members.
Dr. Vest is a specialist in three-dimensional imaging and image reconstruction, and has written a standard textbook, ''Holographic Interferometry.''
His experience with the manufacturing sector was also a factor in his selection, said Dr. Solow, because M.I.T. has taken an increasing interest in examining reasons for the decline in competitiveness of American industry.

HEADLINE: Home Economics Lives On

 BODY:
To The Living Section:
Marian Burros's point in her Eating Well column of May 9 [''Good health habits can reduce risks of hazards in food''] is timely and certainly important. However, Ms. Burros is erroneous in her comment about home-economics classes, which she claims ''appear to have gone to the way of automobile fins.'' 
Home-economics classes - which do indeed teach, among other vital information, rules of hygiene - are mandated in New York State at the junior high school level. They are alive and well in many high schools throughout the state, especially in New York City and on Long Island. In fact, students are able to major in home economics at the high school level and graduate not only with a Regents sequence and a diploma, but an immediately marketable skill.
Home economics offers not only the traditional foods-and-nutrition and clothing-and-textiles courses, but also majors in human development and family studies and in housing and environment. It is sad that a discipline as vital, timely and necessary as home economics is not recognized for the valuable function it can play in the overall education of the young person and thus is considered extinct by people who should know better.

HEADLINE: THE PURPOSEFUL COOK;
When the Weather Gets Hot, The Hot Decide to Make

BYLINE: By JACQUES PEPIN

 BODY:
THE question often arises by midafternoon at our house: ''What are we cooking for dinner?'' Sometimes my wife, Gloria, decides; sometimes I do. But when neither of us feels like eating much, and this happens often in hot weather, we usually end up with pasta. It is quick, easy, economical and always welcome.
Although we like pasta with fish and shellfish as well as meat, more often than not we eat it with herbs or vegetables. A refreshing all-vegetable menu is ideal hot-weather fare. Fresh vegetables and fruit are at their best, available in all markets and reasonably priced now.
If prepared in the winter, spaghetti with pesto would be quite costly, since it requires a lot of fresh basil and parsley. But in summer basil and parsley are free, if you have a garden of your own, and inexpensive to buy if you don't. I use a pound of spaghetti for six servings here, enough for a first course. To serve this as a main course, double the amount. 
This is also the time of year when zucchini is regularly featured at our table. One day we might have a salad of zucchini, another day fried zucchini sticks, sauteed zucchini with garlic, ratatouille with tomatoes, eggplant and zucchini, or the zucchini boats with herb stuffing that are part of the accompanying menu.
Stuffed zucchini can be served cold or hot. When cold, sharpen the flavor by garnishing it with additional oil or a little vinaigrette and fresh herbs just before serving; fresh basil, tarragon, parsley or chives are good choices in summer.
Zucchini boats can also be stuffed with a meat mixture. Leftover cooked meat or cold cuts can be chopped and added to the vegetable stuffing to extend it and make it heartier.
The melon dessert is excellent when ripe, juicy, fragrant melon is used. I used a large, heavy, yellowish (rather than green) cantaloupe with a pleasantly fruity smell. You can substitute honeydew or muskmelon for the cantaloupe. The most important requirement is ripeness; if you cannot find a ripe melon, use fresh, ripe peaches or plums instead. It is best to prepare this dessert ahead and let the fruit macerate in the sauce for a few hours in the refrigerator.
With this summer menu, I suggest a cold, flavorful white wine like a riesling from Alsace or a California sauvignon blanc.
 
The Season's Bounty in Three Dishes
 
Zucchini Boats With Herb Stuffing
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour 15 minutes
 
6 zucchini of equal size, about 3 pounds
2 tablespoons virgin olive oil, plus 2 to 3 tablespoons for garnish
1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped onions
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
 1/2 cup minced scallions
5 cups 1-inch cubes leftover bread
1 cup milk
 1/2 cup chopped herbs (chives, parsley or basil or a mixture of these) plus extra for garnish
 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 eggs
1 teaspoon salt
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Red-wine venegar for garnish (optional).
1.Wash zucchini, trim ends and cut in half lengthwise. Using a metal measuring tablespoon with sharp edges, hollow out the inside of the zucchini; remove most of the seeds and a little of the flesh so that the remaining hollows have a shell about 1/4-inch thick. There should be about 4 cups of flesh and seeds. Chop coarsely into 1/2-inch pieces and set aside.
2.Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet. When hot, add onions and saute for 4 to 5 minutes over medium-to-high heat. Add garlic, scallions and reserved zucchini flesh and saute for 10 to 15 seconds. Then cover and cook for 5 minutes over medium-to-high heat, until mixture is soft. Set aside.
3.Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
4.Add bread to milk and mix until most of the milk has been absorbed by the bread. Crush mixture to create a paste and add to it the chopped herbs, Parmesan cheese, cayenne, eggs, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and pepper. Mix well and add reserved zucchini mixture.
5.Arrange zucchini boats in a large roasting pan and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Mound equal portions of stuffing into the boats and place in oven. Cook for 30 to 35 minutes, then place under a hot broiler for 4 to 5 minutes to brown stuffing on top.
6.Serve hot, sprinkled with remaining 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil, or serve at room temperature, sprinkled with olive oil and additional herbs. If you prefer a more pungent taste, sprinkle a little vinegar on top before serving.
Yield: 6 servings.
 
Spaghetti With Pesto
 
Preparation time: 12 to 15 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
 
3 to 4 quarts water
 
For the pesto:
 
 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
 1/4 cup walnuts or pecans
5 cloves garlic, peeled
1 small jalapeno pepper, cut in half and seeded (optional)
1 cup parsley leaves (tightly packed)
2 cups basil leaves (moderately well packed)
 1/2 cup virgin olive oil
 
For the pasta:
 
1 pound thin spaghetti (No. 4)
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
Hot pepper flakes (optional)
Grated Parmesan cheese, for garnish.
1.Bring water to a boil in a pot. Meanwhile, to make the pesto, place Parmesan cheese, nuts, garlic and jalapeno pepper, if desired, in bowl of a food processor and process for about 30 seconds. Add parsley, basil and oil, and pulse a few times to mix the greens into the oil. Process for about 30 seconds, until the mixture is finely pureed. Yield should be about a cup. Set aside.
2.Add spaghetti and 1 teaspoon of the salt to the boiling water a few minutes before serving. Return to a boil and boil over high heat for 8 to 9 minutes until slightly al dente or as preferred. Using a measuring cup, remove a cup of the cooking liquid.
3.In a large bowl, mix reserved cooking liquid with pesto mixture. Drain pasta and add it to the sauce with the remaining salt and black pepper. Toss and serve immediately with hot pepper flakes, if desired, and grated Parmesan cheese.
Yield: 6 servings.
 
Melon With Orange and Rum
 
Preparation time: 10 minutes plus time for refrigeration
 
1 large ripe cantaloupe, honeydew or muskmelon (about 3 pounds)
 1/4 cup honey
 1/2 cup orange juice
3 tablespoons dark rum.
1.Cut melon in half and remove seeds. Cut each half into 4 wedges. Remove flesh from skin and cut each flesh slice into 5 pieces. There should be about 4 cups of melon pieces, each about 1 1/2 inches square.
2.In a bowl, combine honey, orange juice and rum. Add melon pieces and toss well to mix thoroughly. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until serving time.
Yield: 6 servings.
 
 
Summer Refreshment
 
Spaghetti With Pesto
Zucchini Boats With Herb Stuffing
Melon With Orange And Rum
 
 
Special Tip
WHEN making a pasta dish, many cooks wait until they have finished preparing the sauce before putting water on to boil for the pasta, even though it usually takes longer to bring the water to a boil than it does to make the sauce. Remember to put the pot of water on to boil when you begin making the sauce.
You can double or triple the pesto recipe here. It will keep for up to a week in the refrigerator and is very good over grilled fish or meat, as a delicious and healthful flavoring (instead of butter or sour cream) for baked potatoes, or as a topping for other pastas.
Be sure to cover the pesto with a piece of plastic wrap that touches the surface of the pesto. This will prevent it from discoloring excessively; there will still be some darkening on top, but this can be stirred into the pesto before serving.

A Doubleday Closing
An important chapter in New York bookselling history will end at 6 P.M. Saturday when the Doubleday Book Shop at 673 Fifth Avenue, at 53d Street, closes for good after 22 years in that location.
Doubleday's flagship store, at 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, remains open, continuing a tradition of at least one Doubleday book store on Fifth Avenue dating to April 1916. There are also Doubleday stores at Citicorp Center, at East 53d Street, the South Street Seaport and at 777 Third Avenue, at 49th Street.
But the store that will close was special. ''It was strong in books on the performing arts and architecture, and we did a spectacular business in fiction and mysteries,'' Gary P. DelVecchio, the president of Doubleday Book Shops, said. ''It was the store with most of our account customers, and it attracted more New Yorkers and out-of-towners than our other stores.'' 
Until a few years ago, its record department carried a large collection of show tunes and jazz albums, but declining sales forced that department to close.
''The combination of the fall-off in traffic, the increased rent and the fact that the store needed to be modernized made it impractical to keep it open,'' Mr. DelVecchio said. In fact, Doubleday Book Shops - now owned by the B.D.B. Corporation, which also owns Barnes & Noble and B. Dalton - planned to close the store two years ago, when its 20-year lease expired. It even put signs in the window to that effect, but at the last minute the lease was extended the lease for two years. This time, however, the closing is irrevocable.
 
Eastern Europe Pays
It is only a footnote to the East European story, but Hungary and Czechoslovakia have recently begun to pay royalties on at least some foreign literary properties, including those of John Steinbeck.
''It just started last month,'' Elaine Steinbeck, the author's widow, said this week. ''From Hungary I'm getting royalties for book sales and for the stage production 'Of Mice and Men,' and from Czechoslovakia I'm getting book royalties.''
What is important about the royalty payments, Mrs. Steinbeck said, is that ''they're a good sign of improving economic conditions in those countries.''
The Steinbeck estate - the author died in 1968 - used to receive royalties from Poland, Mrs. Steinbeck said, but those stopped several years ago. The Soviet Union never paid royalties despite the immense popularity of ''The Grapes of Wrath'' and other Steinbeck novels. ''They said their contracts with John were signed before they joined the international copyright convention,'' Mrs. Steinbeck said. But there have been recent inquiries from the Soviet Union about producing the stage version of ''The Grapes of Wrath.'' That adaptation won a Tony Award this month as the best play, and the novel, published more than 50 years ago, has been translated into 40 languages and still sells throughout the world.
Speaking about ''Of Mice and Men,'' Mrs. Steinbeck said: ''The sun never sets on that play. It plays somewhere in the world all the time.'' The best version she has seen was in Paris in 1975. ''I didn't think they had a clue about California or ranching,'' Mrs. Steinbeck said, ''but they played those characters exactly as John wrote them.''
 
Return of Thurber
In September, Donald I. Fine Inc. will reissue two books by James Thurber, ''The Thirteen Clocks'' and ''The Wonderful O,'' books originally published in 1950 and 1957.
''Part of the deal with the Thurber estate,'' David Gibbons, the associate editor, said, ''was that we had to do facsimiles, and any changes had to be approved by the estate and the original illustrator.''
Even after all those years, the illustrator, Marc Simont, still had the original art except for the cover of ''Clocks,'' and he did a new illustration for that. The Thurber estate approved, and the the Book-of-the-Month Club bought 5,000 copies of both titles.
 
Medical Ethics
Do terminally ill patients have a right to kill themselves? The debate is finding its way into books.
''Convictions,'' a posthumous collection of essays by Sidney Hook, to be published by Prometheus Books on June 29, includes an essay advocating legalizing voluntary euthanasia. And euthanasia and many other ethical questions are addressed in ''Ethics at the Bedside,'' edited by Charles M. Culver, a Dartmouth College book scheduled for publication in October. The essays are written by doctors, philosophers, theologians and a legal expert, all medical ethics consultants.

HEADLINE: Chrysler-Renault Project Is Ended

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 12

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation, which has lost several top executives in recent weeks, suffered another big disappointment today as an international joint venture with Renault, the French auto maker, fell apart.
Chrysler and Renault announced that they had jointly decided not to cooperate on a $500 million project to build a mini-Jeep to compete with the Suzuki Motor Company's Sidekick and Samurai and the General Motors Corporation's Geo Tracker. The vehicle would have been sold in Europe and the United States.
The two companies had considered assembling the vehicle in the United States and Europe and sharing the cost equally. Although no manufacturing site had been chosen in the United States, the partners announced in February, a year after the preliminary pact was signed, that they would build the vehicles at a vacant Renault plant in Valladolid, Spain, about 100 miles north of Madrid. 
Chrysler declined to elaborate on the reasons for the termination except to say that both sides believed it ''is no longer economically attractive.'' Chrysler said a distribution agreement under which Renault sells Jeep vehicles in Europe would not be affected.
A spokeswoman for Renault confirmed that a study by the two companies had concluded that an alliance was ''not feasible.''
It was not clear whether Renault's increasing involvement with Volvo A.B., the Swedish auto maker, affected the decision to drop the mini-Jeep project. Since the agreement with Chrysler was made, Renault and Volvo have agreed to a large-scale joint venture to build trucks in Europe.
Chrysler said it plans to continue with the project, code-named JJ for ''junior Jeep,'' and ''is reviewing various implementation alternatives,'' including a different partner. Chrysler has been negotiating with union and city officials in Toledo, Ohio, where it operates an assembly plant for full-size Jeeps, to build mini-Jeeps.
Chrysler and Renault had originally talked of starting production of the mini-Jeeps in 1992.
For Chrysler, pressing on alone with the project would be likely to raise the company's capital costs significantly at a time when the No. 3 auto maker's financial resources are already stretched. The company's sales have been soft and its market share in the United States has declined in the last year.
The company has also been jolted by a series of executive changes. Two weeks ago, Gerald Greenwald, vice chairman and heir apparent to Lee A. Iacocca, the company chairman, announced his resignation. The departure of Mr. Greenwald, who left to run UAL Inc., the parent of United Airlines, followed the defection of a vice president in charge of international business and the resignation of Chrysler's treasurer.
And on Monday, Bennett E. Bidwell, the chairman of Chrysler's automotive subsidiary, confirmed that he would retire at the end of the year for health reasons.
After Mr. Greenwald's announcement, Mr. Iacocca told Chrysler's board that he would stay on as chairman indefinitely and would begin working on a succession plan. His current management contract expires at the end of 1991.
Like its competitors, Chrysler has tried in the last two years to build a presence in Europe to balance its heavy reliance on the United States auto market. The Ford Motor Company and G.M. have recently had trouble making a profit in their United States operations, but have managed to balance those results with strong earnings in Europe.
Chrysler sold off its European operations more than a decade ago to raise cash. But it has an agreement with Steyr-Daimler-Puch A.G. to build mini-vans in Graz, Austria, beginning in 1991.
When Chrysler first announced the venture with Renault, Mr. Iacocca projected eventual sales of 100,000 mini-Jeeps a year in the United States and 50,000 in Europe.
''It's a wild car,'' Mr. Iacocca had said when the joint venture was first announced. ''It's a youth-oriented vehicle that will have appeal in many countries. Russian kids will like this, too.''
At the time, Mr. Iacocca had said the vehicle would be assembled using an innovative manufacturing technique, but he had declined to elaborate. Today, a spokesman said Chrysler is aiming to have its suppliers assemble parts into large subassemblies, which Chrysler workers would put together to create a whole vehicle. This modular-assembly process would require far fewer workers, perhaps as few as 300, compared with a few thousand in a conventional assembly plant, a spokesman said.
But so far, the sales of competitive vehicles suggest that the entire mini-Jeep market might not be as big as Chrysler had projected. ''Chrysler's goal of selling 100,000 was way too ambitious,'' said Christopher Cedergren of J. D. Power & Associates, a market research firm. ''The mini sport utility market is pretty dead right now.
''Most of the vehicles - the Suzuki Samurai, Geo Tracker and Suzuki Sidekick - are not suitable as a primary means of transportation. Even young people are reluctant to buy them for their primary car, because they're not very comfortable for long periods of time.''
Two years ago, the Suzuki Samurai was branded as unsafe by Consumer Reports magazine, a contention that Suzuki denied, and sales of the Samurai fell sharply. Since then, Suzuki and G.M. have teamed to build similar vehicles, the Sidekick and Tracker, that the companies say are inherently more stable than the Samurai because of their dimensions.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Unusual View On Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Joel Kurtzman

 BODY:
THE good news, say Robert J. Barro of Harvard University and Xavier Sala i Martin of Yale University, is that high interest rates are not bad for the economy. The even better news, say the two economists, is that the size of the Federal deficit doesn't matter.
Two surprising conclusions. According to conventional wisdom, high rates limit growth, slow investment, put a brake on economic activity and can lead to a recession. Today's high rates have already led to protests by home builders, who have seen sales fall, and to rumors of a rift between the Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve over interest-rate policy. 
The conventional wisdom also says that when the Federal Government borrows to finance the deficit or bail out savings and loan institutions, it competes for scarce capital in the domestic markets and drives rates up.
But if Professors Barro and Sala i Martin are right, the conventional wisdom is wrong.
Professors Barro and Sala i Martin have constructed an ingenious model that uses economic and financial data from the 10 major industrialized countries going back as far as 1952. The model simulates the effect of business activity on interest rates, adjusted for inflation, through a series of elaborate equations. The two economists constructed a world index of interest rates for the 10 countries they studied. With their model, they say they can forecast future real interest rates, which are defined as nominal rates less inflation.
The first conclusion from their continuing research, presented as a working paper, is that ''high real rates of interest reflect increased rather than diminished business opportunities,'' Professor Barro said. The conventional wisdom is that high rates slow business activity by making it more expensive to invest.
Their second finding is that American rates are strongly influenced by business conditions in the other countries surveyed and not just by domestic factors like the savings rate and Government borrowing. Interest rates in the United States seem especially sensitive to what is going on in the world's stock markets.
As the two scholars see things, the chain of logic runs as follows: good business conditions lead to higher stock market prices as investors looking for profit opportunities eagerly bid up stocks. And those higher prices suck in money from the rest of the economy. Interest rates go up as the demand for funds increases.
And the process goes on beyond national borders. Opportunities in one country influence rates in the next. ''Rising stock markets abroad mean rising interest rates in the United States,'' Professor Barro said. ''We were quite excited when we found this out.'' The two economists forecast an average interest rate of 5.5 percent, adjusted for inflation, in most of the industrialized world this year, falling to 4.7 percent by mid-decade as growth slows.
While Professors Barro and Sala i Martin generally see rising rates as a vigorous competition for investment funds and thus a sign of health, they concede that at some point high interest rates can choke off investment and lead to a recession. But that happens, Professor Barro said, ''when interest rates go up as a result of tight monetary policy.'' During the 1982 recession, for example, rates climbed ''because the Fed kept money tight.''
The two professors put little faith in low interest rates as a spur to growth. They say this should be clear from looking at recent events. In the 1970's, interest rates were very low because they were reflective of sluggish economic activity, a low stock market and little investment opportunity, they say. When rates picked up, later in the decade, it was because business activity also picked up.
What these findings mean for policy makers is that it would be a mistake to conclude that rising rates are bad for growth.
''Today's average real interest rate for the 10 countries we studied is the highest we have seen since the 1920's,'' Professor Barro said. But these high rates have been accompanied by a ''significant rise in investment in the 10 countries we studied, to levels not seen since the late 1960's. That's very bullish for growth.''
The model has been criticized because it is still only a preliminary effort and because it ''overstates how much economists really know about what moves interest rates,'' said Robert E. Lucas Jr., a professor of economics at the University of Chicago. ''Everyone knows that sometimes the stock and bond markets move in the same direction and that there appears to be a link,'' he said. ''But sometimes they don't.'' Professor Barro concedes that his efforts are still preliminary, but contends that the model has advanced economists' understanding of what moves rates. ''I'm going out on a limb, but I think we have found predictors of future rates,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Foreign Investors Held $2 Trillion in U.S. in '89

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Foreign investment in the United States rose to a record total of $2 trillion in 1989, up 12 percent from $1.786 trillion in 1988, according to preliminary statistics released today by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.
About a third of the $214.6 billion increase, or $72 billion, was in direct investments. These include foreign spending on factories, real estate, corporate takeovers and ownership of 10 percent or more of an American company. 
The remaining two-thirds of the increase in foreign holdings came from so-called portfolio investments, which include purchases of American corporate securities and Government bonds. Foreign investment now plays a very large role in financing the huge Federal budget deficit.
 
Fourfold Increase
Since 1980, foreign investment in the United States has increased fourfold, the report noted.
''Until the budget and trade deficits are brought under control, the U.S. will continue to rely on foreign capital,'' said Elliot L. Richardson, chairman of the Association for International Investment, which represents foreign investors.
Brad Larschan, a spokesman for the group, warned that today's report could ''exacerbate concern about foreign investment in the Congress and with the public generally.''
Three bills pending in Congress, including one proposed by the Bush Administration, would increase Government surveillance of foreign investments.
A recent report by the General Accounting Office has raised questions about the effect of foreign investment on national security. ''The basic question, as many have posed it, is whether the U.S. defense industrial base is being gradually 'hollowed out' as foreign investment takes place,'' the report said.
Supporters of foreign investment say that it provides the money needed to finance the deficit and support the stock market and that it provides jobs, management skills and technology. They say the ability of the United States to attract foreign investment reflects its strength in the global economy and improves Americans' understanding of foreign cultures.
Critics contend that the United States has become overly dependent on foreign capital, which could lead to an erosion of political and economic independence as decisions affecting Americans are increasingly made abroad. In addition, they say some foreign investors buy American companies to acquire their technology and damage their competitors.
Pat Choate, a vice president of the military contractor TRW Inc. and a leading critic of foreign investment, said the report showed that ''bit by bit we're surrendering control of our economy.''
While foreign direct investment increased by 22 percent in 1989, according to an analysis of the Commerce Department data by the Association for International Investment, American investments abroad increased by 9.7 percent, or $31.7 billion, raising its value to $358.6 billion.
 
British Remain in the Lead
The British continued to be the largest direct investors in America, with the Japanese remaining in second place. They were followed by the Dutch, Canadians, West Germans and French.
British investment increased by $20.2 billion, or nearly 20 percent, for a total of $122.1 billion, accounting for 30.5 percent of all direct foreign investment in the United States, according to the analysis of the Commerce Department data by Mr. Richardson's organization.
Japanese investment increased by $17.3 billion, or 32.4 percent, for a total of $70.6 billion, or 17.6 percent of all foreign direct investment.

ITT Reducing Its Stake in Alcatel

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The ITT Corporation said yesterday that it would sell 7 percent of Alcatel N.V. for $640 million.
The sale to France's Compagnie Generale d'Electricite will reduce ITT's ownership in Alcatel, a French telecommunications equipment manufacturer, to 30 percent. That is the level ITT sought to own in the 1986 negotiations on forming the joint venture with Compagnie Generale d'Electricite. To assure completion of the deal, which created the world's biggest maker of telecommunications equipment, ITT had agreed to take a 37 percent stake.
ITT said it would report an after-tax gain of about $139 million on the transaction, which is expected to close on June 14. The gain will be included in ITT's second-quarter earnings, the company said.
Shares of ITT rose $3.25 yesterday, to $60.625, on the New York Stock Exchange, ITT said proceeds would be used to buy additional shares of its common stock under the company's stock repurchase program, which began in 1987.
Rand V. Araskog, ITT's chairman and chief executive and also chairman of Alcatel's supervisory board, said ITT's investment in Alcatel has grown since the venture began.
''Our Alcatel shares have more than doubled in value in three years and our board of directors is pleased not only with this outstanding appreciation of our investment, but also with the positive working relationship developed between ITT and C.G.E.,'' he said.
Alcatel's growth has been spurred by economic development within the European Community and Eastern Europe. The creation of a single European marketplace in 1992 is expected to increase demand for Alcatel equipment.
ITT, based in New York, is primarily involved in the telecommunications field.

HEADLINE: Current Account Deficit Is Lowest in Six Years

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
The deficit in the broadest measure of United States trade shrank to $22.94 billion from January through March, the lowest quarterly imbalance in six years, the Commerce Department reported today.
The current account trade deficit narrowed by 14 percent in the first three months of the year, compared with a $26.69 billion deficit in the final three months of 1989.
The improvement was credited to a record level of sales of American products overseas, which helped to reduce the merchandise trade deficit. 
Domestic earnings on overseas investments and payments by foreigners for services like travel and tourism also played a part in reducing the current account imbalance.
 
Smallest Since 1984 Quarter
The first-quarter deficit was the smallest quarterly trade gap since a $20.5 billion deficit in the first quarter of 1984.
The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is the most closely watched trade statistic because it measures trade not only in merchandise but also in services and investments.
Even with the first-quarter improvement, the United States is beginning the new decade in a far different position than it began the 1980's. Ten years ago, the United States was the largest creditor nation. It ran surpluses in its current account as the earnings on overseas investments were enough to offset perennial deficits in merchandise trade.
But as Americans handed over billions of dollars to foreigners in payments for imported cars and television sets, the investment cushion eroded. It disappeared altogether in 1985, when the United States became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.
 
Loss of Control Seen
That means foreigners now own more in United States assets than Americans own overseas, a development that has led some to say that the country is losing control over its economic destiny.
Today's report indicates that the nation's debtor position has now risen to around $670 billion, although the Government's official account of the gap between American holdings and foreign investments will not be made until later this month.

HEADLINE: Japanese Trade Surplus Down

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 12

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus declined slightly in May, the 12th month in the last 13 during which the surplus narrowed from a year earlier, the Finance Ministry reported today.
The May surplus of $3.13 billion compared with $3.76 billion in May 1989. Exports fell nine-tenths of 1 percent from a year earlier, to $21.52 billion, while imports grew by 2.4 percent, to $18.38 billion.
Economists said a slowing in the rate of declines in exports indicated that the yen's recent weakness might cause a renewed buildup in the surplus.
They added that slower growth in the domestic economy might be depressing imports. A cheaper yen makes Japanese goods more competitive in price overseas.
''I'm confident that possibly as early as July we could see a widening in Japan's trade surplus,'' said Jesper Koll of S. G. Warburg Securities.
 
In trade with the United
States, Japan's surplus shrank to $2.44 billion in May from $2.76 billion a year earlier.
Japanese companies exported $6.82 billion worth of goods to the United States in May, down 4.5 percent from a year earlier.
Imports from the United States fell by two-tenths of 1 percent, to $4.38 billion.
 
Japan's surplus with the
European Community shrank to $1.2 billion, from $1.63 billion in May 1989.

HEADLINE: Japan Criticized on Trade Progress

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
The Senate Finance Committee's ranking specialists in trade policy expressed concern today that Japan was not living up to promises to open its economy and warned that Congress ''may have no choice'' but to respond with retaliatory legislation.
They were reacting to reports that progress had stopped in negotiations on the Structural Impediments Initiative with Japan, which calls for more public investment, stiffer anti-monopoly enforcement, streamlined retail distribution and other measures to make the Japanese economy more receptive to imports.
The Senators said in a letter to Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, that Congress was ''very concerned about the state of the U.S.-Japan trade relationship.''
 
Signed by Leaders
The letter was signed by the Democratic chairman of the Finance Committee's Subcommittee on Trade, Max Baucus of Montana, and by the ranking Republicans on both the full committee and trade subcommittee, Bob Packwood of Oregon and John C. Danforth of Missouri. 
The Finance Committee's chairman, Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, issued a separate statement accusing the Japanese of ''stonewalling'' and warning Japan that he and other members of his committee ''will insist that more be done.''
Such harsh statements by members of Congress on trade matters are not unusual, given their sensitivity to the complaints of their business constituents. In recent years, Congress has taken the lead in forging trade policy toward Japan and other countries.
In response to today's comments, the economic minister at Japan's Embassy here, Hiroshi Hirabayashi, insisted that his Government ''is making utmost efforts to put flesh on the bones'' of the sought-after changes under the structural initiative.
''We would hope that Congress, instead of constantly speaking of retaliation and threats of retaliation, would move in more constructive ways for the betterment of the U.S.-Japan relationship,'' he said.
 
Effect on the Deficit
The hope of Congress and Administration officials is that opening Japan to more imports from the United States would help shrink what last year was a $49 billion American trade deficit with Japan, though some experts doubt that the changes would affect the deficit significantly, at least not immediately.
The two Governments produced an interim report last April 5 that seemed to resolve most of the basic issues. But now American negotiators say the talks are not going well.
''The Japanese want the clock to stop after the interim report,'' said a senior American trade official who asked not to be identified. ''Our meetings have come up snake eyes.''
He stressed, however, that the talks had not broken down and that both sides were still scheduled to meet in Tokyo on June 25 to try to conclude a report. But he acknowledged that if the final report did not broaden Japanese commitments and establish specific monitoring mechanisms, it could be a ''big political problem'' for the Bush Administration.
 
A July Deadline
The final report, outlining specifics on government spending, antitrust enforcement and other issues, is supposed to be completed by the time President Bush next sees Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu at the Houston economic summit meeting of seven industrial nations next July 9.
It was on the basis of the broad promises of the interim report, as well as a series of specific market-opening agreements involving supercomputers, satellites and other products, that President Bush on April 27 dropped Japan from a list of countries that could become subject to reprisal tariffs because of unfair trade practices. At that time, many lawmakers said it was premature to ease the pressure on Japan before the final report had been completed.
In their letter, the Senators said that although Japan had repeatedly agreed to work to eliminate its current account surplus, some Japanese Government officials were now arguing that the Japanese surpluses could be sustained indefinitely at very high levels.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Next Challenge for Solar Power: Cheaper Cells

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FREDERICK, Md.

 BODY:
Scientists have been continually improving photovoltaic cells by raising the amount of electricity they produce from a given amount of sunlight. Now, industry experts say, progress in the technology of manufacturing is at least as important as gains in the lab in the struggle to make the cells more competitive in cost with conventional ways of making electricity.
Much of the production, which has a lot in common with the manufacture of computer chips, still takes place in rooms that are not automated and look more like workshops than factories. Costs are high, because the materials must often be applied in many steps, and the components can be contaminated by a fingerprint. 
Automation can solve these problems and reduce costs, but it is difficult to justify for a product with a market that is limited, at least at today's prices. But growing sales volume is encouraging progress. Primarily by using industrial robots, the Solarex Corporation's factory here turns out cells with one-third the manpower of three years ago. Another Solarex plant is automating the complicated task of producing ''thin film'' cells that use less costly materials in small amounts.
 
Studying Ease of Fabrication
Other manufacturers are considering the ease of manufacturing when developing designs for cells. Some are expanding production, and in the process are discovering efficiencies that cut the cost per unit.
Photovoltaic cells use the energy in sunlight to shake loose electrons from atoms of silicon or other materials. The electron, with a negative charge, and the atom that gave it up, with a positive charge, migrate to separate terminals, creating an electric current. The technology, which was born in 1954 and got its first big boost from the space program, has found growing applications in everything from wristwatches and hand-held calculators to remote microwave communications relays and navigation buoys.
But photovoltaic power is still far too expensive to compete with coal or even oil for making electric power in the amounts useful to utilities. Electricity from solar power still costs more than 25 cents a kilowatt-hour; residential customers in the United States pay an average of about 10 cents.
Costs have fallen, however, because the efficiency of the cells - the ratio of the energy deposited as sunlight to the electricity produced -has risen to 28 percent from 6 percent for the first silicon crystal cells. Thin-film cells, a more recent development made by applying to glass small amounts of materials that convert light to electricity, have achieved efficiencies of 15.6 percent in the lab and are competing successfully with crystalline cells because they are cheaper to produce.
In fact, it is production cost, rather than wattage per square foot, that is developing as the key variable, industry officials say.
''You're seeing the focus going from the lab, on being science-driven, to being one where, if we're going to succeed, we're going to be good at manufacturing,'' said John Corsi, the president of Solarex, a subsidiary of the Amoco Corporation of Chicago and the largest American-owned photovoltaic producer.
Indeed, the Bush Administration has proposed a $43 million budget for solar research next year, up from $35.5 million this year and the first increase in eight years. Nearly all of the increase would go into studying the technical roadblocks to multiplying the scale of production, said Scott Sklar, executive director of the Solar Energy Industries Association, in Washington.
''You could probably lower the cost of photovoltaic modules a lot more easily in dealing with the manufacturing approach than in worrying about the efficiencies of the modules,'' Mr. Sklar said.
But Kenneth B. Zweibel, the manager of polycrystalline thin film research at the Solar Energy Research Institute, a Government-supported laboratory near Denver, pointed out that makers do not even agree on the ingredients for the product whose fabrication they are trying to improve. In addition to silicon, in crystals or in an amorphous, non-crystalline state, companies are aggressively researching materials including copper indium diselenide, gallium arsenide and cadmium telluride. All function by having light energy shake loose electrons, but they differ in efficiency and longevity.
The choice of materials can be influenced by problems in manufacturing, said Scott P. Albright, vice president of Photon Energy Inc., a young company in El Paso. Photon is working to bring to market its first cell, made of cadmium telluride. Nearly all of the steps involved are performed at atmospheric pressure, so capital costs are only one-tenth those of amorphous silicon, the dominant thin-film cell, which requires that some steps be conducted in a vacuum, Mr. Albright said.
The cost of fabrication is also the key factor at the Solarex factory here, according to officials. Much work has been done, and continues, on the recipe for making silicon blocks from which the polycrystalline cells are made. But another problem is turning the blocks into wafers.
 
Large Amount of Waste
The old method is to use a saw to slice wafers, one by one, that are 12 mils, or 12-thousandths of an inch, thick. Thinner wafers would work as well, but the saw cannot cut them. Worse, using a saw turns half of the block into a sawdust-like waste.
The company has recently begun to use as a saw a thin steel wire wrapped scores of times around a block, to slice the whole brick simultaneously. It makes wafers that are only 7 to 8 mils thick, with 20 to 25 percent less waste.
The silicon accounts for only 8.5 percent of the cost of the finished cell, but making the technology competitive with oil will mean increasing the efficiency of every step, company officials say.
At another plant, in Newtown, Pa., the company is pursuing another strategy: thin-film cells. Here, materials cost is not really an issue; half the cost is in the ordinary window glass on which the cell is built. But engineers are putting finishing touches on an automated production line that would turn out cells with a capacity of one megawatt a year, with four workers a shift, and have begun assembling parts for a line that would turn out 10 megawatts a year with the same number of workers.
The next step, said Dr. David E. Carlson, a thin-film pioneer who is in charge of the project, is a 100-megawatt line, which would cost only triple the model one-tenth as large. That development might require putting the plant adjacent to a glass factory, to achieve economies of scale.
Even the large plant would be of modest size by the standards of the utility industry; a single large coal plant produces 600 megawatts, and a nuclear reactor may produce 1,100. But the scale is huge by the standards of the photovoltaic industry, for which total worldwide production last year was only about 40 megawatts.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Pound Rises Sharply As the Dollar Ends Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed yesterday as the soaring British pound attracted the most attention, reaching a four-month high against the American currency in European trading.
Gold prices fell after rising overseas.
Currency dealers said dollar trading was slow and in a narrow range in advance of several economic reports scheduled for release later this week. 
The market is hoping that the Government reports on May retail sales, April merchandise trade and May consumer and producer prices, among others, will shed more light on the direction of the United States economy, traders said.
Most of the market's interest yesterday was focused on a rush to buy sterling.
The pound rose against other currencies and reached a four-month high against the dollar in Europe on reports that Britain plans full membership in the European Monetary System within a year.
The Financial Times reported yesterday that Treasury officials expect Britain's underlying annual inflation rate to be low enough toward the end of the year to include the pound in the monetary system.

New Sports Complex for Cleveland

BYLINE: By Jennifer Stoffel

DATELINE: CLEVELAND

 BODY:
THIS city is moving ahead with an ambitious plan to have its new baseball stadium and basketball arena ready for the 1994 season, after voters approved an excise tax to help finance the downtown sports complex.
To be constructed on a 28-acre site a few blocks from Public Square, Cleveland's center, the new Gateway complex is expected to encourage downtown redevelopment and extend the urban center south to the main highway exits, an area long considered urban fringe.
The complex is expected to draw an additional two million people downtown each year and increase the city's attractiveness as a convention center. 
''Back in 1980, we identified the area as the most visible gateway to the city and we asked if this is so important, why does it look so bad?'' said Hunter Morrison, Cleveland's planning director. ''It sets a bad impression of the city.''
The Gateway project will have a $128 million open-air stadium for the Cleveland Indians. The 45,000-seat baseball stadium will be expandable to 72,000 seats for football games. The project will also have a $75 million 20,000-seat indoor arena for the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team. It will be used for hockey games as well.
As part of a long-term effort to redevelop the southern edge of downtown, an additional $35 million will be spent to acquire property surrounding the complex. Preliminary proposals for the site include office, retail and hotel development.
The development and operation of the project will be managed by the Gateway Corporation, a nonprofit company.
The push for a new stadium, which began in the mid-1980's, has been readily embraced by business executives interested in creating a more profitable city center. But it has been more difficult to sell the project to the public. A 1984 referendum to raise property taxes to help finance a plan for a domed stadium was defeated by a 2-to-1 margin.
On May 8, however, voters in Cleveland and the rest of Cuyahoga County approved by a narrow margin a new excise tax on cigarettes and alcohol that is expected to raise $150 million over the next 15 years. Additional money for the sports complex will be raised from the sales of luxury seating.
Local investors have also promised up to $20 million through a development partnership backed by Cleveland Tommorrow, a business group. The Gateway Corporation has until the end of the year to have the financing in place in order to meet a Federal deadline for tax-exempt bonds.
For its part, the State of Ohio gave its support with a $4 million loan granted in 1985 to help buy the land. The site was assembled over two years by the Greater Cleveland Domed Stadium Corporation, which has since gone out of business. Demolition of selected buildings began in 1987; much of the site is currently used for parking lots.
While owners of the Indians and the Cavaliers have both agreed to negotiate 20-year leases with the Gateway Corporation, no terms have yet been reached. And the long-term fate of the 59-year-old lakefront Municipal Stadium, current home of the Cleveland Indians and Browns, is still uncertain.

MOSCOW LOOSENS ECONOMIC SANCTION AGAINST LITHUANIA

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 13

 BODY:
The Soviet Government eased one of its economic sanctions against Lithuania today as an encouragement for negotiations to begin over the rebellious republic's attempt to thrive independent of Moscow.
The Kremlin move, announced at a meeting with Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene of Lithuania, amounted to a relatively modest increase in fuel for a single fertilizer factory in the republic.
But it was important as a gesture of the Gorbachev Government's eagerness to back down from the three-month sovereignty crisis and negotiate a solution. [In Washington, the United States hailed Moscow's reported decision to ease its economic sanctions against Lithuania, and President Bush called President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's talks with Baltic leaders a ''significant change'' that could help end the Baltic crisis. Page A18.] Restoring Some Faith Mrs. Prunskiene held exploratory talks with a Soviet delegation led by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who announced the slight easing in the fuel embargo. Later she said, ''This meeting allowed us to have more faith in one another. It is very obvious they do want negotiations to begin.'' 
She emphasized, however, that the Lithuanian Government would have to settle the basic question of whether it might suspend or ease some of its independence measures, a conciliatory step the Kremlin wants as a condition for ending the sanctions and starting full-scale negotiations on the future relations between the republic and the central Government.
 
Pledge to Double Supply
Mr. Ryzhkov promised to double the limited amount of natural gas that is being piped to the Lithuanian fertilizer factory at Jonava, Lithuanian officials said. The increase of 3.5 million cubic meters of gas would raise the plant to 30 percent of capacity, a spokeswoman for the Lithuanian Government said, and would put about 1,600 plant employees back to work.
Mr. Ryzhkov said he had told Mrs. Prunskiene that ''great opportunities'' will open if they accept the idea of ''freezing'' the independence resolutions ''not to annul them'' but to get negotiations under way.
''There has been progress,'' he said. ''We have made our step, now it's up to them to make theirs.''
In Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, President Vytautas Landsbergis also reacted with optimism, telling Lithuania's Parliament that his conversation in Moscow on Tuesday with Mr. Gorbachev had been ''concrete, constructive and, I should say, even friendly.''
''This can be regarded as a good sign showing an obvious desire to solve the problem, not to make us yield to the one who is stronger but to find a way out acceptable to both sides,'' he said, adding that the Soviet Government seemed interested in ending the economic sanctions ''as soon as possible'' by the two sides taking ''simultaneous steps'' toward each other.
 
Moving Toward a Solution
The mood about the sovereignty crisis has shifted in recent days, with President Gorbachev laying out new terms to invite negotiations and Lithuanian officials offering indications, in turn, that they expected an end soon to the economic sanctions and progress toward some sort of compromise.
But this was not the outcome of the one-hour-forty-five-minute meeting at the Kremlin. Mrs. Prunskiene said the next step would be to present Mr. Gorbachev's latest proposals to the Lithuanian Council of Ministers on Saturday, and eventually take them up in the republic's parliament and craft counter proposals for the Kremlin.
Rita Dapkus, a Lithuanian spokeswoman, quoted the Prime Minister as saying after the meeting that ''now we are pretty clear on the position the Soviet Government takes, which makes it much easier for us to know where we go from here.''
Most recently Mr. Gorbachev has talked of a new Soviet federation that would treat all Soviet republics as ''sovereign states'' with considerable control over their own affairs. He has seemed amenable to Lithuania's latest offer to place a moratorium during a period of negotiations on all actions taken since its declaration of independence, made March 11.
 
One Concrete Promise
In initially trying to contain the sovereignty movement that is sweeping through the Soviet republics, Mr. Gorbachev reacted to Lithuania's declaration of independence by imposing economic sanctions including a tough but not complete fuel blockade and embargoes on a few other commodities, resulting in closings at many factories in the republic of 3.4 million people and widespread hardships like gas shortages.
In the talks today, the Lithuanian Prime Minister had brought up the possibility of easing the embargo on crude oil supplies to the republic, her office said after the meeting. But Prime Minister Ryzhkov replied that subject was much larger and no decision could be made as yet, and instead promised to increase the gas supply to the fertilizer plant.
''That's the only concrete thing he promised,'' Mrs. Prunskiene said after the meeting, according to her office.
Her office could not immediately confirm reports in the Soviet press that she had enthusiastically declared after the meeting that the supply embargo would be eased for several other Lithuanian enterprises.
Interfax, a quasi-independent Soviet press agency, quoted the Lithuanian Prime Minister as saying of the Soviet Government after the meeting: ''We do not doubt that it is ready to lift the economic blockade. This was said very concretely, so we have the opportunity to act and open contacts with the Government.''
Her office said one ''model'' of the future outlined in the Soviet proposals was that of taking part with ''special status'' in a new future Soviet federation. Her office said she thought this model could not immediately be discussed because the republic would need to know more about the future look of the Soviet Union, particularly in consideration of the republic's determination to set up trade and travel contacts with the West.

HEADLINE: BONN WELCOMES NEW SOVIET SHIFT

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, June 13

 BODY:
West German officials today welcomed as ''fundamentally positive'' President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's latest remarks on Germany, describing them as a softening of the Soviet position on a unified Germany's status but again rejecting the suggestion of dual alliance membership.
Mr. Gorbachev, speaking to the Soviet Parliament on Tuesday in Moscow, said that after German unification West German troops could remain in NATO without a corresponding role for the East Germans in the Warsaw Pact, and suggested that East Germany retain a vaguely defined ''associate membership'' in the Warsaw Pact while it honors all obligations inherited from the two Germanys.
While officials reiterated Bonn's continuing opposition to membership in both organizations, a West German Government official said: ''Mr. Gorbachev's suggestion is not really new, but coming at this time it confirms that the Soviet position remains open and flexible, that we have not heard the last word. While they have shifted their stance a bit over the past few months, it is fundamentally positive that Mr. Gorbachev now views German membership in NATO as possible.'' 
 
New Germany, New Alliances
Still to be worked out, he added, are the conditions of German membership in NATO. ''That will be the focus of the upcoming two-plus-four talks,'' he said, referring to negotiations on German reunification involving East and West Germany, and the four World War II victors: Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States.
The Soviet Union and the Western allies are currently at loggerheads over Germany's military affiliation after unification. West Germany is a member of the United States-dominated NATO alliance, while East Germany belongs to the Warsaw Pact and has about 420,000 Soviet troops stationed on its soil.
West Germany, the United States and other major NATO countries want a united Germany to remain in NATO, while the Soviet Union opposes exclusive NATO membership and is seeking the creation of a new ''security order'' in Europe.
 
Preliminary Talks
The ''two-plus-four'' Foreign Ministers are scheduled to meet in East Berlin on June 22. In preparation for that gathering, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany and his Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, held talks on reunification on Monday in Brest, in Soviet Byelorussia. The two men will meet again next week.
Mr. Gorbachev's suggestion of German membership in both alliances was immediately rejected by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and other Western leaders.
''This is a proposal we do not consider realistic,'' Mr. Kohl said. ''I find that proposal unacceptable because it completely misunderstands the purpose and foundations of NATO.'' President Bush also reiterated that a united Germany must belong to the alliance without conditions.
 
Shifting Soviet Position
A NATO spokesman also dismissed the Soviet proposal for membership in both organizations, saying: ''Among other problems, the ideas of associate membership of a united Germany in both alliances, or of dual membership, do not seem promising to pursue. A united Germany must have the right, recognized in the Helsinki Final Act, to choose to be a party to a treaty of alliance, without the establishment of constraints on its sovereignty.''
Many Western analysts believe the shifting Soviet stance on the question of alliance membership for a unified Germany is primarily meant to extract the best possible terms for the Soviet Union as it relinquishes control over East Germany and Eastern Europe.
Economic assistance from West Germany appears to be one of the main Soviet objectives. The Soviet Union would like assurances that a united Germany will fulfill the long-term contracts that it has signed over the years with East Germany. In addition, it is believed to be pushing for a dramatic increase in West German financial, scientific and technological aid.

Bush Sees 'Significant Change' in Baltic Standoff

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
The United States today hailed Moscow's reported decision to ease its economic sanctions against Lithuania, and President Bush called President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's talks with Baltic leaders a ''significant change'' that could help end the Baltic crisis.
Mr. Bush and other White House officials have avoided commenting on developments in Moscow's test of wills with Lithuania over the Lithuanian declaration of independence. But after two weeks of pressure from Congress on Mr. Bush's decision to sign a new trade agreement with Mr. Gorbachev despite the continued stalemate over Lithuanian independence, the White House welcomed the latest developments in Moscow with a markedly upbeat assessment.
Mr. Bush took a few minutes at the start of a news conference with regional news organizations to read a statement in which he seemed to allude to the political pressures of the Lithuanian stalemate. 
Referring to Mr. Gorbachev's meeting on Tuesday with President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania, President Anatolijs Gorbunovs of Latvia and President Arnold Ruutel of Estonia, Mr. Bush said, ''I was very, very pleased to see this occur in the wake of what I think was a successful summit meeting.''
 
Push to Upgrade Trade Status
He said: ''We applaud Mr. Gorbachev's meeting with the Baltic Presidents. For some time, we've urged a peaceful resolution of this confrontation, one that will result in dialogue, negotiation if you will, and lifting of this economic blockade against Lithuania. And so I hope that what we saw yesterday is a first step in a dialogue that will lead to the self-determination that we strongly support.''
Mr. Bush spoke before the White House learned of today's reported decision by the Soviet Union to ease slightly its economic sanctions against Lithuania. He refused to answer questions about the report during a subsequent photo session in the Oval Office.
Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, said: ''We welcome this announcement. Together with the beginning of the dialogue yesterday, these are positive steps.''
But Administration officials were more reserved in private, saying there were conflicting reports about how far Moscow was willing to go to ease its economic sanctions. ''We are not yet willing to say this is the end of the crisis,'' an official said.
Congressional response to the news from Moscow was mixed. Senator George J. Mitchell, the Majority Leader, who has been critical of Mr. Bush's signing of the trade agreement, said he was heartened by news reports from Moscow.
 
'This Smacks of Propaganda'
Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance subcommittee on international trade, which will be the first stop in the Senate for the new trade agreement, said, ''Today's dramatic events make it clear that it is time'' to grant favorable trade treatment to the Soviet Union.
''The President showed great vision in signing a trade agreement with the Soviet Union a few weeks ago,'' he said. ''Now it is time to make good on the commitments in that agreement.''
But Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who has been one of the most vociferous Congressional critics of Mr. Bush's Lithuania policy, disputed the reports from the Soviet Union.
He said he had been ''pleased and delighted'' at first by news that Moscow would ease its economic blockade of Lithuania. But he said he spoke by telephone with Mr. Landsbergis late in the afternoon and was told that such an agreement ''had not been solidified.''
He said, ''This smacks of propaganda when what we need now is not propaganda from the Soviets, but action.''
 
Pact and Soviet Emigration Law
Administration officials said they hoped movement in the Lithuania stalemate would ease Congressional opposition to the trade agreement, which Mr. Bush said he would not submit until the Soviet Union enacts a new emigration law that is a precondition for broadening trade ties. But they said they had received no assurances from Mr. Gorbachev during his visit to Washington that a breakthrough was imminent.
Indeed, the official said the talks with the Baltic leaders came a little sooner than some American analysts had anticipated.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Measure to Protect Alaskan Forest

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
Seeking to strike a compromise between environmentalists and the timber industry, the Senate overwhelmingly approved legislation today to prohibit logging on 673,000 acres of pristine Alaskan land in the Tongass National Forest.
The bill would also discourage logging in other areas of the forest by modifying contracts with local pulp mills that had allowed them to buy trees at well below market price.
But the Senate measure, approved 99 to 0, did not leave either environmentalists or Alaskan timber industry executives happy. Both sides will be looking anxiously to see what version emerges when lawmakers meet in conference to work out differences between the Senate bill and a House-approved measure that calls for much stronger action to protect the Tongass..
The House bill, approved last year, designated 1.8 million acres of the forest as a wilderness area where no roads or any commercial development, including logging, could be established. The measure would also cancel long-term logging contracts in the Tongass and subject future timber sales to competitive bidding. 
 
Effort to Save Jobs
The Senate bill was devised as a compromise aimed at preserving jobs. It bars logging from a much smaller area, 673,000 acres, and would allow some limited commercial activity like mining.
The Tongass, the largest national forest in the United States, is the last major expanse of temperate rain forest in North America. Protection of the forest, which occupies an area the size of West Virginia, has been a major priority of environmentalists. They argue that it is inconsistent for the United States to criticize Brazil for the destruction of its rain forest while allowing overharvesting of trees from the Tongass.
''We are no longer embarrassed,'' said Senator Tim Wirth, a Colorado Democrat who was a major proponent of the Senate bill. ''Last year I was in Brazil and met with President Jose Sarney, and the first thing he said was, What about the Tongass?''
But the debate did not turn on purely environmental issues. There were also concerns about the loss of jobs in Alaskan cities like Sitka and Ketchikan, whose economies are heavily dependent on logging, and some Alaskan legislators resented what they see as the dictates of outsiders.
''Alaska is an area that's remote and easy to attack,'' said Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska. ''Any time someone wants to prove they're an environmentalist, they go to Alaska and get another area declared a wilderness.''
Both environmentalists and timber industry officials expressed concern today about what would emerge from the House-Senate conference.
 
Not Jumping for Joy
''To put it bluntly, we're not exactly jumping up and down with joy,'' said Rollo Pool, manager of public relations of the Alaska Pulp Corporation, one of the two mills operating in the region. ''We're not excited with the Senate version and even less excited with the House version. If we had our choice we would have preferred no bill. But, looking at the political realities, that is not a real choice. We have to wait and see if the conference will leave us enough scraps to live on.''
Environmentalists, who strongly supported the House bill, were critical of the Senate version. Bart Koehler, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, said, ''The Senate bill doesn't protect enough lands, doesn't designate them as wilderness, doesn't include as tough a buffer zone provision as the House passed bill, and doesn't terminate the long-term contracts.''
Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who is a chief proponent of the House bill, expressed confidence that most issues could be resolved in conference, but he added, ''It's clear there are going to be difficult decisions.''
The dispute over the Tongass underlines the continuing debate over the extent to which pristine lands should be used for commercial benefit or left in their natural state. It also focuses attention on the policies of the Forest Service, which critics contend has emphasized logging interests in the national forests at the expense of other uses like commercial fishing and tourism.
At the heart of the dispute is the Tongass itself, which at 16.7 million acres occupies about 85 percent of southeastern Alaska. In 1980 Congress designated 5.4 million acres of the forest as wilderness. The Tongass, which has stands of Sitka spruce that are more than 800 years old, provides a home for more than 400 species of wildlife, fish and shellfish, including the world's highest concentration of bald eagles and grizzly bears.
 
Guarantee of a Profit
The provision of the Senate bill involving the pulp mills would revise an arrangement made in the 1940's and 1950's, when the Forest Service granted 50-year contracts to two companies that promised to build pulp mills in southeastern Alaska. In exchange for building the mills, the companies were guaranteed long-term supplies of timber from the Tongass. To promote economic activity in the area, whose remote location has often made logging only marginally profitable, the Forest Service maintained pricing policies for timber in the forest that guaranteed the two companies a profit.
One company, Alaska Pulp, which is owned by a consortium of Japanese companies, pays the Federal Government as little as $1.48 per thousand board feet for the right to cut trees in the Tongass. Species of trees native to the Tongass now fetch more than $200 per thousand board feet on the open market. About 50 percent of the trees harvested in the forest are turned into pulp, much of it exported to Japan for use in clothing products, including disposable diapers.
The Senate bill directs the Forest Service to negotiate timber sales to the two pulp mills taking into account prevailing market conditions.

HEADLINE: Tough Test in Peru

 BODY:
In just 10 weeks, Alberto Fujimori has rocketed from obscurity to Peru's presidency. The speed of his ascent shows. Though confronted with staggering problems, he has yet to produce a serious program. His inauguration is due next month; there's no time for delay. Other Latin countries and the United States have a stake in his success. Unfortunately, they can't offer much direct help. 
The principal U.S. connection is coca leaf, of which Peru is the world's largest producer. The Bush Administration proposes a military program to support Peruvian eradication and interdiction efforts. Mr. Fujimori argues that the U.S. could more usefully help by supporting economic programs to promote crop substitution.
His preference makes sense as drug policy and addresses Peru's economic plight. Inflation now runs at more than 2,000 percent. Less than one Peruvian in five is fully employed. But there is no realistic chance that the U.S. or Japan, Mr. Fujimori's ancestral homeland, can bankroll a painless recovery. Mr. Fujimori won by promising less-harsh economic adjustment measures than his rival, Mario Vargas Llosa. He still has to offer persuasive details. Yet he risks alienating his political base if he cannot produce.
That base includes the urban and rural poor, small-business owners, Protestant evangelicals and others outside the traditional elite. Peruvian democracy owes its survival to these groups' resistance to the Maoist message of Shining Path.
Shining Path terror and army counterinsurgency drives have cost 17,000 lives in the last decade. Mr. Fujimori says the answer is social reform. Probably so, but his predecessor, Alan Garcia, said the same thing five years ago to no visible effect.
Washington can serve American interests by helping Mr. Fujimori finance a reasonable coca crop substitution program. It can also provide military and police training, if wanted, and steady political support. Mr. Fujimori could yet succeed where his recent predecessors have failed. But he will need to be bold and tough; effective help from without requires effective leadership from within.

Migrant Labor: The McShuttle To the Suburbs

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Ramona Hardy, a 17-year-old Bronx high school student, needs more money to help support her young son.
Perry Morgan Jr., a 30-year-old unemployed messenger, hopes to earn tuition for a cooking school.
Zeke Minaya, 18, works as a bank data processor during the day and wants a night job to supplement his college scholarship. Charles Chestnut, 16, is saving up for a car. The four Bronx residents were among 27 people waiting at 2 P.M. Tuesday in the smoking section of a McDonald's restaurant on White Plains Road near Allerton Avenue to fill out peach-colored job applications served up by a McDonald's manager, Jean Paul Baptiste. 
Nearly seven hours later, Mr. Baptiste had interviewed 131 applicants who had been lured by advertisements that promised immediate hiring for all shifts and by the prospect, unstated, of premium pay.
They also promised free round-trip transportation - less a perquisite than a requirement for most people who answered the advertisements because the restaurant Mr. Baptiste manages is not the one on White Plains Road in the northeast Bronx, but another, also owned by the Trefz Corporation, about 25 miles away on the Connecticut Turnpike in Darien.
Connecticut traditionally has imported migrant labor for its apple orchards and dwindling tobacco fields. Increasingly, though, service businesses in the region around New York City are confronting a labor shortage by aggressively recruiting in the city, where unemployment is about double the 3 percent or so in Stamford, Conn., Middlesex County, N.J., and Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
And some of those businesses provide or subsidize round-trip transportation.
 
Those Fairfield
County McDonald's owned by Trefz have been described as the chain's only restaurants that routinely import employees by bus. But other companies offer their own version of the McShuttle.
The Andover Nursing Home in Sussex County, N.J., brings workers by van from Port Jervis in Orange County, N.Y., about 25 miles away. The Trump Taj Mahal hotel and casino in Atlantic City recruited employees from Washington, Gary, Ind., and Camden, N.J. (as well as Europe and Puerto Rico), relocated many of them and subsidizes commuting costs for those workers who come by train from Cherry Hill, N.J.
In many places, the problem of a dwindling labor pool, particularly among young people, is compounded not only by the lack of affordable housing nearby but also by inadequate public transportation.
''The biggest job increases in the region in recent years,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, ''have been in less developed areas like Putnam and Sussex Counties.''
Labor shortages have abated in some suburbs because service industries are growing more slowly and the jobless rate is rising in response to the Northeast's sluggish economy.
''McDonald's was paying $6, $7, even $8 an hour,'' said C. Richard Ficks, a spokesman for Connecticut's Labor Department. ''Now they're back to $4.50 to $5'' - apparently still more than in the Bronx. Officials of McDonald's and Trefz politely declined to give wage differentials, but a call to two of their restaurants found that the same entry-level evening job that pays $4 an hour in the Bronx pays $4.75 an hour in Connecticut.
In Connecticut, the unemployment rate climbed to 5.6 percent in April from 3.3 percent a year ago. Declining tax revenues, meanwhile, crimped seasonal jobs at pools and playgrounds operated by local governments.
Rather than being buffeted by periodic fluctuations in the quantity and quality of younger potential employees, a number of companies, McDonald's among them, have wooed retirees. Abraham & Straus, the Brooklyn-based retailer, which until two years ago bused workers from the city to Long Island and New Jersey branches, now emphasizes full-time, more highly educated and better-trained ''sales specialists'' to whom it pays commissions.
Nonetheless, the gap between the resident labor force and the number of jobs is growing in many suburban counties. This year alone, the Regional Plan Association figures there will be 56,000 more jobs than resident employees in Westchester, 87,500 in Fairfield and 111,000 in Bergen.
This may be good news for would-be workers in the Bronx, like Ms. Hardy, Mr. Morgan, Mr. Minaya and Mr. Chestnut. That they answered the advertisement Tuesday reflects a statistical trend: besides those using private transportation services like the McShuttle, the average number of Metro-North commuters bound for the suburbs from the Bronx during the morning rush has tripled to 1,500 since 1982.

HEADLINE: Cocaine Prices Rise; Police Role Is Cited

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
For the first time in almost 10 years, the wholesale price of cocaine is rising sharply in New York and other American cities, suggesting that extensive law-enforcement efforts in this country and Latin America may finally be reducing the availability of the drug, Federal officials and independent drug experts say.
In New York and Los Angeles, wholesale cocaine prices have jumped by more than 40 percent since December.
At the same time, heavily diluted cocaine has been turning up in many cities, further suggesting diminished supplies, the officials say.
But they caution that price rises have not been consistent across the nation and that they have been noted only in the last three to six months.
 
No Declaration of Victory
''We don't have enough of a pattern yet to make an overall conclusive statement,'' the acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terrence M. Burke, said in a telephone interview from Washington. 
''But,'' he said, ''there's enough smoke out there to cause us to realize that something is happening. We haven't seen signs like these up till now. We're not quite sure, but it's our hope and belief that there's a good possibility that this has been because of law-enforcement action.''
Analysts in the office of national drug policy headed by William J. Bennett are reaching the same conclusions. ''We're not in a position to declare victory,'' said Stanley E. Morris, a deputy to Mr. Bennett, ''but we're seeing movement in the right direction.''
 
Tentative Conclusions
Some skeptical Federal drug officials say they suspect that the South American smuggling organizations may be holding back on sales to drive up profits or may be using the news of drug seizures and other police operations to justify price increases while continuing to maintain high supply levels. Still others say aggressive law enforcement may be increasing smuggling costs, which are being passed on to consumers.
But Dr. Mark A. R. Kleiman, an expert on drug policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and a frequent critic of Washington, said his tentative conclusion was that police and military operations appeared to be ''now taking hold.''
''That would be the hopeful interpretation,'' he said. ''Less hopeful would be that this is some kind of a temporary glitch. If this keeps up for another six months, you'll have to say something is working.''
 
Fewer Patients
The developments in the cocaine market come as some social scientists say they are seeing the first tentative signs that the hard-core use of cocaine - mainly crack - may be declining in the inner cities, following a trend noted earlier among high school students and middle-class families.
One indicator is a report from the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Washington describing a sharp drop in patients being treated in emergency rooms across the country for reactions to cocaine in the last quarter of 1989. In Washington, the presence of cocaine in people being arrested has been declining for several months. Elsewhere in the country it appears to have reached a plateau.
''We could be on the verge of turning the corner,'' Dr. Kleiman said. He added that he believed that having seen the devastating effects of cocaine and crack for several years, many young people in the inner cities are deciding not to try the drugs. #40 Percent Rise Wholesale drug prices are established through negotiations between principal distributors who operate in the major cities and generally deal in quantities of at least several kilograms of 2.2 pounds each. The larger the purchase, the better the price.
In New York in the last few days, Drug Enforcement Administration officials say, undercover agents several times have been offered cocaine at $32,000 to $36,000 per kilo, compared with a high of $25,000 per kilo in December. In Los Angeles, the wholesale price is as high as $23,000 per kilo in contrast to $16,000 at the turn of the year.
In Baltimore, the cost of a kilo of cocaine rose from a high of $17,000 in September to $22,000 in December and has now climbed to $24,000. In Chicago, a kilogram is selling for as much as $32,000, up more than 20 percent from $26,000 at the turn of the year.
Prices for individual customers on the streets in New York, Baltimore and Los Angeles have not increased, the city police and Federal agents say. But Federal officials say they are seeing indications in those and other cities that dealers are effectively raising their street prices by diluting their products.
When cocaine is diluted, often with lactose, the effects of the drug are diminished, with the predictable result, experts say, that addicts buy more to reach familiar highs.
 
Less Purity
In Los Angeles, a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman, Ralph Lochridge, said the agency has been seizing crack lately that consists of only 35 to 55 percent cocaine compared with 80 to 100 percent in recent years.
The Drug Enforcement Administration agent in charge in Baltimore, Jack Taylor, said the purity of cocaine being sold on the streets in his area had fallen to 15 to 30 percent. from 30 to 50 percent in September. In New York, a spokesman for the Federal drug agency, Mark Hannan, said agents had recovered some kilo packages consisting of 50 to 60 percent cocaine down from the standard in recent years of 88 to 93 percent.
The wholesale price of cocaine reached a high in the United States of $65,000 a kilo in 1981 and had been falling steadily as coca crops and processing expanded in South America, outpacing the demand of a burgeoning North American market. United States officials in Colombia, the main refining and exporting country, estimate that production there has peaked at 600 metric tons a year.
United States officials in Colombia say that Government raids may be curtailing processing in Colombia but that new refineries are being started in Peru and Bolivia, where most of the coca, the raw material for cocaine, is grown, as well as in the jungles of Brazil. This contributes to skepticism that the flow of cocaine to the United States is diminishing.
 
Fluctuation in Miami
Federal officials and other drug experts have been closely following cocaine prices since late last summer when Colombia declared war on drug traffickers and President Bush announced an intensified anti-drug campaign.
Prices in Miami, one of the principal hubs for importing, jumped several thousand dollars in September, a month after Colombian police and soldiers went into action, but fell back within a few weeks.
Since then, Federal drug officials in the United States and Latin America have searched in vain for evidence to justify the Bush Administration's strategy of devoting 70 percent of its anti-drug money to law enforcement. The Federal Government is putting $9.5 billion into the fight against drugs this year.
The wholesale price in Miami has risen nearly 20 percent since December to as much as $23,000 per kilo. In Houston and San Antonio, the wholesale cost of a kilo reached a high of $14,000 by the turn of the year, or nearly 20 percent more than in the fall. James O. Hawkins, the chief of intelligence in Houston for the Drug Enforcement Administration, said he expected prices now being tabulated to show an additional 10 percent increase by the end of June.
Information on smugglers and dealers is sketchy, and drug officials in different cities and even within the same office sometimes come to different conclusions in their analyses.
 
Possible Price Manipulation
As sea and air patrols and electronic surveillance have increased in the Caribbean and along the Florida coast, much of the cocaine smuggling has shifted to routes through Central America and ultimately across the Mexican border. Because more people have become involved, smuggling costs have increased, some Federal officials say. Michael Garland, the chief of intelligence for the Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington, says he believes that these factors, coupled with anti-drug operations in Colombia, is responsible for the price rises.
In the Houston office of the Drug Enforcement Administration, which oversees most of Texas's long border with Mexico, Mr. Hawkins said that cocaine was still readily available and that he believed traffickers were manipulating prices.
''It's there for the purchase,'' he said. ''All you've got to do is come up with the money. They can make available whatever amounts you want.''
Some Federal agents and police department officials say they suspect price manipulation is contributing to the higher prices in New York.
 
Effects on Supply
Peter Reuter, an economist and drug expert in Washington for the Rand Corporation, and other Federal agents said they believed this might be possible for short periods. But, Mr. Reuter said, ''Lots of other people can get into this business from other places and if cocaine is arriving here, they can offer it at lower prices.''
Though the Colombian drug rings are sometimes referred to as cartels, they have not in the past fixed prices but have functioned as cooperatives of processers, financiers, shippers and enforcers for distribution in widely varying sales arrangements.
James S. Milford, the deputy chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration's New York office, said he is convinced that less cocaine is reaching the city.
''Traditional major traffickers in this area don't have large amounts available for wholesale distribution,'' he said. ''We're seeing traditional buyers of 5 and 10 kilos having to look elsewhere.''
At Drug Enforcement Administration headquarters in Washington, Mr. Burke said that in conversations with chiefs of police across the country and through telephone wiretaps in several cities he had found that ''people are talking about having trouble putting together packages and there's a great deal of discussion about the purity of the stuff.''
''I think the point is,'' he said, ''that there is less cocaine available to individual entrepreneurs.''

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Durenberger's Senate Testimony

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from testimony today by Senator Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, before the Senate Ethics Committee, on the second day of hearings into his financial activities, as supplied by the Federal News Service, a transcription company:
This investigation and this hearing focuses on only a few years of the 55 years of my life. While it may appear proper to talk about those years as if we could somehow cleanly separate them and study them, there is much living that has affected those years. And very briefly, let me give you some context.
I was born on the campus of the monastery of St. John's Abbey and University in Collegeville, a second-generation Minnesotan. My father, the college athletic director for 42 years; my mom, a superwoman, a mother, teacher and a volunteer. I graduated from grade school, a two-roomer; high school, and college at St. John's. St. John's is a Benedictine community, and the Benedictine motto is ''Work and pray.'' And I must say I learned those lessons well, as you'll see during the course of this matter. 
I spent time in the Army. I graduated from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1959, and I joined a firm in South St. Paul. In 1962, I married Judy McGlumphy. Our sons were born in 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1967. We discovered that Judy had breast cancer at the birth of our youngest son, Danny, who happens to be with me here today. She died three and a half years later at the age of 31.
At that time, I was serving as Gov. Harold Evander's chief of staff. Shortly after Judy's death, I became H. B. Fuller Company's legal and community affairs counsel, and I became active in the leadership of literally dozens of community organizations.
 
Struggles With Family
Despite appearances, I was overwhelmed by the sadness and the daunting challenge of raising four small sons under the age of 8. Within a year of Judy's death, I met and married Penny Tuohy. She was a Vietnam War widow of a U.S. Marine captain. Steve Tuohy was killed in the Tet offensive, and Penny undertook to help raise these four boys. While she had her own cross to bear, she added five more - of ours. With a mother lost to Charlie, David, Mike, and Danny, a husband lost to Penny and a wife lost to me, sadness made bonding difficult in our family.
Some of that sadness was acknowledged, but a lot of it was never dealt with. My grief counseling was to throw myself into my work and yes, gentlemen, that was a serious mistake but one I didn't know how to acknowledge.
I was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1978 and again, I threw myself into my work, and, as you know, that's not hard to do around here. Over the past 12 years, I have been extremely proud of representing the people of Minnesota handling their constituent issues; helping develop legislation on national health policy, intergovernmental relations, national security, tax reform, civil rights and economic equity, the environment and, most recently, as you know so well, the work on the Clean Air Act, the Pepper Commission, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, among just a few -among many other areas.
Yes, there have been many ups and downs in my personal life. But I thank God for the friends; staff, past and present; and the constituents who have supported me. And I thank God especially for my family because they have remained the keys in my daily life even after everything I've put them through.
 
Passion of Public Service
Yes, there have been good times and tough times in my career. But I want to tell you that one thing remains constant, I believe deeply in public service. It's been my vocation, it's been my passion and, sometimes, my refuge. And whatever public service has cost me, including the opportunity for personal wealth, or, for that matter, even financial security, it's been worthwhile. There are many things in my life I would change if I could start over. The opportunity to serve my community, whether on a park commission or in the United States Senate, is not something I've ever regretted.
Hopefully, some sense of my past will now help inform the future. Yesterday's presentation painted a very different portrait of me and my situation. And I would say to the members of the committee that you can only accept Mr. Bennett's characterization if you ignore four clear and undisputed historical facts.
My personal history includes three decades of public service requiring substantial responsibility and integrity. . . .
Secondly, I have a strong background in ethics in government. I was the vice chair of the Minnesota Ethical Practices Board and its predecessor, the Minnesota Ethics Commission. I was executive director of the Minnesota Constitutional Study Commission and the Minnesota Supreme Court Advisory Committee on Professional Standards for Judges.
Third, none of the people involved with me in these matters can be described as anything but upstanding. They are well-respected members of their communities. They're not fast-buck or special interest operators.
To me, reprehensible is an appropriate word to characterize the suggestion that these people would participate in the kind of scheme outlined by the Special Counsel.
And fourth, all of these matters were done in the open and disclosed. There has been no obfuscation or cover-up. And I must say, somebody called yesterday who were watching my facial expressions or something like that when Bob Bennett got to the point of the Piranha Press chewing up the prey or whatever it was. I guess I got one of those facial expressions that said I was arrogant or something like that.
But I must say, every time somebody brings up this notion of Piranha Press I just have to say: Would anybody in their right mind believe that anybody was going to cook up a scheme to evade U.S. Senate rules by going out and creating a company called Piranha Press? No, Mr. Bennett's characterization flies in the face of these well-known facts, and I would urge you to take into account these facts as you weigh his conclusions.
 
Political Realities
Now I want to turn to several comments which reflect in a more personal way on the facts my counsel has given to you. And first let me talk about what has come to be known as the condo deal. Those Americans who argue for a citizen legislature can look to me, for better or worse, to see some of the realities that face someone who comes into public office relatively late in life. I was a grass-roots activist, and what I knew about the mechanics of the Senate came when I was told how much I could spend for my staff, given the keys to my office, and my unabridged dictionary, and told good luck.
While I don't presume on this occasion and in this forum to offer myself as an expert or a guide to my colleagues on the committee or in the Senate on the subject of political ethics, there are a few personal thoughts that I need to share.
It is with a great deal of sadness that I approach this proceeding and review my own actions which have provoked them. The Senate is an institution I love. I've come to love it. . . . To the extent my actions, my inactions, my failure to perceive the consequences of my actions, have in any way reflected poorly on the Senate as an institution, or been uncomfortable or distressful to you as a person, I must say, I am sincerely sorry. I have tried to uphold and to strengthen this institution. . . .
I've been careful not to abuse my rights, or my privileges, as a Senator, with respect to allowing the Senate to work its will and get its business done, and I think you've observed that. . . .
 
Proud of Work in Senate
I believe I've made a significant contribution to the work product of this institution. I've taken my institutional responsibility very seriously to protect the Senate's structure, and ease its operation. And that sense of the value of the institutional responsibility, makes my sense of sadness over this situation all the more acute.
As I've said, I was raised in a small town. I think when college was out it wasn't more than about 200 people. The first 21 years of my life were in this closely knit educational community. Other people's perceptions of what you did weren't much of a factor in that kind of an environment, since we were all known on a first-hand basis.
But those kinds of personal relationships can't exist in the larger public arena. People must, of necessity, rely on other's views and impressions. And that's when perception becomes a real factor. Appearances, I have learned, are much more than a tool of public relations, in this business. They have ethical consequences far greater than we usually attribute to them.
As Professor Thompson of Harvard testified to the House of Representatives, and I'll quote him, Public officials have a ethical obligation to do all they can to make sure that citizens do not have any reasonable basis for believing that they or their colleagues are violating their own ethics rules.
There is an ethical obligation to protect the appearances of propriety almost as great as to produce its reality, end quote.
What I have learned is simply that a clear conscience or a legal opinion does not make you ethically bulletproof - a tough lesson to learn - a good lesson, but it's tough to learn it the way I have. The difficulty for rules-driven ethics is that it is difficult to write or to enforce a rule governing appearances. It becomes quite difficult when ethics, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.
 
Accountable for Mistakes
But let there be no misunderstanding of what I am saying. There's no excuse for my actions to be found in changing public perceptions or in the way other members conduct themselves. I am fully responsible, and I am accountable for the mistakes that I have made. I am simply pointing out from my own experience that the broader challenge of political ethics which we in this body will have to address in campaign finance reform, limitations on honoraria, our associations with nonprofit organizations, the proactive work that the Vice Chairman referred to earlier of ethics, rules, disbursing, to inform and advise those and a host of other issues.
Publc attitudes about political ethics have changed, and we have to change with them or be swept aside.
In conclusion, members of the committee and the Senate and especially the people of Minnesota, I want to express again my regret and my sadness for the circumstances that have brought us to this point. I acted throughout in good faith. I sought out competent legal and official advice. I worked too hard on your public agenda to attend to my private one. Since my service to you began, I have never sold your vote or bartered your influence to enrich myself.
But I recognize that real damage has been done, by what has been perceived as my desire to push the limits and take advantage of the Senate. And for that, I am deeply sorry.

HEADLINE: Can Small Be Cheap and Also Beautiful?

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
IT is the architectural equivalent of the Japanese compact car, without options like power steering or a tape deck. But two professors at McGill University are betting that many young prospective homeowners would willingly trade closets and other amenities for a home of their own that is efficient and affordable.
The ''Grow Home'' - two stories, 14 feet wide, 1,000 square feet -is an experimental house recently built by the Affordable Homes Program of the McGill School of Architecture. In Montreal the two-bedroom, one-bathroom town house cost $36,000 for materials and labor, in United States dollars. The estimated selling price in Montreal would be $62,000. In the United States, the selling price would vary, depending on local land and construction costs.
''We felt there was a gap between architects, housing and the needs of the public,'' said Avi Friedman, who is co-director of the graduate program with Witold Rybczynski, the author of ''Home: A Short History of an Idea'' and ''The Most Beautiful House in the World.'' 
''The whole issue of affordability isn't talked about enough,'' Mr. Rybczynski said. ''No one knows how to manipulate interest rates and land costs. So as architects we thought it was worth taking a look at the product again.''
As a model, Mr. Rybczynski and Mr. Friedman looked to the row house, a staple of cities like Montreal, London and Philadelphia. Row houses allow relatively high densities but also have some advantages of single-family houses, chiefly a private front door and a private rear garden. Grow Homes could be assembled in rows, pairs, terraces or courts.
Perhaps the biggest issues raised by the house are lot zoning and house size. Since the housing boom of the 1950's, the size of North American houses has been on a steady incline. The Levittown houses of the late 1940's, for example, offered buyers 800 square feet without a basement. Now, according to the National Association of Home Builders, the median size of a new American home is 1,850 square feet.
But family sizes have decreased. In 1949 4.2 people lived in the average single-family home; today the figure is 2.3 people, said James McKeller, the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Real Estate Development in Cambridge, Mass. The result, Mr. McKeller said, is ''twice as much house for half as many people.''
Michael Carliner, an economist for the home builders' association, said house sizes became larger partly because buyers' incomes were rising and partly because members of the baby boom have moved from being first-time homeowners and in trading up can afford more.
In addition, he said, many places effectively encourage bigger houses with zoning that establishes minimum building lots of one-eighth to one-fifth of an acre (about 5,500 to 8,700 square feet).
The 1,500-square-foot lot that might comfortably accommodate a Grow Home would not be legal in many areas. ''There has been a history of exclusionary zoning and growth control,'' said Karl Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley College. ''Though decreased lot zoning is the ticket to affordability, many municipal zoning laws would not permit it.''
A small-is-cheap-and-beautiful ethic (''space costs money,'' Mr. Rybczynski said) was a major impetus behind the creation of the Grow Home, which has been attracting a steady stream of visitors since it was opened last week. The house will remain on campus and open to visitors through June 30.
''It takes a certain amount of sophistication to appreciate smallness,'' Mr. Rybczynski said. In central Philadelphia, he noted, historic town houses as narrow as 12 feet are considered charming and highly desirable. The no-frills design of the Grow Home - which might be compared to knockdown furniture or generic grocery brands - was formed in part by a consumer survey conducted with The Montreal Gazette.
Although Europeans are accustomed to buying unfinished houses and buying additional components later, it is not a North American tradition. ''We were very surprised by how many people said they would be willing to do work on the house themselves in exchange for lower costs,'' Mr. Rybczynski said.
The idea, as with a Japanese car, Mr. Friedman said, was to combine ''small size with a high degree of finish and workmanship.'' Construction, land and marketing costs are all lower for a smaller house.
Homeowners could add on options - a basement with a garage, for example, or a second bathroom - as they go. The architects envision four models: the Windsor now standing at McGill; the Straight-Back, without a pergola, a lattice-covered back porch, or front balcony, which would sell for $56,000 in Montreal; the Ottomane, with an unfinished basement, $67,000, and the La-Z-Boy, the top of the line, with an unfinished basement and a garage, $76,000.
The Windsor has a blue stucco facade and classic architectural details, and comes with a second-floor balcony in front and a small pergola in back. Rather than shrink every room, ''we really tried to make judgments,'' Mr. Rybczynski said. Built-in closets, which are extremely labor-intensive, were not included; it is assumed that the homeowner will buy storage units seperately and place them where they want them. But the house has an expensive steel front door, because ''we felt the front door was important,'' Mr. Rybczynski said.
In their design, which they developed with a research associate, Susan Ross, the architects tried to keep contemporary living in mind.
There is no entry foyer; the front door opens into the kitchen. The kitchen is bright, spacious and designed to be the heart of the house and the principal dining area. The sitting room is a snug 14 by 10 feet. The downstairs bathroom is large enough to hold a washer and dryer.
The interior is meant to be flexible. ''Houses, especially the noise level and the placement of furniture, change with life changes,'' Mr. Friedman said. The upstairs is an unpartitioned loftlike space. A wall can be installed at extra cost. At McGill, the second floor was set up as a master bedroom and child's nursery, with a Venetian blind between them. A number of visitors walking through the house suggested that this space looked perfectly wonderful for two people - without any children.
Though small, the house does not feel claustrophobic, in part because of the abundance of windows divided by wooden mullions and the two sets of French doors to the pergola and balcony. Where inexpensive materials are used, it is assumed that they can be replaced with better materials later. ''Creative use of vinyl can be as attractive as marble,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''Creativity and energy are a resource, like money.''
The Affordable Homes Program was begun last year as a graduate program for architects and designers, the only advanced degree in affordable housing from a North American school of architecture. Its students are studying economical kitchen designs, housing for households headed by single women and other issues. The program is financed by the Canadian Government, the Quebec Government and private benefactors. The house was financed by Dow Chemical Canada Inc., with furnishings fromIKEA Canada Ltd. The builder was Modulex Inc. of Quebec City.
Reactions from visitors seemed generally favorable. For every person who said, ''I wouldn't dream of living in it; it's too small,'' there was another who marveled at the amount of space. Although he had not seen the house, I. Donald Terner, president of the Bridge Housing Corporation, a nonprofit housing company in San Francisco, cautioned that provision for automobiles could significantly drive up the cost.
Mr. Rybczynski and Mr. Friedman said that even with differences in land costs the ''Grow Home'' could be built for significantly less than a typical home. But ''expectations are the hardest things to change,'' Mr. Rybczynski admitted.
''What is a home?,'' Mr. Friedman asked. ''It's a cozy kitchen, a place to hang a baby's picture and a place to watch the evening news.''
The architects seemed determined to turn smallness into a virtue.
''Upper-story-loft dinner parties could be an attraction,'' Mr. Friedman said.
''Even Roseanne eats in the kitchen,'' Mr. Rybczynski said.

HEADLINE: Japanese Say Their Country Has Sold Its Soul

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 13

 BODY:
Japan's postwar mistake has been selling its soul to the West along with its cars and computers, several Japanese novelists and critics told an international literary conference here this week.
''With prosperity, the economic miracle, has come cultural and spiritual degeneration,'' said Masao Miyoshi, a critic and professor of literature at the University of California at San Diego, who moderated a panel of Japanese writers on Monday. ''Japan has surrendered to Western cultural hegemony. We are represented in industry but not in cultural matters.'' 
The same point was made more informally by the novelist Kenzaburo Oe, a perennial candidate for the Nobel Prize. ''You know why Honda is great,'' Mr. Oe told his American dinner companions at a gathering that opened the conference. ''But we don't care about Honda. We care that our cultural life is unknown to you.''
 
A Shift in Focus
The panel discussion, one of a dozen here this week at the War Memorial and Performing Arts Center, was part of the Wheatland Foundation's fourth annual conference on world literature, which until this year has been dominated by Central European and Soviet writers. But in this most Asian of American cities, the conference organizers shifted the focus and, for the first time, invited novelists, poets, playwrights and essayists from Japan, South Korea, China and Southeast Asia.
The Chinese panel, scheduled for Thursday, is expected to be the most provacative because of last year's massacre in Tiananmen Square. Most of the participating Chinese writers, all living in exile, are members of the younger generation, but they were joined here by Liu Binyan, the eminent journalist who has twice been expelled from the Communist Party.
The Japanese panel was considered the most distinguished assemblage of the week, with several of the country's foremost writers. Among them were Mr. Oe, whose books include ''A Personal Matter'' and ''Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness,''and Yuko Tsushima, daughter of the prominent novelist Osamu Dazai, who committed suicide shortly after World War II. Ms. Tsushima's novels include ''Child of Fortune'' and ''The Shooting Gallery.''
 
Prize for Translation
Mr. Oe's work is distinguished by twists of syntax and sentence structure more common in English and the European languages than in Japanese, said Van C. Gessel, a professor of Japanese literature at the University of California at Berkeley, who attended the conference. Ms. Tsushima's novels, he said, are full of the mundane details of domestic life and grapple with the struggles of a divorced mother in a country that is harsh on nonconforming women. Later in the week, Ms. Tsushima's translator, Geraldine Harcourt, will be awarded the Wheatland Foundation's translation prize, which has previously gone to Arpad Goncz, the new interim President of Hungary.
The Wheatland Foundation was established in 1984 by Ann Getty, the philanthropist who is married to the heir to the Getty oil fortune, and Lord Weidenfeld, the British publisher. Together, Mrs. Getty and Lord Weidenfeld bought Grove Press in 1985, subsequently losing millions of dollars. They put the publishing house on the market and found out last month that it was virtually unsalable because of its liabilities. Mrs. Getty lives here in San Francisco in a lemon yellow stucco mansion with sweeping views of the bay and is the hostess at the city's grandest dinner parties.
 
The Getty Touch
Mrs. Getty's touch was evident at the conference, held in the Green Room of the War Memorial and Performing Arts Center, a high ceilinged chamber that opens onto a stone loggia overlooking City Hall. It was here, in brilliant spring sunshine, that conference participants nibbled chocolate-dipped strawberries during the breaks between panel discussions.
The discussions, more often than not, left participants yawning, whispering among themselves like school children or trying to sneak a look at the baseball box scores without rustling the newspaper. But occasionally sparks flew, as they did when Mr. Oe made it clear that he did not think much of Yukio Mishima, Japan's most famous postwar novelist, who committed hara-kiri after a failed attempt to take over a military base.
Mr. Oe argued that Mishima shaped his life to ''live up to the image of Japan created by Europeans.'' Mishima's decision to die in the ''traditional way,'' Mr. Oe said, was the final proof of his ''perverted relationship with the image of Japan'' and ''a great betrayal of his fellow Asians.''
This incensed Pierre Mertens of Belgium, a novelist and lawyer who writes frequently about war crimes and totalitarianism. ''Mishima is accepted in other countries as a great writer,'' Mr. Mertens sputtered into his microphone, calming himself with a sip of cool water. ''I don't think the Japanese have a right to decide he's not a great writer. And once we've thrown the suicides out of literature, what happens to Primo Levi? We'll be getting into cultural genocide before too long.''
 
Two Confessions
While Mr. Oe lamented that Japanese writers are too obeisant to the West, rather than ''turning our eyes to the Asian literature,'' his life and career follow the same pattern. He was 10 when the war ended and vividly recalls the truck full of American soldiers who rolled into his village with chocolate bars and chewing gum, copies of ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' and ''Black Beauty'' and volumes of Walt Whitman and William Butler Yeats.
''This was the beginning of my literary life,'' Mr. Oe said, dipping his head apologetically. He went on to study French literature at Tokyo University and write a thesis about Sartre.
Ms. Tsushima, too, offered a contrite explanation for a lifetime spent reading Western literature in translation rather than indigenous Japanese works. ''Women seemed so free and liberated in the foreign literature,'' she said. ''There were very few books written by Japanese women and to read them made me feel I was going back to the olden days. That aspect within me has changed recently.''

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Down 0.7% Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
In a surprisingly weak performance, American shoppers cut retail spending by seven-tenths of 1 percent in May, the third straight monthly decline, the Commerce Department said today.
It was the first time since September, October and November 1981, during the nation's most recent recession, that retail sales for apparel, autos, furniture and other items have fallen for such an extended period.
The report sent bond yields falling to their lowest levels since mid-February as market participants said the report further evidenced a weakening in the economy. [Page D17.] The news prompted some analysts to wonder whether the economy would continue to move ahead, however languidly, without some move to ease monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. 
 
'A Grim Number Indeed'
''This was a grim number indeed,'' said Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, suggesting it was now ''very possible'' that the Fed would cut interest rates even before the next scheduled meeting of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee on July 2.
Other analysts, noting that much of the country suffered from poor shopping weather last month and that retail sales figures are quite erratic in any event, were somewhat less concerned.
Richard B. Berner of Salomon Brothers said that while the latest figures ''paint a picture of sluggish consumer spending'' they probably overstated the severity of the decline in retail sales.
He observed that exceptionally warm weather early in the year may have ''stolen'' sales from the spring and predicted that the May figures would be revised upward substantially, as they were in May 1989.
The data are adjusted for seasonal, holiday and trading-day differences, but major aberrations in the weather can swamp the adjustment factors.
 
Many Taken Aback
Even those who see no imminent danger of recession, like Edward Guay of the Cigna Corporation, were nonetheless taken aback by the scope of the declines in sales last month, with only apparel stores managing to post an advance, perhaps because of volume-enhancing price cuts.
''I don't think it's enough weakness for the Federal Reserve to ease, but it's certainly going to cause some argument'' at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Mr. Guay said. He suggested the Fed would defer easing until more data on the domestic economy are in and until there is some evidence that German economic unification will not touch off a bout of inflation there that could cause a rise in German interest rates. April Drop Revised Today's report also showed that retail sales declined more in April than initially reported - nine-tenths of 1 percent instead of six-tenths of 1 percent - and that, unlike other recent months, May's poor sales could not be attributed to a paucity of car sales. Auto sales in May fell six-tenths of 1 percent compared with a drop of 1.6 percent in April.
Last month, retail sales excluding the automotive sector slumped eight-tenths of 1 percent, slightly more than for total retail sales. In April, non-auto sales fell seven-tenths of 1 percent.
But in the first 10 days of June auto sales have headed downward. In a separate report released today, Detroit's Big Three auto producers said that sales of North American-made cars and trucks tumbled 14.9 percent.
 
Food Sales Down 1%
The Commerce Department's report showed that outlets selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes posted a 4.2 percent drop last month after a 3.2 percent drop in April. Home furnishings and equipment fell 1.1 percent and food fell 1 percent.
Stores selling general merchandise suffered a 1 percent decline, gasoline service stations had a 1.6 percent decline, while drug and proprietary stores and eating and drinking places showed sales lower by 1.3 percent and five-tenths of 1 percent, respectively.
Peter A. Radford, chief economist for the National Westminster Bancorp in New York said the fact that the declines were so widespread was ''the thing that disturbs me the most.'' He said, however, that while economic growth had decelerated markedly in the last few months, the Federal Reserve would probably wait until at least mid-July before relaxing the monetary reins.
 
Growth Estimate Cut
In a market letter dated Monday, Merrill Lynch disclosed that it had cut its estimate of 1990 growth in gross national product to 1.8 percent from the 2.1 percent it had predicted earlier, and Mr. Straszheim of Merrill said today that even the new figure might well prove too optimistic.
The Commerce Department's report showed that retail sales last month were $146.84 billion, which, while down from the previous month, were 1.5 percent above the $144.71 billion posted for May 1989.
With retail inflation running at about 4 percent, this implied that volume last month was about 2.5 percent below levels a year earlier.
Sales of durable goods fell 1.1 percent last month, while nondurable sales fell five-tenths of 1 percent, the department reported.
Without any adjustment, sales last month were $152.94 billion, up from $144.85 in April and from $150.26 billion in May 1989.

HEADLINE: U.S. Likely to Forgo Sanctions Against India

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
Although India has refused to negotiate removal of trade barriers with the United States, the Bush Administration has ruled out sanctions against New Delhi lest broader trade liberalization talks be undermined, American trade officials said today.
Under the decision, expected to be announced on Thursday by the trade representative, Carla A. Hills, the Administration would wait until the multilateral talks among 106 nations, known as the Uruguay Round, conclude at the end of this year before determining what action, if any, to take on India.
India is the only country remaining on the ''hit list'' of those selected for reprisal under 1988 trade legislation. The Journal of Commerce reported today that it was virtually certain that the Administration would decide not to impose sanctions. 
Japan and Brazil worked their way off the retaliation list with a series of market-opening measures adopted after negotiations with the United States earlier this year.
 
A Steadfast Refusal
But India has steadfastly refused to negotiate under a unilateral threat of sanctions. ''As a sovereign independent country, we cannot be subject to another sovereign independent country's laws,'' said Shrimati Prem Singh, minister of commerce at the Indian Embassy here.
The Administration faces a June 16 statutory deadline in deciding what to do about India, which was accused of maintaining unfair trade barriers by excluding foreign insurance companies and by imposing onerous conditions on foreign investment.
Mrs. Hills broadly hinted at the decision she is likely to take during a breakfast meeting with reporters today in which she outlined her options.
 
A Variety of Options
She said she could retaliate immediately, take no action at all or ''defer and say we're negotiating on issues of services and investment in the Uruguay Round, and that therefore I will determine what action to take when those negotiations close.''
The United States is now preparing for major international meetings it hopes will give a greater political thrust to the ambitious multilateral trade talks begun in Uruguay four years ago. The hope is not only to cut tariff and nontariff barriers, but also to reduce subsidies that distort trade in agriculture, set rules of good conduct for trade in financial, construction, tourism and other services and widen protection against piracy of books, movies, brand-name jeans and other intellectual property.
The global talks have been foundering in disputes over agricultural protection and other matters. For the new political push, Washington is looking to the July 9 economic summit meeting of seven industrial nations in Houston and a meeting of developed and developing country members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade the last week of July in Geneva.
 
Sanctions' Explosive Potential
Sanctions against India, the world's biggest democracy, at a time when the United States is seeking international consensus on what President Bush calls his highest trade priority would outrage not only India but also other developing countries and could tilt the balance against further progress in the round, American and international officials say.
They also note that while New Delhi has refused to sit down with American negotiators, it has quietly taken a series of liberalization steps that American officials say point it in the right direction.
The coalition Government of Prime Minister V. P. Singh has just revalidated a $1 billion investment by Pepsico Inc. in India. Pepsico officials had urged the Bush Administration not to impose sanctions, arguing that approval of their project would help create a better climate for resolving the outstanding trade issues.

HEADLINE: U.S. Concern Over Japan's Surplus

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
The Bush Administration today interjected itself publicly into a domestic policy debate in Japan that Washington contends is slowing bilateral trade talks.
In the first comments by an American official on the issue, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said the United States was concerned that Tokyo is now thinking of maintaining trade surpluses at about 2 percent of total economic output. She said the concern had already been related to the Japanese Government. 
''It's one thing to come upon a surplus because of currency swings and the like,'' she said at a breakfast meeting with reporters. ''It is quite another thing to have a policy to maintain a 2 percent surplus. It's that which creates dislocation in the trading system.''
 
The Argument's Implications
This new argument between Washington and Tokyo has broad implications for the ''structural impediments initiative,'' in which the two Governments are trying to revamp their economies to reduce the American trade deficit with Japan, which last year stood at $49 billion.
Should Japan set limits on surplus reduction, the initiative, which seeks to increase competitiveness in Japan so that imports will respond to market forces, could be undermined.
Indeed, Mrs. Hills suggested as much when she noted the trouble American negotiators are having in concluding a final report on the initiative in time for next month's economic summit meeting in Houston.
An interim report committing Japan to a series of measures making it easier for foreigners to invest and do business in Japan was agreed on by the two Governments on April 5.
''These negotiations are difficult and very slow,'' she said today. ''I am not pleased with the progress, but I am not giving up.''
Earlier this month Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto welcomed a report from a Japanese Government advisory panel saying that Japan's surpluses were needed to meet rising demand for world savings to pay for reconstruction of Eastern Europe, unification of Germany and demands of the third world. Agreement from the I.M.F. The International Monetary Fund made a similar argument in its recently published International Economic Outlook.
''The possibility of a rise in world demand for saving associated with recent and prospective developments in Germany and Eastern Europe suggests that it might not be desirable for Japan to eliminate its external surplus over the next few years, especially through actions that would reduce national saving,'' the I.M.F. said.
Japan's overall current account surpluses, which include trade and services accounts with all nations, have declined dramatically, to 2 percent of gross output from around 4 percent to 5 percent.
In the structural initiative, American officials say, Japan is resisting American demands for a big increase in public spending, precisely because of fears of the impact on trade accounts.
Washington is asking for a sharp jump from the current 6.7 percent of gross national product to 10 percent.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
New Mexico Utility Picks Leader

 BODY:
Ashton B. Collins Jr., an expert in electrical services, will take over next week as chairman of the Public Service Company of New Mexico, a large electric and natural gas utility in Albuquerque. He will replace Jerry D. Geist, who is retiring after spending 30 years at the helm.
The succession also includes John T. Ackerman, currently president and chief operating officer of the concern's gas division, who will become president and chief operating officer of the parent company, two posts also held by Mr. Geist. 
Mr. Collins, 58 years old, said the three positions had been split to enable ''another set of shoulders to bear the burden'' of responsibilities. Mr. Ackerman will handle day-to-day operations while Mr. Collins will concentrate more on the overall direction of the concern. He will also remain president of his own company, Reddy Communications, which provides information services to utilities.
Mr. Geist, 56, said Mr. Collin's ''experience and sensitivity to electric utility issues'' will enable him to maintain the company's image as a strong service utility.
Mr. Collins complimented Mr. Geist on the company's ability to balance economic development and environmental concerns. ''He did an extraordinary job positioning the state for a strong future and enabling New Mexico to be the only state to qualify for the most stringent Federal clean-air standards,'' he said.
In the 1970's the company shied away from the polluting coal-burning plants and worked with environmental groups to create a strict set of air and water standards. They now have a diversified set of energy outlets, including nuclear and solar energy.
The greatest challenges Mr. Collins said he would face would be instilling more confidence into shareholders after the company shed all of its non-utility operations over the last two years. ''It will take some time,'' he said. ''We are not paying dividends and have not had a rate increase since 1984.''
After graduating from Cornell University with an economics degree, Mr. Collins worked for his father's company, Reddy Kilowatt, and took over as president more than 20 years ago, changing its name to Reddy Communications. He joined the New Mexico utility in 1979 as a director.
Mr. Ackerman, 46, has a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of New Mexico and a master's degree in utility management from New Mexico State University. He has held a variety of utility-related jobs since then. ''He's strong in management and human relations. He's also a journeyman who can get an operation running smoothly,'' Mr. Geist said.
Mr. Collins, in the meantime, said he does not mind ''wearing two hats'' by heading both Reddy and the Public Service Company of New Mexico. ''Come back in six months and I'll tell you how it feels,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Early June Vehicle Sales Down 12.6%

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 13

 BODY:
Sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks declined 12.6 percent in early June, puncturing hopes by manufacturers that a surge in late May signaled an end to the auto industry's eight-month slump.
The decline comes despite fairly broad and aggressive cash rebates and other financing incentives, including rebates offered by several Japanese manufacturers.
''Sales continue to be sluggish in a saturated market,'' said David Healy, an auto industry analyst for Barclays Bank in New York. ''Some people hailed the upturn in late May sales as a recovery, but it ain't.'' 
Mr. Healy said the strong showing in late May was primarily becaue of a pattern by Japanese manufacturers with plants in the United States, and particularly the Toyota Motor Corporation, to report the bulk of their sales in the last third of the month.
 
Car Sales Down 14.7%
The 10 companies that make cars and trucks in the United States reported total car sales of 152,630, a decline of 14.7 percent from moderately strong sales a year ago. Cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.4 million, well below the 7.3 million rate in late May, and behind the rate of 7.2 million for the corresponding period a year ago. The sales rate for the last 60 days was 6.6 million.
There were eight selling days in the period this year, compared with nine days a year ago. Percentage changes are based on daily selling rates.
Sales of domestic light trucks and mini-vans fell 8.8 percent, to 92,140, accounting for slightly more than one-third of vehicle sales.
The Big Three reported a 14.9 percent decline in combined sales of cars and trucks, ranging from a 12.4 percent drop posted by the Ford Motor Company in early June, to the General Motors Corporation's decline of 16.7 percent. The Japanese producers all reported sales gains, led by the Honda Motor Company, whose car sales increased 30.8 percent.
 
Personal Debt Seen as Factor
Edward A. Sullivan, an analyst with the WEFA Group Inc. in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., attributed the continuing sluggish market for autos to the rising personal debt of American consumers.
''Consumers are so overloaded with debt that a slowdown in the economy, particularly in the Northeast, has caused a lot of people to re-evaluate their purchases,'' he said.
In a move that underscores the declining borrowing power of some car buyers, Ford's financing division told dealers two weeks ago that it would offer lower loan fees for customers it considers creditworthy, and higher fees for those with irregular credit histories.
''We've recognized some of the economic realities of the business,'' said Randy Kniebes, manager of marketing and business development at the Ford Motor Credit Company. ''Consumers who have better credit histories and are better able to repay can get lower rates, and consumers that have had difficulty paying in the past may pay a higher rate.''
The General Motors Acceptance Corporation adopted a similar financing program in March 1989. The Chrysler Corporation's financing unit makes no differentiation in loan fees offered to customers.
Car sales at G.M. fell 19.2 percent, to 71,810, while sales of G.M. light trucks were down 11.3 percent, to 36,906.
Ford reported the largest decline in car sales, down 20.2 percent, to 43,628. Sales of Ford's light trucks rose five-tenths of 1 percent, however, to 33,184, largely on the strength of the popular new Explorer sport utility vehicle.
 
Chrysler Car Sales Off
Chrysler's car sales declined 10.3 percent, to 20,659, a better showing than Chrysler has mustered for several weeks. But sales of Chrysler light trucks, including the important mini-vans, fell 19.1 percent, to 19,866. Analysts attributed the drop in Chrysler's light-truck sales to an end to the rebates Chrysler had offered on its mini-vans.
Honda's car sales increased 30.8 percent, to 9,054.
Toyota reported a gain of 35 percent in sales of its cars, to 3,842. The Mazda Motor Company's car sales rose 22.8 percent, to 728, while the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation posted an increase of 59 percent in sales of its cars, to 1,180.
The Nissan Motor Company's car sales rose 30.5 percent, to 1,517, and sales of light trucks rose 1.1 percent, to 1,922.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mostly Weaker As Pound Keeps Surging

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended weaker yesterday against most major currencies after a mixed performance overseas, while the soaring British pound continued to take center stage.
Currency dealers said the dollar's decline was largely the result of technical factors, with traders selling the dollar to buy the West German mark and Swiss franc. 
But they said the dollar was also depressed by the report of an unexpected decline of seven-tenths of 1 percent in May retail sales, which suggested economic growth was continuing to slow. Dealers said the report caused concern among currency traders that the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates, making the dollar less attractive to investors relative to other currencies.
Three more indicators to be reported this week may also affect the dollar: producer prices come out today and consumer prices and trade figures tomorrow.
The British pound continued to show strength because of high British interest rates and a growing expectation that Britain will join the European Monetary System later this year.
The pound rose to a nearly four-month high against the dollar, dealers said. It traded at $1.7070 in London, up from $1.7020 Tuesday, and at $1.7115 in New York, up from $1.7035.
In other trading, the dollar fell against the West German mark, to 1.6865 marks from 1.6965. It managed a slight gain, however, against the yen, rising to 154.75 yen in New York trading, up from 154.55 yen late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.4240 Swiss francs, down from 1.4382; 5.6720 French francs, down from 5.7090; 1,238.00 Italian lire, down from 1,245.00, and 1.17195 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17255.

HEADLINE: White House Tutors Kremlin In How a Presidency Works

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
On his visit to Camp David this month, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev dropped German unification and Soviet political reform for a moment to quiz President Bush about the logistics of being President. How does paper flow in his office? Who decides who gets into the Oval Office? How does his staff handle Congress?
Enjoying his newfound rapport with Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Bush responded enthusiastically, officials said, and agreed to one of the more unusual accommodations to grow out of the new superpower comity: At Mr. Gorbachev's request, John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, was detailed to tutor the Kremlin on the running of a presidency.
For two days this week, Mr. Sununu played host to an aide to Mr. Gorbachev, Mikhail S. Shkabardnya, arranging an in-depth tour of the White House's administrative operations and those of four Cabinet agencies. 
 
Moscow Trip Planned
And the White House announced today that Mr. Sununu had agreed to take the project a step further by traveling to Moscow for a firsthand look at Mr. Gorbachev's own presidential operation and to offer more advice. Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said no date had been set for that trip.
The project is remarkable both on a personal level and as a symbol of the emerging relationship between the White House and the Kremlin. No one seemed more surprised than Mr. Sununu, a staunch conservative, at the idea of shepherding a delegation of Kremlin efficiency experts through the White House, officials said.
''Even if you look at how quickly and how far we've come, it's amazing that the lines of communications are improved to a degree that we can now do such things,'' said Sig Rogich, Mr. Bush's director of events and initiatives, who also met with the Soviet officials.
 
A Schedule for Gorbachev
Mr. Sununu's class on executive staffing follows a visit late last year by Soviet legislators who went to Congress for tips on running their fledgling Parliament. The Soviet Embassy made tentative inquiries about a similar visit to the White House after the Soviet Parliament elected Mr. Gorbachev to the new post of President on March 14.
The plan for Mr. Sununu's seminar was not made final until June 2, when Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev met at Camp David. ''They began talking about the Presidency and organization and scheduling,'' an official said.
Mr. Bush showed Mr. Gorbachev his minute-by-minute schedule, the official said, and Mr. Gorbachev asked if he could study the document. ''Keep it,'' Mr. Bush replied, handing it to the Soviet leader.
''Gorbachev then said that he would like to have someone talk to Sununu about how the Presidency works as an institution,'' an aide to Mr. Sununu recalled.
''Our resident Sovietologists were impressed with how quickly they followed up,'' the aide said. He said the White House heard from Moscow on June 5, the day after Mr. Gorbachev went home, and Mr. Shkabardnya arrived on Monday.
 
'Process, Process, Process'
Mr. Shkabardnya, a Gorbachev aide previously unknown to the White House, came with five other Soviet officials. ''He's an engineer, like Sununu, so Sununu liked him,'' the aide said. ''There was no ideology, no policy, no philosophy. It was all process, process, process.''
Touring the White House, the visitors ''went from mailroom to switchboard,'' the aide said. ''But of course they didn't go to the situation room,'' the top-secret command center in the White House basement, he said.
Other than Mr. Sununu, the visitors did not meet with policy makers. Instead, their tutors were the White House officials, silent and unseen from the public perspective, who run the nuts-and-bolts operations.
James Cicconi, the staff secretary, and Joseph Hagin, the scheduling and appointments director, gave a crash course in organizing a President's day. ''They asked a lot about our system of prioritization and how things are ultimately put on the President's schedule,'' an aide said.
 
Paper Flow Studied
Ede Holiday, the Cabinet secretary, talked about how to deal with the Government departments and agencies, officials said. ''They were very interested in paper flow, what gets to the President's desk, how it is checked for quality and content,'' an aide to Mr. Sununu said.
The Soviet officials were briefed on the structure of the Cabinet councils on domestic policy and economic policy, the aide said. Using specific examples, they were shown how policy documents move through the bureaucracy to the President's desk, he said.
The Soviet visitors seemed especially interested in learning how often the President talks with his Cabinet secretaries and how the White House communicates with the agencies, officials said.
Dmitri K. Simes, a Soviet specialist with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, noted that Mr. Gorbachev is grappling with the transformation of a Government run by the Communist Party into the more Western model of legislative and executive branches.
''I think that in terms of the mechanics of government and helping them to remove the power from the party apparatus and give it to the presidency, which is in everyone's interest, it is entirely constructive for Sununu to be doing this,'' he said.
But he said it was important for the White House to handle the situation with delicacy, given Moscow's political uncertainties. ''You want to make absolutely certain that reasonable people would not think that you are taking sides,'' he said.

HEADLINE: HIGH COURT RULES HOSPITALS CAN SUE ON MEDICAID RATES

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
In a decision likely to fuel the growing debate over how to pay for medical care for poor people, the Supreme Court ruled today that hospitals and nursing homes can sue states for higher Medicaid reimbursement rates.
The Court ruled that hospitals can go to Federal court to enforce their legal right to ''reasonable and adequate'' reimbursement for the cost of treating patients covered by the Medicaid program.
The 5-to-4 decision is likely to further strain the troubled program and put new financial pressures on state governments at a time when many are trying to control Medicaid costs, which they share with the Federal Government. [Page A15.] Less Than Adequate Care Many hospitals and nursing homes around the country say inadequate reimbursement rates have led them to transfer costs to patients with private insurance and, in some cases, to provide less than adequate care for poor people. 
Hospital administrators in Virginia who are part of an association that initiated today's case said the shortfall in Medicaid reimbursements had not forced them to turn away any indigent patients, but had in some cases hampered a hospital's ability to deliver the best possible medical treatment.
The Court upheld a ruling by a Federal appeals court in Richmond, permitting a lawsuit by a group of hospitals that contend that the state's Medicaid reimbursement rates are causing them to lose $1 million a week collectively. The state appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that Congress had not intended to permit Medicaid providers to bring such lawsuits.
 
Case Has Yet to Go to Trial
The case, brought in 1986 by the 106-member Virginia Hospital Association, has not yet gone to trial. But similar cases have been pursued successfully by Medicaid providers in other states. Every Federal appeals court that has addressed the question has permitted the lawsuits.
Under the Constitution, states cannot be found liable for retroactive damages, so any judgments in favor of Medicaid providers must be prospective only. Nonetheless, the result of a successful lawsuit can be to force the states and the Federal Government, which finances at least half of each state's Medicaid program, to spend substantially more than they are now.
The case before the Court today concerned not the broad policy debate but a precise question of law: what Congress meant in 1980 when it amended the Medicaid law to give states more flexibility in setting reimbursement rates.
 
A More General Standard
Under the legislation establishing the Medicaid program in 1965, states were required to reimburse the reasonable costs of services that hospitals actually provided. But the Boren Amendment in 1980 allowed the states to adopt a more general standard, not tied to any hospital's actual costs. Under the amendment, the rates only had to be ''reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities.''
Virginia and most other states adopted plans that provided prospective payments, rather than actual reimbursement, based on what various procedures and treatments should cost. In its lawsuit the Virginia Hospital Association contended that the rates its members were receiving were not ''reasonable and adequate'' as required by the law.
The Federal District Court in Richmond and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed that the 1980 amendment gave Medicaid providers an ''enforceable right'' to a reasonable and adequate reimbursement rate.
The Supreme Court agreed today in an opinion written by Justice William J. Brennan Jr. ''We decline to adopt an interpretation of the Boren Amendment that would render it a dead letter,'' Justice Brennan said, adding, ''The only plausible interpretation of the amendment is that by requiring a state to find that its rates are reasonable and adequate, the statute imposes the concomitant obligation to adopt reasonable and adequate rates.''
 
Chief Justice in Dissent
Justice Brennan's opinion, Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assoc., No. 88-2043, was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the text of the Medicaid law ''does not clearly confer any substantive rights on Medicaid services providers.'' He said providers would perhaps be able to bring suits challenging the administrative procedure by which a state set its rates, but not to challenge the result of that procedure.
The Chief Justice said, ''To support its decision, the Court looks beyond the unambiguous terms of the statute and relies on policy considerations purportedly derived from legislative history and superseded versions of the statute.''
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy joined the dissent.
As reflected in the tone of the dissenting opinion, the debate on the Court was only partly over the Medicaid law and had at least as much to do with the more general question of how to decide whether there is a private right to bring a lawsuit to enforce a generally worded Federal law that does not explicitly grant such a right. The Court has been debating this question for many years.

HEADLINE: After Barry, Uncertainty;
Mayor's Move Brings Painful Era to Close

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
A painful era in this Federal city's relationship to Congress and the country comes to an end with Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr.'s decision not to run for re-election, but it is far from clear whether what follows will be a political rebirth for the troubled city or just a refocusing of complaints by its legion of critics.
The District of Columbia's political establishment voiced relief the morning after Mr. Barry's announcement, the long-awaited denouement of the political drama created when the Mayor was arrested by Federal agents last January for smoking crack under the eye of an F.B.I. camera at a downtown hotel.
After that arrest, all the city's problems - the murders, the dropouts, the infant mortality, the drug use -seemed suddenly to be embodied in this one man who 12 years ago brought whites and blacks together to elect him Mayor but then slowly lost this widespread support until only a core of firm backers was left by the time of his announcement Wednesday evening.
 
Strains With Congress
Compounding the bleak problems, symbolized by the Barry era, were the worsening political strains between local leaders and Congress, exemplified most recently by efforts from Congress to dictate to Washington about how it should spend its police budget. 
''The city was being distracted from really focusing on those problems that affect it,'' Joslyn Williams, the district's Democratic Party leader, said of Mr. Barry's legal and political troubles. ''Our relationship with Congress was at a standstill. Our enemies were using this as an excuse to really whip the city, and our friends were being put on the defensive. Now I think that excuse and impediment has been removed.''
But Mr. Barry's departure will not solve the city's underlying problems. Being mayor of any big city is a tough job. Being mayor of Washington is even more complicated. There are all the problems of poverty and crime and taxes that many American cities struggle with, and then there is the special relationship that only Washington has to Capitol Hill and the nation.
Mr. Barry had surely strained that relationship, to the point where the district was ''shunned'' by members of Congress, Democrat and Republican, who viewed the Washington government as mismanaged and corrupt, said a senior Congressional staff aide. Many have noted that Washington has one of the highest ratios of employees to residents of any city in the country, with about one employee for every 12 residents.
 
'Honeymoon' Is Expected
A new mayor will no doubt get a ''honeymoon'' with Congress, said Representative Stan Parris, a Republican from northern Virginia who is one of Washington's chief critics on Capitol Hill. To the extent that problems of mismanagement or corruption were directly the result of Mr. Barry's presence, his departure may indeed help ease the strains with Congress.
But there was considerable belief here today, in Congress and among the city's political figures, that critics of Washington had used Mr. Barry's problems as ''an excuse,'' as Mr. Williams phrased it, and that they would find new ground to criticize the district after Mr. Barry is gone.
The city, by the Constitution, is a ward of Congress. Congress has all the power to tax and spend, and the Mayor and his government are delegated these powers by Congress. It is a relationship no other mayor in the country has to deal with.
Members freguently use the city's appropriations bill as a place to fight about national issues, knowing that they can brag about it back at home without paying any political price with voters here.
This year Congress barred the district from spending money - even money it raised itself - on abortions for poor women. Some lawmakers are also hoping to reinstate the death penalty here for certain crimes.
 
Statehood Drive Stressed
The Rev Jesse Jackson said today that many members of Congress have used Mr. Barry's presence in office ''as a reason for not voting for statehood,'' which Mr. Jackson is pushing. Yet no one interviewed today thought the city was any closer to statehood than it was before Mr. Barry announced he was leaving.
Mr. Jackson said statehood was his principal interest now, as he reaffirmed that he has no plans to seek the Mayor's job. Mr. Jackson had re-emerged in recent days as the chief voice in favor of a plea bargain deal that would avoid a trial that could further damage the image of both Washington and its black political leadership.
If no deal is struck, the trial will most certainly be under way while Nelson Mandela, the South African black leader, is visiting Washington.
Mr. Barry's departure will at least give new leaders a chance to improve the city's situation. Six candidates are vying for Mr. Barry's job, and now that the Mayor has stepped off center stage, they will get a better chance to be heard.
Mr. Williams, the Democratic Party leader, said it would be several weeks before the shape of the September Democratic primary becomes clear. Mr. Barry may yet try to help either John Ray or Charlene Drew Jarvis, both members of City Council. Sharon Pratt Dixon, an officer of the local power utility, has impressed insiders with her campaigning, but has yet to make much of an impact on voters.
 
Racial Outlook Unclear
The one white candidate in the field, David A. Clarke, chairman of the City Council, has already demonstrated his ability to win black votes. But the effects of the racial strains caused by Mr. Barry's case are not yet clear.
In the days before his announcement, Mr. Barry and his allies had blamed the white prosecutors for his plight, helping to fuel an image of racial polarization here. Lost was the irony that a man first elected Mayor because he had the strongest biracial appeal was reduced in his last days of power to holding an angry and disaffected base with charges of racism.
In truth, the city's race relations are not so much polarized as separate. The city has no white working class to speak of anymore and thus does not have the stress so visible in New York, say, or Chicago, where whites fear economic competition from blacks, said Mark Plotkin, who became active in Washington politics at the same time Mr. Barry did and is now a political commentator for a local radio station, WAMU.
The one obvious political effect of Mr. Barry's decision was the blow it dealt to the Republican Party's effort to make inroads here. The party has recruited a former police chief, Maurice Turner, to run for Mayor. Against Mr. Barry, with all his legal troubles, Mr. Turner would have provided a powerful law-and-order candidacy. But none of the now likely candidates are saddled with such problems. So unless Mr. Clarke wins the nomination and a racially divided election follows, the Republican plan seems unlikely to go anywhere.

HEADLINE: Oil Cleanup Plan Aims At Protecting Refuges

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GALVESTON, Tex., June 14

 BODY:
The Coast Guard said today that the blaze aboard the stricken Norwegian tanker Mega Borg had resisted firefighting efforts, and state officials announced a strategy for coping with oil that is expected to begin washing ashore this weekend.
The plan, unveiled six days after the ship began leaking crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, gives first priority to such sensitive areas as marshes and estuaries but offers virtually no protection to the broad, sandy beaches that are the summer playground for residents of Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city.
Buck Wynne, chairman of the Texas Water Commission, said that although he was sensitive to the economic concerns of beach communities, ''it is a whole lot easier to make people whole for their economic losses than it is to undo environmental damage.''
The Coast Guard statement and the cleanup plan announced today represent a new level of official concern about the potential of serious damage from the spill. Contrasted with earlier statements that the fire was under control and that the amount of oil likely to reach the shore was negligible, they suggest that the spill is becoming considerably more menacing. 
 
'No Way They Can Compensate'
Coast Guard officials said this afternoon that the oil, now just 20 miles off shore, seemed likely to hit this weekend on the west part of Galveston Island, an area that has prime beaches and is near a series of marshes and estuaries. In economically depressed Galveston, the state's plans were received grimly.
''There is no way they can compensate everyone who makes a living off the beach in one way or another,'' said Doug Matthews, city manager of Galveston. ''This is a city of 65,000 people, and tourism represents about one-third of our economy, more than $300 million a year. There is no way they can make up the losses if we get oil on the beaches.''
Oil spill specialists said there is no practical way to prevent oil from reaching the beaches. Booms cannot be strung in the water in front of beaches to keep oil off the sand, because the surf will disrupt them, said Jim O'Brien, owner of O'Brien Oil Pollution Services Inc., the New Orleans-based company that is overseeing the cleanup efforts. Instead, he said, debris will be cleared from beaches likely to be hit so that the sand can then be more easily cleaned.
But spill specialists said that booms and other measures can be used to limit the amount of oil reaching the marshes and estuaries, which are almost impossible to clean up once they are oiled.
 
Prime Breeding Ground
Tony Amos, an oceanographer at the University of Texas Marine Science Institute, said: ''At this time of year, the bays and marshes are the prime breeding ground for many species of birds such as egrets, spoonbills, herons, pelicans, as well as large numbers of gulls and terns. Oil pollution in that environment would have a devastating impact.''
Salvage crews have been struggling to extinguish the fires on the tanker since the ship was hit by an explosion of unknown origin around 11:30 P.M. last Friday. Fires were still burning in the pump and engine rooms, Capt. Thomas Greene, commander of the Coast Guard marine safety office here, said today.
 
As Fires Burn, Oil Leaks
The Coast Guard announced Tuesday that the fires were under control, but efforts on Wednesday to extinguish it with foam had to be suspended when the flames flared anew. Coast Guard officials said today that they still consider the fires to be under control, adding that the flames are much less intense than before.
A spokesman for K/S Mega Borg II, the Norwegian company that owns the ship, said this afternoon that the salvage and pollution control efforts so far had cost the firm $2 million.
Oil continues to pour out of the ship. Captain Greene said that from 12,000 to 48,000 gallons of oil are now in the water, heading northwest slowly in a patchy slick roughly 30 miles long and up to 10 miles wide. He said the main part of the slick is about 30 miles from shore, half the distance from the ship to the shore, and thin streamers of oil with the consistency of mousse extend another 10 miles toward shore.
Sharon Christopherson, scientific advisor to the Coast Guard station here, said this morning that the oil could reach shore as early as Friday, although it is more likely to arrive over the weekend. When it does hit land, she said, it will be in the form of gooey tar balls that can stick together to form large globs.
 
Bacteria Test Today
Meanwhile, Garry Mauro, the Texas Land Commissioner, announced today that the state would apply naturally occurring bacteria on a part of the slick to determine whether the bacteria can help break up an oil slick at sea. The bacteria, contained in a corn starch powder, has been used in cleanups on land but not at sea.
 
Best Beaches Likely Target
A spokesman for K/S Mega Borg II, the Norwegian company that owns the ship, said this afternoon that the salvage and pollution control efforts so far had cost the firm $2 million.
The beaches likely to be hit by the oil are on barrier islands that stretch along the coast. Between the island are passes that lead to the intercoastal marshes and estuaries.
Captain Greene said this afternoon that although winds and currents are highly variable it seemed most likely that the oil would come ashore this weekend on the West End of Galveston Island. The most attractive beaches on the island are on the West End, and hundreds of weekend and vacation homes have been built behind the dunes there. Off the western tip of the island is San Luis Pass, which leads to a large network of marshes and estuaries.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Protectors Of Industry Hard Up For Battles

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
For all the talk of the ris= ing tide of American protectionism, one of the few precise markers available, the caseload of the International Trade Commission, seems to show that the storm surge has passed.
Under trade laws that go back a century, the six commissioners of the I.T.C. adjudicate trade disputes between domestic industries that want higher tariffs put on foreign imports and foreign suppliers who want unimpeded access to American markets.
The agency's 1990 budget, $40 million, is twice what it was a decade ago. But, try as it may, the agency won't be able to spend all the money that Congress appropriated for it this year, said Anne E. Brunsdale, the commission's chairwoman. 
This year, the commissioners will have before them only a third the number of petitions they received in 1982 from domestic industries alleging instances of unfair competition from imports being subsidized by foreign governments or sold below cost, said Ms. Brunsdale. (A finding by the commission that a domestic industry has been ''materially'' injured is a green light to the Commerce Department to order higher duties on the import.) Because it exists to serve home state or hometown interests, the agency is a favorite of Capitol Hill. And many of its friends there are puzzled by the declining caseload.
''You might say this reflects the law of unintended results, since we've been trying for years to make it easier for industries to go to the I.T.C.,'' mused Representative Sam Gibbons, a Florida Democrat who is chairman of the House trade subcommittee.
Has the agency been done in by its own efficiency, having so successfully laid the ground for protection that there is not much new demand? Or are there other factors at work? The answers, most analysts say, are yes and yes.
In a study for the Institute for International Economics, a policy group here, Gary C. Hufbauer, professor of international finance at Georgetown University, found that by the end of the Reagan Administration, about 22 percent of the $500 billion a year the United States spends on imports was already covered by some form of protection. The figure for 1980 was 12 percent. The 10-point difference, he says, is costing consumers $80 billion a year.
Most bigger industries have been taken care of. Imports of steel, autos, machine tools, textiles, apparel, semiconductors, softwood lumber and myriad other products are subject to quotas, high tariffs, or so-called voluntary restraint agreements in which exporters, like Japanese car makers, impose restrictions on themselves to avoid more drastic curbs.
Another factor is that since the economy has been enjoying unbroken growth since the 1981-82 recession, domestic industry is having an increasingly hard time demonstrating injury. The clearest demonstration, after all, is to show a deteriorating profit and loss statement and a weak balance sheet. And in these fairly good times, many companies, even those with import competition, show rising profits and strong balance sheets.
Still another influence is the dollar. Exchange rates have changed since the dollar reached its highs in 1985. With American currency more competitive around the world, American exports are setting records.
But any look at the trade commissiion is a look at only part of the trade story. The commission deals with imports to the United States. And today, Congress and the White House are concentrating on barriers to American exports abroad. Under the so-called Super 301 Section of the 1988 trade law, President Bush has threatened to curb imports from Japan, South Korea, the European Community and other countries that exclude American exports.
So far, the big stick seems to be working. The United States recently signed agreements with Japan opening up markets in telecommunications, supercomputers, satellites and wood products. Countries acting to avoid American import sanctions include South Korea, which has opened its beef markets, and Taiwan, which is cracking down on counterfeiters of American jeans and other products.
Where does this leave the I.T.C.? ''The complainers will be back again - just give us a recession,'' said C. Michael Aho, a foreign trade specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''Trade policy is loser-driven.''

HEADLINE: Ruling Likely to Increase Strains on Medicaid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
The nation's already troubled health care program for the poor is likely to face new financial strains because of the Supreme Court's decision today holding that hospitals and nursing homes have a judicially enforceable right to ''reasonable and adequate'' payment under Medicaid.
Medicaid, the primary source of health care for 24 million low-income people, is under siege in many states, with local officials trying to hold down costs even as the Federal Government requires more services.
At the same time, hospitals and nursing homes complain bitterly that they have been underpaid by Medicaid programs in many states, so that patients sometimes receive inadequate care.
 
A Flood of Lawsuits Forecast
By giving hospitals and nursing homes the right to sue for increased Medicaid payments, the court ruling may compound the problems. Poor people may benefit if hospitals and nursing homes succeed in getting more money for care provided under Medicaid. But increased payments could worsen the fiscal problems of many state governments. Over all, states pay 43 percent of Medicaid costs, but the proportion varies from state. 
Today's decision opens the way to dozens of lawsuits affecting millions of dollars in Federal and state funds.
''If states continue to underfund Medicaid, there definitely will be more lawsuits brought by health care providers,'' said Fredric J. Entin, senior vice president and general counsel of the American Hospital Association, which represents 5,500 hospitals.
The High Court decision does not guarantee that hospitals and nursing homes will prevail in such litigation, but it emphatically affirms their right to sue. Health care executives, state officials and lawyers predicted that, as a result, states would be much more careful, and somewhat more generous, in setting Medicaid rates for hospitals and nursing homes.
Many health economists say that hospitals have tried to offset their financial losses on Medicaid patients by increasing charges for more affluent patients, who have private health insurance or use their own money to pay hospital bills. If today's decision leads eventually to a change in that practice, it could indirectly benefit middle-income families. But such families might have to pay higher Federal or state taxes to help finance Medicaid.
Eugene Tillman, a Washington lawyer who specializes in health care issues, said that hospitals and nursing homes had an obvious, direct financial interest in assuring adequate Medicaid payment, because ''they are businesses and need to survive.''
At the same time, he said, ''if these cases result in rational state decision-making and more adequate funds to carry out Federal mandates, the ultimate beneficiaries will be the Medicaid recipients.''
Mr. Tillman helped write a legal brief filed with the Supreme Court on behalf of the American Health Care Association, which represents nursing homes, and the American Hospital Association.
 
What Medicaid Costs
Medicaid rates are set by the states, which share the costs with the Federal Government and the states. The program cost $61.3 billion in the last fiscal year. Washington paid $34.6 billion, while states spent $26.7 billion. Total program costs have increased an average of 10 percent a year over the last five years.
Medicaid accounts for 10 percent of the gross revenues of hospitals and 43 percent of the total receipts of nursing homes.
The Supreme Court decision comes just 15 weeks before the effective date of a major 1987 law, under which nursing homes will be required to meet strict new Federal standards for safety, sanitation, nursing staff and social services.
California and some other states say they do not have the money to increase Medicaid rates to cover the costs that nursing homes will incur if they comply. Today's decision gives the nursing homes a potent tool to squeeze more money out of the Medicaid program.
Carter G. Phillips, a lawyer who advised the American Health Care Association, said states would now have to re-examine the techniques used to set Medicaid rates.
Benna Ruth Solomon, chief counsel of the State and Local Legal Center, which represents the interests of the nation's governors, said: ''We are very disappointed by today's decision. It could eventually cost states a lot of money.'' She said it was impossible to estimate the cost because no one had measured the gap between Medicaid rates and the amount that would be deemed ''reasonable and adequate.''

HEADLINE: Marion Barry's Good Years, and Bad

 BODY:
The announcement by Marion Barry that he will not seek a fourth term as Mayor of Washington D.C. comes as a relief to a city beset by drugs and by the strong suspicion that Mr. Barry himself may be a drug abuser. Now both the Mayor and the nation's capital can get on with recovery.
Mr. Barry's remarkable career makes his ignominious demise even sadder. The son of Mississippi sharecroppers, he jumped into the civil rights movement in the early 1960's and was the first national chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He became active in Washington politics and took office as Mayor in 1979. 
Though hampered by laws that give Washington only limited control over its municipal affairs, Mr. Barry generated economic development projects and tended to neglected social ills. He was a source of particular pride for poor blacks and a symbol of growing black political power.
But the shining accomplishments were clouded. Several subordinates were charged with corruption and fraud. Rumors circulated of drug use by Mr. Barry. In 1988, the growth of drugs and drug-related violence made Washington the murder capital of the nation. Other problems mounted, like prison overcrowding, homelessness and a budget that is $90 million out of balance.
In January the Mayor allegedly smoked crack cocaine with a friend at a downtown Washington hotel. The encounter was videotaped in a joint sting operation of the F.B.I. and the District's police department. It formed the basis of drug possession and perjury charges that will be heard in Mr. Barry's Federal trial, which began this week. Whether or not he negotiates a plea bargain, his troubles made it impossible for him to deal with those of his city.
In his announcement, Mr. Barry declared that ''a time for healing'' had arrived. His departure from center stage allows that process to begin.
