HEADLINE: House Committee Approves A Package of Tax Changes

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed a package of tax changes today including breaks to help blighted areas and the repeal of luxury taxes on expensive yachts, furs and jewels.
The bill, which the House will probably vote on next week, would cut a variety of miscellaneous taxes by around $14.4 billion over six years and raise others by the same amount. 
 The single biggest money raiser in the bill would hit workers who have to move because of a job change, and also affect employers who pay those costs. The measure would impose a $5,000 limit on tax-deductible moving expenses. Since many moves cost far more than that, the restricted deductions would bring the Government an extra $3.5 billion.
The largest tax cut -- the $2.5 billion centerpiece of the bill -- would go to investors and businesses that put their money and efforts into 50 "enterprise zones" in depressed, poverty-stricken inner cities and rural areas.
Through income-tax rebates, the Government would in effect pay part of the wages of workers hired in enterprise zones, up to maximum of $3,000 a worker. Businesses would be allowed to quickly write off equipment purchases. Investors would pay no capital-gains tax on profits from the sale of investments in enterprise zones so long as they plowed the gain back into a zone.
The committee agreed to repeal, retroactive to Jan. 1, the luxury taxes on expensive yachts, private planes, furs and jewels. The 10 percent tax on expensive cars would be retained but the $30,000 car price, after which the tax is imposed, would be adjusted yearly to offset inflation.
Republicans on the committee fought unsuccessfully for President Bush's enterprise-zone plan, which would have excused enterprise-zone profits from capital-gains taxes even if they were taken out and pocketed or invested elsewhere. The G.O.P. considers a zero capital-gains tax essential to attract investors into risky neighborhoods.
The Ways and Means bill would extend a dozen special tax breaks that expire June 30. They include incentives for investment in low-income rental housing; assistance for moderate-income families buying a first home, and a credit for businesses that increase research spending.
The bill would relax a 1986 law on "passive losses" to permit builders and real estate managers to use losses on real estate activities to shield wages and other income from taxes. The provision would apply only to property placed in service before Wednesday.
That tax cut would be financed by a tax increase on investors who own nonresidential property. The 31 1/2-year period over which such property could be fully depreciated for tax purposes would be raised to 40 years.
The bill would eliminate the tax deduction now allowed for dues paid to athletic, business or social clubs.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Subpar-Growth Signs Help Prices

BYLINE: BY KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Additional signs of subpar economic growth drove up prices of Treasury notes and bonds yesterday and caused long-term interest rates to fall to their lowest level since early February.
An upward revision by the Commerce Department in first quarter economic growth to 2.7 percent from 2.4 percent was discounted by traders as old news, even though the rate of expansion was the strongest since the fourth quarter of 1988. 
 But credit market participants began to bid up prices almost immediately after the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment insurance rose by 16,000 in the week ended June 13, to 422,000.
Economists said they were particularly troubled by the fact that the weekly claims numbers remained above the 400,000 level. Unless claims move lower, employment growth will remain weak, the analysts said.
 
'Still Flopping Along'
 The initial unemployment claims figures "provide further confirmation that we have failed to establish self-sustaining growth conditions we need to have for a good recovery," said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "We are still flopping along at about 2 percent growth, and that is not encouraging."
In other signs of weakness welcome in the bond market, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes fell by 1.7 percent in May, the second straight monthly decline. And the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week ended June 15.
The economic and money supply reports only served to fuel speculation that the Fed might feel it needs to lower short-term interest rates again soon, and rates on short-term securities outstanding moved lower as the session progressed.
The prospect of a Fed easing also helped demand at an auction of one-year Treasury bills.
The new bills were sold at an average discount rate of 3.93 percent, down from the 4.07 percent average rate at the last one-year bill auction on May 28. It is the lowest rate on a one-year bill since the auction on Jan. 9, when the rate was 3.84 percent.
 
Benchmark Issue Yield
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 102 5/8, up 19/32, to yield 7.77 percent, compared with 7.82 percent late Wednesday. Yields on the benchmark issue have not been this low in nearly six months.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 18/32, up 13/32, to yield 7.13 percent. And the 5 7/8 percent three-year notes were offered at 101 13/32, up 5/32, to yield 5.34 percent.
The new two-year and five-year Treasury notes auctioned earlier this week continued to perform well.
The 5 percent two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 4.88 percent, compared with 4.95 percent late Wednesday. And the 6 3/8 percent five-year notes were offered in when-issued trading late yesterday at a price to yield 6.31 percent, compared with 6.40 percent late Wednesday.
In other developments, new-issue activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was heavy yesterday, as roughly $2.5 billion of short- and long-term debt securities were priced.
 
Big New York Offer
 By far the largest issuer was New York City, which offered a total of $1.4 billion worth of short-term tax and revenue anticipation notes at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by the First Boston Corporation won the bulk of the $700 million worth of tax anticipation notes.
The securities, which mature April 14, 1993, carry a coupon of 3 1/4 percent and were priced to yield 2.40 percent.
A bid from a group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company won $500 million of the $700 million revenue anticipation notes sold by the city.
These securities mature June 30, 1993, carry a coupon of 3.50 percent and were priced to yield 2.80 percent.
The tax anticipation notes, which are secured by city property taxes, are rated MIG-1 by Moody's Investors Service and SP1+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The revenue anticipation notes are secured by certain New York State aid payments. These securities are rated MIG-1 by Moody's and SP1 by Standard & Poor's.
Demand for the city notes was extremely strong, as more than $11 billion worth of bids were received for the securities sold, according to a news release from City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman.
 
Spiegel Bonds Offered
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Spiegel Inc. offered $250 million of certificates backed by credit card receipts through an underwriting group led by the First Boston Corporation.
The 6.95 percent notes, which have an average life of 5.08 years, were priced at $99.359 to yield 7.141 percent, 80 basis points, or one-hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on Treasury securities of comparable maturity.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues rose by about 1/8 point.
Demand for outstanding securities in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was good despite the flood of new issues. Traders said that prices of most widely quoted bonds rose by about 1/4 point.

HEADLINE: G.D.P. Revised Upward But Other Indicators Lag

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
The economy grew at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the first quarter, the briskest pace of the Bush Presidency, the Commerce Department said today.
But while the Administration insisted that the economy was clearly in a period of "modest growth," some private analysts were more cautious. 
 The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits shot up 3.8 percent, to 422,000, for the week ended June 13, the Labor Department said. The unexpectedly sharp increase, 16,000, from the previous week put the number of newly laid-off workers seeking jobless benefits at its highest level in six weeks.
 
Other Signs of Weakness
 Another sign of weakness: Sales of existing homes fell for the second straight month, falling 1.7 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.43 million units in May. The National Association of Realtors attributed the setbacks to rising mortgage rates.
Economists said the weakness in the housing sector and the labor market, coupled with a report Wednesday showing that orders for durable goods dropped sharply, could be pointing to an economy that is slowing down rather than revving up.
"The first quarter was a good starter, but the question is, can we maintain it, and the answer right now is that we are going to have trouble," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company of Chicago.
But Michael Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters that he was not overly concerned to see some economic indicators falling while others were rising.
"The economy is improving, but you can't expect every indicator to be up," he said. "Clearly, the economy is in a period of modest growth."
The Administration, worried about rising unemployment rates during an election year, has been keeping up pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further. Earlier this week, President Bush publicly called on the Fed to ease credit.
On that point, Mr. Boskin said, "It would be perhaps wise to realize the risks are greater on the sluggish growth side than they are on the reaccelerating inflation side."
 
Second-Quarter Pessimism
 The increase in the gross domestic product, the country's total output of goods and services, was revised up from a 2.4 percent estimate made a month ago. It represented the fastest growth since 1988's fourth quarter, when the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.9 percent. Since that time, the economy has been virtually stagnant or in outright recession.
The Bush Administration had forecast 2.9 percent growth for this year. In its semiannual economic review, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development today projected growth in the United States for 1992 at 2.1 percent, with 3.6 percent for next year.
The upward revision to the first-quarter G.D.P. report reflected new-found strength in housing construction, business investment and the country's trade performance.
Analysts said, however, that in the second quarter all those areas have weakened. And of even more concern, the biggest source of strength in the first quarter, a 5 percent rise in consumer spending, appears to have faltered in the current quarter, as Americans, worried about job losses, cut spending.
 
Economy Is 'Pretty Lethargic'
 Kevin Logan, an economist at the Swiss Bank Corporation, said the recovery still had a pulse beat, but "it's pretty lethargic right now."
The G.D.P. report did show that an inflation index that measures the prices paid by United States residents increased at a modest rate of 3 percent in the first three months of 1992. And an accompanying report showed that after-tax profits of American corporations jumped 11.3 percent in the first quarter, the biggest increase in nearly five years.
The various changes left G.D.P. at $4.9 trillion in the first three months of the year, after removing the effects of inflation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Heavy Selling Amid Rumors of Fed Move

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Heavy selling drove the dollar down sharply against major foreign currencies yesterday as traders reacted to rumors of central bank activity and a gloomy employment report.
Gold prices rose slightly. Gold for current delivery was quoted at $343.20 an ounce, up 40 cents from Wednesday's closing quote. A late bid at the Republic National Bank in New York quoted gold at $342.80 an ounce, up 15 cents. 
 Several currency traders said the dollar plunged after rumors swept the market that the Federal Reserve was checking price levels of the Japanese yen. If true, that would indicate that the central bank was poised to intervene in the market to support the dollar.
Andrew Hodge, vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York, said he had received no confirmation that the Fed actually was checking yen prices, let alone intervening on behalf of the dollar.
Mr. Hodge said the reports had hurt the dollar, as well as a Labor Department survey showing first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose by 16,000 in mid-June, an indication of growing economic weakness.
The second day of a national railroad shutdown was also cited by currency traders as a problem for the economy, which would weaken the dollar.
Jack Stapleton, vice president, Standard Chartered Bank in New York, said predictions that the economy would suffer even further weighed on many traders' minds.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 126.62 Japanese yen from 127.03 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 125.35 yen. At closing in New York, the dollar was 125.15, down from 126.45 late Wednesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8910, from $1.8780 late Wednesday. The pound was quoted at $1.8970 at closing in New York, more expensive than $1.8795 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.5375 German marks, down from 1.5500; 1.3830 Swiss francs, down from 1.4005; 5.1750 French francs, down from 5.2185; 1,163.00 Italian lire, down from 1,173.00, and 1.19175 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19565.

HEADLINE: The Wild Calls. Anybody Listening?

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM

 BODY:
WITH an uncanny precision that perhaps comes from knowing that no one else is counting, New York City officials can at a moment's notice announce precisely how many gallons of water currently reside in their complex system of regional reservoirs. Having automatic access to that water is essential to the city's well being. And such volume figures are most helpful when necessary to flush guilt through the modern consumer's civic psyche.
What have never been tracked so closely, however, are the city's equally vital reservoirs of serenity, those sirenless, automobile-alarm-free areas where urban residents of even modest means can fleetingly flee the city life they are paying so much to endure. In these rural refuges for humans where only visitors lock their cars, city people can pay large sums of money to accommodating local citizens to allow them to sleep, eat, hike, swim, canoe, read, acquire souvenirs and generally relax the way real people do routinely all over this country. 
 Judging by the volume of automobile, railroad, bus and airplane traffic attempting to exit New York on these summer Fridays, New Yorkers have a high serenity deficiency. For many generations, a favorite destination to mine repose has been the Adirondacks, organized since 1892 into the Adirondack State Park, that immense, troubled, much-romanticized upstate area where animals, lush scenery and good times abound and the air is invisible.
These six million acres -- the largest state park in the lower 48 states -- are actually a political patchwork of timberlands, public wilderness and private holdings whose incongruous juxtaposition and conflicting priorities guarantee, in perpetuity, almost as many disputes as trees.
Wild, at times, the Adirondacks certainly are. Beautiful, definitely. A colorful countryside contrasting starkly with the city's straight lines, numbered streets and manmade grays, but of course. However, only an Eastern urbanite accustomed to trees in concrete pots would call the Adirondacks a wilderness; for anyone else, the presence of 45 state campgrounds, 3,000 miles of biking and horse trails, countless canoes, 130,000 year-round residents, 250,000 more summer residents, potentially 400,000 additional homesites and nine million visiting wallets a year would very likely nudge the area out of the wilderness category.
But in many ways that region, its history and its stubborn problems, which receive only episodic attention in the polluted but politically powerful large television markets, are apt symbols of the rural-urban tensions bubbling at varying temperatures across the country.
A helpful backgrounder or fond reminiscence for any New Yorkers who have yet to flee this weekend is "Forever Wild: The Adirondack Experience," a current exhibition at the New-York Historical Society in Manhattan.
Organized by the Katonah Museum of Art for the park's centennial this year, the exhibition is an intriguing three-room collection of oil paintings, watercolors, photographs, postcards and Adirondack-style wooden furniture. Even the walls are trimmed in birchbark, the region's unregistered trademark.
The show effectively captures the flavor of the Adirondacks in the New York mind, which is the same as any American urban mind, only more so. "The weather is just lovely here," Annie wrote on a 1943 postcard to Loretta Williamson over on Madison Avenue. Scores of cards are imaginatively displayed within plastic windows affording views of both sides. "Having a fine time," Wilson wrote to Dr. A. B. Wright at his city home. "Go rowing, swimming and fishing about every day. Weather is cool and fine."
The exhibition also captures the romance of the place, lush oil landscapes caressing the beautiful unfenced countryside, outdoor life flowing on freely before human regulation was deemed necessary. A prominent theme of the 19th-century oils is tiny humans dwarfed by the immense landscape, Lake George reaching on toward the horizon where even a steamboat seems like a toy or a storm boiling up over the same scenic waters. William J. Stillman's canvas titled "The Philosophers' Camp in the Adirondacks" (1858) shows a group of men in their Adirondack camp looking off into the dark, forbidding woods that surround them.
Rustic romanticism hangs everywhere like moss, although Thomas Cole's 1827 portrayal of an impending Indian sacrifice may only be romantic as long as you're not the maiden at the cliff's edge.
There's a Winslow Homer of 1889 depicting a delicate flycast from a canoe. There's a snowy Frederick Remington oil from 1904 showing a blue-gray barn scene after those early winter sunsets. The light and warmth seeping from a nearby cabin door make viewers want to blow into their cupped hands. And to keep that flavor of the Adirondacks (actually a disparaging term meaning "bark eaters" used by the Iroquois to describe the hunting ability of their Algonquin enemies), the Adirondack exhibition also has a gruesome moose-leg lamp that almost certainly looked better on the moose.
Thanks to 19th-century photographic protocol, which forbade smiling on camera, Adirondack-users seem a pretty dour crowd, although this didn't stop them from clearcutting vast areas of virgin timber. Two centuries ago this year New York State, desperate for cash, started the resource scramble by selling off (the state did not call it privatizing) 3.6 million acres of wilderness to developers.
 
Syrup, Soaps, T-Shirts
 This being the Adirondacks, the show also has a souvenir shop offering everything from maple syrup, soaps, T-shirts and bird books to puppets, bug bottles, china and a jigsaw puzzle of backwoods outhouses. But save for one Pop Art watercolor juxtaposing a waterfall with a Hershey bar and tennis shoe, there is nothing to suggest the modern conflicts enveloping the Adirondacks and similar rural refuges with the misfortune to be so handy to so many.
From the Smokies to the Olympics, millions of presumably well-meaning city folks want to preserve these places for their pleasant escapes, their comforting thoughts and their hunting expeditions. Even on the crowded, cacophonous corners of filthy streets with worn curbs, there is a reassuring psychic charge to be had from thoughts of soft, needle-strewn paths, dainty does and fluoride-free water not far away. Naturally, these occasional visitors are pro-preservation, leading to a new definition for conservationists: Some people who built their summer home last year.
 
How Much Is Too Much?
 Many rural residents, year-round custodians of these surrounded sanctuaries of green, also want to preserve their lush life style. This is hard without work. Development might mean cutting trees for lumber, or approving new sites for septic tanks or for new attractions to get those wandering wallets to stop again. But how much development is too much for whom? And how do you find the balance in a divided legislature in an inattentive land that devotes live television time instead to learning the results of the Elvis stamp contest?
Answers don't seem to come easily on many emotional issues in a modern America adrift in its unappreciated natural bounty. What seems in short supply, besides domestic jobs and foreign enemies, is an old-fashioned willingness for reasoned discourse and careful listening. And therein lies the value of a thoughtful exhibition like this.
Yes, it wallows in the rural romanticism of urban ignorance: the vast Kodacolor vistas, the quiet fear-free paths, the treasured moments of shared leisure that linger long in family memory. No, the exhibition does not portray the mosquitoes that also reside there. There are no acid rains in this indoor Adirondacks, no vandals spraying graffiti onto ancient rocks, no carbon-copy condos with tax-deductible mortgages, no economic refugees fleeing to other regions, no McDonald's blasting out the odor of hot fat, no septic tanks seeping sewage into overloaded soil.
So what? The exhibition, indeed the Adirondack-type memory for many, is like a ferocious wild animal, a beguiling wet stone or an innocent lightning bug. In their natural habitat -- the fabled forest, the dappled depths of a clear brook or the cool dusk darkness of a bush -- these things are wild and beautiful, even quietly inspiring.
The instinct of humans, however, is to seize these wild sights with cameras, with postcards, with rifles and souvenirs, even with museum exhibitions, as if grabbing, possessing and transporting a piece of wild somehow enhances us and preserves it. This explains the existence of taxidermists (and trees in pots).
But the moment you plop a burly bear into an ersatz cave in some concrete-laden city park, the moment the colorful river stone dries to a drab brown on the car's backseat or the 10th time that intriguing, illuminative insect falls back down inside the glass jar to wiggle helplessly on its back, you begin to realize that wild is wild and captured is captured. And captured wild cannot be.

HEADLINE: Doing Right by Russia

 BODY:
Finally, Boris Yeltsin has won a victory he has richly earned: economic help from the West. For six months the Russian President has implemented astonishingly bold market reforms, pushed his country to democracy and, last week, proffered momentous nuclear cuts. The West, after having given him many warm words and little cold cash, finally has its priorities straight.
The International Monetary Fund has decided to lend Russia $1 billion before working out the details of economic reform. It's a big win for all sides. Under the arrangement, Russia gets cash that will preserve reform, and democracy. And the I.M.F. gets time to hammer out a long-term plan satisfactory to Western creditors. 
 Until now, the I.M.F. balked at putting up money before it was completely satisfied with Russian policies. It deserves credit for reversing course. President Bush deserves applause as well, for delivering on his promise to press the I.M.F. to accept a sound, even if not perfect, agreement.
In April the West promised Russia $24 billion in 1992 to bridge the vulnerable period between breakdown of centralized controls and the rise of a functioning market. The money was to import desperately needed food and raw materials and to create a fund to stabilize the ruble, a prerequisite for international trade. The catch was that no money would be released until Russia adopted a plan acceptable to the monetary fund.
Russia needed no prodding. It had already begun decontrolling prices, cutting its deficit in half. This month, the Parliament passed a sweeping plan to privatize state enterprises. The pace of reform has been astonishing.
Yet the I.M.F. insisted on imposing a series of crippling conditions. Russia agreed to stop paying for its deficit by printing rubles and thereby accelerating inflation. But the fund insisted that Russia balance its budget without Western aid -- even though the aid would substitute for printing rubles. The fund wanted Russia to begin immediately to pay off debt of the other republics, even while its own economy was collapsing. In the name of market reform, the fund became an obstacle to reform.
The fund has reason to worry, for example, about recent decisions to back away from decontrolling oil prices and to reinstate subsidies to failing state enterprises, decisions that will jack up the deficit. It frets, justifiably, that Russia can't control excessive printing of rubles as long as central banks in the other republics do as they please.
But Russia acknowledges these problems. They are matters of execution, not principle. Mr. Yeltsin has proved, by bold deeds, that he's prepared to make reform work. He needs and deserves the West's help. He has earned this I.M.F. yes.

HEADLINE: Reagan Can't Shift the Blame to Congress

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Bush Leads the Way" (Op-Ed, June 10), Ronald Reagan makes the assertion that Congress "has shown little restraint in spending" and therefore Congress alone is responsible for our debt-burdened condition. The former President also accuses unnamed "pundits" of playing "the blame game" by critizing the White House for this mountain of debt.
It is true that only Congress can pass a budget (and therefore must shoulder some of the responsibility for the fiscal disaster of the 1980's), but it is the President who offers a budget to Congress. Mr. Reagan's claim that Congress is solely to blame for the massive budget deficits is similar to A blaming B because B did not prevent A from committing a crime -- that is, it is patently false. 
 During his Presidency, Mr. Reagan never once offered anything even resembling a balanced budget -- instead, deficits upward of $300 billion became normal.
We must also keep in mind that in the eight years when Mr. Reagan was President, more debt piled up than under all previous Presidents, spanning two centuries, combined.
The huge debt amassed under the Reagan Administration was not, as Mr. Reagan charges, the result of "entitlement" programs, like Social Security and Medicare. It was the result of large increases in the military budget, combined with large tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans.
Mr. Reagan's goal of saving money in Government operations, while it was surely worthwhile and laudable, in no way extended to military spending. Indeed, during his Administrations tens of billions of taxpayer dollars were simply thrown away on vast amounts of waste, fraud and abuse, not to mention weapons systems that never worked.
Another assertion of Mr. Reagan's, that it is unfair of Congress to inflict "new burdens on state and local government without providing the money to finance them," is also shifting the blame. It was the Reagan Administration, not Congress, that introduced budgets calling for massive cuts in state and local aid.
It is wrong of Mr. Reagan to blame Congress for the economic calamity that he left behind as his legacy. Then again, when we consider the many deceptions that were offered to the people of the United States during his Administration, we should not at all be surprised.

HEADLINE: Serbs React With Anguish As the U.N. Sanctions Bite

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, June 25

 BODY:
The war in Bosnia has come home to Serbia.
Though it has not experienced any fighting on its soil or lost a single inch of territory, this largest and most populous part of fragmented Yugoslavia is reeling under United Nations sanctions imposed to punish its leaders for provoking and sustaining fighting across its borders. 
 With the economy all but capsized and Serbian politics turning increasingly stormy, it is no longer possible, as it was a month ago, for people in this capital to view the fighting in Bosnia as remote from their daily lives. Now, as the sanctions' bite grows more painful each day, waiters and cabdrivers routinely but apprehensively ask foreign customers when America will bomb Belgrade.
 
Inflations Soars Daily
 It has been slightly more than three weeks since the Security Council moved to bar all trade with Serbia and its allied republic of Montenegro, except for humanitarian aid, and to cut air links. Since then the economy has gone from eccentric to fully crazed. Inflation has zoomed to the point where, measured by the prevailing rates for foreign currency, it is climbing at more than 10 percent a day. The important textile industry has shut down. Most construction projects have been suspended.
Tens of thousands of people have been given paid leaves financed by sending the already high-speed printing of dinars into inflationary overdrive. Next week tens of thousands more are scheduled to lose their jobs.
Three weeks ago a 5,000 dinar note, the largest denomination available, had a value of about $550. Today, both banks and the legions of street hustlers exchanging money are delighted to trade a 5,000 dinar note for $2.70.
 
Hard on Pensioners
 For pensioners the effect has been particularly devastating. A woman in her 60's who worked for 25 years in a chemical plant said the other day that her entire monthly payment of 35,000 dinars would buy no more than 44 loaves of bread, or three-quarters of a tank of gas for her son-in-law's car if he gave her the right ration coupons.
"Only the criminals can live on what they earn now," said Milos Vlasic, an editor at a news magazine. "The rest of us are living on the foreign money we have kept in our mattresses. When those dollars and Deutsche marks are gone, I can't imagine what people will do."
Under such volatile conditions, the facade of aloofness from war that Serbia's leader, Slobodan Milosevic, was able to project here, even as he was encouraging Serbs to fight for territory beyond the republic's borders, is tearing sharply. So is the tight control he has maintained over political debate and dissent.
For the last 11 days, students occupying the university, where the enrollment is 80,000, are demanding that Mr. Milosevic "step down and go away."
The bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which is sometimes described as "more Serbian than Christian," have also called for Mr. Milosevic to resign in favor of a "Government of National Salvation."
 
A Rally Is Planned
 The more formal political opposition, long stymied by Mr. Milosevic's control of television and by the wide appeal of his image as a uniter of all Serbs, is organizing a rally for this Sunday that its leaders say is sure to stagger the Government, if not yet bring it down. The main figure in this opposition, Vuk Draskovic, a 44-year-old writer and lawyer, said the protest, which was originally scheduled for last week, was delayed until St. Vitas Day, the most significant date in Serbian history.
Not only does it mark Serbia's nation-building defeat in the battle of Kosovo in 1389 and the beginning of what was to be 500 years of occupation by the Turks, but it is also the day chosen by a Serbian nationalist named Gavrilo Princip to assassinate Archduke Francis Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, while he was visiting Sarajevo in 1914. The shooting ignited World War I.
"Every Serb is aware of history," said Mr. Draskovic, a bearded and long-haired man who, dressed in floral Hawaiian shirts and with a retinue of bodyguards, looks like a rock star. Asked about the potential for violence at the demonstration, he said it was taking place on the only day of the year when it was "unthinkable for Serbs to kill Serbs."
"We expect our rally will mark the beginning of the end of Communist rule and a new and better time for Serbs, for Serbia and for Europe," he said.
Adding still more yeast to the suddenly heady brew of Serbia's politics, the son of Yugoslavia's last King is scheduled to arrive here this weekend intent on eventually restoring the monarchy that ended when his father, King Peter, fled the throne as Nazi forces invaded. Although he speaks Serbo-Croatian only haltingly, the pretender, Alexander Karajorjevic, has generated some support among young people, who seem to regard him less for his royal lineage than for the understanding and respect for democracy they assume he acquired by living in Britain. For some others, the monarchy is revered as a link to the pre-Communist past.
 
'Anything Can Happen'
 "We can see for him a role like that of Juan Carlos in Spain," said Voja Kalic, a 25-year-old philosophy student taking part in the university protest. "He may be the only person in this country who can attract enthusiasm from people like us and also appeal to the people in the countryide who are supporting Milosevic because they think he will bring them their dreams of Greater Serbia."
A few days ago a local newspaper used the headline "Anything Can Happen" to describe the political situation that has developed in the wake of sanctions. In the article and in seemingly never-ending discussions in every restaurant and coffeehouse, the possibilities suggested range from the toppling of Mr. Milosevic by the kind of peaceful protests that succeeded in Czechoslovakia to dire warnings of civil war in Serbia or an even wider conflict that would once again directly involve Serbs and Croats.
Fears are being expressed that students at the university might be attacked by workers, the police or any of several paramilitary groups to inhibit attendance at the Sunday rally. When a delegation planning the demonstration week asked for Government assurances that the army would not intervene, they were told by Dobrica Cosic, the nationalist writer chosen by Mr. Milosevic to head a new Yugoslav Federation that links just Serbia and Montenegro, that he could not offer them such a pledge.
A view widely held among Mr. Milosevic's critics is that he has in the past vaulted over problems in Serbia by aggressively defending Serbs and Serbian interests in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. "Whenever he runs into trouble at home he extends the field of battle," said Miodrag Perolic, a mathematician who publishes on opposition monthly, Monitor, in Montenegro.
 
A Diversion Is Suspected
 Such analysis, on the first anniversary of Croatia's and Slovenia's secession from Yugoslavia, has led some of Mr. Milosevic's opponents to suspect that the Government may try to divert attention from its difficulties by raising the nationalist banner over Kosovo. Although two million ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, it lies dear to the hearts of all Serbs as the site of their defeat by the Turks. A few of the critics said their suspicions grew after Serbian forces surrounded an Islamic school in Pristina on Wednesday to prevent the Kosovo Albanians from convening a parliament they had chosen in clandestine balloting.
But there is mounting evidence to suggest that however much Mr. Milosevic might be tempted to confront the students, the political opposition or the Albanians, he is constrained from doing so by the sanctions.
On the outskirts of Vukovar, a Croatian city of 43,000 that Serbian guns blasted into a stark wasteland during three months last fall, ethnic Serbs complained that the region they had carved out of Croatia and renamed Krinea was in danger of being sold out by Belgrade.
Even more indicative of Mr. Milosevic's reduced options has been the silence of the Government-controlled news media about recent attacks by Croats against ethnic Serbian units across a six-month-old cease-fire line. The television and radio here have played down the news, presumably to keep the public from either demanding military action, which could only bring about greater isolation and international reprisals, or from asking whether in the light of Croatian gains and their own current sacrifices, Government policies had been worthwhile.
In the absence of a military option, it appears the Government continues to pin its hopes on some miraculous political stratagem that will lead to a reduction of sanctions without forcing the resignation of the leadership here.
In this vein, there were reports today that Mr. Cosic, who has not yet appointed a Yugoslav Prime Minister, as he was constitutionally obliged to do two days ago, is continuing discussions with Milan Panic, a naturalized American and a millionaire entrepreneur from California, in hopes of persuading him to take the post. Mr. Panic had earlier refused to consider such an offer.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 27, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of a computer transmission error, an article yesterday about effects felt in Serbia from the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina described the drop in the value of the currency incorrectly. While inflation has sometimes climbed at a rate of more than 10 percent a day, in the three weeks since sanctions were imposed the value of a 5,000-dinar note dropped to $2.70 from about $5.50, not $550.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sends Mobutu a Message By Welcoming a Cleric-Critic

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
With negotiations to bring democracy to Zaire entering a critical phase in Kinshasa, the Bush Administration has given an unusually high-level welcome to a Roman Catholic archbishop who is leading the movement for change in the Central African country.
The cleric, Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya, the Archbishop of Kisangani, said today that he had come to ask for the moral support of the United States as he begins negotiations with President Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's dictator for 27 years, to install a new prime minister and open the way to more representative government. 
 Archbishop Monsengwo predicted that if the effort fails, there will be "an apocalypse" in Zaire, where nearly a year of turmoil and the loss of foreign aid has created an economic and social crisis.
The Administration, sending a strong message to President Mobutu, arranged meetings for the Archbishop with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and other high State Department officials; with Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, and with Karl Jackson, Vice President Dan Quayle's foreign policy adviser.
 
McNamara Turns Up
 At the International Monetary Fund, which like the World Bank has suspended help to Zaire because of President Mobutu's repressive policies, the Archbishop was welcomed by Michel Camdessus, the managing director. He also met with Robert S. McNamara, a former Defense Secretary and a former head of the World Bank.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a reception for the Archbishop, who was brought to the United States by the Africa Faith and Justice Network, an association supported by Christian religious orders. Two committee members, Senators Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, and Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, have pressed the Administration to cut ties to President Mobutu. For them, the message from the Administration was not strong enough.
"I'm pleased at the general reception for the Archbishop," Senator Simon said in an interview today. "But I think we have to convey more clearly that we are on the side of the people of Zaire. My own reading is that the State Department would like to shift on the policy, but the White House does not want a break with Mobutu because President Bush feels that Mobutu was with us during the cold war, and we shouldn't turn our backs on our friends.
 
National Effort
 "Past friendship alone should not determine foreign policy," Senator Simon said.
Archbishop Monsengwo, 52 years old, is president of a national council that has been trying for a year to draft a constitution and form a transitional democratic government for Zaire leading to elections.
President Mobutu has put pressure on the conference, often with troops, and had repeatedly sought to have it abolished. He has drawn strong messages of condemnation from the United States for his actions. But the Bush Administration has stopped short of openly forcing the removal of the Zairian leader, who allowed his country to be used as a base for rebels fighting Angola's Marxist Government in the 1970's and 1980's.
Archbishop Monsengwo said today that he believed that President Mobutu would have to be consulted and cajoled into accepting change to avoid civil conflict in Zaire, where soldiers have mutinied for lack of pay and citizens are running out of patience as hardships increase.
In Zaire, as in Kenya, Malawi and Zambia, churches have played a leading role in the democracy movement. On Feb. 16, Zairian churches organized a march in Kinshasa, which was attacked by policemen. At least 32 people were killed.
Early this month, the Zairian bishops issued a declaration outlining a program against "injustice, egoism and untruth." The document assailed a range of what it saw as economic, social and moral shortcomings on the part of the Government, mentioning "nepotism and clientage," a disastrous education system and a moribund health service.

International
An angry American steel industry has decided to seek tariffs totaling billions of dollars on imports from Japan, the European Community, Canada and more than a dozen third world countries. The companies plan to file nearly 100 suits on Tuesday -- the day Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan is scheduled to visit President Bush and before the economic summit meeting [Page 37.]
 
The Economy
Personal income grew just three-tenths of 1 percent and consumer spending rose five-tenths of 1 percent in May, but analysts said the increases would not be enough to spur a dull economic recovery. [37.] 
 When the rail strike began on Thursday, traffic managers like Doug Ely of Kransco, a toymaker based in San Francisco, moved from the corporate background to become the most important people at their companies, finding alternative shippers. [39.]
 
Markets
Globex got under way at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange with more sound than fury, and that was as its planners intended. The goal for the first night -- and even the first few months -- of the new 24-hour electronic futures trading system was simply to make sure that it worked. [37.]
A summer lull settled over Wall Street, with the Dow Jones industrial average slipping 1.60 points, to 3,282.41, and volume shrinking. [40.]
Prices of Treasury securities were basically unchanged in very slow trading. Dealers closed their books and waited for a series of important economic reports next week. [40.]
The dollar was mixed against leading foreign currencies. Gold prices also fell. [46.] Cocoa futures prices rose to a three-and-a-half-week high, but analysts disagreed on the reasons and were reluctant to declare an end to the downward spiral that brought prices to a 19-year low earlier in the week. [46.]
 
Companies
Digital Equipment said it would spend more than $300 million over the next three years to buy 10 percent of Ing. C. Olivetti & Company, the troubled Italian computer maker. [39.]
A court victory was won against two Olympia & York affiliates by one of the nation's largest pension funds, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America. The ruling, which concludes that the troubled Canadian real-estate company reneged on a $250 million loan agreement in 1983, could imperil the developer's efforts to avoid a huge bankruptcy filing in the United States. [37.]
Robert Mondavi Winery resigned from the Wine Institute, the California wine industry's primary lobbying body because of differences with E.& J. Gallo Winery, its largest member. The withdrawal is a significant blow to the institute. [39.]
Rodale Press is the fountainhead of an all-natural mainstream, but some critics contend that the company is more willing to consult customer data bases than its conscience. [37.]
Intel declines to name its powerful new microprocessor the 586, putting aside the "86" moniker it has used for 14 years. The new chip, which has the code name P-5, has more than three million transistors and will be introduced in September. [39.]
 
Today's Columns
The I.R.S. dismissed Beverley P. Addison as a revenue agent in 1985 and later sent her a bill for back taxes.

HEADLINE: Big U.S. Steelmakers to Seek Billions in Tariffs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
An angry American steel industry has decided to seek billions of dollars in tariffs on imports from Japan, the European Community, Canada and more than a dozen third world countries.
The six large American integrated steel producers plan to file nearly 100 trade complaints on Tuesday seeking protection from foreign competition -- on the day Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan is scheduled to arrive here on an official visit and a week before President Bush meets with the leaders of the seven leading industrial democracies in Munich, Government and steel industry officials said. 
 These complaints amount to "a declaration of economic warfare," one European Community official said.
The Bush Administration has quietly tried to persuade the steel companies to postpone their filings at least until after the Munich summit meeting to prevent harm to America's diplomatic relations. Steel trade cases, like auto cases, tend to result in diplomatic frictions because steel companies employ hundreds of thousands of people around the world and are often regarded as important for national security.
The Japanese Government has joined with Japanese steel companies, which own large stakes or have joint ventures with all six big American steel companies, in an aggressive but unsuccessful campaign to persuade American steelmakers to leave Japan out of the trade cases.
But the United States steel industry is planning to go ahead with the filings anyway for several reasons, five people involved in the cases say.
For one thing, the companies are furious at the Bush Administration for refusing to file the cases itself, which would have spared American executives the embarrassment of confronting Japanese business partners, whom they increasingly rely on for investment and technology.
For another thing, top steel executives feel they are legally obliged, by the risk of shareholder lawsuits, to take every opportunity under American law to minimize competition. Steel imports totaled $7.8 billion last year, or 17.8 percent of the market.
The steel companies plan a news conference on Tuesday, to be attended by senators and representatives from steel-producing states as well as the heads of most of the big steel companies. People involved in the case insisted that Tuesday had been chosen because all the officials would be in Washington, not because of the arrival of Mr. Miyazawa.
Like the Japanese officials, European, Mexican and Canadian officials have expressed alarm to the Bush Administration. A senior European Community official said that as soon as the cases were filed, the community would immediately seek to block them by appealing to the Geneva-based secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the international arbitration panel for trade disputes.
A senior Japanese official said his Government was irritated at the prospect of the steel complaints, noting that Tokyo warned on June 7 that it might file its first GATT cases against the United States.
Mexican and Canadian officials have been seeking modifications to United States trade laws as part of a nearly completed free-trade pact the three nations are negotiating. These officials have expressed concern to their American counterparts that the trade cases could harm the negotiations and result in retaliatory actions by their domestic industries.
 
No Pact on Steel Exports
 The United States has not had a lot of steel-trade cases since 1984, when it imposed import restrictions that expired on March 31 of this year. International negotiations in Geneva have failed to produce an agreement limiting countries from subsiziding their steel exports and barring industries from selling their steel below cost in foreign markets.
The steel companies face a difficult legal battle in which the strength of their cases will depend partly on how many countries they include, said Gary C. Hufbauer, a trade policy specialist at the Institute of International Economics, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. Each additional country means the inclusion of more of the American market, which makes it easier to prove before the International Trade Commission, an independent Federal agency, that the imports are the source of the American industry's troubles.
The United States steel industry has decided to include as many countries as possible in the complaints because of concerns about a change in direction at the commission.
 
What Damages an Industry
 With three new commissioners on the six-member panel, the commission has been looking more closely at the causes of an industry's troubles and less at its overall financial condition. In particular, the commission is looking at whether imports have claimed a large enough market share to have an appreciable effect on the industry.
The Commerce Department can only impose tariffs after a ruling by the commission that imports are hurting the domestic industry seeking protection. The commission shocked the steel industry on June 10 when it ruled in an early test case involving steel rails that imports from Britain and Luxembourg but not imports from Japan were hurting the United States .
This new perspective at the commission is forcing the American steel industry to include as many countries as possible in its filings, especially Japan, so that their combined market shares add up to a large enough percentage to appear threatening to the domestic industry.
The six American producers -- Bethlehem Steel, USX, LTV, Inland Steel, Armco and National Steel -- are seeking tariffs on imported steel that would allow them to raise the price of domestically produced steel. The domestic industry sought quotas on the tonnage of imported steel in the early 1980's when it was still an oligopoly with fairly little price competition, and could make a profit on each ton of steel sold.
But the import quotas are no longer providing much protection because the tonnage of imports has fallen and the quotas are no longer being filled.
In the last decade, the large integrated steel companies, which make steel from raw iron ore, have also been ravaged by price competition from small steel mills that recycle scrap steel. At the same time, the fall of the dollar and the increasing competitiveness of domestic mills have meant that the tonnage of imported steel has fallen. With the exception of some specialty steel products, import quotas are not being filled, so importers are not bidding up a scarce supply of foreign steel and prices have fallen.
The main question then for the American steel industry is whether the International Trade Commission will attribute the industry's problems to competition from dwindling imports rather than from the new small mills. The small mills, led by Nucor, are not joining the trade cases but will also benefit if prices rise.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voices -- Atlanta;
On Political Expediency and the Price of War

 BODY:
Political experts, local officials and ordinary voters in several cities were asked to appraise President Bush's handling of the Persian Gulf war.
 
Charles W. Scott
60 years old; retired Army colonel who is now a consultant and lecturer on the Middle East; one of the American hostages in Iran in 1979-80
In the broadest sense, the Persian Gulf war was a tremendous military victory in terms of logistics, tactics and strategy. 
 There have been some very positive things that have come out of the war. One is the realization that American technology and American power is real. The Vietnam syndrome has been set aside. On the negative side, we've learned that we can't afford to do that very often.
It's an oversimplification to say General Schwarzkopf should just have gone all the way to Baghdad. If he had done that, the United Nations coalition that supported this operation certainly would have fallen apart. And by the time he got to Baghdad, Norm probably would have gotten a phone call from Saddam sitting in Tripoli or Algeria.
 
Kenneth W. Stein
46 years old; associate professor of Middle Eastern history and political science at Emory University and director of Middle Eastern Studies at the Carter Presidential Center
During the 1980's, the United States' attitude toward Iraq was characteristic of the way we shaped our foreign policy in the Middle East -- in a stealth fashion, essentially by the executive branch.
We developed our attitude toward Iraq out of political expediency: "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." And since Iraq was Iran's enemy, therefore Iraq was our friend. We did not want to know more than we needed to know about Saddam's domestic behavior. It was not so much a policy as a stopgap of political expediency.
After the war, the Bush Administration took the attitude that one of two things would happen: either there would be a coup within the military that would oust Saddam, or that economic sanctions would cause internal turmoil that would bring him to his knees. But Saddam is the quintessential survivor. Saddam lives to fight another day. And the irony is that he may well outlast in power the man who defeated him militarily.
 
 Daniel S. Papp
40 years old; professor of international affairs at the Georgia Institute of Technology
It's been said that United States policy in the Persian Gulf has been inconsistent over the past few years. But, in fact, the United States policy for the last 50 years in the headwaters of Persian Gulf has been very consistent: to guarantee, to the greatest extent, that the area not fall under the control of a hegemonic power who may have intentions adverse to American interests.
I would argue that the Persian Gulf war was worth the price we paid because it did have two positive outcomes aside from getting Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. First, it illustrated the American capability to put together a very diverse coalition. It was one of the most adroit diplomatic, political maneuvers of recent years. Second, it was a crucial factor in bringing the Israelis and the Arabs to the peace table.
The Persian Gulf war was not a war fought purely for oil. For one thing, it was appropriate to demonstrate that in the 1990's invading one's neighbor is not the way to solve one's problems. The international community did come together in strong support of getting Saddam out of Kuwait. At the same time, had we left Saddam there, he would have had control of something like 38 percent of the world's known oil reserves and he would have been sitting there menacing Saudi Arabia. On that basis, it had to be done.

HEADLINE: Albany Session Limps to an Unproductive Close

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 26

 BODY:
A legislative session that once held great promise now appears to be dwindling to an anticlimactic close, with state lawmakers failing so far to agree on many of the most critical issues facing the state, from economic development to Medicaid to environmental protection.
With the Senate and Assembly planning to recess within days, legislative aides and Cuomo administration officials said today that a proposal to have the state take over local Medicaid costs was close to death. The same was true of a bill intended to discourage adolescent smoking by limiting vending machines and requiring antismoking advertising in public places where cigarette ads are displayed. 
 Officials in the Republican-controlled State Senate also said that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's two primary economic development initiatives were in serious trouble. One bill would authorize a November referendum on an $800 million bond act that would create jobs through infrastructure projects. The other would greatly expand the power of the State Thruway Authority, using it to finance construction projects along the Thruway corridor and giving it control of the state canal system.
And two environmental bills, one that would create an environmental trust fund with the state's bottle and can deposits and another that would strengthen wilderness protections in the Adirondacks, appear unlikely to go anywhere.
"You are now on the verge of an extremely disappointing session," said Mr. Cuomo, acknowledging in a news conference that many of his pet initiatives were in danger. "There's still time to make different judgments, but as of this moment this could be a disastrously nonproductive session."
The last days of the legislative session are always tricky, with long stretches of inaction pierced by frenzied activity in which dozens of bills are traded for one another and passed at the last minute. Legislative aides are saying that two things might break the logjam this year: the Republican Senate's desire to allow Nassau and Suffolk Counties to impose new taxes and incur new debt to close budget gaps, and the Democratic Assembly's need to alter its legislative redistricting plan to conform to a Justice Department order.
"The only way I think some of these things could be resurrected are in the bigger matrix of things, if something broke and all of a sudden things started getting traded," said one Senate aide, who requested anonymity. "You have to look at all this as part of a mix where you say, 'We'll give them that thing,' and they say, 'We'll give you this thing.' "
James A. Yates, the counsel to Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, said that it would be a mistake to conclude that the Legislature had done nothing. He said that many important bills, such as an overhaul of the state's trust and estates law, had drawn little attention because they were less glamorous than some other issues.
"The items that make a leader's list or attract media attention are just the tip of the iceberg," he said. "There's a mass of legislation we've done that never makes the front page."
Much of the legislative inaction on the more controversial pieces of legislation can be attributed to classic Albany inertia, in which lawmakers in the divided Legislature try to put off tough decisions until some hazy point in the future. But this is an unusual year, a time when the Legislature has also been obsessed with its own redistricting problems and with fears of what tetchy voters might do in the November elections.
 
New Maps Take Time
 Mr. Cuomo said today that the Legislature's preoccupation with redistricting -- in addition to drawing its own lines, it was charged with drawing new lines for New York's Congressional delegation -- had "consumed" the Legislature and served as a "retardant" on the session.
The issue drags on still. On Monday, New York State's highest court, the Court of Appeals, will hear the Legislature's appeal of a lower court ruling that overturned the new state lines. If the court upholds the decision, the Legislature may have to return and refashion its plan.
In addition to focusing on redistricting, lawmakers are particularly worried about the fall elections. "The Legislature is trying hard not to take action on measures that would alienate important constituencies," said Robert Jaffe, who lobbies the legislature on health and other issues.
A couple of months ago the session seemed particularly promising, because for the first time in years the state budget was passed just after its deadline, April 1, giving lawmakers three whole months to deal with the rest of their agenda. But on some matters, such as an overhaul of the state's health insurance system, negotiators for the Governor and the Legislature seem stuck on the same issues that divided them when they began talking.
The session was actually supposed to end today, and all week long legislative leaders had promised their members that they would close on time. But the deadline faded away as the Assembly debated for more than five hours about a bill that would outlaw the practice of selling babies through surrogate parent arrangements, and finally passed the measure. The Senate had passed the bill with no debate earlier in the week.
Legislative leaders also agreed today on a bill to sell property at the Aqueduct Race Track to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for $50 million to raise money to balance the state's budget.
On Thursday, the Assembly debated for five and a half hours and then finally passed a bill that would establish universal health care in New York State. Today, with great fanfare, the Senate passed a bill that would allow voters to decide in a referendum whether juries should be allowed to impose the death penalty in first-degree murder cases.
But both actions were essentially symbolic, because neither measure has any chance of getting through the other chamber in its current form.
At a news conference today, Governor Cuomo predicted that some of the unresolved issues would return in the fall to haunt legislators.
Mr. Cuomo has promised to make a particular campaign issue out of the Senate's apparent failure to agree to his Medicaid proposal, a complex and expensive plan in which the state would gradually assume Medicaid costs currently being paid by New York City and the state's counties. In exchange, the state would be allowed to keep the revenue generated by the city's personal income tax and by the sales taxes in the state's 57 counties.
Mr. Cuomo estimated that the plan would save $1.6 billion annually for local governments by the year 2000. The Assembly Democrats supported the plan, but the Senate Republicans said they were concerned that it would burden the state with huge new costs that would not be offset by an economic recovery or by cuts in Medicaid programs.

HEADLINE: U.S. Presses Ousted Haitian Chief To Negotiate a Return From Exile

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 26

 BODY:
In a push to end a nine-month political standoff, the United States has begun urging Haiti's deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to meet with the country's army-backed Prime Minister to negotiate his return from exile and the lifting of an international embargo.
While the new approach falls short of outright recognition for the recently formed Government of Prime Minister Marc L. Bazin, the pressure on Father Aristide to negotiate represents a strong shift from recent statements supporting the exiled President's right to choose his own prime minister. 
 In recent weeks, American diplomats have spoken caustically of Mr. Bazin, a former World Bank official who they said had struggled for months to block an internationally brokered settlement of the crisis that began with the violent overthrow of Father Aristide last September.
More recently, diplomats had also complained that Mr. Bazin's nomination as Prime Minister was secured with the support of less than the required majority of Haitian senators.
 
Pledge for Negotiations
 Since his inauguration a week ago, however, Mr. Bazin has repeatedly pledged his willingness to negotiate with Father Aristide.
Calling Mr. Bazin a political force to be reckoned with, a senior State Department official credited the de facto Prime Minister with securing the removal of Haiti's provisional president, in theory clearing the way for Father Aristide's return. "Clearly that is important movement if you are trying to resolve this situation," the official said.
Diplomats explaining the new approach also spoke of a growing disenchantment with Father Aristide, who they said had recently failed to play a constructive role, preferring instead, as one official said, to "make speeches and tour the Haitian diaspora."
Several diplomats said Father Aristide had adopted an unacceptable strategy of simply waiting for hemisphere-wide economic sanctions imposed on Haiti last October to generate serious political unrest, which they said he believes represents his best hope of returning to power.
 
U.S. Approach Criticized
 Haitian officials loyal to Father Aristide have rejected those assertions and strongly criticized what they see as a reversal of Washington's approach to the crisis.
"Mr. Bazin represents the best form of disenfranchisement of the Haitian people," said Jean Casimir, Father Aristide's Ambassador to Washington. "The person who was resoundingly defeated is now being put forward through all sorts of devious means. They are asking us to spit on our constitution. We are being told that democracy is for rich, white countries and that black, poor countries should be practical."
Father Aristide, a populist priest, won Haiti's fist democratic elections in December 1990 with over two-thirds of the vote. Mr. Bazin, a conservative rival, placed a distant second.
Since the immediate aftermath of his overthrow in a military coup Father Aristide has called for a purging of the army, starting with the commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras. General Cedras and other senior army officers have repeatedly ruled out Father Aristide's return as President.
 
Stronger Embargo Urged
 With signs that Haiti's small elite is now seriously chafing under economic sanctions, aides to Father Aristide have called for a more vigorous enforcement of the embargo and the cancellation of American visas for senior political and military figures in Haiti. Already, Washington has canceled more than a score of visas.
"The military's selection of Bazin is to me an indication of their awareness that they need to do some things," said Michael Barnes, a former American Congressman who is advising the Aristide government-in-exile. "If Washington is worried about where we go to from here, they are right. We're worried too. But this is a case where the old medicine may still work."
Diplomats at the Organization of American States, which has sponsored sporadic discussions between Father Aristide and political leaders in Haiti, have expressed mixed opinions about the efforts to urge Father Aristide to work with Mr. Bazin.
Citing fast deteriorating economic conditions in the country and widespread human rights abuses, some diplomats backed negotiations with Mr. Bazin. Others, however, expressed skepticism that a lasting political settlement could be built around the new Prime Minister, a bitter enemy of Father Aristide, whom they blame for scuttling past negotiating efforts.
One Latin Ambassador whose views were echoed by several other O.A.S. officials said Father Aristide would be committing "political suicide" to accept Mr. Bazin, a politician whose years in Washington have given him the image of an internationally imposed candidate. On the other hand, he said, whatever Mr. Bazin's sincerity, he could never prevail upon the army to accept the President's return.
"To many of us, this seems like a Band-Aid that is tempting because it may keep things quiet as long as it sticks," the diplomat said. "But like all Band-Aids, it seems destined to fall off."

HEADLINE: Uncharted Territory Ahead as Trains Roll Again

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
Railroads around the country moved quickly to resume normal service today, ending the two-day chokehold on industries that rely on the rails and the threat of no service for tens of thousands of commuters in the Northeast.
Just after 1 A.M. today, President Bush signed into law binding arbitration that was approved by Congress late Thursday night. 
 But neither side involved in the dispute seemed particularly pleased by the outcome. Union leaders said they resented the binding arbitration, and the railroads gave it only a slightly warmer reception, saying that it was uncharted territory at best.
"We've been negotiating for four years, and when we get to the point where the law allows us to exercise our right to strike, Congress intervenes in a way that is going to make it very difficult for us to win legitimate wages and working conditions," said Jed Dodd, chief negotiator for the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees.
 
'This Is Brand New'
 Edwin L. Harper, president of the Association of American Railroads, which represents freight lines, said the new law applies only to the current situation and not to future disputes.
"I wouldn't draw the implication that this is the way it is going to be forever or that it impinges on the right of unions to strike," Mr. Harper said. "This is brand new. I think the Congress is as curious as we are on how this is going to work."
Whatever its prospects, the law did immediately set trains back in motion. Farmers, travelers, manufacturers and even a group of circus performers all expressed relief after experiencing inconveniences and worrying about the prospects of major economic losses.
A unit of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, which had been stranded in Lafayette, La., loaded up and moved out this morning to Jackson, Miss..
 
Busier by the Hour
 The American Association of Railroads reported that 70 percent of all freight traffic was back to normal by 8 A.M. today, and it expected that the rest would be running by the end of the day.
This morning, the "Lakeshore Limited" set off from Boston to Chicago by way of New York, and some other long-distance Amtrak trains began normal runs. Amtrak, the federally subsidized passenger carrier, expected to have the rest of its trains back on track over the weekend.
The law enacted early this morning marked the 18th interventionin a rail labor dispute since 1963. All the parties involved agreed that there needs to be serious updating of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, whose arcane provisions govern the way contracts are negotiated.
Clearly frustrated with repeatedly sorting out messy controversies, Congress this time tried a novel approach. It imposed a 20-day cooling-off period during which the parties are supposed to negotiate. If there is no agreement, each of the parties then submits a "last best offer" to a neutral arbitrator who picks one or the other to serve as the new contract.
The procedure has been used by several state governments with unions representing police officers and firefighters, but the "last best offer" provision has become best known for its application to salary disputes between major league baseball players and their teams.
For a short time on Thursday night, the lawmakers who devised the measure thought it might prove the key to revising the old, painful rail contract negotiating procedures.
Representative Dennis Eckart, a Democrat of Ohio who was chief sponsor of the bill in the House, said, "It will drive the parties to negotiate seriously and present realistic offers, because they'll know that at the end of the process it is an all-or-nothing deal."
The Secretary of Transportation, Andrew H. Card, said, "The solution represented in this legislation might well become a model that could be used in the future."
 
Won't Lament Passing
 But the angry reaction of the unions and the indifference of the railroads today suggested that the solution was unlikely to become regular fixture in rail labor talks.
"This is a one-shot deal that we will be happy to be rid of," said Mr. Dodd.
George Kourpias, international president of the machinists union, said "We're getting calls from hundreds of members who are upset that their collective-bargaining rights were taken away from them even when we decided not to create a national crisis, and then the carriers went ahead and shut down the country."
When a negotiating deadline passed at midnight Wednesday, the machinists called a strike against a single railroad, CSX Transport, the railroads then responded with a lockout on 38 railroads, effectively halting freight traffic nationwide.
As of this afternoon, neither the machinists nor the freight railroads had scheduled their first negotiating session. Talks between Amtrak and the locomotive engineers and the maintenance-of-way employees continued even while Congress was deliberating and will go on over the weekend.
Under the new law, the railroads and the unions have until no later than Wednesday to choose one person apiece from a list of Government-approved arbitrators, and they in turn will select a third person to serve as the arbitrator in the process.
After picking between the proposals presented by the railroads and the unions, the arbitrator must submit the choice to the President, and it becomes a matter of law unless the President disapproves of it within three days. If he disapproves, the unions would then be free to strike again, and the railroads could conduct lockouts.

HEADLINE: Religion Notes

BYLINE: By Ari L. Goldman

 BODY:

Switching Allegiances
Americans are a changeable people. They switch homes, cars and spouses with alacrity. A new national poll shows that religion is no exception.
One out of four Americans has switched faiths or denominations at least once from the religion in which they were born, according to the Princeton Religious Research Center, an affiliate of the Gallup Organization. 
 Of those who switch, 81 percent end up in Protestants denominations and 9 percent in the Roman Catholic church. Fewer than 1 percent become either Eastern Orthodox Christians, Mormons or Jews.
Before anyone jumps to the conclusion that all this switching comes from a deep spiritual search, one should consider the reasons that the respondents cited for the switch. The most often cited explanation, at 24 percent, was marriage to a person of another faith or denomination. Fourteen percent said they were motivated by a positive religious feeling toward their new church and 7 percent said that they were motivated by a negative feeling about their old church. And 11 percent changed for convenience, as in a move to a new neighborhood. The remaining explanations varied greatly.
The findings were based on telephone interviews with 1,002 adults conducted April 9 to 12. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points. The center did not collect data on the respondents' original church.
 
Clerk for a Day
 It was a great mystery. Twenty-four hours after the Rev. W. Clark Chamberlain of Houston was elected stated clerk of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), he resigned citing "private reasons" but offering no details.
This week, the tale began to unravel when the Texas clergyman explained that he had stepped down after he learned that he had been accused of sexual harassment by an employee of the national church organization.
"I could not have functioned as head of the church under a cloud of suspicion," he said Wednesday. "Certainly it could not help the church."
Mr. Chamberlain's election and sudden resignation took place June 10 at the annual meeting of the 2.8 million member church in Milwaukee. In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Chamberlain said that he had been unaware that the charge had been lodged against him until a day after his election. He said that he still did not know the details.
"I may never know," he said, noting that under church disciplinary procedures such charges are kept confidential and are released only if an investigating committee finds there is basis for a trial before a judiciary committee.
At the Milwaukee convention, the 45-year-old Mr. Chamberlain, a philosophy professor and lawyer, defeated the incumbent, the Rev. James E. Andrews, for the position of stated clerk, who shares leadership responsibilities with the denomination's executive director. After the resignation, the convention returned Mr. Andrews to the position.
 
Second Renaming
 What's in a name?
Well, Second Cumberland Presbyterian Church, a small Southern denomination, felt that its name connoted a second-class status and so announced recently that it was dropping the troublesome word.
The church's General Assembly, meeting in Huntsville, Ala., announced June 12 that the 25,000-member denomination would henceforth be known simply as the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America.
"We felt that 'second' gave a message we did not feel good about," said the Rev. R. Stanley Wood, the general secretary and stated clerk of the denomination. "We did not want to say that because we are African-Americans we are second to anyone."
The denomination was formed in 1874 as the Colored Cumberland Presbyterian Church by blacks who had left the predominantly white Cumberland Presbyterian Church, which today has a membership of over 100,000. In 1958, the breakaway group dropped the word "Colored" and replaced it with "Second."
The white and black Cumberlands have been negotiating for years about the possibility of reunion. Dr. Wood said the action of the convention might well prove a step in that direction. "We at least have one thing out of the way: the name."

HEADLINE: Credit Market Awaits New Economic Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were basically unchanged in very slow trading yesterday, as dealers chose to close their books and wait for a series of important economic reports next week.
Selling pressure arose early in the session, as some traders chose to take profits after the market's solid price gains earlier in the week. 
 But those declines were reversed later, and participants said market psychology remained upbeat on expectations that the Federal Reserve Board would move soon to cut short-term interest rates again.
"On balance, I think the Fed would like to wait as long as it can" before cutting rates, one government-bond trader said. "But if the employment numbers are weak, that may force its hand to move quickly."
 
Several Reports Due
 June employment data are scheduled to be released by the Labor Department on Thursday. A number of other reports on the economy, including home sales data for May and the monthly survey of manufacturing companies by the National Association of Purchasing Managers, are also expected next week.
"Every day next week there are important numbers," said Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
"Right now, the economic evidence is not decisive enough to get the Fed to lower interest rates," Mr. Moran added. "But they would react if the data coming out next week are weak."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year benchmark bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10218/32 , unchanged on the day, to yield 7.77 percent, the same as late Thursday but down from 7.83 percent on June 19.
Among Treasury note issues outstanding, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered late yesterday at 10217/32 down 1/32 , to yield 7.13 percent. And the 7 percent seven-year notes were offered at 101 1/2, down 1/32 , to yield 6.71 percent.
Among the new issues auctioned earlier this week, the 5 percent two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 4.88 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.
Short-term Treasury bill rates inched higher.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.62 percent late yesterday, up one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.71 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 3.93 percent, up two basis points.
In the corporate bond market, Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager on the first public bond sale for a bankrupt company.
The transaction was for Mid State Homes, the financing subsidiary of Jim Walter Homes, the modular home builder that filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in December 1989.
The financing is part of the reorganization plan designed to bring Jim Walter, which is owned by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, out of bankruptcy.
The $249.86 million offering of securities backed by mortgages on Jim Walter homes is fully insured by Financial Security Assurance.
The 7 5/8 percent securities, which have an average life of 5.7 years, were priced at $99.375 to yield 7.83 percent, 1.31 percentage points over the prevailing yield on Treasury securities of comparable maturity.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investor's Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mixed Results for Dollar; Gold Prices Move Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday against leading foreign currencies in trading largely pegged to sour economic news earlier in the week.
Gold prices also fell. Gold for current delivery at the Commodity Exchange in New York was quoted at $342.50, down 70 cents from late Thursday. At the Republic National Bank in New York, the late bid for gold was $342.50 an ounce, off 30 cents. 
 After heavy selling in the last two sessions, a technical correction propped up the dollar slightly yesterday. But investors were still reluctant to buy the dollar ahead of the weekend, causing its downward drift.
There had been a sense early in the session that traders who had sold short, or bet that the dollar would decline, would be doing some buying to reduce their exposure ahead of the weekend, said Mike Faust, senior currency strategist with MMS International. 'But when it became obvious that wasn't going to happen, the dollar sold off again," he said.
There was little in the way of good news for the dollar this week and a sense that many of the negatives contributing to the losses will not disappear, Mr. Faust said.
Figures released yesterday showing personal income rose three-tenths of 1 percent in May were in line with expectations and did little to motivate the dollar, he said.
Uncertainty over the Presidential election and fears that the Federal Reserve might ease interest rates were also not in the dollar's favor, Mr. Faust said.
Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors, thereby decreasing need for dollars.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 125.60 Japanese yen, from 126.62 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 125.70 yen. At the close in New York, the dollar was 125.70 yen, up from 125.15 late Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8925, from $1.8910 late Thursday. Sterling was quoted at $1.8945 in New York, down from $1.8970 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5355 German marks, down from 1.5375.

HEADLINE: Modest Rise In Spending And Income

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
Personal income and consumer spending rose modestly in May, the Government reported today, but analysts said the increases would not be enough to spur a dull economic recovery.
The Commerce Department said income grew just three-tenths of 1 percent, to $5.01 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. Income in April totaled $4.99 trillion, a gain of a tenth of a percent. 
 The report said consumer spending rose five-tenths of 1 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.06 trillion. Consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, fueled much of the economy's first-quarter growth of 2.7 percent at an annual rate. That rate is about half the average growth for previous recoveries.
 
A Downward Revision
 The department revised its April spending increase to three-tenths of a percent, or $4.04 trillion, from the original estimate of four-tenths of a percent. The March spending calculation, earlier reported as unchanged, was revised to a decline of a tenth of a percent, the first since October.
"Growth in income is very modest," said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group in Washington. "Luckily, inflation is so low that it's permitting at least small improvements in purchasing power."
Edward Yardeni and Deborah Johnson, economists with C. J. Lawrence in New York, said the modest income gains supported forecasts that the recovery would be far less robust than rebounds from other recessions since World War II.
"It's hard to see much of a gain in consumer spending in the second quarter," Ms. Shaber said. "That removes one of the important props to the economy that we had in the first quarter."
Elliott Platt and Christine Schneider, economists at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York, concurred, saying the April and May spending figures mean growth in the second quarter was just 1.8 percent.
Although analysts described the income growth as meager, it was the first four-month string of advances since March-June 1991.
 
The Savings Rate Drops
 Disposable income -- income after taxes -- rose three-tenths of 1 percent after being unchanged in April.
The fact that spending growth exceeded income gains meant that Americans' savings rate dropped to 5.3 percent in May from 5.4 percent. It had been 5.8 percent in March.
Wages and salaries totaled $2.89 trillion, up from $2.88 trillion a month earlier.
The income and spending figures were not adjusted for inflation. When adjusted, disposable incomes inched up one-tenth of 1 percent, after falling two-tenths of a percent in April.
Consumer spending, when adjusted for inflation, was up just three-tenths of a percent after increasing two-tenths of a percent the previous month.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
I.R.S. Pursues One of Its Own

BYLINE: By John H. Cushman Jr.

 BODY:
BEVERLEY P. ADDISON'S problems with the Internal Revenue Service began when the agency dismissed her as a revenue agent in 1985, supposedly for unacceptable job performance. Only later did the I.R.S. send her a bill for back taxes.
She challenged the agency on both matters, with varying degrees of success. The Merit Systems Protection Board, which protects civil servants from unfair dismissal, quickly gave her back her I.R.S. job. And last week the United States Tax Court said some of the tax deductions that the I.R.S. had challenged were proper. On some other counts the court upheld the agency. 
 The court's decision shows, among other things, how important it can be to keep good records, like detailed logs of automobile mileage.
In August 1984, according to court papers, Mrs. Addison bought a Cadillac, which she used mainly to drive from one tax audit to another. Because the car was essential for her job, she took an investment tax credit in the year she bought it, and she claimed deductions for business use of the car in 1984 and 1985.
But her dismissal in May 1985 disqualified Mrs. Addison from using some of those tax breaks, the I.R.S. argued.
The agency reasoned that she had stopped using the car for business within one year of placing it in service, and under the rules this meant that the 1984 investment tax credit had to be paid back.
Furthermore, during the trial the agency raised the ante and challenged Mrs. Addison's deduction for business use of the automobile in 1984, saying that like the tax credit, this deduction too must be revoked since the car was not used mainly for business in 1985.
The I.R.S. introduced as evidence the mileage vouchers she filed while employed by the I.R.S.
Mrs. Addison countered that the I.R.S. had been at fault for improperly dismissing her, as the Civil Service board declared despite repeated appeals by the I.R.S. In any event, she said, she continued to use the car for business purposes throughout 1985, since she used it extensively to drive to union meetings and Civil Service hearings as she fought successfully to hold onto her job.
In Tax Court, petitioners like Mrs. Addison bear the burden of proof when they are appealing I.R.S. decisions. But the I.R.S. must prove any new claims that it raises in Tax Court arguments. And because of this legal technicality, Mrs. Addison, who had not kept good mileage records in 1985, lost part of her case and won another part.
Without logs showing how far she drove her Cadillac as she fought her dismissal, she could not prove that she continued to use the car mainly for business purposes for more than a year after buying it, even after she was dismissed. So on this point the I.R.S.'s claim against her was upheld. Unfair as it might seem, the court said, the law forced her to give up the investment tax credit she had claimed in 1984.
But the I.R.S., not Mrs. Addison, bore the burden of proof when it raised new questions during the trial about her other deductions for the Cadillac. Testifying that she drove to meetings and hearings while fighting her dismissal, she told the court that she had been so upset at the time that she did not keep records of those miles. "We believe her," the court said, and it allowed the deductions since the I.R.S. could not prove her story wrong.
The court went on to decide several unrelated issues in her case, including whether she properly filed as the head of a household and whether her unemployment benefits should be taxed. In some matters the court sided with Mrs. Addison and in others with the I.R.S.
Finally, the court had to decide whether Mrs. Addison owed penalties for negligence in those instances when she filed incorrectly. The court ruled that her errors were nothing more than those an ordinary person might have made under the same circumstances, the standard the law sets for determining negligence.
"We arrive at this conclusion notwithstanding the fact that petitioner is an Internal Revenue agent, presumably with more than general knowledge of provisions of the code," the court remarked.
 
Survey of Businesses
 With state and local taxes steadily increasing, the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand recently surveyed 348 companies about their tax burdens.
Based on the survey, the company estimates that state and local governments now take 46 percent of business taxes. The Federal Goverment gets 48 percent of the total, and international taxes make up the rest.
But the average respondent assigns markedly fewer people to handling state and local tax issues than to handling Federal tax issues.
And they mistakenly believe that state corporate income taxes are the biggest burden, when according to the Bureau of Census, property taxes and sales and use taxes are actually greater.
The accounting firm says most companies fight taxes in two main ways: by lobbying governments against increases and by challenging property tax assessments. It recommended that they also emphasize state and local tax considerations whenever they plan to reorganize, expand or acquire new properties.

HEADLINE: County Chiefs in Albany Seek Approval to Borrow

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON

 BODY:
A delegation of government leaders from Nassau and Suffolk counties went to Albany yesterday to lobby for borrowing plans to balance their budgets and to save Long Island homeowners from property-tax increases.
As lawmakers raced toward adjournment, County Executives Robert Gaffney of Suffolk and Thomas S. Gulotta of Nassau, both Republicans, worked the corridors of the State Capitol, accompanied by local legislative leaders. 
 Both delegations said that they were being received well and that they were optimistic that the Legislature would approve their requests, possibly as soon as this weekend.
"The feedback has been positive," said David Vieser, a spokesman for Mr. Gulotta. "We anticipate approval."
A spokesman for Mr. Gaffney, Tim Ryan, said, "Indications are there will be no last-minute hangups."
 
Suffolk Sales Tax Would Rise
 Mr. Gaffney, armed with strong bipartisan support, sought approval of up to $91 million in borrowing to help close a deficit in Suffolk's $1.3 billion budget that is estimated at between $90 million and $110 million. The fiscal year in both counties ends Dec. 31.
Mr. Gaffney is also seeking approval of a half percentage point increase in Suffolk's sales tax, to 8.5 percent, which would bring in an estimated $23 million this year and at least $50 million next year. Mr. Gulotta, carrying home-rule measures adopted by the Nassau County Board of Supervisors shortly before midnight on Thursday, sought Albany's approval for $100 million in borrowing. He also sought backing for a doubling of the mortgage tax in the county, to 2 percent, which is expected to raise $213 million by the end of 1997.
The Nassau plan is intended to close an estimated $159 million deficit in the county's current $1.8 billion budget and eliminate the threat of a property tax increase for two years.
 
Critics Call It a Bailout
 Opponents of the borrowing measures in both counties argued again yesterday in Albany that the borrowing was, in effect, a tax increase, since taxpayers would ultimately have to repay the loans, with interest.
Ben Zwirn, a Democrat and the Supervisor of the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau, told the Albany lawmakers that "so long as Nassau has no fiscal plan in place, there is no reason for the state to bail it out once again."
He recalled that six months ago the State Legislature approved a half-cent increase in Nassau's sales tax, to 8.5 percent. He said the additional income was supposed to "solve all of Nassau's problems."
"And here were are, no less than six months later, with hat in hand, asking for another bailout," Mr. Zwirn said.
Mr. Gulotta and Mr. Gaffney met with Ralph J. Marino, the Senate majority leader and a Republican from Long Island, who has indicated support for the borrowing measures, and with Saul Weprin, the Speaker of the Assembly and a Democrat, who has indicated he opposes further borrowing unless local authorities agree to state oversight of their finances.
Critics of Mr. Weprin's view argued that since dozens of municipalities and counties were also seeking home-rule measures to borrow money, oversight of all of them by the state would create an administrative nightmare.
Both Nassau and Suffolk have been hit hard by the recession. Sales-tax revenues have dropped off sharply while the cost of social-welfare programs and other county services have increased.
Among those affected by the hard times are several hundred former Nassau County workers who were laid off this year to cut costs. The outcry from civil-service unions and the effect of the layoffs on county services caused Mr. Gulotta and county lawmakers to rethink plans for additional layoffs and for wage cuts.
A similar outcry in Suffolk brought legislators to a near standstill on measures to cut costs. Mr. Gaffney broke the stalemate on Thursday by announcing the formation of a new bi-partisan coalition, which quickly approved the borrowing and sales-tax measures.
A bipartisan effort was also needed in Nassau, where Lewis Yevoli, the Democratic Supervisor of the Town of Oyster Bay, broke with Mr. Zwern and another fellow Democrat, Bruce Nyman, Supervisor of the City of Long Beach. His shift allowed the borrowing and mortgage-tax measures to pass on a 4-to-2 vote.

HEADLINE: Albany's Parting Shots

 BODY:
The New York State Legislature is, as usual, bogged down in partisan politicking as lawmakers move toward summer recess. Negotiations over important bills are further complicated by the need to agree on a reapportionment plan ordered by the Justice Department.
Here, in any case, are measures that deserve last-minute attention. 
 Police Plan. New York City can save $21 million in pension costs by pushing the start-up date for the next class of police recruits into fiscal 1993, a three-day delay. But meddling legislators won't go along unless they can impose tight controls over the city's police program and the $21 million. The Legislature has neither the knowledge nor the authority to run city government. That's the job of people elected to city office by city voters who can hold them accountable. Prompt approval of the city's request is in order.
Bond Act Authorization. Gov. Mario Cuomo's $800 million bond proposal could be an economic stimulus or a boondoggle, depending on how and where the money is spent. The Governor and legislative leaders pledge to provide detailed spending objectives before a November referendum. In the meantime, it makes sense to approve a pending bill that authorizes a November vote. There's enough time after that to determine if the act itself deserves support.
Medicaid. The State Senate is balking at Mr. Cuomo's proposal for a larger state role in Medicaid. Under the Governor's plan, local governments, instead of paying 25 percent of Medicaid bills, would give the state part of their tax revenues. The senators worry about saddling the state with high Medicaid costs, especially New York City's, but the measure would give Albany a better grip on expenses and the system in general.
Environmental Trust Fund. This fund would earmark certain revenues, like taxes on soda and beer containers, for land acquisition, recycling and sewage treatment. The Assembly has approved the fund, which is environmentally desirable and fiscally sound. The Senate balks.
Gay Rights. An overdue measure to bar discrimination based on sexual orientation stands a chance in the Assembly. But Speaker Saul Weprin, eager to avoid a tough issue in an election year, refuses to schedule a vote on the bill. Avoiding debate doesn't advance gay rights; it adds to the stigma. Mr. Weprin's proper role is to lead, not duck.
Child Health Plus. This program provides primary and preventive health insurance for children of the working poor. It has already signed up 25,000 youngsters. But because the program started late, only a small fraction of its $20 million annual budget was spent in 1991 and not all will be spent in 1992. What's needed is authority to roll over unused funds to open the program to new enrollees.

HEADLINE: The Enduring Cost of Rent Control

 BODY:
An "enduring monument to economic illiteracy," Vice President Quayle called rent control in his latest speech bashing New York. On this subject, at least, he's got it right. Rent control remains one of New York City's more galling and costly policies.
It has been in effect ever since World War II -- and hasn't made sense for most of that time. It purports to help the poor afford housing. Instead, it does serious damage, speeds the destruction of older housing, reduces the city's property tax revenues and discourages the construction of new rental apartments. That hurts the poor and middle class by keeping housing at a costly premium. 
 Moreover, as a study by the Citizens Budget Commission reiterated last year, rent control helps a small number of low-income New Yorkers but mainly benefits wealthier people who pay artificially low rents -- rents in effect subsidized by the taxpayer.
Nobody who understands the economic realities of New York City and its housing stock can justify the perpetuation of rent control. It was an emergency measure enacted during World War II. But it has become an icon in New York City, protected by politicians who should know better.
They do know better. But because real estate is so expensive, rent control has strong support from tenant groups, and no elected official in a position to revise the law will touch it.
Yet there are reasonable ways to release this stranglehold on the housing market. The simplest is called vacancy decontrol, under which apartment rents are freed only when they change hands.
Right now, a reasonable bill to decontrol luxury apartments is stalled in the State Legislature. The measure would decontrol rents of anyone making more than $100,000 a year, and decontrol apartments renting for more than $2,000 a month once the current tenant moves out. The Republican State Senate approved the bill, but it can't even get out of committee in the Assembly, where Democrats from New York City are in charge.
The repeated failure of New York City officials to revise a policy that is so fundamentally unfair and damaging remains a disappointment. Now it is also an embarrassment that it should take Dan Quayle, who scorns New York at every opportunity, to speak the truth about rent control.

HEADLINE: Sudan Points Up the World Hunger Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I write to express the combined voice of the world's largest Roman Catholic, Protestant and Jewish overseas relief and development organizations in response to "Trek to Misery by 12,000 Pawns in Sudan War" (front page, June 10), about the young refugees who have made a 1,000-mile, four-year, barefoot odyssey from the Sudan to Kenya.
Your article provides just a glimpse of the structural violence, both endemic and epidemic, that threatens the world's poorest citizens. It is endemic, as every night more than one billion people throughout the third world go to bed hungry, most of them women and children. It is epidemic, as the worst drought of the century puts some 30 million lives at risk in South and Southeast Africa this year alone. 
 The agencies of the Interfaith Hunger Appeal -- Catholic Relief Services, Church World Service, Lutheran World Relief and The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee -- urge that the United States take the lead in providing immediate assistance to the famine-threatened people of the third world.
Sub-Saharan Africa remains the world's most serious development challenge: more than 450 million people with an annual per capita income of $323 translates into a high incidence of chronic malnutrition and periodic famine. In the last 40 years, United States foreign assistance has played a constructive role in the social and economic progress achieved in many developing countries.
It is time to recommit the United States to this humanitarian task and to coordinate its aid with multilateral institutions so that people who suffer chronic poverty and hunger might have an opportunity to achieve self-reliance.

HEADLINE: South Bronx Begins to Shed Image of a Land Without Hope

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Bank Shows It Can Profit and Follow a Social Agenda," your May 24 front-page article on Chicago's South Shore Bank, sheds light on one model for revitalizing economic opportunity in blighted neighborhoods.
However, having been involved in economic development in the South Bronx since 1971, I was dismayed to read that South Shore's strategy "would not work in the South Bronx, or other areas so distressed that neighborhoods have gone to demolition." This statement unfortunately perpetuates a persistent stereotype of the South Bronx as beyond hope, which clearly contradicts the progress being made here. 
 Several groups -- including the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation -- are pursuing similar goals as South Shore, albeit with slightly different means. Acting as an intermediary between capital and communities, we have developed an approach to community economic development that involves helping business to expand; easing the way for commercial revitalization and neighborhood development and training youth and the unemployed for jobs.
And the strategy has worked: since 1971, more than $100 million in new capital has come into this community, more than 20,000 jobs have been created, and 19,000 jobs that might have been lost have been retained.
The challenge for the South Shore and for our organization alike is to harness capital for the continuing revitalization of neighborhoods such as the South Bronx. As the events in Los Angeles indicate, there may be no more pressing task in the United States today.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Hardly Laissez-Faire;
Perot Says Strong Government Action Could Restore Industries to Strength

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
In his muscular rhetoric about making America's economy stand tall again, Ross Perot sounds more activist about the economy than many liberal Democrats, promising a far more interventionist role for the Government to make American industry more competitive.
"I don't want to live in a country that can't make its own television sets," he told The New Republic recently. "It's just bizarre that we can't make consumer electronics. Those are industries of the future. If we forfeit whole industries from this country, we will have a third-world-nation standard of living." 
 On economics, as in other areas, Mr. Perot is long on criticisms but short on specific solutions. But while he has never issued a detailed program, he has conveyed his general approach in interviews and television appearances.
One thing he has made clear is that he supports an industrial policy that would have government focus on and help the growth areas of tomorrow.
"There are industries we've got to keep in the country, and we're losing them right and left," he said in a speech at the National Press Club in April. "We've got to target them. They will create millions of jobs. We've got to make sure that we're first and best. In Japan, that's called MITI: study it, analyze it, improve on it."
While Mr. Perot says he does not want to create an American version of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which played a crucial role in helping industry rebuild after World War II, he does want to develop strategy, industry by industry. "We think 10 minutes ahead," he said. "Japan thinks 10 years ahead. I suggest we start thinking 15 years ahead and ace her."
Mr. Perot's approach is in stark contrast to the laissez-faire attitude of President Bush, whose Administration argues that American industry is on the mend and that it would be wrong for a ham-handed Government bureaucracy to interfere.
"I do not want to see the Government pick winners and losers," Mr. Bush said in an interview this week.
The Perot approach is also different from that of Mr. Clinton, who bemoans the decline of American manufacturing. In the plan he released last Sunday, the likely Democratic nominee said he would concentrate on spending on roads, railroads and other public works and on improving the skills of the work force.
The Arkansas Governor supports creating a Federal agency to coordinate research on new civilian technologies, having a broad investment tax credit and requiring employers to spend a certain percentage of their revenues on job training.
In contrast, Mr. Perot talks of action to help companies directly.
It might "make sense from time to time to assist" financially in developing "some leading-edge technology," the Dallas billionaire told The New Republic, particularly "if corporate America is bled so white it doesn't have the capital to do it."
Mr. Perot also suggests easing antitrust laws so that large corporations could share the cost of developing products to enable them to vie more effectively against the Japanese. He wants to change banking regulations to pressure banks to lend more to small business, and he wants to enable banks to invest directly in new companies.
Like Governor Clinton, he favors spurring entrepreneurs by reducing capital-gains taxes for investments in new businesses. In contrast, President Bush has called for cutting capital-gains taxes for almost all investments.
All in all, Mr. Perot's activist approach to industry makes many conservatives uneasy. "He seems to be a kind of corporate state planner type," said Edward Hudgins, an economist with the Heritage Foundation. "He is pro-business in that he wants government to intervene to favor specific industries and companies, but the unspoken secret is that this will be at the expense of others."
Viewing trade policy as a potent tool for strengthening industry, Mr. Perot sounds far more protectionist than Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton. While President Bush and Governor Clinton support the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Perot is strongly opposed, saying it would mean a massive loss of industrial jobs to Mexico.
Mr. Perot told The Los Angeles Times that he would adjust the "tilted deck" on trade policy with Japan. He said he would make the Japanese say, "We'll take the same deal on cars we've given you." This, he said, would slash the number of imported cars.
Mr. Perot talks vigorously about the importance of slashing the deficit, condemning Congress and the past two Presidents for letting Federal debt mushroom to $4 trillion. He has given few specifics on how he would balance the budget, but he has suggested that wealthy retirees forgo Social Security payments, and that Germany and Japan contribute billions more for American troops overseas. Mr. Perot has said he would slash $180 billion in fraud and waste, but he has not said how.
Richard G. Darman, the Bush Administration's budget director, said on Wednesday that Mr. Perot's proposals were not serious and would save just a fraction of what he suggests.
The Perot campaign has promised to issue a more detailed economic plan, but has not said when it would do so.
Mr. Perot sounds like President Bush in backing a line-item budget veto. He also sounds Republican in forswearing tax increases. "Raising taxes is like taking dope for politicians," he said on the "Today" program on NBC.
Some critics say he has changed his tack on taxes for this year's campaign; they note that in October 1987 he wrote in The Washington Post that taxes needed to be raised to trim the deficit.
"There are some positions where he would be closer to an activist Democrat, and some where he would be close to very conservative Republicans, which is why I think he appeals to a lot of people," said Felix Rohatyn, the New York investment banker, who recently met with Mr. Perot to discuss economic policy.
Far more than President Bush or Governor Clinton, Mr. Perot warns that the nation will have to tighten its belt. If "you can't stand to trip across the desert with limited water, we're not going to straighten this country out," he said on the "Today" program. "If you just want Lawrence Welk music, I'm not your man."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Bush's Greatest Glory Fades As Questions on Iraq Persist

SERIES: The Bush Record -- Third article of a series

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO with MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
President Bush may have reached the pinnacle of his political career on March 7, 1991, when he addressed a joint session of Congress and basked in a three-minute standing ovation from lawmakers who waved small American flags and even chanted his name in admiration of his handling of the Persian Gulf war.
He had skillfully forged an international diplomatic and military coalition that had driven the Iraqi Army from Kuwait. His approval rating had soared to nearly 90 percent in several polls and even the Democratic Speaker of the House, Representative Thomas S. Foley, introduced Mr. Bush that night by giving him "our warmest congratulations on the brilliant victory of the Desert Storm operation." 
 So it is not surprising that Mr. Bush's friends call him frustrated, even angry, that as the afterglow of the war fades, Democrats in Congress are trying to transform what was once regarded as his greatest triumph as President into one of his most significant political liabilities.
Genuine concerns about the policy failure before the invasion are mingled with election year politics; Democrats in Congress are asserting that the Administration's policy of supporting Iraq before the war was not only misguided, but criminal, and even some of Mr. Bush's staunchest backers wonder why Saddam Hussein is still in power in Baghdad.
The stark but unanswerable question behind the politics is this: Could Mr. Bush have avoided the war if he had moved to restrain rather than reward the Iraqi leader earlier?
Mr. Bush and his aides insist the answer is no. Still, no other foreign policy issue is likely to so dog Mr. Bush through the campaign. Ross Perot has reserved some of his most scathing criticism for Mr. Bush's Iraq policy, portraying the President as a sissy-turned-swashbuckler who sent emissaries to "burp, diaper and pamper" Mr. Hussein just before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Mr. Bush and his aides were urged to rethink Persian Gulf policy from the moment they took office. Shortly after Mr. Bush won the Presidency in November 1988, a State Department strategist drafted a paper for the President-elect urging that the United States take a fresh approach to the region.
The Reagan White House steadfastly believed that the great menace to peace in the gulf was Iran. But Zalmay Khalilzad, an official in the office of Policy Planning, asserted that the more dangerous threat came from Iraq, which had replaced Iran as the strategic regional power and was now poised to dominate the gulf.
Mr. Khalilzad advised in the paper that America's new policy should concentrate on strengthening Iran and containing Iraq. The paper was included in the State Department Policy Planning Staff's official "transition book," which reviewed all the foreign policy issues the new President would soon have to confront. But after Mr. Bush took office, the State Department staff's arguments were either overlooked or rejected.
The Administration knew, however, that Saddam Hussein spent $10 billion -- 40 percent of Iraq's oil revenues -- in 1988 and 1989 on military equipment and personnel.
It also knew that mounting evidence suggested he was pressing ahead with the developement of nuclear and biological weapons, enhancing his chemical weapons and working on his own long-range ballistic missiles.
 
Staying a Policy Course
 When President Bush finally issued his policy on Iraq in October, 1989, the decision was to stay Ronald Reagan's course, which evolved at the height of the Iran-Iraq war. Iran should be isolated, and Iraq should be extended political and economic favors as a way of moderating its behavior and improving its relationship with Washington.
In the nine months after the Bush Administration settled on its policy -- as Iraq grew steadily more belligerent and, eventually, massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's northern border -- the Bush Administration provided Baghdad with $500 million in agricultural sales credits and pushed for $500 million more. It overrode Congressional objections to continuing Federal financing for commercial transactions with Iraq and sold Baghdad high-technology equipment that could be useful in Iraq's military programs.
It provided Iraq with intelligence on Iran's political and military situation -- until the Iraqis themselves cut off the so-called intelligence-sharing meetings in February 1990. It fought Congress's attempts to impose economic sanctions on Baghdad and to brand it a supporter of terrorism. And it played down the importance of what it acknowledged was Iraq's "abysmal" human rights record.
 
A $40 Million Explanation
 Now, some Democrats say, it is difficult to explain to the American people why the Central Intelligence Agency must spend $40 million in taxpayers' money next year to try to overthrow a dictator whose Presidential Palace is protected by an American-made communications system -- particularly after the United States and its allies spent $61 billion to fight the war.
But Mr. Bush's unwillingness to come up with a coherent defense of his policy has frustrated even his Republican supporters. "I consider this an Administration of generally good judgment, but it is totally bereft of philosophy," said Representative Jim Leach. Although the Iowa Republican said he is "99 percent sure" that the Administration committed no crimes, "The more ham-handed the defense, the more the public will suspect a cover-up."
While some Congressmen say that all this suggests a large-scale cover-up that can be investigated only by an independent counsel, the White House has denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Bush admits that his policy failed while also continuing to argue that the gulf war victory was one of the greatest achievements of his Presidency.
 
Bush Smells Politics
 He said that the move to appoint an independent counsel "smells political to me." Referring to Congressional inquires about the Iraq policy and accusations that the Reagan campaign in 1980 tried to delay the release of American hostages in Iran, he added: "Why the Congress keeps spending the taxpayers' money on these witch hunts, I do not know. And I'm a little sick of it, but there's not a heck of a lot I can do about it except to express a continual and somewhat mounting frustration as I see now another attack. Our policy was well known. We tried to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations. That policy was not successful."
For some lawmakers and analysts, Iraq is a showcase of Mr. Bush at his best and at his worst. At his best, Mr. Bush built an international coalition to push the Iraqis out of Kuwait and strip Baghdad of its weapons of mass destruction. At his worst, Mr. Bush allowed the policy to drift as soon as peacetime set in -- just as he failed to modify it in the months before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
"He showed great skills in ad hoc policymaking, and his performance during the war was impressive," said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who is the leading contender to head the House Foreign Affairs Committee this fall. "But his policies prior to the war failed, and the follow-through afterward has been disappointing. He is not thinking ahead."
Charles William Maynes, the editor of the magazine Foreign Policy, put it more bluntly: "Triumph has become ashes in the mouth of the victor," he said.
 
Hazy Memories
Pursuing Peace; A Personal Note
 Among the thousands of pages of classified and declassified papers that have come to light since the Iraq war, the one that perhaps best captures Mr. Bush's attitude toward Iraq was his personal message to Mr. Hussein on July 28, 1990, a few days before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
In it, Mr. Bush noted that both countries "have a strong interest in preserving the peace and stability of the Middle East." The President also said he welcomed a statement Mr. Hussein made a few days earlier to the United States Ambassador, April C. Glaspie. "Iraq desires friendship with the United States," the Iraqi leader had said, and Mr. Bush assured him that Washington felt the same way. "My Administration continues to desire better relations with Iraq," he said.
Mr. Bush did not mention that Iraq had already massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with Kuwait.
To this day, Mr. Bush's aides defend that message by pointing out that King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan all told Mr. Bush that the Iraqi leader was bluffing, and that United States pressure would only worsen the crisis.
"The President's statement was intended to give the sense that the peak of the crisis had passed," one official said. "The President didn't want to be the American bull in the Middle Eastern bazaar."
When Mr. Bush was elected President, United States policy toward Iraq was a marginal issue; he and his senior advisers were consumed with the developments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe as the Communist bloc disintegrated, and in the Middle East.
Iraq remained a back-burner issue, even by the spring of 1990, when the signs of Mr. Hussein's confrontational behavior seemed unmistakable to many.
In December 1989 he had launched his first long-range missile. Two months later, he demanded the removal of United States forces in the gulf. In March, United States intelligence detected the construction of six fixed launchers for long-range Scud missiles at an Iraqi base near Jordan, putting the weapons within range of Israel.
In April, Mr. Hussein threatened to "burn half of Israel" with chemical weapons if attacked and during the same period of time, British Customs seized part of a nearly 200-foot "supergun," and a joint American-British sting operation intercepted nuclear-weapon triggers intended for Baghdad.
Mr. Bush noticed the ominous developments, but according to his aides, he was puzzled, not alarmed. Although the Administration publicly and privately criticized Mr. Hussein's words and actions, it did nothing to alter its policy.
"Bush was going around and asking, 'What gives with this guy?' " recalled one senior adviser. "He was saying, 'Gee, we are trying to be reasonable, yet this guy says and does these crazy things.' "
By June 1990, Iraq's behavior had become so worrisome that some in Congress began to call for economic sanctions. In response, Mr. Bush dispatched to Baghdad Richard N. Haass, the chief White House official dealing with the Middle East, who said the Administration wanted to avoid sanctions by working with Baghdad.
"The jury is out on the future of the relationship, and it will not be possible to sustain it unless your behavior improves," he told Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, according to a senior Administration official.
Mr. Aziz, the official said, replied: "What are you going to take away from us? You don't sell us anything anyway."
 
Selective Memories
Intelligence Gaps; Advice Not Taken
 At a Congressional hearing last year, Robert M. Kimmitt, then the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, asserted that American weapons had never been sold to Mr. Hussein. "If other countries had followed the same policy, Iraq perhaps would not have become the force for instability that it became in the region," he testified.
But throughout the 1980's, when the United States wanted Iraq to win its war with Iran, the Government encouraged America's allies to sell Iraq conventional arms as well as equipment that helped Saddam Hussein's efforts to build nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. And from 1985 to 1990, the United States approved 771 licenses to export $1.5 billion in advanced equipment to Iraq -- much of it useful for both civilian and military functions.
Throughout the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the State Department led a campaign to transfer millions of dollars worth of high-technology equipment to Iraq, at first to help Baghdad in its war against Teheran, and later as part of its policy of conciliation.
Similarly, White House officials have said that foreign policy concerns did not play a role in the Bush Administration's decision to extend agricultural credits to Iraq. But both the Reagan and Bush Administrations used the Commodity Credit Corporation, an Agriculture Department agency that promotes farm exports by arranging Federally guaranteed loans to foreign nations, as a key element of its policy to curry favor with Baghdad, pumping out $5 billion in credits that built Iraq into America's ninth-largest agricultural customer and a top buyer of rice, wheat and corn. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and defaulted on its foreign debts, the Commodity Credit Corporation was liable for nearly $2 billion in bad Iraqi loans -- one quarter of its portfolio.
Almost two years later, most of those debts have been repaid with American tax dollars, even as investigations suggest that Iraq's "farm" loans were widely diverted to kickbacks and arms-buying.
Some call that mismanagement. Others raise a more serious charge: that the White House knowingly pushed the credit corporation into foolhardy fiscal adventures in its courtship of Saddam Hussein.
Since the war, extensive evidence uncovered by United Nations inspectors on Iraq's programs to build weapons of mass destruction has illustrated the gaps in the Administration's knowledge of Mr. Hussein's war machine. But there were exceptions, isolated warnings that Iraq had embarked on a major effort to build a nuclear bomb. These warnings, however, were disregarded.
 
Short Memories
Gloria Fugit; Saddam Remains
 Before Mr. Bush appeared before the National-American Wholesale Grocers' Association in March, the audience was shown a film about the Persian Gulf war that was filled with images of the President reviewing and honoring American troops. When the film ended, the audience responded with total silence. It was only when Mr. Bush greeted the crowd that he was cheered on -- driving home the painful point that even among staunch Bush supporters, the war is no longer a career-sustaining victory.
Sixteen months after the war, the man Mr. Bush called "worse than Hitler" is still firmly in power in Baghdad.
Even though much of his military arsenal was destroyed, Mr. Hussein still controls the largest army in the region. According to testimony before Congress by Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, Mr. Hussein could rebuild Iraq's ability to make nuclear, chemical and biological weapons within a few years and he is still believed to be hiding hundreds of Scud missiles.
Although Mr. Hussein rarely appears in public and reportedly spends much of his time moving from bunker to bunker, the problem for Mr. Bush is that Saddam Hussein is still there at all.
Aides who advised Mr. Bush during the Persian Gulf crisis strongly defend his decision not to attempt to overthrow Mr. Hussein as part of the gulf war.
"There was a sense that Saddam was not going to sit on the veranda and wait for us to find him," said Mr. Gates, who was deputy national security adviser throughout the gulf crisis. "We would have had to occupy all of Iraq. We would still be there."
But out of that comes a dark possibility that no one in the White House wants to contemplate: That President Hussein may hold on to his job longer than President Bush.

Did Los Angeles Change the Rules of the Game?

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
To put it bluntly, the Regional Plan Association is not known as a bunch of live wires. An organization of professional urban planners from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, it enjoys no legal power and hasn't lately rocked the world with visionary fervor. The association was established in 1929 on the sound idea that the future growth of New York City would require rational management of the entire metropolitan region. But in recent years, it has come to seem like a relic of an earlier time, when people actually believed they could shape the urban environment.
So the lively mood at this year's annual meeting, which drew about 700 of its 1,300 members to the New York Sheraton Hotel last month, came as a pleasant shock. The event percolated with energy and ideas.
The ideas came from speakers like Rena Cusma, executive director of the Metropolitan Service District of Portland, Ore. Sound dull? Not to planners who for years have wrestled unsuccessfully with the steady drift of economic vitality from the inner cities to the suburbs. 
 As head of the nation's only directly elected regional government, Ms. Cusma has been a champion wrestler. Her agency -- Metro for short -- was created 13 years ago by the Oregon Legislature to manage the "regional growth boundary," the border between urban development and rural areas. Metro has the muscle to override local governments when necessary -- to carry out its vision of compact urban centers, to prevent development from eating up open land. It has already produced conspicuous results: since the 1970's, the number of jobs in downtown Portland has increased by half, while the level of incoming automobile traffic has remained constant.
But most of the energy at the conference came from the audience. The kinetic mood was evident in their reactions to the speakers, in the substance and urgency of their questions. For once, economic priorities were relegated to the back seat while social issues rode up front. When the subject of regional transportation came up, this audience wasn't satisfied with being told how many people could be moved by public transportation. What people, the planners wanted to know. From what income levels? Moved from what kind of housing to what kind of jobs?
The planners wanted to remind themselves that urban forms have social costs, and that these costs can be measured. For example, average commuting times for working mothers (two hours, say, to get from a low-cost apartment in the city to a low-level job in the suburbs) can be correlated with other local statistics: reading scores, incidence of drug use and juvenile crime.
There was no mystery about the catalyst behind the Regional Plan Association's sudden surge of vigor. South Central Los Angeles had burst into flame just days before. Headlines, editorials, magazine covers, talk-show slots had been invaded by The City, the group's field of expertise. An opportunity had opened up for planners. How could they take advantage of it? How could they claim a place at the table the media had spread for the nation to graze on during the crisis of the week?
It was by no means certain that a place had been set for planners, or, for that matter, for architects and urban designers. The table was already packed, what with all the economists, politicians and religious leaders who expected to be seated, not to mention the police chiefs, the National Guard and even the Marines. If any planners were invited, we didn't hear about it on the news. We didn't even hear lip service paid to the idea that the quality of urban life is linked to urban form. If the subject of planning came up at all, we heard only echoes of familiar complaints. Aren't planners those awful people who rammed the expressway through the old neighborhood, demolishing buildings, uprooting lives? Or aren't they irrelevancies, mere onlookers at an urban spectacle created by forces that lie beyond the control of even national governments?
The Los Angeles riots had provoked the feeling that the rules of the urban game had changed. But perhaps what had changed was only the feeling: indifference gave way to raised hopes that might soon be dashed again. That depressing possibility is being faced now by everyone engaged in the physical shaping of cities, from regional planners to urban designers to the architects who seek to integrate individual buildings into the larger urban picture.
The training these professionals undergo, their titles, licenses and job descriptions are all based on the assumption that reason can influence events. That is a hard idea to hold onto in cities, which so often appear governed not by reason, or even money, but by chance. Francesc Torres suggests as much in his "Assyrian Paradigm," a city of cards ruled over by a pair of dice, now on view at the Whitney Museum's downtown branch.
The sense of urgency at the planners' convention arose from something more than distress at the condition of the cities. It was also prompted by an awareness of the public's short attention span. Soon The City would be yesterday's stale crisis; who could say when there would be another opportunity even to speak of change, much less effect it?
Of course, the conditions that produced turmoil in Los Angeles have not vanished. And even without political clout, architects and planners could begin to exploit more fully the power of ideas. Their expertise lies in the molding of ideas as well as in the shaping of physical forms. They could recognize that they have considerable power not only to formulate new urban concepts but to deny intellectual respectability to ideas that have become bankrupt. They could actively question concepts that have received far more attention than they are worth: Festival marketplaces. Public art. Edge cities. Contextual design guidelines. Mid-block arcades. Skywalks. "Neo-traditional" suburban centers. And that is just a short list.
Some of these concepts may have their uses; many will endure through sheer inertia, still others should be buried with all possible haste. And surely one of the urgent tasks now is to go patiently down the list and inquire of each of these ideas: What have you done for us lately?

HEADLINE: 'SESAME STREET';
High Grades For Big Bird

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Getting Big Bird off the Dole" [June 14] is Laurence Jarvik's most partisan attack to date on "Sesame Street." While he pretends that he and his fellow conservative Republicans are supporters of Big Bird, this latest essay is just another in a seemingly endless chain by Mr. Jarvik attacking the program, its producer, Children's Television Workshop -- and now Senate Democrats. In each attack, Mr. Jarvik has selectively used and misconstrued the facts to serve his ultimate goal: the defeat of public television. 
 In his most recent round of accusations, Mr. Jarvik questions "Sesame Street's" educational impact. I'd like to set the record straight.
Research has proved that "Sesame Street" is educational and that it reaches an ethnically, racially and economically diverse audience. For example, a 1989 Yankelovich, Skelly and White/Clancy Schulman study conducted in 25 cities across the United States found that nearly two in three youngsters in poverty-level families watched "Sesame Street" daily. In the same study, 75 percent of the mothers named "Sesame Street" as their children's favorite show.
Studies conducted by the Educational Testing Service after the program's first two seasons indicated that "Sesame Street" viewers demonstrated significant gains in basic skills, and that frequent viewers of "Sesame Street," regardless of racial background or socioeconomic status, made greater cognitive gains than infrequent viewers or nonviewers.
"Sesame Street's" reach is broad. But it will take more than a widely available television program to narrow the gap that continues to exist between disadvantaged and advantaged youngsters in our society.
Mr. Jarvik chides Congress for worrying about the continued existence of "Sesame Street." Yet it was he and his colleagues who led the charge to privatize the Public Broadcasting Service, a proposal sure to eliminate broadcast of "Sesame Street" and other educational television programs for children.

HEADLINE: Talking: Bankruptcy;
Can Filing Protect The Home?

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
THE explosion of personal bankruptcies has created confusion about the fate of a debtor's residence. Is bankruptcy a magic wand that can save a home from the onslaught of creditors, including the mortgage holder? Or is it more likely to clean out a homeowner (and even a renter) of everything -- including the home and all its furnishings?
The reason so much misinformation is circulated, lawyers say, is that so many variables can affect the outcome. Much will depend on the kind of debts burdening the person filing for bankruptcy, the chapter of the bankruptcy code being used and the state in which the home is situated. 
 Even so, some general rules hold everywhere. If bankruptcy is being contemplated because the person can no longer afford the monthly mortgage payments or rent, then the home will ultimately be lost -- irrespective of which state it is in.
"But it could delay that day for as long as a year," said Barbara McEntyre, a lawyer in San Raphael, Calif., who specializes in bankruptcy. She said she recently watched a family hang onto its home for a full year as a result of a bankruptcy filing.
If the person can still afford the mortgage payments and rent but is sagging under an overload of other debt, such as high credit-card balances, business losses that were personally guaranteed or damages from a suit, then the home may well be saved.
First, some background reading can help make sense of what is clearly a complex situation. An exceptionally clear account can be found in the latest edition of "How to File for Bankruptcy" (Nolo Press, Berkeley, Calif., $24.95, obtainable at bookstores or by calling Nolo at (800) 992-6656).
A consultation with a bankruptcy lawyer before problems reach crisis level can also help save the debtor from two classic errors: falling behind on mortgage payments or rent while catching up on other debt, or taking out a large equity loan to pay off other debts and then falling behind on equity payments.
"More people lose their homes because of the size of their equity loans than for any other reason," said Jeffrey Sapir, a lawyer in White Plains who also specializes in bankruptcy law. This is because an equity loan is a secured debt and even under bankruptcy the courts normally let the lender go ahead with a forced sale to recoup all or part of his outstanding balance.
One of the first decisions the debtor must make is whether to file under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. If the debtor is unemployed and has no alternative source of steady income, it may be necessary to file under Chapter 7.
Chapter 13 is reserved for people with a regular income, less than $350,000 of secured debt and under $100,000 of unsecured debt. The aim is to give any debtor with an income a regulated method of paying off the overload of debt. It does not normally eliminate those debts.
Chapter 13 normally affords both the owner and the renter the best chance of saving the home because the court can impose a repayment schedule on the lender or landlord, said Peter J. Broege, a bankruptcy lawyer in Manasquan, N.J.
And this will immediately put the brakes on any efforts to reclaim the premises, provided the debtor can also meet ongoing payments or rent.
Chapter 13 can also lower the overall level of debt level on a home.
Consider the experience of Jimmy and Cynthia Bellamy of Bridgeport, Conn. The couple had a mortgage balance, including arrears and penalties, of $151,000, when they filed for bankruptcy in 1991. But the value of their home at the time of filing was only $127,000. The judge therefore reduced the debt to $127,000, arguing that a secured claim cannot exceed the value of the security.
While the ruling has not lowered the couple's monthly payments (the court did not have the right to change the terms of the original mortgage contract), it means that should they sell the house in the future the lender cannot demand more than $127,000.
ALTHOUGH this is not an unusual ruling, says Richard Zeisler, a lawyer in Bridgeport who handles many bankruptcies, it may not be the view of all bankruptcy courts.
Chapter 7 requires the debtor to liquidate all assets to help pay off creditors since the debts cannot be paid from income. Afterwards, any debts that cannot be satisfied from the proceeds are wiped clean.
But under Chapter 7 certain categories of assets, such as a personal residence, may be exempt from the sale and placed beyond the reach of creditors. When and how this can be done will hinge on how much equity is locked in the home and the laws of the state where the debtor lives. However, it is important to remember that such an exemption can never stop the forced sale of a home needed to pay off a secured creditor such as the holder of the mortgage or equity loan.
That is why most people should try to keep their mortgages or equity loan payments current even if they have to raise the money with a cash advance on a credit card, said Robin Leonard, the lawyer who was a co-author of the book from Nolo Press.
In Texas, Florida, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota and Oklahoma, none of the equity in the home can be used to pay off unsecured creditors (Texans, incidentally, are also permitted to keep two guns and a horse).
"That's how we became known as a debtors' haven," said Arthur Menor, a lawyer in Palm Beach, Fla., referring to a recent incident in which a developer from New Orleans hurriedly bought an oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach when faced with business debts totaling several million dollars.
Other states, such as New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, have less generous homestead exemptions. And these may save only $10,000 of equity in the home, not the home itself. However, the filing normally delays any pending foreclosure or forced sale because the bankruptcy court must review and approve such action.
Ms. Leonard said that renters using Chapter 7 can often buy time by tapping their "wild card" exemption. In most states the wild card allows the debtor to select any asset, such as a car or jewelry, up to a certain limit -- normally $4,000 -- and hang onto the cash it might generate for any purpose.
"You could put that money aside for future rent and or even use it to make the arrears," she said.
Finally, the contents of a home are rarely scooped up into a forced sale, said Ms. Leonard, because the cash that second-hand furnishings can generate is normally too paltry.

HEADLINE: $2.3 Billion Plan On the Horizon for Hunters Point

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the economy has played havoc with grand development visions, the public sponsors of the $2.3 billion Queens West project in Hunters Point believe that its time is at hand.
In part, that is because an experienced and influential group of developers and financiers already controls a key site in the 74.5-acre project area along the East River. This group may be able to solve the almost insurmountable problem of financing by building middle-income co-ops with tax-exempt bonds and the help of labor unions, either as partners or lenders. 
 "Right now, finding developers with financing ain't so easy," said Vincent Tese, chairman and president of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, one of the public sponsors. "If, in fact, the group that owns this site has the financing in place and is ready to go, it is going to look very attractive."
"As a general premise, there is a desire to get a shovel into the ground," he said, as a way of triggering the whole project.
The ground in question is known as the Gateway Residential Area, a 10.5-acre development site immediately south of the Pepsi-Cola bottling plant. Under the general project plan for Queens West, 1,450 apartments could be built in this area.
Most of the Gateway site is owned or under option to a partnership called M.O. Associates, which includes the Dreyfus Corporation, through a subsidiary called the Trotwood Corporation; an affiliate of the James D. Wolfensohn investment banking house and affiliates of the Zeckendorf Company and the Japanese construction and real estate concerns of Tekken and Tobishima.
"It demonstrates that there's serious private interest in the redevelopment of this area and that it's not simply an abstract fantasy of some bureaucrats," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, another public sponsor.
In theory, the state could condemn this property and award it to another developer. But Mr. Tese said the choice of M.O. Associates "might be judicious."
Herbert J. Sturz, a former chairman of the City Planning Commission and the president of Trotwood, said that if M.O. Associates were designated as the developer of the Gateway site, construction might begin by the end of 1993. That would surely enhance the credibility of the overall project.
THE Queens West Development Corporation, a new subsidiary of the Urban Development Corporation, has also made a bid for Unicef headquarters, which is now across the East River in Manhattan.
"We're hopeful they'll show a strong interest," said Vincent M. Albanese, chairman of the Queens West corporation. "If they do, it will accelerate the start of the project."
Although Unicef's director of administrative management dismissed the Queens West overture as not being nearly specific enough, it is conceivable that other United Nations agencies might be lured over the river.
Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens is also talking about a biomedical research complex with a 400-bed hospital at the site, which is across the water from numerous major medical centers.
"Lots of people are starting to look at the site," said Anthony E. Shorris, deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the other public sponsor of Queens West. "We are ready, as soon as the market is ready, to move ahead."
There are those familiar with Hunters Point who still believe that time is distant. "I think it's many years off before we see brick upon brick at that site," said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey. "We've had no work done on the infrastructure. None of the street work, none of the sewer work, has been started, let alone completed."
But a middle-income housing project may break the logjam because "it's a product no one else is offering," said Frederick S. Harris, the vice president of Trotwood and former director of real estate for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
"We're looking at a limited-profit potential," Mr. Sturz said. "We want to be part of something where we're making the statement that you can build in New York, reach a middle-income population and keep the union members who are here working."
M.O. Associates is talking with the Joint Industry Board of the Electrical Industry, a labor-management organization that administers the benefit plans of Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The board sponsored and was a developer of Electchester, a middle-income co-op project in Flushing, Queens.
"We try to see where we can invest money back into the community, as long as it's a prudent investment that has a market rate of return," said Larry Jacobson, assistant to the chairman of the joint board and its director of investments.
"What intrigued us about Queens West is that, for the first time, they're willing to do waterfront housing for middle-income people," he said. "A lot of our members are looking to the suburbs. This might be another alternative. We also felt it was a good time to get involved because we are a construction union and a lot of our members are unemployed. This is a way to spur job creation at the same time as housing."
Mr. Jacobson said the joint board would "reach out to the whole trade-union movement in the city to see if they would also participate." However, he also stressed that Queens West was not envisioned as an enclave for union members but intended for "working people and their families, whether they belong to the unions or not."
As conceived, two-thirds of the units in the first building, at least, would be available only to those whose household income fell below a certain level, currently $60,000. "We want to have a down payment low enough that it's realistic for people in that income range," Mr. Harris said, which would suggest something like $10,000 to $15,000. The other units would not be subject to an income limit.
MS. SHULMAN withheld any judgment of the scenario outlined by Mr. Sturz and his associates. But she said she would like Queens West to be "a cohesive project instead of an ad hoc, acre-by-acre thing." After all, she said, "this is one of the last large pieces in the city."
The Hunters Point waterfront runs a mile, from the Anable (or 11th Street) Basin to Newtown Creek -- or, to use more familiar landmarks, from the Pepsi-Cola sign, past the Tennisport tennis bubble and Norval cement silos, to the abandoned Newspoint printing plant, which was once used by The Daily News. The south half of the site is bounded on the east by Second Street; the north half by Fifth Street.
During Mr. Sturz's term as director of the City Planning Department, in 1984, the agency suggested that the Hunters Point waterfront be redeveloped in its entirety, "with a mix of community facilities, residential, commercial and residential uses."
That year, the Port Authority was empowered by the New York State Legislature to finance and implement waterfront projects and it undertook Hunters Point in tandem with a development in Hoboken, N.J.
In 1985, the authority acquired 22 acres at the south end of Hunters Point, paying $15.5 million to the Tribune Company of Chicago for Newspoint, which closed in 1982, and $9.8 million to buy out the lease that the Norval cement company had from the Tribune.
Master planning was undertaken by the architects Jordan L. Gruzen of Gruzen Samton Steinglass and John H. Beyer of Beyer Blinder Belle, both based in Manhattan. Ted D. Kleiner was named manager of the Hunters Point development at the Port Authority.
For a time, the project had 10 million square feet, divided evenly between offices and apartments, with about eight acres of public space on decks over the river. But this approach was abandoned and the public space was moved inland, thereby shrinking the overall development area. Also, the commercial-residential ratio was changed.
The final master plan called for 6.385 million square feet of residential space, or some 6,385 units; 2 million square feet of office space; a 350,000-square-foot hotel (about 350 rooms); 225,000 square feet of retail space; an elementary school for up to 650 pupils and a community center with a swimming pool.
Several key planning principles emerged. The existing shoreline, with its variety of coves and inlets, is to be retained, as are the old gantries on the water's edge. This is to be the site of a continuous esplanade.
The entire project is to be organized along a new north-south thoroughfare, called Center Boulevard, which would bend and shift to match the site geography and enhance vistas of the waterfront from inland sites.
EAST-WEST streets are to follow the established grid, both to integrate the project with its surroundings and to preserve view corridors from Long Island City.
In 1990, the Board of Estimate approved the project. Last September, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo announced that he would create the Queens West corporation to "buy up land at depressed recession prices and help set the stage to develop the area."
But the Governor was speaking in only general terms, Mr. Tese said, "I don't think he had any specific parcels in mind."
The new corporation was also meant to untangle the somewhat confused situation that resulted from three public sponsors.
In April, Mr. Cuomo appointed Mr. Albanese as chairman. He is the president of the Albanese Development Corporation and a partner in the law firm of Albanese, Albanese & Fiore, both of Garden City, L.I.
Albanese Development has built offices, houses and apartments in Queens, Nassau and Suffolk Counties but may be best known for 100 United Nations Plaza, a 52-story apartment tower at First Avenue and 48th Street, whose triangular top is a striking skyline feature as seen from Hunters Point.
Now, the corporation is looking for a president. Mr. Albanese expects one might be selected by summer's end.
The overall development plan divides the Hunters Point site into four areas.
SOUTHERN RESIDENTIAL AREA
Running from Newtown Creek to 54th Avenue, this area would have four development parcels and a waterside park. Buildings would range in height from 210 to 390 feet (about 21 to 39 stories) and would have from 453 to 656 units.
This is the former Newspoint site and is owned by the Port Authority.
COMMERCIAL CORE
Straddling Borden Avenue, this district would run from 54th Avenue to 50th Avenue and have four development parcels. Three of these would get office buildings, ranging from 180 to 400 feet. Two sites would have 800,000-square-foot buildings, one site would have a 400,000-square-foot-building and one site would get the hotel.
The south end of the area, the former Norval site, is owned by the Port Authority.
The north end is Tennisport, owned by Fred Botur, which has 16 indoor courts and 13 outdoor courts. Mr. Botur has a lawsuit pending in the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court that challenges the environmental analysis performed for Queens West, said his lawyer, Donald H. Elliott.
GATEWAY RESIDENTIAL AREA
Running from 50th Avenue to 47th Road would be four development parcels for apartment buildings ranging from 104 to 495 units and from 130 to 390 feet in height (13 to 39 stories). Floor-area ratios, the relation between lot size and floor space, would range from 2.98 to 8.37.
M.O. Associates owns most of the two southern development parcels outright, accounting for 58 percent of the Gateway area. The group says it has an option to buy most of the two northern parcels from Pamela Rankin-Smith, thereby bringing 93 percent of Gateway under their control.
Half of M.O. (it stands for Manhattan Overlook) is owned by T.T. Associates, a partnership of affiliates of the Tekken Construction Company and the Tobishima Corporation, both of Tokyo.
The other half is divided among six partners. Besides Dreyfus, Wolfensohn and Zeckendorf, they are World-wide Holdings, headed by Victor Elmaleh, a frequent partner in Zeckendorf projects; the M. J. Raynes Company and the Resolution Trust Company, as successor to the CorEast Financial Group.
NORTHERN RESIDENTIAL AREA
Running from the Anable Basin to 47th Road, this district would have seven development parcels, a landscaped waterfront park and a recreational park on Fifth Street. Apartment buildings would have from 212 to 745 units and range from 170 to 390 feet in height (17 to 39 stories).
This 21-acre property is owned by Pepsico and leased to the Pepsi-Cola Botting Company of New York. Pepsico has an agreement with an affiliate of M.O. Associates granting a "preferential right to purchase that site or develop it as a joint venture, if Pepsi decides to sell or develop it," said Anne Ward, a spokeswoman for Pepsi. She added that "there are no plans to make any changes right now."

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM: THE FOOTE SCHOOL IN NEW HAVEN;
'Don't Have So Many Baby Sitters. Enjoy Your Children.'

BYLINE: By MARCIA CHAMBERS

 BODY:
FRANK PERRINE was doing what he does best, moving in and out of classrooms, getting the feel of things. The fourth graders were in high gear, having performed in a Mayan festival the night before. "Were you nervous," asked Mr. Perrine of one. "Yes," confided the smiling child, "I said symbols instead of syllables."
Other children clamored to be heard. At one point he sat on a small chair and the students gathered round. "What's your theory as to why the Mayan civilization ended?" And the answers poured out. "But we really don't know, do we?"
And letting the question hang in the air, he was out the door. "This is what I like to do," he said. "Get out and around, make sure the kids still got the spunk and the spirit in them."
 
Savoring Every Moment
 Earlier this month he found himself savoring every moment in the final days in what has been a remarkable career as headmaster at the Foote School in New Haven. Most heads of schools do not last a decade; Mr. Perrine has been headmaster for 25 years. He has won the praise and affection of the staff, faculty and parents. His retirement, a year in the planning, has generated a library, a scholarship fund, a sculpture, a tree, a chair, a book, a biographical video, even an ode -- all in his honor.
Mr. Perrine's leaving the Foote school was as thoughtfully planned as Benno C. Schmidt's leaving Yale University was abrupt. While Mr. Schmidt's departure made headlines, Mr. Perrine's has been less visible yet of great significance to the same community. The Yale president and the Foote headmaster are more closely related than one might imagine, for many Foote parents teach at Yale and they care deeply about the private day school founded 75 years ago by Martha Babcock Foote, a Yale faculty wife and parent as well as a graduate of Bryn Mawr.
Foote has been home to many connected to Yale, both as students and as parents. The children of former Yale presidents A. Bartlett Giamatti, Kingman Brewster and A. Whitney Griswold all attended Foote. Guido Calabresi, the dean of the Yale Law School, and his wife, Anne, went to Foote, as did their three children. And the son of Yale's new provost, Judith Rodin, is now enrolled, as are many of the children of Yale's faculty.
Popular with students, Mr. Perrine knows the name of every child in the school. They approach him openly, unafraid. In part, they respond to his modesty, his optimism, his sense of humor, his willingness to chat with them. He still teaches the seventh grade and views himself as an old-fashioned history teacher. He said he did not think students were hurt by memorizing certain things: the Gettysburg Address, multiplication tables, state capitals and the names of the Presidents.
At his final school assembly, the students presented him with a wooden chair, which they had all signed. They asked him to sit him in it, and then each grade recited his favorites, including "The Swing" by Robert Louis Stevenson and a section of the Declaration of Independence. They ended with a hymn with many chords, just the kind Mr. Perrine likes to play on the piano.
Given this adoring throng, why is he retiring at the age of 58? It is not for another job. Rather, he said he believed it was time for him to try something new, and for the school to have fresh leadership. The new headmaster is Jean Lamont, formerly of the Allen-Stevenson School in Manhattan. Mr. Perrine said that a good friend who had retired at 65 told him not to wait that long. "He said 'you've got another life in you; do something else.' I believe that. I think you're a long time dead. Life is short and you should try different things. So, I forced myself out."
The Perrines will spend a year at their home in Peru, Vt., before deciding what's next. Even so, they leave a personal legacy to education -- their three adult children, Charlotte, Bill and Katherine, are all in teaching.
Looking back, Mr. Perrine says students are different today from when he arrived in New Haven from the Harvey School in Katonah, N. Y., where "we shook hands with the kids every morning and shook hands with them every night." The year was 1967 and the Foote School was at half its current enrollment of 430 boys and girls.
"Kids today are much more sophisticated," he continued. "They have a lot more stuff -- Nintendos and games and after-school activities. I tell their parents slow 'em down, be their parents, tell them no, don't rush their childhood, don't over-program them. Stay with them. Take the afternoon off, go fishing. Don't have so many baby sitters. Enjoy your children, enjoy your life."
If anything, he confided, he has seen more change in parents than in children: "I get so mad at them, I want to spank the parents some days. They give those kids everything. The kids are crying for someone to set limits, they're not going to tell you that but they are dying for someone to structure them. Tell them what they're supposed to do. I tell the parents don't let these kids be making all their own decisions. Some parents are afraid to speak to them, to say stop it."
Mr. Perrine, a product of the public schools of Cranbury, N. J., learned from the easy style of his acknowledged mentor at the Harvey School, Headmaster Leverett T. Smith, and sought to transplant the coziness of boarding school to Foote. But shortly after he arrived he was caught up in the educational turbulence of the 1960's. "We were radical about education in those days." he recalled. "I got all stricken with the latest theories. The open classroom, the idea that kids can't learn sitting still. We had merged age groups. Then our board starting getting on my case because they didn't think the kids were learning."
Mr. Perrine credited several people including Mr. Giamatti, who was secretary of the Foote board and teaching at Yale at the time, with helping him rethink his educational philosophy. "Rather than lecture me, he had me talk it through," Mr. Perrine said. "And we started all over again. We developed a statement of purpose for the school, we got a committee together and we worked on Saturday mornings and slowly pulled it all back."
Mr. Perrine said he now thinks a classical education is best. "We have Latin in grades seven to nine and French from grades four to nine, and we emphasize writing and the arts and sports."
He said a major issue for Foote was how to keep a social and economic mixture in a good community school when tuition ranges from $8,350 to $9,250 a child each year. Foote draws from 30 communities in addition to New Haven, has a 16 percent minority enrollment and a strong scholarship fund.
The paradox in the departures of Mr. Perrine from Foote and Mr. Schmidt from Yale is that Mr. Schmidt, who is to lead a new private school venture for Whittle Communications, has had no experience in a world that has been Mr. Perrine's life. The Whittle concept does not appeal to Mr. Perrine because, he said, it is predicated on computer and television learning, and as important as technology is to education, it cannot replace the teacher.
"Education is the spark between the kid and the teacher," he said. "You've got to get inside a kid's heart. That's not what computers do."

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
Thai Food in the Heart of New Haven

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
IN the late 1980's, Thai restaurants seemed to open with alacrity, but the pace has slowed over the last couple of years. That probably has as much to do with economics as with any possibility that the public is sated with the delicate yet fiery cuisine.
Nevertheless, a new Thai restaurant, Bangkok Gardens, has opened smack in the center of New Haven, near the Yale University campus and across the street from the Yale Repertory Theater. 
 While hardly a garden, the new restaurant strives for an airy, open feeling. A glass-roof addition on the front of an old brick building has two glassed-in sides that contribute to a feeling of space and cheerfulness. Inside, the restaurant proper (the smoking section) has buff-color walls (and one exposed brick one) decorated with ornate Thai embroideries and pictures.
The menu has the expected Thai curries -- red, green, yellow and massaman -- available with chicken, pork, beef, shrimp or tofu. There is also a listing "Exclusively Bangkok Gardens" of nine dishes available with the aforementioned ingredients, plus assorted vegetable combinations, many sauteed. This back-to-basics approach may be intended as a simplification for non-Thai diners, but it has the suggestion of fast-food preparation. The dish in this category that we tried -- pork with ginger, mushrooms, onions, scallions and bean sauce -- reminded us more of China than Thailand.
As starters, we began with satays of chicken: white meat threaded on matchstick skewers. The chicken was deep yellow from its curry marinade, with a mild but definitive curry flavor. The peanut dip with it had zip but was unnecessary with the curry. We used the dip with Bangkok rolls instead of the sweet sauce that came with them. The spring rolls, filled with minced meat and vegetables, tasted freshly made and the wrappers were thin and crunchy crisp. Goong-tad, a third appetizer, consisted of five whole shrimp, wrapped in a thick batter, deep-fried golden and served with a delicate sweet sauce.
Yum nua, a salad that did double duty as a starter, was a dish we have savored elsewhere. The Bangkok Gardens version was severely disappointing, partly because the strips of broiled beef were so tough and dried out they curled at the edges, while the rest of the dish -- red onion slices in an indifferent sauce -- wasn't interesting enough to compensate. Missing were the usual fresh mint, cilantro, lemon grass and lime. The "mild tangy sauce" lacked the hot chili-lime taste that would have provided some gusto. In fact, the fresh accents that normally give a lift to Thai dishes and provide the intoxicating balance of hot, tart, sweet and subtle -- lemon grass, fresh cilantro, lime and Thai ginger -- were missing from all our Bangkok Gardens dishes.
Miles ahead of other entrees was chaiya noodles, a mixture of thin yellow noodles, scallions, bean sprouts and carrots in a spicy peanut-flavored sauce. It had verve and veracity. Bangkok basil -- a combination of beef, fresh basil, red and green peppers, onions and mushrooms, with a hint of anise -- also had a modicum of sparkle.
Certain dishes seemed to be going through the motions. An entree of massaman curry, cited as containing "sweet potatoes," piqued our interest. To our disappointment "sweet" turned out to be plain old white potatoes, a somewhat ho-hum addition to the chicken, onions, peanuts and carrots in the dish. Furthermore, the mild coconut milk curry sauce lacked the garam masala-spice mixture that differentiates a massaman curry from other Thai curries. Tamarind duck, another entree, consisted of excessively fatty duck slices, scallions, mushrooms, slices of red pepper, onions and canned pineapple cubes; the sweet-sour tamarind tang was missing.
Desserts are minimal at Bangkok Gardens, but the ginger ice cream made a pleasing palate refresher. Other options were coconut ice cream and canned lichees.
On one visit four of us spent $65 (before tax, tip and beverages) for a dinner that consisted of three courses apiece. There is a minuscule wine list and several beer choices, including Singha, the Thai beer that makes a light, agreeable accompaniment to a Thai meal. The price is certainly right at Bangkok Gardens and so is the location. Now if only greater attention were paid to the cuisine, this garden could really bloom.

HEADLINE: After Shoreham Fiasco, Break Up Lilco

 BODY:
If the chairman of Lilco ["New Style Emerges as Lilco Revives," June 18] thinks that the company suffered during the 80's with the Shoreham fiasco, what about the innocent ratepayers who have to pay the huge cost of that mess for the next decade?
When you add in the interest charges, the price of Shoreham will be an easy $10 billion, which is higher on a per capita basis than the cost of the greatest American financial scandal: the Federal S. & L. swindle. 
 Shoreham and Lilco, our own local S. & L. scandal, is costing the Island ratepayer (a k a the public) dearly, and it is the public that is and will suffer from Lilco's mismanagement, while the managers collect fat bonuses and golden parachutes after the Governor's "wonderful deal."
What nerve to tell the innocent victims about Lilco's suffering, especially when this scandal hurts the poor, the elderly on fixed incomes and the most productive part of our economy -- small business! We the public are being robbed, and Lilco should be ashamed to say that "it now wants to help cure the sick economy."
Lilco's chairman may claim that his "critics do not understand the situation," but the critics were right all along. We don't have a nuclear Shoreham, and we never had the massive power crisis, the off-shore oil wells or "the one or more coal plants" that Lilco supporters threatened. If Lilco listened to its critics (who are probably hundreds of thousands, instead of tens of thousands), and converted to a gas-fired plant when Shoreham's price doubled, our rates would be near the national average. And projections of the average U.S. electric rate actually show a slight decline by the year 2000. Instead of now having the highest rates in the country, rates that will increase again by 60 to 100 percent under the Governor's deal, our electric rates could be below average with the inclusion of the Island's share of New York State hydropower.
Hydro that keeps Greenport's rates low and that was built by an Islander, Robert Moses, should be a major part of our power mix, no matter what Lilco says. But the maldistribution of this cheap, reliable and safe power in New York State is another way in which the Island public is being robbed besides the Shoreham swindle. If New Jersey can successfully sue for a share of this hydro, why can't the Island? Instead of suing Suffolk, Lilco could copy the Jersey brief and try to get us our share. But I guess there's nothing in it for them. And Cuomo seems to be unwilling to get hydro from upstate or Quebec.
This Shoreham saga has been riddled with baloney from Lilco all along, but the claim from them that "Lilco is no longer a monopoly" is blatantly not true. Nor only are they a monopoly, they are a double monopoly, controlling two vital sources of power that should compete with each other. Edison may have copied the gas works when he started his electric companies during the 1880's, but there is no synergy involved in combining gas and electric power in one-company-only greed.
Economic competition works. The Sherman Antitrust Act is supposed to work, and the recent breakup of A.T. & T. is already paying off in reduced rates and better service. Now is the time to start on the road to breaking up Lilco. If a well-heeled, respected company like A.T. & T., with a national treasure like Bell Labs, can be broken up, so too can a nearly bankrupt, despised Lilco with a national disgrace like Shoreham.

HEADLINE: An Epitaph for Shoreham From Cuomo

 BODY:
From a podium near the reactor core Gov. Mario M. Cuomo delivered a requiem for the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station on June 17 to start the two-year decommissioning of the plant. The project, which will be carried out by the Long Island and New York Power Authorities, is expected to cost $186 million. It involves a partial dismantling and the removal of radioactive parts from the $5.5 billion plant.
After off-the-cuff remarks, Mr. Cuomo pressed a button to make an underwater torch sever a pipe that would have been part of the emergency cooling system. Following are his remarks: 
 I don't think I have the words to describe the significance of this event. This is a nearly incredible situation, I dare say, anywhere in the world, certainly anywhere in the country, where you stop the population and say, "Let us tell you exactly what happened on Long Island."
They built a great new modern facility. It cost them $5 billion and more. It was only supposed to cost $500 million. And many of us shouted from the early stages that it oughtn't to be done.
But forces that wanted to build it were greater than the forces against it in the beginning, and so they went forward to the point where they have an almost inexplicably complicated structure, billions and billions of dollars.
And a lot of people, including the Governor, felt that in the end it was threatening people's lives in a way that you could not tolerate. And no amount of money, no amount of investment could be great enough to excuse the risk that it would impose on even a single human life.
 
'How Do You Value Life?'
 And this then was the test of society on Long Island as well as New York State. How do you value life? All this vast power, all these billions of dollars, all the major newspapers, all the big shots, most of the politicians, most of the Republicans, most of the Democrats, the entire Legislature's refusing to stop it, because they were afraid of the power of the thing.
Everybody refusing to take a position. Nobody on the side of what we thought was the truth. Nobody. Even the Governor, for all that he tried to do, did not have the power to stop it by himself. How is it, then, that the plant was stopped?
It was not the Governor. It was not [State Economic Development Director] Vincent Tese. It was not [Long Island Power Authority chairman] Richie Kessel. It wasn't Irving [Like, a lawyer and authority trustee opposed to the plant]. It wasn't Nora [Bredes, a leader of citizen opposition to the plant and now a Suffolk County Legislator]. It wasn't all the people that struggled in the streets. We didn't do it. We never passed a bill to do it. We didn't stop it physically.
Well then, what stopped it? You try explaining that. I do. I tried in Tokyo, I tried at The Wall Street Journal. I tried from time to time in Washington and elsewhere. There are media people in this place right now who don't understand.
It was not stopped by any act of the Legislature. It was not stopped by an executive order of the Governor. It was not stopped by any act of the Department of Economic Development.
 
Recalcitrance of the Legislature
 It was stopped by consent of Lilco and the shareholders and a lot of people who decided it did not make sense. What won here in the end was the inexorable force of common sense and intelligence.
No political power won. All the political power was against us. I could not get the Legislature to vote on it. You talk about disgraceful performances. I could not get them to vote on it. Think of that. Millions of human lives at stake, and they did not want to take a position. You try being the governor under those circumstances.
And so it wasn't politics. It was common sense. No. 1, the threat. No. 2, the practicality. This would have wasted money in the long run. It is easier to close it down, to decommission it, to convert it, than to go forward with it. Common sense.
Now there's a heck of a thought. Imagine if you can apply that kind of intelligence to all the other near disasters in this society. If you had the capacity as a state and as a nation to spend $5 billion on something like this and at the very last moment recognize intelligence, turn it all around and now convert it into something which I guarantee you is going to be better.
Because even if you do not find an alternative use for this very facility when they do the arithmetic 10 years from now, the shutting of this plant will have been the smart thing to do on the dollars, on the economics, on the numbers.
The way you are correcting this mistake, you can correct them all. All the mistakes you have made in the budget deficit and squandered money on military devices that you no longer need, all the failed investment in education and poor people and people who need an opportunity, all the inability of the Congress and the Presidency and governments everywhere to do the right thing that has put us now on the downward slide economically -- the way you turned around Shoreham you can turn around anything. With common sense, with intelligence.
If only some people are persistent enough to keep shouting it at the public, this country will recognize that in the end. That's what Shoreham means.
Common sense and intelligence closed it. And common sense and intelligence can bring us back to the top in this world economically, can reverse some of the stupid things we are doing. It can correct the foolish differences we have among one another, the blacks, the African-Americans, the rest of the population, constantly people's looking to divide us and put us against one another. Stupidity, lack of intelligence, lack of common sense. Shoreham is the reminder that in the end we can be smart, that in the end we can be good.
I am very pleased to have been a small part of it. Thank you.

HEADLINE: No-Frills Insurance Proposed for Cars

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AFTER years of paying some of the highest automobile insurance premiums in the country, New Jersey motorists may soon be able to purchase bare-bones insurance for as little as $250 a year.
Two proposals about to work their way through the Legislature would dramatically change the state's compulsory-insurance law to allow drivers to buy greatly reduced coverage for a fraction of what they now pay, which can exceed $2,500 a year. 
 The no-frills policies, supporters say, are intended for New Jersey's estimated 500,000 uninsured motorists, many of whom are believed to need their cars for work but cannot afford to buy insurance at current rates.
Both proposals have influential legislators behind them. Senator Gerald Cardinale, Republican of Demarest, who is sponsoring one of the measures, is the chairman of the Commerce Committee, which presides over insurance matters in the Senate. The sponsor of the other proposal is Assemblywoman Clare M. Farragher, Republican of Freehold Township, who is chairwoman of the Assembly Insurance Committee.
Both proposals would reduce the amount of personal injury protection coverage required under the state's no-fault insurance law to $15,000 from $250,000. And under Mr. Cardinale's proposal, a person with a no-frills policy would not be required to have liability insurance if he or she gives up the right to sue for pain and suffering resulting from an accident caused by another driver. Currently every automobile must be covered by at least $15,000 of liability coverage, which is used to pay claims for pain and suffering of those injured in an accident caused by an insured driver.
Insurance industry officials said the proposals appeared to be a first step toward more affordable insurance. But some trial lawyers argued that as many as half the state's automobile owners might sign up for low-cost, bare-bones policies, leaving them with inadequate coverage.
And the possibility that drivers could waive their liability coverage was described by Gerald H. Baker, a Hoboken lawyer who specializes in automobile negligence cases, as "trading the legal rights of the innocent victim in order to protect the economic rights of the careless driver."
The average price in New Jersey for full- coverage insurance -- including comprehensive and collision -- for a person with a clean driving record is now about $825. That figure soars for drivers with bad records.
"We are currently forcing people to pay as much as $2,500 for insurance when they don't really need that much coverage," Mr. Cardinale said. He added that the no-frills policy he was proposing would sell for about $300.
Mrs. Farragher said the $15,000 minimum would be adequate to cover the insured person's medical expenses in 90 percent of cases. In those cases where medical costs exceed $15,000, the insured person would be responsible for the balance.
Both proposals also change the amount of insurance required to cover the cost of repairing vehicles involved in accidents. Mr. Cardinale's plan would reduce the minimum property damage coverage required to $2,000 from $5,000. Mrs. Farragher's proposal would increase the minimum coverage to $10,000.
But the two proposals differ most markedly in the area of liability insurance coverage.Under Mr. Cardinale's proposal, car owners could avoid buying liability coverage by relinquishing their right to sue for pain and suffering, but they would not be prohibited from suing for actual economic losses, like wages.
"It's cat and dog suits that really run up our insurance bills in New Jersey," Mr. Cardinale said, adding that under his proposal, "a lot of those suits will be eliminated."
Mr. Cardinale acknowledges that a no-frills policy is inappropriate for most drivers, particularly those with assets, since such a policy affords little or no protection against a lawsuit.
"We're going to be putting in a very dramatic disclosure statement saying, 'If you own a house, you're crazy to take this,' " he said.
Some trial lawyers, however, say no-frills policies provide inexpensive insurance at the expense of innocent accident victims. Allowing drivers to drive without liability coverage, Mr. Baker said, will make it nearly impossible for an accident victim to recover damages for pain and suffering from the party at fault.
"You can sue them and win and you get nothing," Mr. Baker said. "The purpose of compulsory liability insurance is not to protect the assets of the careless driver; it's to protect the innocent people who are injured in accidents."
 
Concern Over 'Bandwagon'
 Mr. Baker also expressed concern that many drivers other than those who were currently uninsured might opt to buy the bare-bones policies.
"I would bet you that 50 percent of the public jumps on the bandwagon because they think they're getting a bargain," he said. And that, Mr. Baker said, would result in more people's driving around with minimal coverage, and an increase in the cost of insurance for the responsible drivers who buy conventional insurance.
Thomas J. Vesper, an Atlantic City lawyer who specializes in personal injury cases, described Mr. Cardinale's proposal to require the purchasers of no-frills policies to give up their right to sue for pain and suffering as "offensive and unconscionable" because it would take advantage of a disadvantaged person's desperation.
"They might say 'great' today," he said, "but what happens tomorrow when they're in an accident and lose a limb or lose a fetus?"
 
A Different Approach
 Mrs. Farragher's version of no-frills insurance takes a different approach to the liability issue.
"We toyed with the idea of taking out the mandatory liability coverage," she said, "but settled on a $15,000 single-limit bodily injury liability per car."
A $15,000 single-limit policy means that $15,000 is the maximum amount that would be paid for pain and suffering for injuries sustained in an accident, regardless of how many people are injured. Current law requires a "$15,000/$30,000" minimum, which means that any one person can recover up to $15,000, with a maximum of $30,000 being available for each accident.
Mrs. Farragher said her proposal was the result of recommendations and suggestions that her committee received over the last six months from insurance experts across the state.
 
'Every Possible Interest Group'
 "We sent a letter to every possible interest group that had anything to do with auto insurance," she said. "We wanted to develop an affordable product that could be marketed to the working poor who sometimes have to choose between making their auto insurance payment and paying their rent or feeding their families."
Mrs. Farragher said the final cost of her proposed policy had not yet been determined. "We've had numbers from $250 a year to $500," she said.
Insurance industry officials say that while more radical changes will ultimately be necessary, the proposed no-frills policies represent a first step toward more sensible insurance requirements.
"We're saying that the no-frills policy is fine for the limited number of folks who don't need and can't afford anything else," said Jerry Lane, regional vice president of the State Farm Insurance Company in Wayne."It essentially makes a person street-legal."

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW JERSEY

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma

 BODY:
IT was a honey of a day, so sweet with sunshine and June skies that Newark looked scrubbed. Real nice.
In such light the three blocks from Pennsylvania Station to Broad Street make for an impressive show. Buildings there are tall, glassy and appropriately angular, the way they are expected to be in any modern city. The overhead walkway above Raymond Boulevard connecting the train station to the Legal and Communication Center even makes Newark look, at that angle, futuristic. 
 The home-bound rush hour was over, but there still was plenty of light left in the day. Light, but not life, for Newark's main streets had already been all but abandoned to the night. The only people around were a woman in a white uniform standing impatiently outside the Wilfred Academy, smoking a cigarette, and a knot of people near Military Park waiting for some way-late bus. A shirtless man sat on a bench asking for change.
There was one place, however, that hummed with both light and life. Above the door a telling sign: Free Public Library. Emphasis on free.
Most every community has a library; it is one of the elements that transforms a settlement into a community. But few places have great libraries. Usually these are reserved for universities and the odd cities that transcend the confusion of special interests to create institutions rooted in the forceful notion that unless all of us prosper, none of us do.
The building is a three-story limestone classic with a confident facade and an aura of rock-steadiness. It sits essentially unchanged in an unlucky city where so much else has been irreversibly altered. Approaching it from the sidewalk on Washington Street, one is struck by the notion that the Newark Public Library is a great institution in a city that once believed it too would be great.
Most New Jersey residents have never set foot inside the main branch of the library, but those who have understand it is a special place that, in a sense, belongs not just to the 275,000 people who now live in Newark but to the 7.7 million people in the state. It is a treasure, albeit something of a hidden one, that is now endangered by a shortage of dollars and the limits of vision.
Newark, like every city, is feeling the economic squeeze of rising costs and inadequate resources. Something had to be cut. And along with lots of other things, the administration of Mayor Sharpe James decreased the library's budget by 15 percent this year. That has meant the library is closed on Sundays, and on the three late nights it is open until 8:30, not 9 o'clock.
The book purchasing budget was slashed by more than 25 percent, which actually translates into a far worse cut because books and subscriptions are rising in cost so quickly that just staying even requires more money from one year to the next.
There have been other cuts, too. The staff is down to 195, 65 fewer than a year ago. At the same time the number of people using the library is up, as always happens when times get bad.
Or it means that while the library itself is open, some departments will be dark. On this night, the Sala Hispanoamericana, a new Spanish-language collection, had to be kept locked because there wasn't enough staff to man it.
The library's gentle-mannered director, Alex Boyd, does not complain much. He says he understands the predicament Newark is in, having to choose between one good purpose and another. Dressed in a neat gray suit, with a lavender shirt and tie, he is the picture of composure. But the strain is there.
"I don't know how long our fingernails will last," he said during an interview in his third-floor office, "but we're hanging in there."
Part of the problem is Dr. Boyd's doing. You see, he has pushed the library into a dilemma. When he came from the Chicago Public Library four years ago, he was determined to throw open long-stuck windows. He has kept all one million books on the shelves, and added thousands more, but his focus is setting up all kinds of activities to reach out to the community and bring back the library to what its most influential director, John Cotton Dana, had conceived of as "a people's university."
Dr. Boyd did everything he could to entice people into the library. He spruced it up with paint and carpet and user-friendly computers. He had his staff organize all kinds of hands-on activities for children, hoping that by inviting the little ones to puppet shows or barbecues he can whet their appetites for the wonders of knowledge.
It has worked, in a sense too well. Having hooked them, the library has found that the new patrons required more services, just when money has grown scarce.
Dr. Boyd doesn't like to retreat. The cuts made so far fall into the category of what he calls "selective pruning" which, he said, if done right, makes the main stem stronger without any permanent damage.
"We'll downsize somewhat, but we don't want to stop anything all together because if you let anything go you may never get it back," he said. "We don't want to lose the heart and soul of the library because of what we hope is a temporary financial difficulty."
By 8:25 that night the streets of Newark have cooled a bit, the shadows having gone to encroaching night. The library begins to empty, and it's like one of those old television routines where the clowns keep coming out of the Volkswagen.
Here comes Robert Pennick, a 29-year-old part-time student at Union County College, coming from a tutoring session that the college requires him to attend. Behind him, a group of Spanish-speaking people who had been closeted on the third floor practicing their English pronunciation: "Draw. Drew. Drawn. Difficult, eh?"
A man and a woman come out together with a videotape from the library's circulating collection. Benjamin Martinez and his son Damian come out into the night air, each holding a book.
"It's lovely to be here," said Mr. Martinez, who has lived in Newark's Ironbound section for more than 30 years and who says he comes to the library at least once a week to borrow books. He has checked out a Spanish-language history of Puerto Ricans in America.
Mr. Martinez said the shorter hours had made it somewhat more difficult for him to use the library. He firmly believes that such cuts are, in the end, counterproductive. "Let me put it to you this way," he said. "If they cut things that are going to educate people, what good is that?"
A man with crazed eyes stumbles out of the library, shouting threats and heading into an uncertain night. But this is a big city, and no one pays much attention.
Behind the man swarms a flock of teen-agers, mostly girls but with a few boys mixed in. They have been coming once a month since last September to participate in the Delta Sigma Theta Teen Lift program, run by volunteer sorority members who live in the Newark area.
The teen-agers come to hear women like Patricia Davis Adams and Beverly J. Evans, who graduated years ago and have successfully launched their own careers. They talk about how much more there is to life than the streets of Newark offer.
"People need the library," said Tameika Carter, a 16-year-old from Irvington who said she often came to the library to help her mother, Joyce, a lawyer, do research in the library's outstanding New Jersey Reference Room. She said she also used the library for her own book reports and papers, and she came for some of the cultural programs.
"You come here to read up on history," she said. "All your history is in library books."
A white-shirted security guard comes out finally to close the gate and lock the doors of the library for another night. But he can't.
Inside the library's elegant marble vestibule, two young children in plastic fireman's hats have found out they can make loud noises. They seem to like the sound. Given the obvious affection they've already developed for the place, chances are they will grow up to be two more of Dr. Boyd's converts, two more budget busters who have developed the notion that libraries are fine places to be, if only you can get in.

Pictures of an Accessible Russia Capture a Fleeting Moment

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

DATELINE: SOMERS

 BODY:
ARTISTS have traditionally forgathered in countries not their own. Depending on the time, they went to Germany, Italy or France -- wherever the art action was. But since World War II their reasons for relocating have been more often political and economic than esthetic and, seemingly, most have come to the United States.
As a rule of thumb, political trouble abroad augurs a new influx into American galleries. Cuban artists have been among the most visible, Romanians among the most recent. Yet, the emphasis is still on the Russians, who first became noticeable in the 1970's. Not long ago, two large collections of Russian art were bestowed on Rutgers University's Zimmerli Art Museum in New Brunswick, N.J., prompting plans to establish a Russian studies center. 
 Into this grand context must be placed the latest Russian manifestation in Westchester, a modest show at the Somerstown Gallery here by four painters, a printmaker and three photographers, some of them Russians and some using Russian subjects.
To take the painters first, Marjorie Michaels, a Russian, focuses on the churches on the Golden Ring, a tourist route in and around Moscow. Washed on canvas in thin acrylic, the pictures look postcardy and, in fact, were based on illustrations for a book about the route, which was recently published in St. Petersburg.
All the same, the grandeur of these structures shows through. The Mongol Empire, the largest in the history of the world, has not had a good press but at least it bequeathed to Russia the incomparable onion-shaped dome. There is even one gracing the all-wood Church of the Transfiguration in the village of Hogliat Yevo.
Leonid Hushnatov paints men's heads, giving them titles like "Inspired Spiritual" and "Beaten, Hackneyed." Some of the subjects are bald and bearded while others are turbaned, but all look somewhat alike. He also shows a not-bad view of a landscape inundated by a flood.
Still, the best painting is the heavily impastoed study of a cherry tree in bloom by Dima Karabchievsky, while the most problematic pictures come from Sergei Polyakov. Inspired by Russian folk tales, these may prove too extravagant even for Americans partial to camp.
For example, "Mikula," a scantily clad peasant with Schwarzeneggerian muscles, charges toward the viewer pushing a hand plow; "Father Frost" has a white beard so long that it seems to drool across the landscape; "Veles" is an old man who sits among trees with reindeer antlers on his head and is encircled by a crowd of miniature horses, bears and rabbits. Mr. Polyakov's technique also leaves something to be desired.
Andre Shabunin gets the show back on track with his mezzotints of figures -- a family group and a woman at her toilette, which may be based on photographs, and a portrait of himself wearing a Rembrandtian tam-o'-shanter.
Then come the photographers, of whom Lisa Toto, an American, gets the most space. Most of her pictures are color prints of familiar types -- the old folk musician with the bifurcated beard, women with seamed faces in babushkas, flaxen-haired children, fashion plates looking not too different from their American contemporaries who affect the styles of the 1950's, and so on. Nudging the viewer along are such titles as "All Work and No Play," "Years of Pain" and "Generation to Generation."
But when visiting Chernobyl (a brave thing to do), Ms. Toto abandons journalistic cliches and produces grainy black and whites that are unnerving in their ordinariness. There is a thicket of pylons that could be in New Jersey, and a baby carriage abandoned in a rural cul-de-sac suggests poverty in the Appalachians. A solitary sandal could be one of hundreds that appear on New York City streets, raising the question of why one never sees people half shod.
A Russian photographer, Sergei Kuzmin, takes stark but effective black and whites of daily life. Two smiling Siamese twins joined at the hip pose in a corridor with one crutch apiece; a day starts in a communal kitchen with a tousled man scratching himself as he takes a coffee pot from the stove, and a woman sits on a folding chair making up her face. In another shot, the head of a theater company stands in his office before a wall scrawled with what seem to be congratulatory messages.
Also working in black and white is Anatoly Loshmanov, who deals mainly with children in all their ethnic diversity, but includes a shot of a masked surgeon at work.
These photographers, like many of those in the recent Russian exhibition at the Lehman College Art Gallery, suggest that now is a precious moment: a country that has been closed for about 70 years has much to show the world and does not yet have an abundance of gadgetry and color film with which to glamorize its findings.
The show is on view through July 5.
Regarding hardship, most museums may be having a bad time financially, but Somerstown has prospered enough to open the Gallery in the Schoolhouse in Croton Falls. Information about both spaces may be obtained by calling 277-3461.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Rates Are Just One Piece of the Puzzle

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
President Bush has again urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. It was still another reminder that the economic recovery remains sluggish despite short-term rates that have already been cut to their lowest level in 20 years.
Undoubtedly, a further move by the Fed would help the economy a bit by prompting cuts in the prime rate charged by banks, causing the banks to cut rates on deposits so low that consumers and businesses would have more incentive to spend or invest. 
 But the economy's muted response so far is a reminder that the willingness of banks to make loans is just as important as the level of interest rates. Bank loans to businesses have been declining the past year, one more reason for the slower than normal rebound in the economy.
According to an article soon to be published in the annual report of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, bank regulators' efforts the past few years to cure the banking system of the ills that resulted from lax supervision in the 1980's may have aggravated the lending squeeze -- and the economy's malaise.
Rather than blame legions of nameless bank examiners for being too tough, Richard F. Syron, president of the Boston Fed and author of the article, says regulators compounded their earlier mistakes when they imposed tougher capital standards on banks that were weakened by loan losses. With that change, he said, the banks' capital lost its traditional role as a buffer available to absorb losses in times of stress. That role allowed banks to continue their business without wrenching adjustments to lending practices and customers.
But as bank failures led to losses at the Federal deposit insurance fund, regulators began seeing capital as a pool of money to share those losses, Mr. Syron said. When regulators told the weakest banks to strengthen their capital quickly to 6 percent or 8 percent of their assets, well above the 3 percent minimum standard, Mr. Syron said, many New England banks could comply only by selling their best assets and shutting off the spigot for new loans.
The changes at banks went "well beyond any desirable backing away from overly liberal lending terms," Mr. Syron said, and caused severe harm to the local economy and many customers, especially small businesses. He said a gentler policy could have helped the economy, which would have done more to reduce losses in the bank insurance fund than any belated efforts to strengthen capital.
While regulators still say that banks are better off with more capital, they do not seem inclined to make standards tougher in the immediate future. Under the Fed's preliminary version of new capital rules for banks most sensitive to interest rate shifts, just a small part of the industry will find itself in need of additional amounts.
Meanwhile, the Fed can only work with the tools it has, and that suggests another cut in rates.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Rocky Road to a Global Market

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
"Our market will be the market where the action will take place," said Jean-Francois Theodore, the chief executive officer of the Bourse de Paris. It is the kind of comment expected of a man in his job, especially when he is visiting the United States to drum up business for the French stock market.
This is the message he brought to the pension funds, brokerage firms and investment banks that he met with: France is a market poised for explosive growth, especially as the Government moves to sell to the public many state-owned or -controlled blue-chip companies, like Rhone-Poulenc, Air France, Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit Lyonnais. It is a market that has been modernized, with a computer trading system driven totally by orders. 
 "The market is not going to be lively in Germany," Mr. Theodore said. "It is a cultural thing. There is no privatization." And in Britain, he added, "everything has already taken place."
What he did not explain on his tour, but did detail in an interview last week in New York, are his views on the broader future of the French Bourse, which is up 8.5 percent this year, and European stock markets as the political and economic unification of Europe approaches at the end of the century.
On this issue, he embodies all the parochial and national desires that will make this transition difficult, especially in the market for retail investors. He is caught between the market forces that are pushing change and the desire to protect his own turf. His comments on the future should be as much a warning to those who have chosen not to worry about the obstacles ahead as was the Danes' surprising rejection of the outline for political and monetary union in a referendum at the beginning of June.
In a new book, "The End of Geography," Richard O'Brien, chief economist at American Express Bank in London, also issues a warning. He sees market forces, like technological advances and the free flow of capital, pushing financial markets toward a global state in which the location of a company's headquarters or where financial business is conducted will no longer be important.
But the transition to that "seamless" market, he warns, will be grim. "A more sober look at the crystal ball," he writes, "suggests a rather bumpy road toward seamlessness: intense competition among financial firms, with major bankruptcies, forced mergers followed by massive shakeouts, crises for customers and producers alike, repeated losses from overambitious investment in new technologies, financial crises leading to the socialization of losses (a la S&Ls) and seemingly intractable problems in reconciling the fundamental differences between contrasting financial systems."
Mr. Theodore acknowledges that the hegemony of local stock markets in Europe will be challenged, likely by outside trading networks that will try to establish their own pan-European market for big blue-chip stocks. It is the kind of challenge that the London stock market has already offered with its concentration on the trading of foreign stocks. (Mr. Theodore dismisses claims by the London market and others that a major share of French stock trading takes place in London, arguing that the London market "is always counting trades two, three or four times.")
He says there should be more cooperation among Europe's stock exchanges on trading as a defense against the success of some outside network. He lamented the fact that a trading system called Euroquote, which would allow the trading of blue-chip stocks among exchanges, has been stalled because of opposition in Germany and Britain.
But, he still concludes, "I don't believe in a pan-European stock exchange. At the end of the 90's, there will be four or five or six stock exchanges, each having the lead in its own domestic stocks." He argues that despite the internationalization of many companies, like Nestle in Switzerland and Peugeot and Alcatel Alstholm in France, the country where the company is based will still determine where most of its stock is traded and where the stock will be most liquid.
"The internationalization of a company does not mean the internationalization of the stock," he said. "The home country will always mean something."
One reason he thinks a broader market will be difficult to achieve is that the merging of company and takeover laws throughout a unified Europe will be very difficult because of the desire to protect the home base. "It is more difficult to converge on company law," he said, than on inflation.
Despite the problems ahead, Mr. Theodore seems to be resisting the change that is coming. It may not be pan-European, but it seems more likely that there could be a two-tier system, with major blue-chip stocks trading as much outside their own countries as in them, while smaller stocks stay home.
Mr. O'Brien, like Mr. Theodore, thinks it will be much harder to move to a truly global equities market than it has been to create an international foreign exchange market. But he also doubts whether any stock market will be able to maintain a national base in a world where location is losing its importance.
The Bourse approach, Mr. O'Brien writes, "presupposes that in the future it will be easy to identify French versus Italian versus British stocks, when companies themselves are becoming more European and/or global in an end-of-geography world."
He also asks if it will be feasible for French companies to "confine trades in French stocks to one market if those companies could enjoy better conditions elsewhere, as a result of tapping a wider marketplace."

THE ECONOMY
 
While the Other Guys Brawl, Clinton Sneaks In a Platform 

While Ross Perot and the Republicans dominated the airwaves with their slugfest over "opposition research," Gov. Bill Clinton and the Democrats released drafts of their party platform. The plan -- which they call the "third way" because they see it as between laissez-faire and welfare-state economics -- proposes increased taxes on the wealthy and on corporations and a 5 percent cut in middle-class taxes -- reduced from Mr. Clinton's original proposal of a 10 percent tax cut. It also calls for a cut in capital gains taxes, new tax credits for the working poor and heavy spending on schools and highways. The tax increases will enable the Democrats to chop the Federal deficit in half by 1996. "It's clearly time to reassess and change our policies and face reality," Mr. Clinton said. Predictably, the Republicans were not impressed. The Clinton plan "has been strictly for media consumption," said Richard G. Darman, President Bush's budget director.
 
A Presidential Prod at the Fed
 
While economists noodle over whether lower interest rates will add spark to the economy or just fuel inflation, President Bush made his views known last week. "I'd like to see another lowering of interest rates," he said, in a statement aimed at prodding Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, to push down rates. But the Federal Reserve only controls short-term rates. Longer rates -- the ones mortgages and car payments are pegged to -- are determined by the market. "Long-term rates are about where they were in November, even though the Fed has eased and eased short-term rates," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities. When the Fed meets this week, Mr. Bush's urgings will still be in the air. "It's poor practice for the President to jawbone the Fed. There's value in an independent central bank," Mr. Levy said.
 
Clean Air on Endangered List?
 
It was a curious decision for the environmental President to make. But last week, the Bush Administration gave manufacturers authorization to increase the amount of hazardous pollutants they emit into the atmosphere. The rule allows them to increase by 245 tons the amount of pollution they pour into the air without public notice or hearings. The Environmental Protection Agency issued the rule at the behest of the President's Council on Competitiveness. The rule, "carves the heart out of the Clean Air Act," said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. President Bush supported passage of the act.

G.D.P. History Repeats Itself
 
When the Commerce Department said last week that gross domestic product grew by 2.7 percent in the first quarter, it was a trip down memory lane. Last year, the first quarter looked promising but the economy lost its oomph by spring. "The numbers we have for May indicate a slowdown," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon Bank.
 
Full Disclosure on Executive Pay
 
To prevent executives from lining their pockets with stock options and fat paychecks at the expense of the shareholders, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new rules for disclosing how executives are paid. The rules require companies to publish what their top executives are paid in a series of tables, graphs and notes. The S.E.C. wants them to plot those figures -- including the value of stock options -- alongside shareholder's return on investment over a five-year period. It also wants charts comparing companies' rates of return with those of their competitors. Shareholder groups have applauded the changes, while the Bush Administration opposes them as meddling.

A Surprising Drop in Durables
 
Orders for durable goods, those big ticket items that are supposed to last three years or more, fell by 2.4 percent in May, the Commerce Department said. That was a surprise to most economists. The consensus forecast was that orders for durable goods would rise. "The goods orders mean we shouldn't expect employment growth in manufacturing in the near term," said Charles McMillion, president of MBG Group, a business information firm in Washington. "Services linked to manufacturing -- software, trucking, insurance -- will also see an absence of high wage growth," he said.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Israel's Shift in Direction
 
By voting into power a Labor Government headed by Yitzhak Rabin, Israel will be getting a Prime Minister who says his first priority is self-rule for Palestinians in the occupied territories. Israelis will also be getting a Prime Minister who opposes new Jewish settlements in those lands. Mr. Rabin's plans are likely to please Washington. The Bush Administration held up Israel's request for $10 billion in loan guarantees because of the previous Government's pro-settlement policy.

Minivans: Japan, 1; Detroit, Zip
 
Relativism may be the scourge of the White House, but it's still in favor at the International Trade Commission. The commission decided that although the Commerce Department determined Toyota and Mazda had been selling minivans here for less than in Japan, penalties should not be imposed because their sales were still too small to hurt Detroit. The commission said its decision was based on whether American car companies suffered "material injury." Detroit, which claims Japan's dumping has hurt its minivan sales, was incensed by the decision. In a statement, the Ford Motor Company said the commission signaled to "Japan that it's O.K. to defy the international rules of trade, and, what's more, that it doesn't hurt America."
 
Agriculture Is No Magic Kingdom
 
As protests go, this one was pretty Mickey Mouse. Five hundred French farmers drove to Euro Disneyland near Paris to protest reforms that cut farm subsidies. The farmers parked tractors at the park's entrance and set tires on fire. Why Disneyland? "You're on American territory." said Henri Pepitas, an organizer. "They're the ones who wrote the reform."
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
A Joint Deal for Flash Chips
 
The deal-making mavens at the International Business Machines Corporation are at it again. Last week, they made an agreement with Japan's Toshiba Corporation to produce flash memory chips jointly. Those are the chips invented by Toshiba in 1984 that can store large amounts of data even when the power is switched off. Some analysts see them as a replacement for magnetic disk drives, especially in notebook and laptop computers. But Big Blue and Toshiba face pretty stiff competition. The Intel Corporation commercialized Toshiba's invention and now has 80 percent of the market. Dataquest, a research firm in San Jose, Calif., expects sales of flash chips to climb to $1.5 billion in 1995, from $130 million today.
 
I.B.M. is not the only computer company sweet on Toshiba. Last week Apple Computer Inc., said it would jointly develop products with Toshiba. This link-up would develop products like CD-ROMS's, which can store data, text, images and sound.

Mr. Murdoch Was Not Amused
 
When Stephen Chao, the 36-year old the one-time wunderkind of TV president of the Fox Network, addressed a group of company executives and guests last week in Aspen, Colo., he wanted to demonstrate his opposition to censorship. While speaking to the audience, which included Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation, which owns Fox, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne V. Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment of the Humanities, a male stripper wandered onto the stage. As Mr. Chao spoke, the stripper disrobed. Mr. Murdoch, who was not amused by the demonstration, dismissed Mr. Chao from the company on the spot. "Sometimes the hardest job a captain has is to terminate his best lieutenant," Mr. Murdoch said.
 
The Bangle With a Past
 
Marlene Dietrich, who died last month at the age of 90, was hardly the girl next door. She was an exotic and alluring beauty with singular taste. Last week, Sotheby's announced it was auctioning off one of Ms. Dietrich's favorite bracelets, which it described as "a dazzling important ruby diamond bracelet," estimated to be worth $300,000 to $400,000.

Merck's Prostate Drug Potential
 
Scientists at the nation's pharmaceutical companies are always on the quest for the elusive billion-dollar drug. Merck & Company received Federal approval on one of them last week. Merck's new concoction, Proscar, is used for treating enlarged prostates. "Proscar has greater commercial potential than any other new drug in pharmaceutical history," said Ronald Nordmann an analyst at Paine Webber. Analysts estimate Proscar will be a $1 billion drug by 1994.

Bat Redux Reaps Record Return
 
The caped crusader's career really took off when he dumped his comic-book pal, Robin, and made it to the movies. "Batman," was one of the highest grossing films ever made. "Batman Returns," the sequel which opened last week, is so far even more of a bonanza. It raked in $46.5 million in its first weekend, a Hollywood record. For Warner Brothers Inc., which produced the thriller, full of bizarre sets and high-priced actors, such boffo results are welcome. It spent between $55 million and $75 million to make the film (accounting in Tinseltown is no science).

A Less-Than-Remorseful Sears
 
At first, Edward A. Brennan, chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Company, denied wrongdoing when California's Consumer Affairs Department accused it of charging people for car repairs they did not need. Sears put pressure on employees, Consumer Affairs charged, to sell a certain number of repairs or services during each eight-hour shift whether they were needed or not. Last week, Mr. Brennan apologized. But he attributed the overcharges to the company's commission plan, not to pressuring employees.

HEADLINE: All About/The Gold Market;
The Good News About Gold: There Isn't a Lot

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Yes, there is some good news about gold.
Gold fillings are making a comeback as prices have retreated. And in 1991, the amount of gold used to make jewelry rose to 2,111 metric tons, a 3.7 percent increase from the year before and a new record, according to Gold Fields Mineral Services, the London-based precious metals research firm owned by three gold mining companies. It was the fifth straight year that jewelry manufacturing had increased. 
 It appears, according to the same Gold Fields study, that the huge increase in the production and overall supply of gold that lead to the sharp price declines of the last six years is leveling off. The total world supply of gold declined last year for the first time since 1983, and mine production showed the smallest increase since 1980.
Less supply could mean stable, if not immediately higher, prices. But the bad news right now is that these facts, and all the others that are mined daily in the gold market, still may not mean much in the way of a stronger price.
The problem for gold is that no matter what you think moves the price -- supply and demand, inflation, the dollar, wars, ideological conflict or even the possibility of a renewed gold standard -- none of these factors is currently providing much of a plus signal. Communism has faded; inflation is at low levels around the world, and gold supplies are shrinking but not plummeting. So no matter how you track gold, its outlook at the moment is neutral at best.

 
 
A Raging Debate
What Causes Prices To Rise and Fall?
 From an average price in 1987 of $446.07 an ounce, gold fell to $362.26 in 1991. Adjusted for inflation, gold in dollar terms is at its lowest level since the late 1970's and in Japanese yen its lowest since 1972. On Friday gold closed at $343.50 an ounce in London, up $8.40 from its low for the year. But at its 1992 low, gold was at a level not seen since 1986.
Despite the disappointing performance of gold, the debate still rages over what moves its price.
David Poole, a senior vice president and economist at Van Eck Associates Corporation in New York, is in what might be called the traditionalist camp. He is in some ways a "gold bug," someone who believes strongly that gold is the best insurance against any currency's depreciation.
For Mr. Poole, who has followed gold for more than 30 years, the price is moved by expectations of inflation and the strength or weakness of the dollar. Using data for these forces and other proxies, like the interest rate on 30-year Treasuries, Mr. Poole has traced the performance of gold since it was allowed to trade freely 21 years ago.
Like most gold bugs, Mr. Pool is optimistic: He sees a rebound in gold prices over the next two years. Mr. Poole is bullish because he expects the economic recovery to continue and to be a little stronger than the consensus outlook. With growth, Mr. Poole expects the rate of inflation to rise to the 5 percent range. This should lead to a further weakening of the dollar, with gold rising to around $500 an ounce. The last two rallies to the $500 level came when inflation rose from below the current 3 percent range into the 4.5 percent to 5 percent range.
Mr. Poole acknowledges that his theory is not perfect. For example, in his view, the price of gold should be rising when the dollar is falling. But that is not the case at the moment. The dollar, compared with other major currencies like the Japanese yen and German mark, has fallen 3.5 percent since the end of May, but gold has managed to inch up just 1.8 percent.

 
 
Money or Commodity?
Supply and Demand In the Ascendancy
 At the other end of the spectrum is the view that gold is moved basically by supply and demand. This means that gold is a commodity, like soybeans, wheat or coffee.
James R. Steel, a metals analyst at Refco Inc., the big commodities trading firm based in Chicago, believes that gold is part money and part commodity. But because inflation is at such lows, the money part is getting no help. Mr. Steele thinks that "supply and demand is going to increase in relevance."
Looking at the Gold Fields report, which the industry often refers to as "The Bible," one feels that gold is behaving more like a commodity. This is the case because forces other than supply and demand that could have an impact on gold prices -- like inflation, war and financial catastrophe -- seem to be receding.
In addition, there are more alternative investments today than 10 years ago, so gold is less likely to be a preferred investment. And the supply and demand factors over the last 10 or 15 years really look like they have had an impact. The rise in supply in the 1980's helped lead to the fall in the price of gold, the Gold Fields analysis shows. The slowing of that supply might now lend some support to the price.
But the report also postulates what Gold Fields considers a more likely supply and demand scenario. With sluggish economic growth, the slowing supply of gold will not become a force boosting the price very quickly. This in turn will encourage a lot of investors to sell gold, adding to the pressure on price and maintaining "a depressed gold price for some time to come," the report says.

 One of the key supply factors is mine production. According to Gold Fields, the continuing fall in the price of gold has left around one third of the world's industry unprofitable, although this does not mean they have stopped producing. In 1991, mine production rose only 2.1 percent, down from 3.7 percent in 1990 and 8 percent in 1989. If the price of gold falls further, the pressure on production will increase.
South Africa is the world's largest producer of gold, but it also has the second-highest average cost of production. There are only four mines in South Africa, according to Gold Fields, that have production costs under $250 an ounce. Eighty percent of the mines in South Africa have costs per ounce of gold that range from $230 to $372. At the higher range, the cost of producing an ounce of gold is higher than the metal's current selling price.
One clear effect of the lower price of gold is that people are putting it back into their teeth again.
The biggest players in the dental gold market are the Japanese and the Germans. In 1982, they put 31.3 metric tons of gold in their mouths -- half of the world's dental goldplate. But then Germany -- and the rest of the world's dental patients, except for the Japanese -- turned to less expensive alternatives like compacted porcelain, titanium and palladium-based alloys. Use of gold dropped just over 28 percent from 1982 to 1987.
But in Germany last year, the use of gold rose 22 percent. The reason: the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany. The former West German government has subsidized 80 percent of the cost of dental treatment for former East Germans. But this subsidy will be halved on July 1. So there has been a rush to get the gold in.
 
 
 
A LITTLE TARNISH ON PLATINUM

Platinum, another precious metal that is not as precious as it used to be. Because its major industrial use is in catalytic converters, platinum is moved by economic slowdowns or recoveries, when auto production is falling or rising. It can also be moved by new demand, like that expected when Europe tightens its air-quality standards and thus demands catalytic converters.
But the price of platinum is moved most abruptly by scares that some other material can be substituted for it. The most recent scare came in May of last year, when Nissan, the giant Japanese auto maker, said it was developing a palladium-only catalytic converter. Even though it was obvious that this converter could be used only on small cars in Japan, the price of platinum tumbled $30 an ounce.
But while platinum is not a mystic metal like gold, many in the market believe it has an inverse connection to the price of gold. And this can make it a hedge against adverse moves in the price of gold.
The outlook for platinum, according to the annual review released last month by Johnson Matthey, a refiner and marketer of precious metals based in London, is a little unclear. The metal rallied from a low of $331 an ounce in January to $378 in June.. But recently, said James R. Steel, a metals analyst at Refco Inc., the commodities firm based in Chicago, it has gotten a "little bit of a bloody nose." It closed on Friday at $360.40.
And while the Johnson Matthey report points out that supply will shrink this year and demand in Europe will rise, the slowdown of the economy in Japan could turn off any major rally. The Japanese are the world's chief consumers of platinum jewelry -- they bought 86 percent of the world's total last year.

Bright Spots in a Dim First Half

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
This hasn't been a good year for stock funds, with the total return of the average fund off 3.3 percent through last Thursday, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. For some funds, the first half was extremely painful -- the health and biotechnology sector slid nearly 20 percent, while Japanese funds fell 17.8 percent.
But there were some pleasant surprises, too. Consider what happened to the natural resource funds, which invest in a mix of energy, forest products and metals stocks. Last year, the group lost nearly 3 percent in total return, which measures income plus changes in principal, compared with an average 7 percent gain for all stock funds. This year, many in the group turned in positive returns and the 23 funds as a whole almost broke even, off just 0.3 percent. 
 Fund managers attribute the recovery to several factors. Oil prices hit bottom in February at $17.50 a barrel, then rose as the United States economy began to pick up and worldwide demand increased while production from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries remained flat. Last week, the price of crude for August delivery hovered around $22.50. More dramatic yet were moves in natural gas prices, which dipped below $1 for 1,000 cubic feet during the winter but bounced up to more than $1.50, helped by a cold spring in the Northeast.
Combine these prices with intensive industrywide cost-cutting measures and the positive trend for the funds could continue "through the second half of 1992 and into 1993," said Ned Shadeck, manager of the $120 million Putnam Energy Resources Trust, which is up 4.4 percent this year. "Because energy is not as tightly correlated with the stock market as food or drug stocks, energy provides a great inflation hedge," Mr. Shadeck said, adding, however, that he recommends investing no more than 5 to 10 percent of a portfolio in the group.
John C. Neff, who runs the $8.1 billion Vanguard Windsor Fund, one of the nation's largest mutual funds, has been even more bullish recently about the energy sector. "We built our energy position to 13.1 percent of assets during the first half," he wrote last month in a report to shareholders.
While most of the natural resource funds concentrate solely on energy, a few small ones have more eclectic mixes which have paid off handsomely so far this year. These include the $24 million Prudential Global Natural Resources Fund: A, up 7.8 percent, which has only one-third of its assets in energy, and the $6 million Fidelity Advisers Global Natural Resources, up 7.0 percent, whose biggest holdings are aluminum stocks.
Here is what some of the natural resource fund managers are doing these days.
Mr. Shadeck says that he is cutting back on Exxon, Mobil, Royal Dutch and other large international oil companies in favor of energy companies whose operations are largely based in the United States. That is because the United States, which led the world into recession, will also lead coming out, he said. His fund's three biggest holdings are Phillips Petroleum and Unocal, domestic integrated oil companies, and the Coastal Corporation, a Houston-based gas pipeline company.
At Prudential Global, the leader of the group, the biggest sectors now are energy (35 percent), gold (23 percent) and agricultural chemicals (13 percent). Leigh R. Goehring, the fund's manager, has built the gold position by moving out of forest products. His biggest holding is Freeport McMoran Copper and Gold Inc. Another favorite: the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, which is profiting from supply disruptions in Germany and Russia.
Ernst von Metzsch, who manages the $160 million Vanguard Specialized Portfolios: Energy, which is up 0.6 percent, sees "a pretty tight oil market by the fourth quarter." But that easily could change, he cautions, "if the economy stalls or we have another mild winter, especially if people build large inventories, as happened late last year." For now, the fund's largest holdings are Amerada Hess, Unocal, Kerr-McGee and Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian oil and gas producer.
The $4 million Eaton Vance Natural Resources Trust, which is up 5.8 percent, is a quirky little fund. About a third of its assets are invested in gold and about a quarter in forest products, with only 20 percent in energy-related stocks. That kind of mix, a hallmark of the fund's five-year existence, is the main reason for the fund's relatively good performance over time, said its manager, Thomas E. Faust.
Shifting among industry sectors is the mark of Malcolm W. MacNaught, who manages the Fidelity natural resources fund. The fund held up in 1991 due to its investments in copper, aluminum and paper; now Mr. MacNaught is moving back into energy and natural gas stocks. Still, his largest holdings are aluminum companies: Alcoa and Reynolds. After that come two natural gas companies: Louisiana Land Exploration and Apache.
One of the half's worst performers was the $20 million Financial Strategic Energy Fund, down 16.7 percent. Philip J. Dubuque, the fund's manager, is bearish on energy over the long run. Sooner or later, he said, Iraqi oil will no longer be embargoed and Kuwait will be back up to full production. "Oil prices will have a tough time doing well in the long term," Mr. Dubuque concludes.

HEADLINE: Low-Skill Immigrants Hurt Job Market for Low-Skill Natives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Obfuscation seems to have become a hallmark of the debate on the economic impact of immigrants. "Immigrants Don't Take Jobs of the Poor" (letter, June 14) by Thomas J. Catapano, in response to Edward N. Luttwak's May 15 Op-Ed article, adds to the confusion. 
 There are two distinct but interrelated issues. One is the impact of immigration on the overall economy, and the other is the distribution of this impact on segments of the population. There is no doubt, as Assemblyman Catapano asserts, that the overall American economy has benefited from immigration. This is supported by sound economics research, as well as by the survey of "38 leading economists" he cites.
It is also true, however, that the United States has experienced a large increase in low-skilled immigration in the last two decades. This has arisen in part from the large illegal immigration, which has acquired permanent residence de jure or de facto. Also in part from a system for allocating most visas that ignores the applicant's skills.
Substantial research indicates that a large immigration of low-skilled workers depresses employment and wage opportunities for low-skilled workers, without regard to the race or ethnicity of the immigrant or native-born Americans. While immigration is not the cause of poverty in the United States, in recent years it has inadvertently made it more difficult for low-skilled Americans.
Mr. Catapano is selective in the evidence he cites. He is perhaps unaware of the research on the adverse effect of low-skilled immigration on low-skilled Americans. Nor does he indicate what the survey of economists would say about this issue.
I sympathize with Mr. Catapano's dilemma. He wishes to expand immigration opportunities for the poor living in other countries and he wishes to help Americans in economic hardship. Sometimes policy objectives come into conflict. To acknowledge the potential policy conflict can result in constructive public policies.

Congress Orders Binding Arbitration To End Railroad Strike

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.

 BODY:
The railroad strike came and went last week like a summer thunderstorm, causing a spell of anxiety as it loomed ominously on the horizon, arrived uproariously, and then vanished before most people had time to comprehend the complex forces at work.
Congress, as usual in major rail disputes, intervened before the strike could have serious economic effects. This time, though, Congress introduced a new form of binding arbitration, hoping to appease labor and business alike. 
 The brief crisis involved three sets of negotiations: the International Association of Machinists, bargaining with most freight lines; the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, seeking a new contract with Conrail; and several unionsconfronting Amtrak, the passenger railroad. Talks had reached an impasse months ago, and Presidential emergency boards had recommended compromises that the unions rejected. Finally, the mandatory no-strike period set by law expired at 12:01 A.M. Wednesday.
Had all the unions struck, passenger and freight lines would have been sidetracked, and commuter trains would have been unable to operate. But only the machinists struck, and they picketed only one freight line, CSX. The railroads, in a display of solidarity that the American labor movement could only envy, responded by shutting down virtually the whole freight system from coast to coast. Eyeing the already wobbly economy, Congress reluctantly imposed a truce.
Now the adversaries will negotiate for another 20 days, after which each side will present its best offer to neutral arbitrators. Congress dictated that the arbitrators may not split the difference, but must choose one offer or the other. This approach should encourage each side to moderate its demands in an attempt to win the arbitrators' approval. Conceivably, the two sides will come close enough to strike a deal before the choice is made for them.

HEADLINE: Israel's Vote Shows It Has Tired of Ideology

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
FORGET for a moment about which parties landed on top and which on the bottom in Israel's national election last week. The real winner was pragmatism and the big loser uncompromising ideology.
In the search for reasons why Israelis said yes to a Labor-led Government and tossed long-governing Likud unceremoniously out on its ear, it is tempting to say that they voted, as if in a referendum, for an accelerated Middle East peace process, for territorial concessions to the Arabs and for a drastic reduction in settlement-building on occupied lands. Judging from the hosannas pouring in for Labor's Yitzhak Rabin, that seems to be a common view overseas. And in some respects it is correct, for if Mr. Rabin keeps his word he will push for a speedy peace agreement, give up some of the territories and put the brakes on new settlements there. 
 "It's a real victory for the peace camp," said Ephraim Sneh, a former general and a Rabin adviser on Labor's dovish side. "I think I can say with reasonable confidence that it was a vote for a substantial peace process, although not exclusively so, because people were fed up with Likud."
That final qualifier is important. It helps explain the complex combination of events behind the upheaval that ended 15 years of Likud governance, threatening that party's stability and dashing the conventional wisdom that Israel's political drift is inexorably rightward.
While the peace camp may have won, a true debate on peace never really got going in the campaign. And while the hard-core right wing clearly lost ground, the major gains were in the center and not on the left. In the end, Likud wore out its welcome, through an incremental erosion of public faith that it possesses the vision, cohesion, integrity and competence to keep the country running.
Likud's leaders say they are just as interested in peace as the next fellow. They point out that it was under Likud Governments that Israel signed its peace treaty with Egypt, gave up the Sinai Desert, and moved last fall to the peace table with other Arab states and the Palestinians.
But a majority of Israelis are apparently convinced that with Likud, as with Moses, Sinai is as far as they will get. Enough of them now believe they will have no peace with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's unyielding insistence on retaining every square inch of occupied territory.
As for Mr. Shamir's ideological commitment to settlement-building in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, many are also persuaded that it translates into less money for their own schools and hospitals, and into unhelpful diplomatic fights such as the one that led the United States to withhold requested loan guarantees on $10 billion for resettling Russian emigres. Many Israelis have grown tired of it, not because they theologically reject either settlements or territories but because of a pragamatic conclusion that unbending ideology just doesn't work.
The point was acknowledged by Defense Minister Moshe Arens, who announced unexpectedly in the wake of Likud's defeat that he would retire from political life, a decision likely also to be made soon by Mr. Shamir.
"A part of the public," Mr. Arens said, "does not see the slogan 'Greater Land of Israel' as an adequate or sufficient response in grappling with the complexity of problems associated with Palestinians in the territories."
 
Too Many Fears
 Indeed not, many Israelis say. For them, ideology has brought years of rocks and gasoline bombs in the Palestinian uprising; endless fears that the Arab street sweeper in Tel Aviv is not the hard-working man he probably is but rather a terrorist ready to pull out a knife; haunting nightmares that this will be the week that one's son in the army does not come back from the West Bank. These weary people say that if some land must be given up for peace, fine. If it means stopping a new settlement in Gaza to build a drug rehabilitation clinic in Ashdod, also fine. And if that doesn't work, they are ready, they say, to keep on looking until they find whatever does.
These people found the electoral jump to Labor easy, especially since Likud had helped push them in that direction anyway. The governing party seemed intent on committing political suicide with its internal squabbles, its government scandals, its failure to breathe fresh life into the Israeli economy and, in Mr. Shamir, a leader who did not inspire.
Few Israelis were more unhappy than recent emigres from the former Soviet Union, who punished Likud for their high unemployment by voting for Labor in sufficient numbers to give it three or four extra parliamentary seats. Sephardic Jews in so-called development towns, a group that tended to view Likud not as a mere political organism but as a way of life, still kept the faith, but in dwindling numbers, according to opinion polls.
Likud suffered most in the election, but it was hardly alone. Tehiya, a small party of far-rightists, was wiped out. Moledet, which calls for transferring Arabs out of the occupied territories, had been expected to increase its parliamentary strength dramatically but instead picked up only one extra seat. Only Tsomet shone on the right, soaring from 2 seats in the old Parliament to 8 in the new. But its triumph was due only in part to its no-compromise territorial policies. Perhaps more important was its image as a clean-government advocate.
The left did not do all that well either. Hadash, an Arab-dominated Communist party, won 4 seats in 1988 but only 3 now. Meretz, a coalition of three small left-wing parties, garnered 12 seats, 2 more than in 1988 but not a huge leap. And Labor, while finishing in first place, did so by draping a veil over its many doves and highlighting its relatively hawkish leader, Mr. Rabin, a take-no-guff former general who had shown as Defense Minister that he knows a thing or two about breaking the bones of rock-throwing Palestinians.
It was, in the main, a centrist vote that did not significantly alter the prevailing left-right balance. "The Israeli voter showed prosaic cleverness," wrote Meron Benvenisti, the demographer and former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, in the newspaper Haaretz. "He turned his back on the groups that tried to mix myths with the political decision-making process."
 
Lessons for Rabin
 There are important lessons here for Mr. Rabin as he begins the process of building a working coalition, one that he wants to make as broad as possible, with himself right in the political center.
What his Government will be like is not quite clear, for he has talked only vaguely about what he plans for the economy, and about how close he would come to a total freeze on settlements, and about how his proposals for Palestinian self-rule would differ (if at all) from Likud's. Mostly, Israeli voters are accepting on faith for now that he will serve them well, even though they also know that his first term as Prime Minister in the 1970's was far from brilliant and that they had finally deserted Labor in 1977 because of its long, overbearing and even corrupt rule.
Mr. Rabin must sense that, in the present pragmatic, throw-the-rascals-out mood, he may have to produce quick results on peace, security and the economy. "These elections make it clear that the Israeli public doesn't want a government whose main talent is not to act," said Nahum Barnea, a political writer for the newspaper Yediot Ahronot. "Whoever gets caught up in passivity will be punished, and very quickly."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Libyan Doubts About Qaddafi Are Growing

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya

 BODY:
THE United Nations sanctions that went into effect against Libya last April are turning out to be more than a symbolic gesture. While they have not yet accomplished their purpose of compelling Libya to turn over two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, they have been politically damaging to the mercurial Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
The Libyan military is struggling with serious shortages. Many Libyans openly call for Colonel Qaddafi's removal and the official information media now admit that the Arab solidarity that was the cornerstone of Colonel Qaddafi's foreign policy was "a mirage." 
 The sanctions have succeeded in banning flights in and out of Libya and in prohibiting the sale of military equipment. They have also brought a reduction in the diplomatic staff Libya maintains abroad. Western diplomats say the departure of 1,700 Russian advisers and technicians has devastated the military's infrastructure, rendering the air defense system ineffective while much of Libya's military hardware rests idle.
One result is that the littered streets and back alleys in Tripoli, where young men once shied away from foreigners because they feared the pervasive security apparatus, are seething with open resentment.
If Colonel Qaddafi were to turn the suspects over, a subsequent lifting of the embargo might permit him to halt the deterioration of his popular support. But Arab and Western diplomats say the extradition of the two men is unacceptable to his security apparatus -- the organization that has held him in power for 23 years.
These diplomats also believe that if Libya was involved in an operation of the magnitude of the Lockerbie bombing, it could not have been carried out without Colonel Qaddafi's approval. "Colonel Qaddafi has no desire to see two of his intelligence agents describe the inner workings of his regime to the West and directly tie him to state terrorism," one Arab ambassador said.
The Libyan leader appears to be hoping to bargain his way out of his predicament; he has been trying to meet the sanctions requirements half-way by giving the West some satisfaction in hopes it will drop its demand for the two men. "The Libyans know little about how the outside world works," a senior diplomat said, "and so they are vainly trying to work out a compromise."
The United Nations, in addition to the extradition of the two suspects, has called on Libya to end support for international terrorism and assist in the investigation into the bombing of a French airliner over Africa in 1989. The two bombings killed 441 people. In response, Libyan officials have turned over information about the Irish Republican Army, for which they provided training and funds, to British officials. They have expelled the Palestinian terrorists Abu Nidal and Abul Abbas, and have closed several Palestinian training camps.
The Libyans are hoping that these actions will at least stave off the imposition of stiffer sanctions when the United Nations reviews the measures in August.
Diplomats say this tactic may work; a senior Egyptian official who travels frequently to Libya said that if Colonel Qaddafi can avoid further sanctions he will probably retain power. The Egyptians believe that despite the erosion of Colonel Qaddafi's grip on the country he does not yet have any serious rivals.
When Libyan officials are questioned about the extradition demand, they appear to be stalling for time. In a letter sent last month to the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Foreign Minister Ibrahim M. al-Bishari promised that the Libyan parliament would "take an appropriate stand regarding the matter as soon as possible." But the 631-member body, which met for 10 days that ended last Tuesday, skirted the issue for most of the meeting. And at the conclusion, it reiterated the standard Libyan demand that the two suspects be turned over to the Arab League or the United Nations, rather than the United States or Britain. Similar offers were rejected before the sanctions went into place.
 
A Catalyst for Anger
 Within Libya, the sanctions have become a catalyst for popular outrage. After two decades in which efforts to follow bizarre economic and political theories have left many Libyans without basic services such as water or garbage collection, even some Libyan officials admit that they are in trouble.
The problems are evident in one of Colonel Qaddafi's most lavish schemes, a $25 billion effort called "the Great Man Made River Project." After spending $6 billion to channel water from aquifers to reservoirs built for the project, the Libyans have discovered that the desert heat is evaporating the stored water. Many Libyans, watching as planners scramble to build roofs over the reservoirs, have begun calling it "the Great Mad Man River Project."
Such feelings do not sit well with the older bureaucrats who dominated the recent session of the parliament. Most spent much of the nationally televised debate attacking the younger generation for advocating change. But younger delegates, while making sure never to attack Colonel Qaddafi by name, complained of shortages in everything from school desks to electricity.
While the sanctions have eroded Colonel Qaddafi's hold on power, his decision to hold onto the suspects while trying to give the West enough to keep the United Nations from imposing tougher measures might just work. "He has been weakened," said an Arab ambassador, "but if he can maintain the status quo, he might survive."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Cuba Seeks Pain Relief: Shot of Western Capital

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
RECENT months have been filled with sour news for Fidel Castro. First came the sudden dissolution of the Soviet Union and the disappearance of the billions in aid it had furnished. Then came a near disastrous harvest of sugar, Cuba's main product.
Finally, even as supplies of oil and consumer goods from flour to bath soap began drying up, the leadership watched in scarcely disguised horror as an exile-led campaign to tighten the noose of a 31-year United States embargo seemed to gain serious momentum in Congress. 
 In the past, Havana responded to almost every adversity with a single reflex: blaming the United States with torrents of overcharged rhetoric. But this time the leadership has begun showing the kind of flexibility that may yet shorten the prohibitive odds against its long-term survival.
Since Havana's special relationship with the Soviet Union began to seriously wane two years ago, Cuban officials have made a high priority of building new economic and political ties with Western Europe and Latin America. Under this program, much of the economy, which was once entirely state controlled, has been rapidly opened up to private investment from abroad in the form of joint ventures, some with majority foreign ownership.
Under pressure from these new partners and growing disgruntlement at home, Cuba has also begun introducing political reforms such as multi-candidate elections to the National Assembly. Some experts see such changes as the beginnings of an effort at gradual reform in order to avoid an accumulation of explosive pressures for change.
Already, with the loss of trade ties with the former East Bloc, which represented more than 80 percent of Cuba's external commerce, the island is undergoing as jolting a transition as it had during the nationalizations of the early 1960's, when Washington, its overwhelmingly dominant foreign partner, imposed an embargo.
 
Courting Americans
 Recently, even as conservative Cuban-American groups in the United States were urging United States officials to do more to cut off the island from the outside world, Havana began a sophisticated campaign to court American businessmen in the hope that their thirst for opportunities would bring them to lobby in Washington for a change in relations.
This month, in the most spectacular recent effort, 100 American business executives, many from large companies like Phillip Morris, Squibb, Kodak and Boeing, were flown to Havana to assess the opportunities. Although few of them wished to be quoted, many said they were strongly impressed by the possibilities they saw.
Such overtures appear to be a decisive acknowledgement that only access to American capital and markets can fill the enormous gap left by the disappearance of the Soviet economic presence here; new ties with Europe and Latin America may help slow the country's decline, but they cannot alone replace what has been lost. Some students of Cuban affairs say, in fact, that such a realization gives the United States a singular opportunity to encourage change here -- as long as the present policy, built around an inflexible embargo, is changed.
 
The Key Actor
 "As has almost always been the case, the key international actor for Cuba has been the U.S.," said Richard R. Fagen, a professor of political science at Stanford University. "Now, with the Soviet Union gone, we are in a clear position of first place, not necessarily in directing Cuba, but at least strongly influencing it."
Cuban officials at the highest levels have themselves begun appealing to this sort of thinking; they are hoping (as they did in previous United States election years) that a new Administration in Washington, whether led by a newcomer or a second-term incumbent, will re-examine relations that have long been frozen in amber.
Cuban officials speculate, for example, that President Bush would be more free in a second term to set aside his past hostility, since he would not be hamstrung by electoral considerations. They remember Richard Nixon's opening to China and the way it cast the Republicans as the party whose hard-line anti-Communist credentials gave it a freer hand to offer detente.
On the other hand, the officials also hope that if Bill Clinton or Ross Perot is elected, policy toward Cuba would be a natural candidate for review.
Hoping to set the stage, articulate Cuban officials who now appear at conferences around the United States argue the case for new relations and express little acrimony.
In a recent interview here, President Castro himself set forth the argument.
The United States, Mr. Castro said, "has two paths: either the path of hostility, aggression, or the path of peace and influence on Cuba's political life through other means." Dialogue, he said, would facilitate "another political direction for our nation."
Although language like this is a departure for Mr. Castro, skeptics say it is not enough for for the United States to take seriously, since the Cuban leader still clings to a lot of his cold war rhetoric toward the United States and a hostility to dissent at home.
"From the Cuban point of view, they recognize that they have to live in a capitalist world, and they are trying to adapt by integrating into the world economy and subtly appealing to the United States," said William LeoGrande, a professor of government at American University in Washington. "But these kinds of gestures by themselves are not going to be enough to change U.S. policy.
"There are some issues, not the ones of the past, but serious issues that remain, like human rights, and there would have to be serious improvements before any Administration takes the risk at home of improving relations."

HEADLINE: Sixth-Grade Graduation Ceremony: Moment for Pride on Treacherous Path

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Lakeshea Hill, a graduating sixth grader, gave her teacher the best farewell gift she could afford. It was the message she scribbled across the blackboard of Room 412 last week. It said in part: "I know we gave you a hard time but I'm going to miss you. You taught me to believe in myself."
Believing in yourself is a victory at Public School 158, a five-story red-brick building in East New York, Brooklyn, surrounded by vacant lots, boarded-up buildings and dusty bodegas -- a school full of dreams in a neighborhood of grim statistics. 
 Born to parents from Alabama, Georgia, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, the 19 black and Hispanic children in Sylvia Ruth's class know they want better lives than their parents had. Their ambitions are lofty: a doctor, a lawyer, an astronaut. How those goals are achieved is more vaguely answered. Few have real-life role models doing what they aspire to do. And for some those goals may be sidetracked by teen-age pregnancy or violent death.
Listen to Lakeshea, age 12, who came here with her family from Jamaica: "This is not a wonderful place. You can't let your child stay out late because there are crackheads. Other kids influence you to do things, like throw rocks at buses or stay out of school.
"Nothing bad has happened to me because I'm not afraid of anybody, but people get shot and hurt in other ways inside their hearts. They are sad because their friends die or people beat you up all the time. You might get shot."
In many ways, the struggles of Lakeshea and the other students who graduated Wednesday are shared all across the nation in neighborhoods like East New York. At the ages of 11 and 12 they are deciding between doing what society expects or succumbing to the temptations that beckon on every corner.
They are the most ordinary of children forced to run a gantlet of extraordinary obstacles. At a tender and awkward time when their suburban peers are fretting about pimples and puppy love, these children are dodging bullets and learning what corners are free from drug pushers.
For Lakeshea and the other students who graduated last week, the choices are complex and painful, like staying in school or dropping out, selling drugs or selling fast food, carrying a gun for protection or staying in the house. They ask themselves: Can I make it? How do I make it? Who can show me the way out? Is it safe to speak standard English, avoid fights, and not spend a lot of money on clothes and risk the disdain of peers?
Listen to Pedro Alicea, a 13-year-old known as "PP." He hangs out with a group called the Junior Links Mob for protection. His goal is to be a football player and earn a college degree, but he admits that his strongest allegiance right now is to his friends.
Pedro says he knows kids who sell drugs because it is the only way they know to make money. When you are hungry or desperate to be popular, he said, getting a regular job or waiting to finish school to make money just takes too long.
"If you don't wear name-brand sneakers they dis you," Pedro says. "You'll feel embarrassed. You'll feel even more embarrassed if there are girls there."
"They make a lot of money, $700 a week," Pedro said of children in the drug trade. "They say stay in school, get a job. Then you hear about the recession and no jobs. How do you even know you will live long enough to graduate? People do die."
Pedro is a tall, handsome boy who likes dying his dark hair various colors. His mother is a restaurant cook and his father is a disabled diabetic. When Pedro had the option of being a drug lookout he did not do it, he said, because, "My moms says it's committing a sin." He hopes he will continue to hold out when the next illegal opportunity rolls around.
 
Street Values Clash With Pupils' Dreams
 The teachers, the parents and even the children themselves concede that there will be many casualties in the battle between street values and old-fashioned success.
"I don't want to be around these neighborhoods when I grow up," said 11-year-old Kelly Samuels. Saying she has only "associates, not friends," at P.S. 158, she predicted that half the boys will end up in jail and half the girls will be teen-age mothers.
"I don't want to be like these girls who are 15 and 16 having babies. I don't want to be like that, not old enough to support my child. I want to be a lawyer before I get into all that.
"My mother has a good life but I don't want my life to be like hers," Kelly said. Her mother works in a school cafeteria. "She's got three kids. I want one. I want my own house. I want a better job.
"I never see my father, but my mother has a boyfriend. When I get married, I want my child to have a father."
Sharon Silcott came with her family to New York in 1989 from the Bahamas.
"I feel funny in East New York because of all the shooting," she said. "It's like no one cares, no one likes anybody. In class, I'm afraid the roof is going to fall on my head. When I grow up I want to leave New York and go someplace nice, someplace quiet."
 
A Big Difference: Believing in Success
 In conversations with some of the 100 P.S. 158 sixth graders, Mrs. Ruth's class in particular, it becomes clear that the children who appear to be on the road to success are those who believe they can be successful, have mentors and role models, understand what practical steps they must take to make it, and have mastered basic reading and math skills.
"I have always wanted to be an astronaut," said Raul Ortiz, a 12-year-old who will enter a special program for gifted children at I.S. 166 this September. "I read a lot, and my grandmother and my uncle and my mother always told me I could do it, I can do it. I just have to do well in school and stay away from bad people, from trouble."
Raul, who gave the class welcoming address to an auditorium of shining faces at last Wednesday's graduation, was born to a 14-year-old mother. But he was an only child and his mother went back to school to get a college degree. When Raul was sent to live with his grandmother in a neighborhood where junkies and men with guns ruled the streets, he stayed in the house to read.
" 'You have to have your eye on the future,' my uncle told me," Raul said. "People might make fun of me, but I'm going to be an astronaut."
For many of the children, the equation does not add up in their favor. They may have loving parents but fear violence to the point they carry a gun for protection and end up in trouble. Girls who are smart in school may end up pregnant and dropping out because of the strong pressure for sexual activity. Children lacking the money to dress well are teased by their classmates and can end up turning to crime because it is an easy way to make money fast.
Complicating every choice is East New York's isolation. The students rarely spend time with black and Hispanic professionals, and so emulate the speech, mannerisms and dress of people who have dropped out of mainstream society. They only have vague notions of what role racism will play in their lives because they have had few encounters with whites.
"I don't know, I think prejudice was a long time ago," Frederick Melendez, a 12-year-old said. "My parents told me there will be some people out there who won't like you -- not you, but your color, the way you speak. Now, Rodney King, that was racist."
 
High Aspirations Built on TV Images
 Many of the children are below grade level in math and reading, and have at various times seen school as a place that makes them feel bad about themselves. Most of Mrs. Ruth's students could not even name a college they had heard about. One student said she wanted to be a lawyer. Asked what she might do to accomplish that goal, she said, "definitely get a G.E.D." The general equivalency diploma is the equivalent of a high school diploma and is awarded to people who pass a test.
Listen to Arjene McCrae, a small 12-year-old boy with a lively sense of humor who wants to be a football player:
"Most of the people who are rich people, I would say it is because they are born that way. Many white people are rich even though they don't work that hard. They want black people to do all the work. If you be selling drugs, the cops don't do nothing and you can get rich. I'm not saying that it's right, for me it's not right, but it's the way for black people to make money. The main way, I would say. Maybe sports, too."
Listen to Yaslynn Perez, a 12-year-old who lives with an extended family that includes her mother, her grandmother, her sister and four cousins. Yaslynn, a pretty girl with long dark hair who likes to dress in black, decided to be a lawyer because she enjoys watching "Divorce Court" and "People's Court" on television. Her Aunt Alba is also a lawyer's assistant.
Yaslynn, whose mother is a shoe clerk and whose grandmother is on welfare, said she is most inspired by the characters on "Beverly Hills 90210," a television show about a group of upper-middle-class white teen-agers in Beverly Hills.
"I used to stay home and never go out," Yaslynn said. "My friends tried to make me go out. They tried to make me do bad stuff. People told me that I was too quiet, that I didn't fight enough.
"Nobody in my family has a high school diploma except my uncle. They're really looking up to me to go to college. I'm a Catholic and I go to church. My family wants me to be a good girl and that's what I'm trying to do."
 
Children Learning Ways of Violence
 Enough, however, has already happened in the lives of these children to let them know that things are not easy and life is not fair, even for good girls and boys.
Room 412 was so cold this winter that the children had to gather around a radiator in the hallway to keep warm, an experience they bitterly recall. And Mrs. Ruth, who calls the children her "babies," invites them to her church, and brings them books to read, has lost her job because of budget cuts.
Mostly, though, it is the violence around them that engenders a sense of hopelessness. The boys, especially, fear being shot or killed. Mrs. Ruth said almost all of the students have had a personal brush with violence; some with death.
Yaslynn's favorite cousin, Pablo, was fatally shot over the Memorial Day weekend. When she began crying in the middle of a reading lesson and her classmates asked what was wrong, Mrs. Ruth told them. Their only reaction was to ask matter-of-factly "was it a boy or girl?"
Eleven-year-old Cory Brown, his 9-year-old sister, Ebony, and his mother, Lucille, were standing at an ice-cream truck one Sunday afternoon when a bullet ripped into Mrs. Brown's left thigh.
Pedro fears the police because of a couple of incidents in which they roughed him up and even pointed a gun at his head. He says he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Maurice McClary, who at age 12 is about 6 feet tall and calls himself "a boy in a man's body" hears the gunfire outside the project where he lives and tries to imagine what it would be like to die. His uncle and several of his older friends have been shot.
Listen to Maurice, a soft-spoken, aspiring rap artist:
"I grew up rhyming. I write my own songs. Positive things. I don't use the word nigger and all that stuff. I write about a black man and everything that's going on in the world. There is too much violence and too much drugs.
"I'm moving out. I want to go someplace quiet. There's a lot of violence around my way. I be daydreaming that one day they'll get me, so I don't like to go outside. You hear pop, pop, pop. Popping. People be running, scattering. They're always shooting at somebody. I hope they don't get me one day. I'll be dead. I'm only 12."
 
Crumbling Walls And Vacant Lots
 And so on Wednesday, the children of Room 412 along with the other graduates -- the girls wearing white carnations, the boys red ones -- attended their commencement. They posed for pictures; they exchanged autographs. They looked forward to the long, lazy summer dividing childhood from puberty.
Principal Anita D. Harrison, a tiny dynamo of a woman who brought a host of special services and a new spirit into the school when her tenure began five years ago, wept openly as the children received their diplomas.
"Some of these kids, this is the only graduation they will have," she said. "Some of these kids, by some quirk of fate, might be killed. Some girls might have babies. They're good kids and the opportunities aren't there for them. The experiences aren't there for them."
Mrs. Ruth, who spent Wednesday clearing out her desk, was equally pensive. She said she hoped she had instilled in the children some sense of self-esteem, some emotional armor.
"No one in government comes to ask what I need," she said. "These children have so many problems. They need something more than vacant lots and crumbling walls."
As always, the children had the last word on her performance.
"Mrs. Ruth," said Lakeshea. "Can I go home with you?"

HEADLINE: Mitterrand Leaves for Sarajevo, Hoping to Shock His Serbian Ally

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 27

 BODY:
By embarking unexpectedly for Sarajevo tonight, President Francois Mitterrand appeared to be seeking to show that the patience of even Serbia's closest ally has run out and that a European leader does not need Washington's endorsement for a bold diplomatic gamble.
 Although it did not seem clear that the French leader's visit would significantly advance the quest for peace, the domestic effect might be considerable for a President facing an important and potentially close-fought autumn referendum on European integration. 
 Throughout the Yugoslav conflict, France, an ally of the Serbs since their shared opposition to the Austro-Hungarian Empire during World War I, has sought to head off drastic measures against Belgrade and distance itself from the German-led support of Croatia. Paris has done so in the belief that it could use its special relationship with Serbia to bring President Slobodan Milosevic to reason.
The French Government has also been increasingly critical of what officials close to Mr. Mitterrand have portrayed as recent attempts by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to take charge of the response to a conflict in which Washington long showed no real interest.
 
Reverses Course
 At the European Community meeting in Lisbon that ended today, Mr. Mitterrand, who had been alone among European leaders in refraining from explicitly blaming the Serbs for the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, changed his stance.
He called for a tightening of United Nations sanctions against Mr. Milosevic's Government and declared that "Serbia is today the aggressor, even if the origins of the conflict go back a long way."
By a visit to a besieged Sarajevo, officials close to the French leader suggested tonight, he could send a powerful message to Serbia that even Belgrade's oldest friend in Europe could no longer tolerate the war.
"While the Germans rushed to recognize Croatia, the French alone have maintained a strong commitment to Serbia," said Nicholas Wahl, a professor of French political history at New York University. "So a visit to Sarajevo by President Mitterrand sends a new message to Belgrade."
The President may also be seeking a public relations coup. His Health Minister, Bernard Kouchner, visited Sarajevo recently, and it seemed likely that he had laid the groundwork for Mr. Mitterrand. Mr. Kouchner arrived in a plane full of food and medical supplies.
 
Inertia and Dithering
 Mr. Mitterrand has been the target of widespread criticism of European Community inertia in the face of the Yugoslav conflict, and he can use the sort of boost that a successful Sarajevo visit might bring him.
Support is particularly important to him because he faces a referendum, probably in September, on the Maastricht treaty on European union. Defeat in this vote could turn into a referendum on his 11-year rule and would seriously endanger the drive for European political, military and economic unity.
According to Mr. Mitterrand's spokesman, Jean Musitelli, the President feels it is essential to rapidly resolve the Yugoslav conflict because its persistence could strengthen an image of European dithering and hold back approval of the Maastricht treaty.
France sees European unity as an essential balance to American power at a time when it argues that Washington's influence in a Europe without the cold war is bound to recede.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Vows Budget Fight With Florio

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 27

 BODY:
New Jersey's Republican leaders vowed today to override Gov. Jim Florio's veto of their $14.6 million budget and use their subpoena power to insure that their budget is carried out.
"The Legislature will oversee the implementation of this budget," said Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, a Republican whose party controls two-thirds majorities in both houses. "Commissioners will be called before committees with subpoena power to explain how they are expending tax dollars." 
 Shortly before midnight Friday, Mr. Florio became the first Governor in state history to unconditionally veto a budget, maintaining that "it is wrong to hurt people for a penny," an allusion to the Legislature's vote -- over his veto -- to repeal the 1-cent sales-tax increase he and the Democratic Legislature imposed in 1990.
The veto sets up a showdown on Monday when the Republican leaders will set up a vote to override.
Today, Mr. Haytaian and Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco accused the Governor and "his minions and hatchet men" of plotting to "see to it that pain and suffering is inflicted on the people of New Jersey because the Republicans had the audacity to cut state spending and lower taxes."
 
'Watch Them Carefully'
 Suggesting that the administration would use the Republican budget as an excuse to make cuts in programs and services that would inflict maximum discomfort on residents, Mr. DiFrancesco said: "Today, I issue a warning to the people of New Jersey: Watch this administration. Watch them carefully."
In his veto message to the Legislature Friday night, issued only hours after the Republicans had rejected the Governor's plea to extend the sales-tax increase for a minimum of three months in order to continue vital services, Mr. Florio said he could not sign "a budget that would force state government to renege on its responsibilities and turn its back on our people."
He accused the Republicans of ramming through a Draconian spending plan, which, in cutting $1.1 billion from his own recommended $15.7 billion budget, would sharply cut or eliminate financing for such programs as tuberculosis treatment, kidney dialysis and treatment of AIDS patients with the drug AZT. Other administration officials have said the cutbacks would require 7,000 layoffs out of a work force of 67,000, reduce the quality of education and drive up tuition at state-supported colleges. They have said the cuts would cut back air and water pollution monitoring that would threaten the Jersey Shore, curb snow removal this winter and force early closing of state parks.
 
'The Mongers of Fear'
 Today Mr. Haytaian said: "If you believe the mongers of fear, scores of workers will lose ther jobs, children will go hungry, the aged will suffer, crime will run rampant, beaches and state parks will close, prisoners will roam free and public transportation will come to a grinding halt. All of this chaos and turmoil from a 6.8 percent decrease in state spending."
Mr. Florio and administration officials, howewer, say that the cuts proposed by the Republicans come after the state Government has already been reduced by 4,000 jobs, and state revenues have been flattened by the national recession, which hit New Jersey particularly hard.
Mr. Florio, at a news conference this morning, also criticized what the Republicans called safeguards they wrote into the budget mandating certain job cuts and forbidding such things as park closings. The Governor said the restrictions were both impossible and an unconstitutional intrusion on the constutionally mandated authority of the administrative branch of government.
"They can require that the sun not shine, but that does not mean it will happen," the Governor said. He said, for example, that a requirement that 200 positions be cut in the Department of Education was impossible because only 126 people worked in the category slated for reduction, "to say nothing of the question of separation of powers" between the legislative and executive branch.
 
Aiming at Public Advocate
 But Mr. Haytaian and Mr. DiFrancesco insisted that the Legislature had the power to enforce its budget in detail. "This is a law," Mr. Haytaian said. "The budget is a law, and if the Governor tells us he is going to break the law, we will go to court."
The Republican leaders also insisted they had the authority to force department heads to follow their dictates and not make cuts in areas they have mandated are off limits.
The Public Advocate, Wilfredo Caraballo, for example, has said that reductions in his department will mean that some Public Defender postions will have to be eliminated, and thus shift the burden of providing constitutionally mandated lawyers for indigents to the counties.
Vowing to subpoena commissioners or other department heads to force obedience, Mr. Haytaian said, "The first to be called will be Public Advocate Wifredo Caraballo, who has already started the attack against the people of New Jersey."
Mr. Caraballo maintained that the reductions in his department -- including the total elimination of two sections, the Division of Public Interest Advocacy and Citizen Complaints -- were political retaliation. Several Republican lawmakers called for his resignation last year when he joined a suit that could force combining school districts to achieve racial integration.
 
Anger at Suits for Poor
 Those lawmakers have also objected to the broad powers the Public Advocate has, unique in the 50 states, to bring suit in the public interest, including suing the state itself, which it has often done in the past on behalf of the poor or others it deems to lack adequate legal representation.
Both Mr. Haytaian and Mr. DiFrancesco insisted they had enough votes to override the Governor's veto. The budget passed the Assembly with more than enough votes to override the veto. In the Senate, two Republicans did not vote, one was absent, and one, Leonard T. Connors Jr., voted against approving the budget.
Mr. Connors said he objected to cuts in the Homestead Rebate program that would hurt people in his district, and also to cuts in outlays for tourism promotion, pollution monitoring and Medevac helicopter service, all important in the shore area he represents.
Mr. Connors, who said after the vote that he had not made up his mind whether he would vote to override the veto, did not answer telephone calls to his office and home. But Mr. DiFrancesco said he had been personally assured by Mr. Connors and the three Republicans who did not vote on the budget Thursday that they would all support the motion to override on Monday, supplying the necessary 27 votes to make it successful.

HEADLINE: A Shimmer in the Kitchen

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
Some time in the 1980's, the old stereotype of the brilliant chef as a florid, shouting and temperamental genius gave way to a new stereotype of the brilliant chef as a florid, shouting and temperamental genius who could attain fame on a par with, say, Luciano Pavarotti.
So it was that a tremor shook the faithful last week when Daniel Boulud, Le Cirque's executive chef since 1986, announced that he would leave that temple of gastronomy in September to open a Manhattan restaurant of his own. Within 48 hours the restaurant's owner, Sirio Maccioni, had calls from at least 10 renowned chefs. He put them off and left, on schedule, for a six-week vacation in Tuscany where his farm's kitchen is so big that it can comfortably seat 12 at a table near the stove. 
 Mr. Maccioni's equanimity stunned no one in the restaurant business. For like great theater, great kitchens are a collaborative effort led by the chef but sustained by a broad staff of talent from those unsung apprentices responsible for the cold appetizers to assistants like Le Cirque's patissier, Jacques Torres, a bit of a star in his own right.
More than 9,000 restaurants slake New York's varied appetites. All told, in 1991 they did $6 billion in business and kept 180,000 people employed, according to the New York State Restaurant Association. Yet out of that vast pool of talent, ambition and blind hope, only a handful of kitchens ever rise to star billing.
 
Gloss From the Dross
 The recession has trimmed away about 10 percent of New York's restaurants like so much unwanted fat. But the best of the city's kitchens have not suffered much despite prices that can easily soar to $300 for a dinner for two. Reservations for a Saturday night at Bouley, at 165 Duane Street, can still mean a four-month wait. And even then, the host may airily announce that the first opening is nearer to midnight than to dusk.
"We are very busy," said the chef and owner David Bouley (pronounced boo-LAY) by telephone, on vacation in Tucson. "It's amazing. People like Bernadette Peters come in and order nine courses. And their plates are wiped clean! Sometimes we have 15 to 20 tables of V.I.P.s."
Stars, of course, twinkle brighter in constellations than alone. "Years ago there was not this notoriety," said Marc Sarrazin, who has been described by New York chefs as a culinary power broker and is a member of the board at the Culinary Institute of America. "Now, it's glamorous. But most people don't understand that to be a great chef you have to be a great cook, a great gentleman, a great communicator and a great leader."
 
Shopping List for Glory
 In truth, for executive chefs, there is usually not much cooking. A complex mix of administration, art, sport and psychology, the life of New York's great chefs is more a matter of building and sustaining an institution than making the perfect pot-au-feu de canette salee aux racines de saison et huile d'echalote aux herbes (duck). Thus, a kitchen like Le Cirque's can live on in glory well beyond a chef's tenure.
At Le Cirque, at 58 East 65th Street, a staff of 26 prepares everything from the Scottish wild hare that might begin a dinner to the warm souffle with apricots and almond sauce that could end it. Mr. Boulud's contribution is to keep the pace and the performance consistent. His supervision -- from checking the aroma of a morrel airlifted in from Oregon to the towel swipe that obliterates an errant drop of consomme -- insures that the results are precisely as he would have them.
It is his stamp. And it is a 12- to 16-hour-a-day job.
"I have no life," Mr. Boulud (pronounced BOO-loo) lamented over a steaming cup of espresso away from the kitchen's lunch-time rush. "Everything is work."
At the same time, chefs share in the rewards that stardom confers. Salaries often exceed $100,000 a year. Mr. Boulud once rejected four times that amount because he feared the cynical manipulation of his name and reputation. Other offers, with varying inducements, have been made throughout his six years at Le Cirque. He stayed, because "after 23 years of being imposed upon by others" he knew that his next move would be solo.
Other great chefs have not been as cautious. Instead, they jump from kitchen to kitchen, staff to staff. "Everyone knows each other," said Karen Waltuck, who with her husband, David, runs the high-toned TriBeCa restaurant Chanterelle. "People will run over and say, 'Oh my God! We're out of foie gras!' and come to borrow some. As time goes on, you share employees. You hire people with talent and like children, people with talent eventually go off and leave you. But sometimes they come back."
That endless cycling through the better restaurants does not always work to a chef's advantage. "There is a lot of talent in New York," said Mr. Boulud. "But everybody should not try to be a vibrant star overnight. I've seen a lot of talented young people jump too often and drop as fast as they went up. Sometimes I feel that things are spinning out of control in New York."
 
Daylong Frenzy
 For those who near the city's culinary peak, the pressures are enormous. The day begins about 10:00 A.M. with the purchasing of everything from lettuce to rare truffles that can cost as much as $1,500 a pound. By mid-afternoon, a tormentingly hectic lunch culminates in "the hit," when every order seems to arrive at once. The break between meals is devoted to administration and perhaps a change of clothes. Dinner repeats the intensity, and the day finally ends in a sea of dirty dishes, near midnight.
Hour after hour, in kitchen temperatures that frequently exceed 100 degrees, the chef must coordinate a staff the size of a baseball team. "It's kind of like a pit crew," said Mr. Maccioni's 24-year-old son, Marco, who has been left in charge of Le Cirque for the summer. "Every guy has to do his share to build a car. And then, when the car is ready, you take it to the door and run it into the dining room."
Danny Meyer, owner of the popular and well-regarded Union Square Cafe, tries to keep the chaos to a minimum by easing the channels of communication. At a roundtable meeting held between meals last Wednesday, Michael Romano, the executive chef, turned to a waiter. "I know the kitchen for you all is a break," he said. "But sometimes, hearing chatter and singing, it drives you to the edge." The meeting ended like a locker-room session before a football game. Staffers joined hands above the table and yelled "Whooo!" before dispersing to their jobs.
A moment later, Mr. Romano was on the run. Taking the stairs two at a time, he burst from the cellar with a bunch of wild watercress. "This!" he said, pointing to its pin-sized flowers and crunching a leafy sprig between his teeth, "This is the sort of stuff that really turns a chef on. When the green market kicks in at this time of year, it's the most exciting moment." The restaurant, at 21 East 16th Street, is neighbor to a farmers' market in Union Square Park.
 
Home-Grown Talent
 Mr. Romano, an Italian-American who grew up in East Harlem, acquired his love of cooking from relatives and friends. "The women would get together on Sundays and make pasta," he said. "And our neighborhood had my uncle's butcher shop, a cheese shop, a fish shop. Even at school you could hear chickens getting slaughtered."
David Waltuck also developed his love of cooking in Manhattan. But his motivation was quite different. "My mother," he said somberly, "was not a good cook." He learned the art partly at the Culinary Institute, in Hyde Park, N.Y., where he studied for a time, and partly on his own.
The care and, of course, feeding of growing chefs is often at the core of their skills. Mr. Boulud grew up on a farm in Lyons, France, where the family made cheese, sausage and fresh bread and raised all the fowl, pork, beef and veal that they consumed. Mr. Bouley's French-born mother cooked for the table from the bounty of the fields of the family farm in Rhode Island.
Both men went on to work in some of the best kitchens in Europe. Mr. Boulud's career started at 13. "The first year I plucked birds," he said. "I learned how to chop parsley, how to peel asparagus and how to handle a knife. There was an old chef of 30 years there who was drunk every night but besides that could really cook like a master."
Before he was 20, Mr. Boulud had graduated to the kitchen of a three-star restaurant near Cannes, Le Moulin de Mougins. "The first year I had goose bumps," he said. Eventually, he moved to Washington to be the personal chef of the Frenchman in charge of the European Economic Community delegation. From there, he moved on to New York's Upper East Side and to Polo, in the Westbury Hotel, and Plaza Athenee.
 
Adding Breadth to Depth
 Mr. Bouley's path was less direct. He, too, cooked with such legends as Roger Verge at Le Moulin de Mougins. But he took time off now and again to study French civilization, painting, economics and other subjects at the Sorbonne.
That training have served him well. At Bouley, he has been the force behind everything from the foie gras to the flower arrangements and the furniture. "I had no idea what I was doing, but I was going crazy doing everything. I think I put down a plaster spatula one day and the next day picked up a kitchen spatula."
Other chefs are less wide-ranging but no less overworked. When Mr. Boulud goes home to his wife and young daughter, he taps away at a book about his cooking. Marta Pulini, the acclaimed chef at Le Madri, used to spend her one day off so tired that she could only sleep. Now, she has added to her responsibilities by teaching in Long Island.
All is not heat and sweat and long hours, though. Mr. Romano and his friends gather occasionally to eat and drink and laugh in a movable club they call "the Chefs from Hell." Ms. Pulini's friends gather the first Monday of each month as "les amis de cholesterol." The name hardly suits her cooking, though, which she keeps light.

HEADLINE: Geneticists' Latest Discovery: Public Fear of 'Frankenfood'

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, June 25

 BODY:
Exhibits of Pfizer's Chy-max, a genetically engineered coagulant, bloomed alongside displays for the Santa Cruz Valley Pecan Company and Sunsweet Prunes at the annual meeting of the Institute of Food Technologists this week in New Orleans.
From above, the displays looked like technological crops in a furrowed field. Instead of overalls, the 15,000 conventioneers who plied the 700,000-square-foot exhibition at the New Orleans Convention Center wore white lab coats or business suits. They carried calculators and notebooks, and when they spoke of "growth potential," they were more often than not referring to the possibilities in the genetic engineering of food products. 
 "The interest in genetic manipulation is unbelievable this year," said Alex Merolli, the marketing manager of Genencor International, which makes enzymes in South San Francisco, Calif. "It's all people are talking about."
 
The Boon and the Nightmare
 Industry analysts say that new genetically engineered food products will be rolled out in the next 18 months. It could be the biggest boon to corporate profits since frozen foods were introduced in the 1930's, and it could also be a marketing nightmare. Food technologists, the biologists and chemists who develop food-growing and processing techniques, are at the forefront of the image crisis that is kicking up around genetically altered food like a dust storm over an Idaho potato field.
In the three weeks since Vice President Dan Quayle announced that the Federal Government would not require specific testing or labeling for a number of genetically engineered food products, advocacy groups have questioned the long-term safety and impact of genetic technology.
Scientists have argued both for and against gene splicing in food production. And agricultural economists have discussed a wide range of altruistic applications: genetic technology could provide safeguards against certain food-borne diseases, it could curtail the dependence on chemical pesticides, and it could increase food production in an economical fashion, easing world hunger.
 
Doing What Nature Doesn't
 Biotechnologists have been developing gene-splicing techniques for almost a decade, hoping to bypass the vagaries of nature. Chy-max (the first syllable is pronounced to rhyme with eye), the only gene-altered product now on the market, is a replica of a natural coagulant used in cheese-making. But nature's coagulant is unpredictable, and Chy-max creates completely consistent cheese.
Similar technologies are being used to create more consistent yeasts for fermenting beer and wine. Fertilizer companies like Dow Chemical have inserted pest-resistant genes into some crops. Other food producers are experimenting with frost resistance and with genetically increasing crop yields.
But therein lies the marketing problem.
"The public is scared of the word genetic," said Dr. Jean-Marc Pernet, a biotechnologist for the Rouquette Corporation, a carbohydrate maker in Gurnee, Ill. "We are working on a number of products, but we know very well that developing the technology will be easier than marketing the technology."
 
A Sense of Menace
 Shortly after the Vice President's announcement, a cartoon in The New Yorker pictured a mad scientist rubbing his hands near his crop of leafy plants. The plants had menacing, feral faces on spindly stems. "That's splendid news from the F.D.A., my pretties," read the caption. In a letter to the editor of The New York Times, Paul Lewis of Newton Center, Mass., called genetically altered food "Frankenfood."
It is not only the public that is uneasy. After a seminar on the use of plant culture in genetic engineering at the New Orleans meeting, one food technologist dubbed such products "sci-fi food."
Coinages like these resonate a distrust of more than Chy-max or of the genetically engineered Flavor Saver, a tomato with an extended shelf life that Calgene Inc. of Davis, Calif., expects to introduce next year.
 
Worrying About Safety
 Indeed, the deconstruction and re-construction of DNA chains in edible plants and animals seem to tap a wellspring of modern misgiving.
"There's a distrust of technology, distrust of corporate profits, distrust of Government regulatory agencies and general fears about the safety of the food supply," said Dr. Susan K. Harlander, a leading researcher who is a professor of food science and nutrition at the University of Minnesota.
In January, the Food Marketing Institute, a trade group in Washington, found that consumer confidence in the safety of the national food supply had dipped 10 percent in the previous 12 months, the largest slide in nearly a decade.
 
Memories of Chernobyl
 Dr. Marshall Martin, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., said that the growing public distrust was not unfounded. "After World War II, the public was told that DDT was safe," he said. "The same thing with nuclear power. It was supposed to solve all our problems and be safe. And then we have Chernobyl and Three Mile Island."
Add the recent outbreaks of food-borne illness and the increasing evidence of the carcinogenic effects of a variety of food additives, and you begin to appreciate the breadth of public apprehension that greets any "New!" "Improved!" food product today.
"A public-relations approach is not going to sell biotechnology to the American public," Dr. Harlander said. But along with a number of scientists, she believes that the public needs to be educated about food science. Genetic technology is too promising, she said, to dismiss it out of a free-floating mistrust.
 
Irrational Reactions
 "If the public understood the technology, they would understand that part of their emotional reaction is irrational," she said.
Introducing genes that endow an organism with specific properties -- a piece of DNA that might make a chicken resistant to salmonella, another that might make wheat inherently pest-resistant -- is merely an extension of selective breeding techniques that farmers have been using safely for generations, Dr. Harlander said. This view was cited by the Bush Administration in announcing its policy on genetically engineered foods.
But in the public mind, using a flounder gene to make a tomato frost-resistant is a long way from crossing sweet corn with sweet corn to get sweeter corn. "Just think of splicing a few seconds of rap into a tape of a Beethoven symphony," said William E. Swartz, the director of technology for Rhone-Poulenc Food Ingredients in Cranbury, N.J.
 
Unease About Animal Genes
 Investigating public attitudes toward biotechnology in a telephone survey of 1,228 adults last month, Dr. Thomas J. Hoban, a professor of sociology at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, and Dr. Patricia Kendall, a professor of food and nutrition at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, found that people favored genetic tailoring of plants but that crossing species lines, particularly using genes from animals, "got people nervous," Dr. Kendall said.
Like most researchers, Dr. Harlander counters such concern by pointing to the altruistic applications of biotechnology. These promise to mitigate pollution by decreasing dependency on agricultural chemicals and by creating crops that require less processing, presumably cutting costs and curtailing the need for chemical additives.
More important, she said, "our natural resources simply cannot sustain a world population that is growing by 90 million people a year."
 
A Business, Not a Philanthropy
 World hunger seemed rather far removed from the food technologists' meeting in New Orleans, where the displays indicated more concern with such developments as low-fat kielbasa and dips, ice cream and burgers made with simulated fat. "They've been talking about famine for 50 years," Mr. Swartz said dismissively. He pointed out that his was a consumer industry, not a philanthrophy, a business driven by people who were willing to pay premium prices for low-fat hot dogs.
Certain innovations simultaneously offer potential corporate gains and potential famine relief. At the New Orleans meeting, the most talked-about genetic innovation -- a tomato that is frost-resistant because of the addition of a fish gene with antifreeze properties -- could significantly curtail crop loss.
But makers of tomato sauce and ketchup are more interested in pulp than they are in antifreeze, said Dr. Dietrich Knorr, a professor at the Berlin University of Technology who is an expert in the genetic engineering of plants. "By increasing the solids in tomatoes by 1 percent, a scientist could increase the profit in tomato processing worldwide by $100 million a year," he said.
The profit motivation worries Dr. Knorr. "Personally, I have to fear that people or companies will use the technology to overexpress certain properties," he said.
 
'Very Few Potential Allergens'
 Public outcry has been directed toward the possibility of allergic reactions to genetically altered food and the long-term health implications of ingesting genes that operate as pesticides. But most researchers and technologists at the convention agreed that these possibilities are less troublesome than other potential problems.
"Out of the hundreds of genes in any organism, there are very few potential allergens, and all are very well known," said Dr. Pernet of the Rouquette Corporation, who is experimenting with gene-splicing in carbohydrates. "But we have no idea what the long-range effect of limiting plant or animal diversity could be."
Of course, years of selective-breeding techniques have already affected the genetic diversity of plants, and some at the convention argued that genetic engineering was necessary to preserve desirable characteristics.
 
At Cross Purposes
 Dr. Herbert F. Pierson of Preventative Nutrition Consultants in Woodville, Wash., who has pioneered research in plant chemicals that appear to fight cancer, explained that years of developing garlic and onions that ship well and cheaply had affected the cancer-fighting phytochemicals in those foods. Nowadays, he said, it is necessary to extract the phytochemicals and then administer them, rather than simply advising people to eat more garlic and onions.
"The concentration of phytochemicals you find in the garlic or onions from the supermarket is completely random at this point," Dr. Pierson said. "We need technology to insure consistency and control over dosage."
The deconstruction and reconstruction of the gene chain made Dr. Pernet smile. "The point of most technology is control, cost control, quality control," he said.
The fact that recent public outcry over genetic engineering of food has centered on control as well -- consumers are asking for detailed labels that give them control over what they buy and eat -- was not lost on Dr. Pernet. To him the consumer's cry for control, like the food marketer's attempts to control the image of genetically altered food, echoes the underlying misgivings about genetic engineering in the scientific community.
"All of us know we can control several generations of genes," he said. "No one has any idea how many generations that control will work, or how long it will take for the genes to resist control. And that's scary."

HEADLINE: Sanctions Keep West Off the Road to Libya

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya, June 21

 BODY:
Fauzi Ghnedi, the director of Libya's national tourist agency, sat in his empty office and tried to think of those who might want to take their holidays here.
"Perhaps reformed alcoholics," he said hopefully. "You know, we don't allow alcohol. And then there are those who like adventure." 
 Libya's nascent tourist industry, which in the best of times attracted only one or two thousand people a year, has suffered a body blow with the imposition of United Nations sanctions.
The sanctions, imposed in April after Libya refused to turn over suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 and a French plane over Africa in 1989, have halted flights in and out of the country.
 
U.S. Visits Restricted
 The State Department sharply restricts visits by Americans to Libya, which for years has been on the department's list of countries that sponsor terrorism. The American Embassy is closed.
"We go to the international tourist trade fairs in Europe," Mr. Ghnedi said, as his four assistants sat idly in front of their blank computer screens, "but we would need billions of dollars to counter the image we have abroad."
Tourism has never been high on the list of priorities for the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. When he first took power in 1969 he nationalized hotels and restaurants, which led to a decline in service and food shortages.
The mores and culture of the West come under frequent attack from Government officials and in the state-controlled media. And when the sanctions were imposed, several Westerners working in the oil fields were temporarily unable to get exit visas.
 
Can't Buy Spare Parts
 Because of the sanctions the Libyan airline, which still flies internally, has lost its maintenance contract with Air France and cannot buy spare parts. Flights are no longer insured.
A group of German veterans from World War II recently canceled a trip to visit the war memorial at Tobruk. And the British have bowed out.
"It's not where you want to get sick in," a Western envoy said. "The hospitals are lousy and there is no way you can be flown out for treatment."
But Libyan officials, buoyed by the success Tunisia has had in bringing in Germans and Italian groups, say they are determined to lure vacationers.
 
'Libya Is Something Different'
 "People must be tired of going to the same old places," said Mr. Ghnedi, "and Libya is something different. Besides, it's not crowded."
Plans are under way to build a hotel on the island of Farwa, near the Tunisian border, and a string of motels along the coast.
"We realize there is a lot we have to do," said Ali el-Oammoudi, who is in charge of the Farwa project. "We have to do a lot of building and we have to train people. We hope to open a tourism institute."
Libya has a long and undeveloped coastline, although much of it is littered with garbage. It has some large Greek and Roman ruins. And for those who enjoy trekking in the desert, the south of the country has thousands of miles of open and unspoiled dunes.
But Libya is one of the most expensive countries in the world, if visitors change foreign currency at the official exchange rate. Most outsiders are required to declare the amount of money they bring into the country and are given a currency form to note each time they change money, making black market transactions difficult.
It takes three dollars to equal one dinar, according to the official rate, making a cup of coffee a $2 purchase. A modest hotel room costs $150, and credit cards aren't used.
On the black market the dinar is worth about 60 cents.

HEADLINE: In East Europe, the Hapsburgs Get Revenge;
Inside the New Croatia

 BODY:
To the Editor:
For eight days Zadar was a ghost town; the populace buried in underground shelters because of continuous shelling by Serbian terrorists camped in the surrounding hills. The city was under siege. At 6 A.M., May 27, the all-clear sounded and families slowly and timidly overcame their fear. Everyone needed a breath of fresh air. The local heroes here today are the bakers, who despite constant shelling, baked bread all night, and journalists and printers, who got the paper out every day. The favorite paper here is Slobodna Dalmacija (Free Dalmatia), whose journalists and editor are now under indictment. 
 Most space is given to war reporting, but journalists and other Croatians are carefully watching the new Government. A few articles have ridiculed and criticized its leaders. The indictment is based on "criticism that might undermine the stability of the new Government." Journalists wonder if the courts will protect their right to criticize, praise or ridicule the leadership of the new Croatia.
There is general euphoria over the acceptance of Croatia into the United Nations, but as some journalists noted, Slovenia was also accepted without so much pomp and at considerably less expense. Inflation is rampant, the war has slowed production and trade. An influx of refugee needs immediate care. Every available space is being turned over to house mothers and children; food and clothing come in from all over Europe. The war is not over, and the Government is slow to react to daily needs.
Journalists have dared to criticize the new regime because the country is hungry for democracy. They know what life is like in other European countries. The big question is what does democracy mean to the leadership of this country. The Government would like a stronger army: to protect the country or those in power? Journalists ask the same questions in all countries. Is the Government a public servant or is it there to meet the needs of a few? Journalists express the fears of a populace fighting for a truly representative government that worries about the price of a loaf of bread and whether or not a family can afford to buy it.
An article in Slobodna Dalmacija today was headlined "Ethnically Pure Onions." Slovenia no longer allows peasants from Croatia to sell vegetables in its market. Only a native Slovene has the right to sell vegetables. Of course, the price has doubled. The housewife's answer: I don't care who sells me onions, I just want to be able to buy them.
In 1991 I retired as a language teacher at the Bronx High School of Science. My parents were born in Dalmatia. My father went to the United States as an Austrian, my mother as a Yugoslav. I have close ties with this part of the world and like to spend a few months here every year. The shelling has started again now at 7 P.M.

HEADLINE: Quest for Zoning

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Congratulations to David W. Dunlap for his "The Quest for New Zoning" on April 12.. His description of the city's current zoning ordinance as "a cumbersome, bloated, 835-page patchwork that can be navigated only by a handful of specialists, leaving everyone else -- developers, architects, community leaders and neighbors -- at a baffled disadvantage" is right on the mark. 
 Sigurd Grava, director of the graduate planning program at Columbia University and current president of the New York chapter of the American Planning Association, has pinpointed the reason for inaction despite the obvious need: "While there are many of us in the trenches who think it should be done, we really don't have a very high official who'd take this on as a major political platform."
This is not a new issue nor is it one only for planning professionals. Three years ago the Women's City Club easily found more than 40 community groups from all parts of the city eager to sign on to its campaign for zoning reform.
Economic development is the key to the future of the city, and an up-to-date, comprehensible zoning resolution is critical to sound physical development. Is a new Zoning Resolution too difficult for a city that has just adopted a new Charter?
The Women's City Club urges the Mayor and the City Council to provide the funds, and instruct the Department of City Planning to give the city a Zoning Resolution for the 90's.

HEADLINE: Quest for Zoning

 BODY:
To the Editor:
New York City does not need a fundamentally new Zoning Resolution or an initial "master plan" ["The Quest for a New Zoning Plan," April 12]. Rather, it needs an officially adopted set of objective master-planning principles to resolve any clash between private real estate interests and development regulations at a specific location. 
 Paramount among those master-planning principles should be a policy favoring economic development and employment growth, especially in areas served by rapid transit or major roadways, or bordering existing commercial or industrial sections.
Zoning changes that implement the economy-employment objective should generally be approved expeditiously by the city (unless offset by a compelling city interest, such as protecting an ecologically fragile spot or maintaining a long-established residential character).
In this increasingly competitive global setting, the city should embrace an entrepreneurial land-use policy. Current zoning-resolution controls (with ordinary amendments or clarifications) may then be applied in new areas or new ways to match this policy.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
The Patriarch of American Luxury

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to automobiles, it is hard to say what sparks brand loyalty. What makes you, for instance, a Ford guy? Or a Plymouth person? Or why are you passionate about Chevies?
It may be that you have heard good things. Or that you like the lines. Or, in my case, that you just wanted to one-up your father. That's how I wound up with my first Cadillac, used but almost new -- and a year newer than Dad's '59 Lincoln. 
 Like a lot of people, of course, I also aspired to Cadillac simply because it was what you did. Things were simpler, and you knew that you were supposed to start with a Chevrolet and work your way through Pontiac and Oldsmobile and Buick until you were ready. Then you bought a Cadillac.
It was the pre-eminent statement. It was also a nice car, and I couldn't wait to show up in front of my father's house.
Cadillacs were, in fact, better than anything else on the road, solid and loaded with quality. Loaded also with the things that spelled luxury: leather seats, power windows, air-conditioning, a good sound system, even cruise control. They lasted longer than Lincolns. They weren't alternately stodgy or weird like Chryslers. And Packard had long since been left behind.
Cadillac was America's luxury-car leader, and it continues to be, holding the position for 43 consecutive years. That puts the turning point at 1949, the year the division introduced its Coupe DeVille, a pillarless hardtop with tailfins inspired by the twin-fuselage P-38 fighter plane of World War II.
Some of us lament the loss of those fins, which reached their outrageous zenith in 1959 and disappeared entirely in 1965, but DeVille is still Cadillac's bread-and-butter model, and it is the best-selling luxury vehicle in the country.
Along with the fins, though, something else has been lost, and the car no longer makes quite so much of a statement, in part because the "luxury" distinctions have become blurred. You can order leather in a lot of automobiles today. Power windows are the norm in any market segment, as are power side-view mirrors. Even cheap little cars have terrific stereos.
So what keeps the Coupe DeVille going?
Well, there is still the name and the size and the V-8 engine, although it now lives sideways under the hood and drives the front wheels. There is the huge back seat accessed through equally huge front doors. And there is the conservative approach to sportiness.
The test car was painted a color that I assumed would be called Champagne Metallic or some such, but which Cadillac sensibly calls light beige. Similarly, the interior has no fancy name, and the window sticker lists it simply as "neutral leather," which translates into a sort of creamy beige.
The leather seats added $570 to the car's $31,740 base price. And, with other options, like a vinyl cabriolet roof, an automatic pull-down for the trunk lid and a digital instrument panel, the sticker's bottom line said $34,638, which may be one way to separate the luxurious from the merely well-equipped.
Walking around the car, you notice some of the old styling cues in the form of long vertical taillights, a familiar egg-crate grille done in chrome, and little lights atop the front fenders to tell the driver that the headlamps are on or that turn signals are operating.
Bumpers are a combination of chrome and body-colored vinyl, and there are those mammoth doors that curve limousine-style into the roof. But the DeVille has not been a true "hardtop" coupe since 1973, and the wide door pillars lead to rear windows that don't open at all.
The car rides on 15-inch cast-aluminum wheels and whitewall tires. A chrome strip runs around the body's beltline, leading back to a trunk that is large and deep but that has a liftover so high that it will prove a pain to younger buyers, not to mention the DeVille's traditionally older clientele.
All the same, the car is comfortable and pretty, with a formal roofline whose square back provides an open feel inside and gives the rear compartment the pleasant look of a car from the 30's. Rear passengers also benefit from grabhandles on each side, and there are large storage pockets on the backs of the front seats.
Those seats, redesigned for 1992 to provide more support, are split 60-40, with the larger seat on the driver's side. The driver also gets a standard air bag in the hub of the wheel, and safety concerns have made antilock brakes standard as well.
Also standard this year are power controls for the passenger-seat adjustment, and an electro-chromic rear-view mirror, which automatically adjusts against glare. There is a one-push down function for the driver's window, and the car comes with a little wastebasket over on the right, a nice touch.
Under the hood, the 4.9-liter aluminum engine puts out 200 horsepower and a healthy 275 foot-pounds of torque, enough to move the 3,519-pound car from a standing stop to 60 miles an hour in 8.7 seconds. This year, incidentally, the engine is equipped with platinum-tipped sparkplugs that effectively last for the life of the car, needing replacement only every 100,000 miles.
The DeVille's bulk does take its toll on fuel economy, although the Federal ratings are better than might be expected at 16, city, and 25, highway. The engine's 9.5:1 compression ratio also creates a thirst for premium unleaded, so filling the 18-gallon tank means having a credit card or a fistful of cash at the ready.
New this year, in mechanical terms, is a traction-control system that improves acceleration on slippery surfaces by regulating tire spin. The system, which uses the same sensors that activate the antilock brakes, is optional on the DeVille series and standard on Fleetwood models.
Another optional electronic system, Computer Command Ride, monitors driving conditions and selects from soft, normal or firm modes of suspension to optimize ride and handling, working through the car's front and rear struts.
Even without it, though, the '92 Coupe DeVille rides like . . . well, like a Cadillac. And if I am less enamored of this year's version than I was of that long-ago car, you can put it down to fuddy-duddiness.
And, just so you know, when I pulled up in front of my father's house, I was much dismayed. e had traded the Lincoln and there was a new Coupe DeVille in the driveway. When it comes to fathers and sons, fathers always win.

THE GREAT THIRST
Californians and Water, 1770s-1990s.
By Norris Hundley Jr.
Illustrated. 551 pp. Berkeley:
University of California Press. $25. 
 IT is difficult for Easterners, for whom ample precipitation and dependable fresh water supplies are the norm, to comprehend the towering importance of water in the American West. But for a third of the North American continent, the rugged land west of the Rockies, water, or the lack of it, has long been the central factor defining the region's political, economic, social and physical landscape.
Nowhere has that been truer than in arid California, which was pronounced nearly unfit for human settlement by one early 18th-century explorer but which now is the most populous state in the nation, being home to 30 million people. California also boasts the nation's second-largest city and its biggest agricultural industry. This has all been done by rearranging a harsh environment, using the world's largest and most complex hydraulic system to collect the runoff from the snows in the Sierra Nevada and divert water from the Colorado River to bring sustenance to huge cities and farms.
The punishing drought that has gripped California for the last six years, forcing urbanites to watch their lawns go brown and farmers to let their land lie fallow, has exposed the inherent fragility of this system. Heavy rains and snows this winter and spring appear to have eased the drought for now. But the convulsions it has caused have focused national attention on the history of frontier heroism, ambition, greed and intrigue that lies behind the building of the modern California. In "The Great Thirst: Californians and Water, 1770s-1990s," Norris Hundley Jr. describes "a new kind of . . . urban water imperialism" among Californians whose determination built a modern economic colossus, but at enormous social cost.
While this story has been told often in print and film, Mr. Hundley, a historian at the University of California, Los Angeles, offers a scholarly, comprehensive and remarkably interesting and well-written chronicle. He traces early water use by the Indians and the Spanish settlers, who diverted relatively small amounts of water for local consumption. But it was the numbers of Americans who came after the gold rush who saw water as an instrument of wealth and power and began the wholesale water transfers that remain a focus of Western politics to this day.
The book recounts Los Angeles's turn-of-the-century rape of the Owens Valley, the once fertile land on the eastern slope of the Sierras that is a dust bowl today because its waters are funneled to the swimming pools of the city. It details San Francisco's bumbling efforts to build the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir -- still the city's only source of fresh water -- in Yosemite National Park and the Depression-born efforts of the Federal Central Valley Project and State Water Project, which built dams, reservoirs and hundreds of miles of aqueducts to bring water to farms in central California. It details the modern-day political battle between environmentalists and commercial farmers over the still-unbuilt Peripheral Canal, which is meant to reduce poisonous salinity in San Francisco Bay and shunt more water to ever-thirsty, fast-growing southern California.
To all this, Mr. Hundley adds the sobering news that none of what has been built is very permanent. Even without earthquakes, he reports, nearly all the state's more than 1,300 dams will silt up and cease functioning within a few hundred years. "The state's (and the West's) watersheds do not consist of solid rock but of crumbling sandstone and quartz, as well as loose soil, and the mountains are steep, often covered with only a sparse growth, and actively eroding."
He criticizes the environmental damage to fish and wildfowl caused by the state's current water system, which gives enormous subsidies to corporate farmers, and faults the state's "hopelessly fragmented water management system" and "patchwork of laws" governing water. And he notes, as many others have, that these subsidies mean that much water goes to irrigate low-value crops like alfalfa. While Mr. Hundley's style is less angry and strident than that of other commentators, such as Marc Reisner, the author of "Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water," his prescription is similar; he calls for "a thorough overhaul" of the system of agricultural subsidies in which major farmers get both cheap water and Federal price supports to grow surplus crops. He notes studies showing that a cutback of just 10 percent in farm water use would meet urban needs for the next 20 years without much damage to agriculture.
To achieve this, he urges "a coordinating agency authorized to take charge." But given the fractious history of water development in California that Mr. Hundley so ably chronicles, that seems a very unlikely outcome.

HEADLINE: Retirees Threatened With Loss of Insurance

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Several million Americans who retired with the promise of comprehensive medical coverage are now having those benefits terminated or sharply reduced by their former employers.
Indeed, as many as 95 percent of employers either are cutting back on retirees' health benefits or will do so eventually, says David M. Walker, a former Assistant Secretary of Labor in the Bush Administration who is a Washington representative of Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting and consulting firm. 
 Deborah Chollet, a health economist at Georgia State University, said about 13 million retired people over age 55 -- about a third of the Americans of that age -- receive health benefits from their former employers. At least 8.5 million retirees have benefits that seem secure because they became effective before the employers added escape clauses reserving the right to change the benefits, she said. That leaves 4.5 million retirees whose benefits are at risk.
The companies say the changes are necessary if they are to remain profitable, protecting their current employees and stockholders.
 
'A Betrayal'
 Advocates for retirees, not surprisingly, are outraged by the changes. "The decision to break a promise of lifetime health benefits may represent a straightforward business decision for an employer," said Cathy Ventrell-Monsees, a benefits-policy manager with the American Association of Retired Persons. "However, for the retirees who relied on such promises and now face an uncertain financial future, the decision is a betrayal."
Many retirees are not taking the cuts lying down. They are taking their former employers to court, where the results have been mixed.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, ruled in January that the new owners of the Pressed Steel Tank Company in Milwaukee did not have to continue retiree medical benefits because company documents had not specifically promised lifetime coverage.
And most appeals court decisions have upheld employers' rights to deny coverage, especially if health plan documents state that the company reserves the right to change or drop the benefits, said Willis J. Goldsmith, a Washington lawyer who represents employers. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, has taken "a very expansive view of the entitlement of retirees to unchanged medical benefits," he said.
 And Kenneth Van Deventer, a Morristown, N.J., lawyer who represents retirees of the American Can Company, said, "The issue is still in its infancy as far as the legal side is concerned."
 
 
Early Retirees Suffer
 While millions of retirees face reduced or terminated benefits, those hit hardest are the tens of thousands of people who were urged to retire before age 65 by companies that slashed payrolls in hopes of becoming more profitable. These people are too young to be protected by Medicare, the Federal insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
Delores Sandberg of Adell, Wis., for example, who turned 65 last year, is struggling to get by on a widow's pension of $126 a month from Pressed Steel Tank, where her husband, Clarence, retired in 1985 at age 61 after 32 years as a factory inspector and office worker.
The company was sold, and the new owners eliminated retirees' medical coverage in 1988. After her husband died in August 1989, Mrs. Sandberg was saddled with $8,000 in medical charges. "I got stuck with these bills," she said. "A collection agency threatened to take me to court."
 
 
Asked to Pay More
 To reduce their costs, many companies insist that retirees pay a greater share of the cost of their benefits. W. H. Goggans, 60, a retired accountant in Sherwood, Ark., said the Georgia-Pacific Corporation had recently doubled his family's health insurance premiums to $4,524 a year. He said the company had previously doubled the deductible amount that he must pay before the insurance kicks in.
"It is clear to me that they are getting ready to phase out retiree insurance," he said. "The next step is to price us out of the market or cut the benefits."
A Georgia-Pacific executive, Dick Spitznass, said the company "has no plans whatsoever to discontinue retiree medical coverage." Mr. Spitznass, vice president for compensation and benefits, said medical costs for retirees under age 65 had doubled in 1991, to an average of $6,000 a retiree. He said Georgia-Pacific had always required retirees to pay half the premiums, which are based on the preceding year's experience.
Elderly pensioners who used to work for the American Can Company, which is now the Primerica Corporation, say their monthly medical premiums were raised to $50 a month, from $5.
William Flowers, 79, a retired clerk in Butler, Ala., who sued the company, said that after the increase, he had only $173.14 left from his monthly pension.
 
 
G.M. Retirees File Suit
 In one of the largest lawsuits, 40,000 former General Motors nonunion employees who took early retirement are challenging the company's right to cut the coverage, which had been virtually 100 percent company-paid. They assert that G.M. promised the coverage in writing when they left.
G.M., which said it would not comment on matters before a court, spent $3.4 billion for health care for employees and retirees in 1991, The company wants the retirees to accept the same deal as active nonunion workers: $750 a year maximum for basic coverage, or no charge if they use doctors in a G.M. medical network, and a reduction of some benefits like prescription eyeglasses and hearing aids at no charge.
Christopher Mackaronis, a lawyer for the G.M. retirees, said the case had raised questions about whether promises that many companies made to induce people to give up their jobs could be enforced. "The decision to voluntarily retire has to be based on accurate and forthright information," he said. "If not, hundreds of thousands of people are giving up their jobs on a foundation based on quicksand. A promise is a promise."
 
 
65% Plan Reductions
 In a survey last year of 1,380 large and small employers by the A. Foster Higgins benefits-consulting firm, 65 percent said they were reducing benefits, requiring retirees to pay more of the costs, up from with 58 percent that were making the cuts in 1990 and 43 percent in 1989. Seven percent said they were ending the benefits.
Similarly, 15 of the country's largest companies said they were eliminating company-paid medical benefits entirely for current or future retirees, according to a 1991 survey of 150 employers by Towers Perrin, a consulting firm.
"We're not doing right by the shareholders," said William W. Spievak, corporate director of compensation and benefits with the Ball Corporation, a container manufacturer based in Muncie, Ind. The company, which has 14,300 employees, has ended retirees' benefits for nonunion employees who started after Jan. 1, 1990. These workers have been invited to start a retirement health savings account at their own expense, but few have done so.
"Right now there are too many unknowns" for an employer to plan for future retirees, Mr. Spievak said. He noted that medical costs had been rising much faster than inflation, and that Congress had been unwilling to provide tax breaks for the health funds of nonunion retirees.
 
 
Escape Clauses
 Professor Chollet of Georgia State said many employers had started adding escape clauses to company health plan booklets in the late 1980's, when they heard about plans for new accounting rules to show the cost of promises to future retirees.
"We are now seeing the leading edge of a generation of retirees in which employers are a lot more careful about limiting the firmness of that obligation," Professor Chollet added. "Those people really can't depend on the benefit. It's a wonderful thing while they have it, but there is absolutely no guarantee that the benefit will continue."
Richard Ostuw, chief health-plan actuary with Towers Perrin, said, "A lot of smaller companies will discontinue the benefits or convert to a retiree-pay-all program."
Patricia Wilson, a principal with Foster Higgins, said employers were increasingly aware that they "can't walk away from retiree medical benefits" without making up for the cuts by increasing pensions or other employee-retirement savings programs.
"Employers try to balance the interest of shareholders, existing retirees and retirees against active employees," she said. "It is an enormously stressful situation for management."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Clinton and Tsongas Agree to Keep Brown's Issues Out of Play

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton's camp struck a deal today with supporters of former Senator Paul E. Tsongas to keep former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. from forcing a convention debate on some of the Brown campaign themes.
 The arrangement was intended to avert a fight next month at the Democratic National Convention on the kinds of trip-wire issues that have often divided and embarrassed the party in the past. 
The horse trading at the Democratic platform committee's meeting today was probably of little direct interest to most Democrats, let alone most voters, but party leaders said it would guarantee a smooth convention beginning July 13 at Madison Square Garden.
 The party platform, written under the direction of the Clinton staff and approved by the platform committee this evening, avoids some of the conventional liberal positions advocated by the Democrats since the New Deal, like down-the-line support of labor unions and promises of vastly increased social welfare. Instead, the platform emphasizes matters like economic growth and business investment.
 At a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Brown called the Clinton platform "fuzzy" and said it did not touch the "flesh and soul" of the Democratic party. His representatives on the platform committee tried to force a debate in New York on matters like an increase in the minimum wage, a moratorium on nuclear arms testing and restrictions on foreign trade, all of which have the support of many Democrats and could have led to fireworks at the convention but are opposed by Mr. Clinton.
 
No Brown-Tsongas Alliance
 Under the party's rules, a convention floor debate would be required on any platform proposal for which Mr. Brown could obtain 20 percent of the votes of the 186-member platform committee. The committee is divided more or less according to how the candidates fared in the primaries. Clinton supporters make up about 55 percent of the committee, and Brown and Tsongas supporters make up about 15 percent each.
 So, if the Brown and Tsongas camps had joined forces and voted for each other's planks, as Mr. Brown said he and Mr. Tsongas discussed earlier this week, they would have had sufficient strength to require floor debates on all their proposals in New York.
 To avoid that, Clinton supporters promised to give Mr. Tsongas the votes on the platform committee he needed to bring about floor debates on four of his issues: a cut in the capital gains tax for most long-term investments, a cap on Federal spending, a promise that taxes would not be reduced until the deficit was brought "under control" and a 5-cents-a-gallon increase each year in the gasoline tax to raise money for public works projects.
 In return, Tsongas supporters agreed to deny the former California Governor the votes he needed to have a debate on more emotional matters.
 
Unity, for the Most Part
 Mr. Brown's reaction was difficult to gauge. At one point in his news conference, he said rather blandly, "That's the politics of conventions." But at another point, he said, "I'm looking for a creative convention experience." He did not explicitly repeat the threat he made two weeks ago to disrupt the convention from the outside.
 Ted Van Dyk, Mr. Tsongas's chief representative on the platform committee, said that the former Massachusetts Senator knew his proposals would be defeated in New York but felt it important "to have a national debate."
 Some of the fires of years past flared occasionally at today's platform committee debate. There was a brief, tense exchange, for example, over racial quotas.
 But for the most part, all the delegates except Mr. Brown's were willing to compromise in the name of party unity. For instance, Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York initially pressed for a $35 billion package of urban aid programs developed by the United States Conference of Mayors. When the Clinton forces objected that the package was too expensive, Mr. Dinkins arranged a compromise in which the platform says only that such a package will be taken under consideration.
 
Edging Toward the Middle
 Party platforms in the United States are not binding the way they are in some parliamentary democracies and are generally ignored from one party convention to the next. Still, many politicians think the platforms are important because they distinguish the parties from one another.
 The document, for instance, endorses legal abortions for all women who want them, paid for by the Government in the case of women who cannot afford them. An attempt to amend the platform to say the party opposed "abortion on demand" did not get the show of 15 hands necessary to be discussed by the committee today.
 The platform also calls for higher taxes on the wealthy, civil rights protection for homosexuals and a requirement that companies grant unpaid leave to workers in family emergencies. These policies are directly counter to what President Bush and the Republican party stand for.
 On the other hand, the platform this year is much more favorable to business interests and less supportive of organized labor than Democratic platforms have been in the past.
 The platform represents what Mr. Clinton calls the "third way," a course somewhere between conventional liberalism and the conservatism as advanced by the Reagan and Bush Administrations.

HEADLINE: Portrait of 2 Accused of Kidnapping: Ardent, Hapless Pursuit of Affluence

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 27

 BODY:
During the giddy late 1980's, Arthur and Irene Seale wholeheartedly adopted the concept of having it all. Blond, fit and perennially tan, the parents of two cashed in their four-bedroom colonial in Morris County, N.J., to join the sail-and-ski set in Hilton Head, S.C. and Vail, Colo.
But like the economy, the Seales' high life tumbled. About three-quarters of a million dollars in debt, they moved back to New Jersey with no jobs, no prospects and no alternative but to stay with Mr. Seale's retired parents in a farmhouse in rural Hunterdon County. 
 And then, if the authorities are right, their yearning for the good life drove them to a desperate step. Mr. Seale, an ex-police officer and Exxon security manager, and Mrs. Seale, known as Jackie, are charged with kidnapping the president of Exxon International, Sidney J. Reso, from the driveway of his Morris Township home on April 29 and demanding $18.5 million in ransom.
Since their arrest on June 19, the Seales, both 45, remained silent, until Friday or today. Then, according to an oil industry official, one of them told law-enforcement authorities that Mr. Reso, 57 years old, died of natural causes in May and that he was buried in southern New Jersey. Tonight, the F.B.I. said, searchers in the Pine Barrens dug up a body thought to be that of Mr. Reso.
The case has shocked everyone who knows the couple. In two dozen interviews over the last several days with associates and acquaintances of the Seales -- from New Jersey, Hilton Head and Vail -- a portrait emerges of a quiet man and a chatty, cheerful woman who acquaintances said could only be guilty of living beyond their means.
 
The Means for a Lavish Life
 Yet many of the facts of their itinerant recent years are sketchy. No one is quite sure how the couple, who drove a Mercedes-Benz, sent their children to private schools and favored Ralph Lauren clothes, conjured the means for the lavish life they led. Mr. Seale has told acquaintances he was awarded a $1 million settlement from the Hillside Police Department after he was hit by an officer's car; the department says he retired from the force in 1977 with a disability pension that gave him two-thirds of his $15,000 annual salary.
Growing up in Hillside, N.J., Arthur Seale and Jackie Szarko were more than comfortable. She was the pretty, pampered daughter of a prominent family that long-time residents still recall in reverent tones.
Her father was a businessman who owned properties and ran a liquor store and delicatessen with his brothers and father. Her mother, now widowed and in her 70's, is a registered nurse. In their neat, middle-class town, with about 20,000 residents, the Szarkos were considered rich.
"Jackie Szarko didn't want for anything," said Vito Menza, a local real-estate agent who knows both families. "The Szarkos were a lovely, lovely family. So, for that matter, were the Seales."
The Seales lived about five blocks away from the Szarkos. Arthur, known as Artie, was the athletic, handsome son of a beautiful school secretary and a police officer who rose to the rank of deputy police chief.
He was sent to the Admiral Farragut Academy, a private military prep school in Pine Beach. Capt. John Matthies, the school's superintendent, graduated two years after Mr. Seale and recalls him as a popular, well-rounded student who played varsity football and track and kept a B average "that could have been better if he tried harder."
"He was smart, athletic and handsome," Mr. Matthies said. "He was not only popular with the students, but also with the teachers."
After graduating from the academy in 1965, Mr. Seale enrolled in Drew University in Madison. He was there one year.
In September 1967, Artie Seale and Jackie Szarko were married and took an apartment in Hillside.
 
Suspensions and Fines
 Mr. Seale's troubles began a few years after he joined the police force in 1968, at age 22. Mayor James Connelly Welsh, who was police commissioner and the town attorney during the time Mr. Seale served on the force, said Mr. Seale was suspended twice and was fined three times over six years, "both for insubordination and pulling out his gun when he shouldn't have."
Mr. Welsh said the disability claim under which Mr. Seale left the force in 1977 was legitimate. But, he added, "it was mutually beneficial to Mr. Seale and the force."
The Seales left Hillside with their two children, Justin and Courtney, shortly after that. Mr. Seale then found work at Exxon as a $60,000-a-year security official, and the family settled in Chester Township, where they lived quietly, neighbors said. For about three years, Mrs. Seale worked at Tewksbury Wine Cellars as an office manager. The owner, Dan Vernon, recalled her as an "honest, hard-working person."
 
Where the Troubles Began
 By most accounts, the Seales' most serious troubles began shortly after they moved to Hilton Head in 1986 to live their dream. They bought a 38-foot sloop called the Gallant and a $500,000 interior design business, settling in a marshfront home in one of the resort's most expensive enclaves. But they lost their business two years later, moving out of town in the middle of the night with a trail of lawsuits seeking more than $715,000.
They came with high expectations and ambitions, recalled Porter Thompson, an advertising account executive hired by the couple to promote their interior design business, called Insiders.
"They were fun, had a great sense of adventure and wanted to make a go of it," said Mr. Thompson, who said the Seales still owed him $30,000. He recalls teaching Mr. Seale to sail during a long night when Mr. Seale became seasick.
Apparently, Mr. Seale's sailing skills improved. Neighbors said he was often away for days at a time on the Gallant, making repeated trips to Florida.
Maryland National Bank held a $71,248 mortgage on the Seales' boat as of February 1988, but no one seems to know what happened to the boat when the Seales left Hilton Head that summer. They were sued by Bill and Sally Hunter, who sold them the store and held the mortgage on it, in July 1988.
The company had accumulated more than $120,000 in other debts and owed $60,000 in back taxes, according to court records. In addition, a South Carolina court had rendered more than $35,000 in judgments against the company.
 
Attempt at a Fresh Start
 The Seales apparently moved to Vail for a fresh start. It didn't work. They somehow managed then to move into a $500,000 town house in Vail, but were unable to secure jobs and left little more than a year later.
Besides job woes, they had family problems in Vail. The police were summoned to their home on several occasions, three times because their daughter, Courtney, had run away. Joe Venneman, an investigator in Vail, recalled that the daughter, who is now 15, "did not have a good relationship with her dad."
After they returned to New Jersey from Colorado, success continued to elude the Seales. Mrs. Seale's last job, which she started in March 1990, was handling promotions at the Four Sisters Winery in Belvidere. She lasted three or four months, said the owner, Matty Mattarazzo. "She told us that her husband had worked for Exxon and that she could bring in important clients," Mr. Mattarazzo said. But during her brief tenure, he said, she never brought in business.
Mr. Mattarazzo said that a fellow employee has recalled Mrs. Seale saying that her dream was to move to a tax-free haven like the Virgin Islands, where "nobody would know her."
"She had great ambitions," he said. "She let us know that this was a temporary thing."
Mr. Seale worked for a brief time at Intertel, a security consulting business. His relationship with the company ended when Intertel closed its New York office in March.
 
Evidence Against the Seales
 Some acquaintances suggest that the couple, overwhelmed by their financial woes, may have written ransom notes about Mr. Reso in a desperate attempt to cash in on someone else's far more serious crime.
But the authorities say the evidence, much of which has not been released, proves otherwise. The Seales are being held without bail in separate county jails, based on evidence that the United States Attorney for New Jersey, Michael Chertoff, did release. The material includes an out-of-date telephone book listing the home numbers of Exxon officials; laundry bags of the type the kidnappers requested be filled with used $100 bills; newspaper clippings, journals and a manual that detailed the kidnappings of corporate executives; a book on money laundering, and a list of banks in Switzerland and Pakistan.
Apparently, Mr. Seale continued to crave the sailing life. Several days before the couple were arrested, he visited his son, Justin, 19 years old, who was staying with friends at Hilton Head after finishing his first year at Norwich University. While there he told acquaintances he was thinking of returning and buying a marina.

HEADLINE: Son of Privilege, Son of Pain: Random Death At Yale's Gates

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
When the trial in the slaying of Christian Prince on the Yale campus ended late last month and the courtroom emptied, few of the central figures were satisfied with the outcome, not even the jurors who had handed down a mixed verdict in a case that had cut this city and the university to the bone.
The family of James Duncan Fleming, the 17-year-old defendant, expressed relief that he was acquitted on a charge that he intentionally murdered Mr. Prince in the early morning hours of Feb. 17, 1991, but expressed sadness that he had been found guilty of conspiring to rob the 19-year old Yale sophomore. "I wish they hadn't found him guilty on any count," the accused man's father, James Fleming Sr., said. "My family and I want him home."
 
Not Their Tragedy Alone
 The family of the victim was not consoled by a verdict that left unanswered the question of who killed their son, even though the prosecutor said the defendant would be retried on two charges the jury deadlocked on: felony murder and robbery. 
 As profound as their sense of loss is -- "It makes you question if there is a loving God," says Sally Prince, Christian's mother -- the Princes see the chain of events that brought the two young men into fateful collision as not their tragedy alone.
It was also a tragedy, they say, for the Flemings, who struggled to raise a son in circumstances where drugs, guns and early violent death are routine.
"We are so terribly aware," Mrs. Prince says with a voice that still breaks slightly when she speaks her son's name, "that these children have no chance in life."
Indeed, despite the image conveyed by the turrets and terra-cotta trim of Yale's neo-Gothic towers, James Fleming grew up in a city whose per capita murder rate has been as high in recent years as New York's and whose minority population is constantly struggling under the weight of joblessness and drugs and the rattle of gunfire.
Most of the shootings have been black-on-black violence, clashes between warring drug dealers and gangs like the one in recent weeks that sent a bullet into the brain of a 6-year-old on a school bus caught in the crossfire.
 
A Bright Future Meets a Dim One
 Rarely, though, does the violence spill over into the Yale campus the way it did the night Christian Prince died.
The paths that brought the victim and the accused into collision began in opposite poles of American life. One youth approached adulthood with a bright future filled with attractive options. The other, despite his parents' hopes, had scant reason to believe he could look forward to any but a narrow band of choices in life.
Christian Prince was a son of privilege.
He grew up in the upper-middle-class terraces of Chevy Chase, Md., his father a prominent lawyer in Washington and a tennis partner of George Bush when Mr. Bush was Vice President. Four generations of the Prince family attended Yale. Christian Prince's father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all graduates; his sister, Jackie, 29, studied chemical engineering as an undergraduate at Yale and later earned a master's degree in environmental science. His brother, Edward Jr., 26, graduated from Yale and is studying environmental law at Duke.
 
The Victim
Almost Too Good To Be True
 Christian, the youngest child, was almost too good to be true in a cynical age when the Frank Merriwells or Dink Stovers, fictional Yale heroes serialized early in the century, are seen as laughable hollow men rather than role models. His name, his blond good looks and trim 6-foot-2 athletic frame seemed to strain reality.
"He was what everyone has in mind when they think of a son," said James Adams, assistant headmaster at the Lawrenceville School, the elite boarding school near Princeton, N.J., where Christian spent three years before graduating in 1989. At Lawrenceville, he was an honors student, vice president of the student body, house president and captain of the football and lacrosse teams.
"He was the kindest guy I've ever met," recalled James Kuser, a roommate at Lawrenceville who is now a senior at Notre Dame University. "He never forced himself on others. They chose to come to him."
 
Walking a Thornier Path
 James Fleming -- "Dunc" to his teen-age friends on the bleak side streets of New Haven -- walked a thornier path.
His family moved here in 1978, four years after he was born in Baltimore, and settled in a section called New hallville. James Sr. took a job as a security guard for a drug store chain.
Decades ago, Newhallville was the neighborhood of choice for many of the 17,000 workers who toiled in the gun factories of Winchester Repeating Arms Company, Colt, Savage and Remington. The plant managers and owners and city merchants raised their Victorian mansions on the heights above Newhallville, on tree-lined avenues named Prospect and Hillhouse, structures eventually acquired by Yale for its expansion.
Blacks had first settled in New Haven in a district west of the university called Dixwell, working as waiters and porters on campus. Beginning with World War II, waves of blacks were drawn to the city from the Carolinas to take jobs paying good wages in the arms factories, moving into a section called the Hill, southwest of Yale, jamming into Dixwell and spilling over into Newhallville as whites left for the suburbs.
The jobs soon joined the exodus.
 
Yale Surrounded by Slide
 By the time the Flemings moved into a three-family house on Winchester Avenue, a street that ran to the gun plant, the old factories were shutting down and the city around Yale was in decline.
Urban renewal and hopeful Government programs like Model Cities did not halt the slide, though Yale, with 11,000 students and 700 faculty members today, remained a major force in the city, largely insulated from the social changes outside its gates. By 1980, the black population in the city reached 40,000, one in three residents.
Only occasionally does the violence reach out of doleful black neighborhoods like Newhallville to touch a student. In fact, James Fleming Jr. was only four weeks old when the last Yale student was murdered on campus in 1974.
But young black men in New Haven have been dying from gunshot wounds at a rate of about three a month, a statistic that youths in the black neighborhoods here know first hand.
"It'll never get any better, man," said a black 16-year old who identified himself only as Scarface. "When you die and go to heaven that's the only place it'll be better. This is hell now."
 
The Suspect
A Troubled World Outside the Door
 James Fleming Sr. can see the despair out his front door. "What we have now is a lot of young men on the streets with nothing to do with their time and nothing to lose," said Mr. Fleming, a spare 49-year-old man with a friendly way who lost the sight of one eye to diabetes, and walks on crutches because of an ulcerated foot. He has been unemployed and on public disability income since 1985. His wife, Julia, has suffered a heart attack. Tanya, a 19-year old daughter who lives at home, is unmarried and has two children of her own.
Mr. Fleming said his son was average in nearly all the ways Mr. Prince had excelled.
James was "a slow learner" in courses like science, Mr. Fleming said. "I forget what his I.Q. was, but it was enough to pass most classes." His main interests were the ones available: watching television and playing pick-up games of basketball.
Yet he was luckier than most boys his age, said Frank Ionnotti, his court-appointed lawyer; unlike many other inner-city children, he came from an intact two-parent family.
"I tried to be a strict father till he grew up," recalled James Fleming Sr. Until 1991, Mr. Fleming said, "The only trouble he got into with the police was when he was 14 and broke a window in a parked car."
 
Brandy Stingers at 16
 But parents at home were not enough to overcome the influences outside the door of the Fleming home. One door away is the Oasis Lounge, a late-night hangout where, said a few friends, James Fleming was drinking brandy stingers the night that Mr. Prince was killed. The accused was barely 16 at the time.
Further along Winchester is the Mudhole, nothing more than an empty lot with broken bottles and other detritus of a worn urban block. Drug dealers congregate there. The night is often split by the crack of shots fired by rival gangs or by offended parties in a drug deal gone sour. The police said James Fleming ran with two street gangs, one called Ville and the other called the Lynch mob.
"BMW's, Volvos, Mercedeses, that's the values of those boys," Mr. Fleming said more in sadness than anger. "Jewelry. Gold. Clothes. That's what the average kid in Newhallville dreams of. Not just James. Any kid is fascinated by big money.
"I'd say to him, James you have to finish school, you must get an education. You can't start at the top. I'd try to instill in him he had to take care of himself because no one else would.
"But even though I tried to be very strict, when your child leaves the house you don't know what he is up to."
 
Dreams
A Desire to Change Parts of Society
 Christian Prince arrived in Yale in the fall of 1989, just back from weeks of rigorous back-country canoeing on James Bay in Canada. His friends say he had been touched by concern over the building of a hydroelectric plant there and its impact on the Cree Indians.
Diana Montgomery, a Yale senior from New York and a close friend, recalls catching sight of him in the first days of the semester in Old Campus, where all freshmen live.
"The other boys were doing the talking and being cool but Christian was hanging back," Ms. Montgomery said. "But you could sense there was a lot to him beside the obvious fact he was very good looking."
The next spring he made the varsity lacrosse team, a feat for a freshman, and the team reached the semifinals of the N.C.A.A. playoffs. That summer he went to Fort Smith, Ark., with a Yale classmate, Lawrence Deas, to work in a warehouse owned by Mr. Deas's family.
"We were in charge of a work crew of 10 men, black and white," Mr. Deas said. "It was a hot, dirty job, and there was no difference between us and the wage workers. We competed to see who could move the heaviest pieces of furniture."
There was ample time over the summer weeks to share each other's thoughts.
"Christian was thinking about going to law school but not practicing it," Mr. Deas recalled. "He thought about getting into the political sphere in some capacity, not necessarily running for office. He said he had this real desire to change some parts of society."
Christian, Ms. Montgomery said, never smoked marijuana. Asked why, he joked, "Who knows; maybe one day I might want to run for President."
 
Death
'I Ought to Shoot This Cracker'
 On Saturday night, Feb. 16, Christian Prince and James Fleming were at separate parties about one half-mile apart.
According to a statement given to the police three months later by Randy Fleming, a 17-year old Newhallville resident who is not related to James Fleming, the two were drinking at the Oasis Lounge and wanted money to attend a rap performance. James Fleming, the other teen-ager stated, suggested they "stick up a cracker," a street word used to refer disparagingly to whites.
A 15-year-old witness testified at the Fleming trial that the defendant asked another neighborhood man for "jammies," slang for handguns. The man went to his apartment and returned several minutes later with a .25-caliber semiautomatic and a .22-caliber revolver. The two Flemings hopped into a white Nissan with two other teen-agers identified only as "Rob" and "Thumbhead."
According to the statement the time was nearing 1 A.M.
Christian Prince had been to Mory's, the celebrated drinking and dining club, earlier that evening and went on with friends to birthday party held in the Aurelian Club in the sandstone building dominated by Sterling Tower, a campus landmark.
The party ended at 1 A.M., and Mr. Prince's friends headed off to get pizza. He declined. He had lacrosse practice in the morning.
He walked east toward his apartment three blocks away.
 
The Pop of a Gun
 Randy Fleming told the police that James Fleming, the driver of the Nissan, spied a man walking alone on Hillhouse, a block from the official residence of the Yale president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr. He stopped the car, got out with a pistol, and demanded the man's wallet.
Randy Fleming testified that the man handed over his wallet without resistance and that James Fleming pistol-whipped him across the forehead, saying aloud, "I ought to shoot this cracker." The next thing he heard, Randy Fleming recalled, was the pop of a gun. The time, the police estimated, was 1:10.
Several minutes later a student on her way to the Yale Health Center at 17 Hillhouse saw a man lying on his back, his arms spread out, at the base of the steps to St. Mary's Church, like a religious supplicant. It was Mr. Prince.
He was declared dead at 2:05, a single bullet having pierced his heart.
Across the street from the church the police found his wallet on the ground. It still contained $46 and credit cards. Apparently his killer had dropped it in the dash to get away.
 
The Present
Anger at Possibility Race Was Motive
 Ted Prince did what he felt he had to do. Within weeks he was on Capitol Hill testifying in favor of the Brady bill, which seeks to set a waiting period for anyone purchasing a gun. Fifteen months after he testified, the bill is still not passed.
Sally Prince, who for years did volunteer work in Washington's inner city before she felt it was too unsafe to continue, sought vainly for a positive outlet for her grief. But the size of America's social ills defeats her.
"I am not going to make an enormous difference," she ruefully concluded.
Everyone struggled to hold back anger. In their minds the crime was a wanton act that reinforced the maxims of wary city dwellers who must calculate safe passages through nighttime streets, chancing "being in the wrong place at the wrong time" against the daily demands of active lives.
 
Haunting Question of Bias
 Jackie Prince, Christian's sister, gave voice to the question that haunted everyone. "What went through the mind of the person when he decided to pull the trigger," she asked. "Was it because they were from worlds set so far apart? Was it impulsive? Drugs? Bravado?"
What no one could accept was the suspicion that Christian Prince had walked blindly into not just a robbery but a situation that had all the earmarks of a bias crime -- that Mr. Prince had become a victim because he was white.
"Of all the elements in this tragedy this was the most troubling," Mr. Deas said. "In all our private talks about race, public schools, social programs and effective ways to bring about change, there was never anything but sympathy for the underprivileged in Christian's mind."
The Prince investigation proceeded slowly until Randy Fleming was arrested in May 1991 on an unrelated matter and told the police, in a 20-minute taped statement, which he later recanted, that he had witnessed the crime and that James Fleming spoke the lacerating words, "I ought to shoot this cracker." Mr. Fleming's lawyer argued at the trial that had the statement been uttered at all, Randy Fleming would have been too far away to hear it distinctly.
James Fleming, who had been arrested in March 1991 on an unrelated car theft and referred to a drug program, was taken into custody May 16, a day coincidentially when the fifth black homicide victim in nine days was shot to death in the city. Randy Fleming's refusal at last month's trial to cooperate as a prosecution witness plus the inability to conclusively match the damaged slug that killed Mr. Prince with a .22-caliber pistol linked by testimony to the defendant, weakened the prosecution's case.
 
Street With No Summer Break
 Since the trial ended, the Yale campus has settled into its light summer schedule. Most of the students are traveling, working or engaged in some other pursuit until the fall.
The streets and corners of Newhallville, Dixwell and the Hill know no summer break. The bar at the Oasis Lounge is crowded with bodies and the thump of rap music urging street justice. The juke joints and pool halls and danger zones like the Mudhole are knotted with young men with no work to do, going nowhere and not quite knowing where to place the blame.
The sentencing of James Fleming, who faces a maximum of 20 years, is set for July 17 on the conviction of conspiracy to rob. His retrial on murder and robbery charges will probably not start until late this year. His father will be there.
But Ted Prince is unsure he can bring himself to return to New Haven, to walk in the shadows of Yale's spires and turrets, and to hear once again the facts of his son's death.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Excerpts From Interview With Clinton on Goals for Presidency

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., June 25

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview with Gov. Bill Clinton in the Governor's Mansion here on Thursday. The questioners were R. W. Apple Jr., B. Drummond Ayres Jr., Thomas L. Friedman, Steven Greenhouse and Gwen Ifill of The New York Times. Some questions have been edited or paraphrased because of space limitations. 
 Q. You're about to be nominated by the Democratic Party. Since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson left office under fire because of the Vietnam War, the Democratic Party has not nominated a candidate who has managed to attract and sustain a large following in this country. Only one has won, and he became fairly unpopular fairly quickly. I wonder if you could summarize for us how you think you are different from that string of people and how you hope to tell the American people that you're different.
GOVERNOR CLINTON: The Democrats have had a lot of trouble.
First of all, why they've had trouble. I think it's obvious what happened in 1968. But since then, the American people, or at least the majority of them, have had questions about whether the Democrats were strong enough to manage the economy at home, stick up for the interests of the country abroad and articulate the broad public interest rather than a collection of particular interests.
The American people have voted for Republican Presidents and Democratic Congresses, a situation which has given us gridlock and quadrupled the debt and undermined our investments and our economic potential. But I think largely on something like this, you know: "Republicans would be better Presidents because they manage the economy better, keep taxes low, stick up for the country abroad, but the Congress should be Democratic because they care more about the people that really need help."
What I have tried to do during this campaign, and before through my work with the Democratic Leadership Council, is to articulate a new approach for the Democrats that goes beyond where both parties have been, one that emphasizes a commitment to strong economic growth and opportunity, one that recognizes the importance of citizens' assuming more responsibility in certain critical areas, moving from welfare to work, strong child-support enforcement, changes in the nature of the American workplace and the nature of the American schools. Changes in the behavior of our corporate executives, up and down the line. And one that was unabashedly pro-growth and for rebuilding in America a sense of American strength based on mainstream values.
I have also been a Governor, not a member of Congress, so that I have shown the ability to stand up to and contend with entrenched forces, to make tough budget decisions and to bring people together in new and nonconventional partnerships to make progress. . . .
I think the Democrats have allowed themselves to be put in a very narrow box by making false choices. I think you can be pro-business and pro-labor. I think you can be pro-growth and pro-environment. I think you can be tough on crime and pro-civil rights.
In order for a Democrat to win, you have to broaden the base of the Democratic Party. You have to be able to do that. You have to prove that you can go beyond the little boxes that have characterized the Democrats for the last 20-plus years.
 
The National Mood
 Q. There is evidence that the common sense of civility and community in this country is on the point of breaking down: the riots, the low voting pattern, the crime rates, the sense of disengagement of many people who would normally be leaders or the sense of isolation and hopelessness of many on the bottom. Are we dangerously close to having a breakdown in the commonweal, and if so, what would you do to alter that?
A. I'm always uncomfortable being a predicter of doom, but I think we're in real trouble. I think our society is coming apart when it desperately needs to be coming together. You can see it in rising crime rates; you can see it in the increasing amount of violence among our young people. And you can see it in declining participation in elections. You can see it in the number of people who themselves decline to participate by running. You can see it in the profound skepticism, bordering on cynicism, of voters who really just don't -- or citizens who just don't -- think it makes any sense to vote, or who if they vote basically don't believe their vote will amount to anything, that the system doesn't work.
I think what you have to do about it is, first of all, remind the American people that we've been around for 200 years, that is the longest-lasting democracy, I guess, except for Iceland, in the history of the world.
With all due respect to Iceland, we've got a few more problems. And it's worked because more than half the time people have done the right thing, and here we've produced the leadership we've needed, and we've done what we had to do.
The world has changed, and what is killing us today is not the dimensions of our problems. Although they are quite significant, they are, I believe, in a historic context not as profound as we faced during the Civil War, the Great Depression or the two World Wars.
What is killing us is people no longer believe that they're part of a larger community where they matter, and where they can make a difference. That's why I've taken the unusual step of doing my best and exposing myself to considerable criticism in putting forward this plan and hammering it out.
Roosevelt ran for President on a balanced budget. Kennedy ran for President on getting the country moving again. I've tried to do it in part to break through the wall of cynicism that exists out there. I don't know -- if it were easy to do I'd have done it already. But I do think that people are aching to see America work again, and I think, frankly, a lot of what we're faced with is the product of a long, slow loss of our economic standing, which is of nearly two decades' duration now.
Twelve years of Presidents who've told us that Government was bad, taxes were evil, nothing would ever work, and a system that plainly works only for organized interest groups and people at the top of the totem poll.
Your newspaper has documented it I guess as graphically as any, the fact that in the last decade-plus the top 1 percent of the American people have garnered 60 percent, 70 percent of the economic gains and now control more wealth than the bottom 90 percent for the first time since the 1920's. And I think people just feel there is nothing they can do about that.
So all I can do about it is run, is tell them what they can do about it and tell them what I'm trying to do about it, and trying to engage their ears and their interest. The results so far has been mixed, but I think there's a real shot that we can do it.
 
. . .
 
Middle-Class Tax Cuts
 Q. The economic package that you unveiled last Sunday in Atlanta builds in large part upon some of your previous economic speeches. One place, however, where it makes a significant departure involves middle-class tax cuts. Why did you scale back your plan on middle-class tax cuts?
A. One is, when I originally proposed it in New Hampshire I proposed it as part of a short-term chance to pump up the economy, as part of a series of five or six short-term strategies I thought ought to be taken. And secondly, when I did it, the projected deficit was about $150 billion less than it is now.
Underlying all that was my conviction that there is a great unfairness in our tax system because we lowered taxes on upper-income Americans, whose incomes rose steeply in the 1980's, while we raised taxes on middle-class Americans while their incomes declined.
So what I attempted to do when I revised the program was to merge the middle-class tax cut at roughly the same size that I proposed in New Hampshire with the children's tax credit recommended by the National Commission on Children, which I had also embraced but recommended for a four-year phase-in. And then let people make a selection: you can have one but not both. You still wind up with the same middle-class tax relief, more or less, as the Congressional bills provided, and the children's tax credit, which will be more helpful to families with children at about half the cost.
I think that is appropriate because I thought we ought to put more money into investment into this economy, and do that without giving up on trying to make some attempt at fairness for the people who basically paid for the bill in the 1980's and got the shaft.
 
. . .
 
The Violence in Sarajevo
 Q. Switching to foreign policy for a second, Governor. In Yugoslavia the Administration finds itself in a dilemma. They've been waiting for a cease-fire in Sarajevo, in order to bring in relief convoys. But it's becoming increasingly apparent that there is going to be no cease-fire, and if you want to bring humanitarian relief to Sarajevo, you're going to have to do it in the middle of a war. Clearly, the Administration is on the horns of that dilemma. Do you go ahead in the middle of a war, or do you wait for a cease-fire that's not going to happen? If you were in the Oval Office now, what would be your recommendation?
A. My recommendation would be to try to get some U.N. agreement about how to open the airport, and whether to go in with an armed force to keep the airport open or to go in with an announcement that the United Nations is going in to open the airport, to bring in humanitarian supplies, and that if any action was taken, multilateral military support would follow. I think I would be for those two options.
Q. You would be ready to participate in a multilateral military operation that could conceivably have to go into Sarajevo to open the airport, to shoot its way in?
A. Yes.
 
. . .
 
America After the Cold War
 Q. What is your post-cold-war vision of America's role in the world?
A. I don't know if there will be a new world order, but there ought to be some new world principles. I think, I feel, that for the first time in my lifetime, because of the collapse of the Soviet empire, and the Soviet Union itself, that it is more possible for us than ever before to be more consistent in the advocacy of freedom and democracy and human rights, and global economic growth based on market principles, than ever before.
And I think, my own view, is that one of the things that has gotten the President in trouble is that while at various junctures he and I have agreed, and I thought he had good instincts in a particular crisis -- I supported Desert Storm, for example -- I think there is an inconsistency in a lot of his actions because of the pull between the impulse, the deep American impulse to support freedom and democracy, and his own preference for stability in his relationships with foreign leaders in a given area. So that perhaps, not perhaps, we ended Desert Storm before we spent another day to destroy 700 tanks and a substantial portion of the Republican Guard, and then left the Kurds and the Shiites twisting.
We had a very tepid response to Tiananmen Square, and then restored most-favored-nation status without requiring any meaningful concessions on human rights in China. We supported, laudably, the O.A.S. embargo of Haiti but were too quick to characterize the Haitians as economic rather than political refugees.
My view would be that the world is not so orderly as it once was, and that gives us some pause. If you've got Iraq, Iran, North Korea, these other countries trying to become nuclear powers, we should do all in our power to stop that, and to keep big, bad things from happening.
But in the absence of that, what we ought to do is to do what we can, whether it's in South Africa, the Middle East or Asia, to promote the things we believe in: freedom and democracy and human rights and market economics and global growth.
 
. . .
 
The First 100 Days
 Q. You set forward a pretty ambitious plan, not only economic plans but just in general, for what you would want to do your first 100 days in office. How do you put priorities on what you can actually get accomplished in the first 100 days?<HE>
A. First, I think you have to pass the economic reform package, which includes incentives for private investment, increased public investment and the education initiatives. Then I want to try to pass the health-care package, with rigorous health-care cost controls and a basic package of affordable health care for all Americans. I think if you don't do those things, it's going to be difficult to recover our economic growth and to control the budget deficit.
And I realize that's fairly daunting, but we have had bursts of activity in the first 100 days of Presidencies before, in times of national emergencies, and I think that people perceive this as a time of crisis, when we need to make a real turn in what we're doing.
And my belief is we can do it if the people decide to elect me because I'm running on it. That is, the reason I've gone to the trouble of trying to lay out my priorities in real detail is so that we can not only give the American people a referendum on it but send a message to Congress that it's O.K. to do this, that this is what the American people want, that they're ready to take this kind of a stand and to take this kind of action.
And in a more simple way, but equally effective, that's what Reagan did in 1980.
 
. . .
 Q. As part of your plan for changing the way the Federal Government deals with welfare, you talk about leaving people on welfare for two years tops, and then cutting them if they are able to get a job. What if the economy doesn't allow -- for some reason all your growth plans don't take hold, there aren't a lot of jobs out there and Congress, or someone, is pressuring you to provide extentions, exceptions, to the rule. How does a program like that work?
A. My argument will be that we should have a network of community-service employment, that it ought to be part of this whole national service movement that I'm trying to create, and that four years from now there'll still be a lot of work that needs to be done in communities throughout the country that can be done by people who will move from welfare to a public service-related job like working in day care centers, for example, or other community-related work. . . .
That will make the notion of welfare as a second chance, not a way of life, a reality. If you don't create an undergirding of public-service jobs, community-service jobs, you won't be able to do it.
 
Bringing About Change
 Q. You put considerable emphasis on what you want to do by way of changing the culture of Washington that has existed since the New Deal: the idea that more employees are better, that new programs require new departments, that spending is the most logical solution to problems. Quite a number of Presidents have come to Washington and said we have to reverse this. The people in these entrenched institutions will say,  "We've heard all this before?" How are you going to go after them, what do you have in store for them?
A. . . . We have got to engage the American Government in the same sort of restructuring -- or perestroika, if you will -- that a lot of private companies have been going through for the last 10 years. They did it because they had no choice, they were in the global economy. . . .
And let me make one little point on that. Productivity growth in America is quite low compared to Germany and Japan. In manufacturing, it's actually pretty brisk, it's about 4 percent a year. So in the services and in Government, it's very low. We still have more Government employees per capita at the national level in America than German and Japan and Great Britain, even though we have a more active local government system through states and localities than they do.
That gives you an idea of how basically we have not kept up in the productivity curve. And I'm going to make it a general argument that we have to be productive in Government, we need to invest more and consume less of tax dollars, and that here is a specific agenda. And I know that it hasn't worked in times past, but I think partly the times may not have been right. I think this is a better time now.
 
. . .
 
Cutting Entitlement Programs
 Q. One of the questions many people have about your economics plan is that it fails to say how much money would be saved by cutting entitlements. Many people say that the heart of the deficit problem is spiraling entitlement costs, especially Medicare and Medicaid. How much money do you think you could save through changing the programs? And how would you change them? 
A. Well, I say, in outline at least, in my plan how I would change them. But the reason I didn't put those numbers in there is that I assume that the money we save in reforming the Medicare and Medicaid system will be approximately what would be needed to pay for the Government's part of providing the basic package of health care to uninsured Americans. And we are working on those numbers now, so I, you know, explicitly left that out.
Let me back up just a minute, if I may, if we could just discuss the entitlements issue, because I do think that the people are concerned about -- they are right to be concerned about it -- the entitlements are driving the deficit. But most people have the wrong prescription for it. That is, most people think that the thing that would fix the entitlements is to subject more Social Security income to taxation and to raise the costs of Medicare to upper-income people. When we ran any conceivable set of numbers on that is very modest revenues. The next big chunk of the entitlements is the growth of poverty in the 80's.
Now one of the things we don't have in our numbers that we should have put in that we're trying to work out now is what the impact on entitlements will be with the earned-income tax credit to lift the working poor out of poverty. If you really want people from welfare to work, if you do get the growth and you, by definition, reduce poverty, what will that impact be on the entitlements? That's the second, that's the second-biggest contributor to entitlements.
And the biggest contributor is what you pointed out: it's health-care cost increases. They're being budgeted now at 11, 12 percent a year, more or less indefinitely. What we've got to do is to bring them down, you know, as close to inflation as we can.
I think in order to do it you're going to have to reorganize the entire health-care marketplace. I think you have to do the following things: One, mandate national insurance reform. . . . That is, everybody gets broad-base rating systems, so that no one gets turned down, you don't lose your job -- your health care -- if you change jobs. And there's a broad pool . . . which will eliminate some of the insurers from the market, if Hawaii's experience is any guide.
And two, a basic package of comprehensive benefits that has to be at the core of any private or public package, which will enable you to simplify billing and slash a lot of administrative costs. Only 84 cents on the dollar in America in health insurance goes to health care. . . .
The third thing you have to do is give people strong incentives to be in health networks and organizations that basically enable you to pay for a year and get what you need.
 
. . .
 
Relations With Japan
 Q. As we now enter this post-cold-war era, it seems increasingly obvious that we need a coherent economic, political, diplomatic policy toward Japan to repair what is clearly an increasingly fraying relationship. I wonder if you've given any thought to that question.
A. I think that the United States policy toward Japan should begin with the statement that this may well be our most important bilateral relationship now, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, both positive and negative. That we have serious differences of opinion . . . but that we are two great democracies, the two greatest economic powers along with the emerging unified Europe. And that the world is very much dependent on our having arrangements between the United States, Japan and Europe which promote global growth. So that it would not be in Japan's interest or America's to continually struggle economically. . . .
Then I think we should, the beginning of it should be, try to articulate kind of a comprehensive agreement that we're going to try to work out a shared understanding of our acknowledged relationship, of our respective national security and multinational and multilateral responsibilities, and our responsibilities for the developing world.
 
. . .
 
Foreign-Policy Experience
 Q. Why should I as a voter want to put the management of foreign affairs in the hands of a man who's been nothing more than the Governor of Arkansas?
A. Because the first and most urgent task for us to do is to rebuild our strength here at home, as the Japanese trade mission pointed out as painfully as anything ever could. That if we're not strong at home we can't be strong abroad. The foot-dragging, which I lament, on the Soviet aid package is another evidence of that. If the Congress tries to find a way to justify to its constituents something that America, in my view, plainly ought to do. . . .
So because -- and because I'm -- of the three choices, I am the best, most likely to rebuild America's strength at home and therefore to give us the emotional and political freedom to engage the world. Because as a Governor I have been involved heavily in international economics over the last 10 years, and that is the core of our, our new foreign policy, at least a part of it. Because I have been willing to outline the conditions under which I thought it would be appropriate to use force, and what other things we ought to do. And I have been more detailed on how I think we should proceed in the future even than President Bush and certainly than Mr. Perot.
So for all those reasons, I think I can be trusted to be Commander in Chief.
 
. . .
 
The Perot Factor
 Q. Governor, there has been quite a little dust-up going on with Mr. Perot in the last four or five days. Where do you think this has left Mr. Perot, and what is your situation in relation to it?<HE>
A. I think it's a little soon to be absolutely sure of where it's left him. It's obvious that you're dealing with two guys who really don't like each other, who really, really don't like each other. And it's now become apparent to the public that this goes back some years, at least to 1986, maybe years before. I mean, they've both been Republican insiders since the Nixon years. And so, you know, who knows how far it goes back.
What I've been saying on the stump, and it's about the same as anything I could say to you, is that Bush has complained that Perot has investigated him, and we know that the Republican committee has got, now with the demise of the K.G.B., they've got the best investigative apparatus in the world.
I'm spending my time trying to investigate the problems of the country. . . .

Clinton Seeking Forceful Image As a Leader in Foreign Affairs

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., June 25

 BODY:
In a wide-ranging discussion of the policies he would pursue if elected President, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas supported strong action to help the besieged citizens of Sarajevo, criticized White House inaction on aid to the former Soviet republics and said Japan should be treated as "our most important bilateral relationship now."
Throughout a 90-minute interview at the Governor's Mansion here, Mr. Clinton sought to project himself as a more forceful leader than President Bush in foreign affairs, which is normally regarded as Mr. Bush's strong suit. 
 On domestic matters, Mr. Clinton, who was asked to paint a detailed picture of how he would govern, promised a 100-day legislative blitz intended to solve the problems he has accused Mr. Bush of ignoring.
 
Thinking Through Answers
 Mr. Clinton said he would propose an economic package that would increase financing for education and job training and emphasize tax breaks for business investment, research and development. He also said he would introduce health-care legislation to impose cost controls on hospitals and other providers and require universal insurance coverage.
Seated in a straight-backed chair, pausing to frame his answers and speaking in an introspective manner that captured both the accumulated frustration of a long campaign and the optimism that has at times rescued his Presidential bid, Mr. Clinton acknowledged the challenge of the general election tasks ahead. [Excerpts, page 17.]
"In order for a Democrat to win, you have to broaden the base of the Democratic party," he said. "You have to be able to do that. You have to prove that you can go beyond the little boxes that have characterized the Democrats for the last 20-plus years."
Mr. Clinton conceded the immensity of the task before him as he seeks to recover from the deep wounds of the primary campaign. But after a two-week stretch in which the spotlight of scrutiny turned to Ross Perot, Mr. Clinton suggested he now sensed an opening for the message he has been trying to deliver.
His fate, Mr. Clinton said, depended on his ability to overcome the fact that "people just feel there is nothing they can do" about the country's problems.
"So all I can do about it is run, is tell them what they can do about it and tell them what I'm trying to do about it, and trying to engage their ears and their interest," he said. "The result so far has been mixed, but I think there's a real shot that we can do it."
 
The Question of Trust
 Mr. Clinton, who will formally accept his party's nomination at the New York convention that starts July 13, outlined an election campaign designed to present him as a leader who would be more knowledgable than Mr. Perot, his likely independent challenger, and more engaged than Mr. Bush.
"I have been more detailed on how I think we should proceed in the future even than President Bush and certainly than Mr. Perot," he said. "So for all those reasons, I think I can be trusted to be Commander in Chief."
In providing a critique of Mr. Bush's foreign policy, Mr. Clinton said he would, if necessary, use military force, in concert with other nations, to bring humanitarian aid to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Mr. Bush "may have been a little slow on the uptake" in responding to the disintegration of Yugoslavia, Mr. Clinton said. But the United Nations should be consulted, he added, before multilateral military action is used to reopen the airport at Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.
He also said the President had engaged in "foot dragging" on providing aid to the republics of the former Soviet Union and said Mr. Bush was wrong to link loan guarantees for Israel to freezing the building of Jewish settlements on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
 
'Inconsistency' in Bush
 Extending his critique to other areas of foreign policy, Mr. Clinton said the White House had been too cozy with China and too harsh in its treatment of Haitian refugees.
"I think there is an inconsistency in a lot of his actions," Mr. Clinton said of Mr. Bush, "because of the pull between the impulse, the deep American impulse, to support freedom and democracy and his own preference for stability in his relationships with foreign leaders in a given area." .
The Governor advocated closer ties with Japan and repeated his criticism of the President's foreign trade mission there last year, which he described as "perfectly absurd" because corporate executives whom Mr. Bush took with him were seeking only concessions from Japan.
 
Emphasis on Japan
 Acknowledging what he described as "serious differences of opinion between us about what constitutes fair and free trade," Mr. Clinton said the collapse of the Soviet Union had changed the diplomatic equation between Japan and the United States.
"It would not be in Japan's interest for America to continually struggle economically," he said. "It's not in Japan's interest for America to have 10 more years in which most Americans work harder for lower pay. It is in Japan's interest for this not to be a zero-sum game.
"I think that we ought to begin by saying this is an important bilateral relationship, perhaps our most important one. And we want it to work. And in order for it to work, both parties have to benefit."
Mr. Clinton spoke of an altered American relationship with other nations that would be based on strengthening the United States economy through job training, education financing, tax breaks for investment and a smaller military.
Only such a concerted economic effort at home, he said, will build confidence abroad.
 
A 'Fairly Daunting' Agenda
 He said he expected to accomplish his goals in part by relying on party loyalties to break the deadlocks between a Republican White House and a Democratically controlled Congress.
"I realize that's fairly daunting," he said of his plan. "But we have had bursts of activity in the first 100 days of Presidencies before, in times of national emergencies, and I think that people perceive this as a time of crisis, when we need to make a real turn in what we're doing."
Mr. Clinton said he expected that a revamped Congress, chastened and restructured by retirements and election defeats, would be willing to work quickly to enact his proposals. Mr. Bush and Mr. Perot, he said, would not be able to accomplish as much as quickly.
"Of the three choices, I am the best, most likely, to rebuild America's strength at home and therefore to give us the emotional and political freedom to engage the world," said Mr. Clinton, who has been searching for ways to prove that a Governor from a small state is equipped to handle global concerns.
"You know, if you look at the number of incumbents that are being defeated, that are retiring this year, I think that the key is whether Congress will be committed to working with the President," he said. "I do not believe that the permanent Government will resist the reforms if Congress and the President are in harness.
"I think it depends on having a Congress that's in sync with the mood of the people out in the country and that responds to the results of the election."
 
What Americans Want
 Mr. Clinton acknowledged that his challenge for the general election was to demonstrate to American voters that Democrats "were strong enough to manage the economy at home, stick up for the interests of the country abroad and articulate the broad public interest rather than a collection of particular interests."
"I think there is a yearning out there to have something that works again," he said. "You can see that in the Perot boom, which I hope is a boomlet."
Mr. Clinton has largely resisted attacking Mr. Perot and left squabbling about the Texan's background and exposition of his record to Republicans and the press.
Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Perot, the Governor said, have "been Republican insiders since the Nixon years."
Left on the sidelines in their growing war, Mr. Clinton has polished an argument that he, not Mr. Perot, could best manage the Government.
"I'm going to run this just the way the best companies do," he said. "We're not going to fire anybody. We're going to reduce Government by attrition."
Government employees, he maintained, "like a good shot in the arm every few years."
Mr. Clinton defended his optimistic budget projections, saying he intentionally did not include potential savings that could be derived from cost controls on the health-care industry and from economic growth.
He said economists and others were "right to be concerned" about the amount of the budget deficit that is caused by the rising cost of spending for guaranteed benefits programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
But he said that cutting the availability of those benefits was not necessarily the best way to rein in such costs. Advocates for the elderly, in particular, have objected to any proposals that would cut such entitlement spending.
"The entitlements are driving the deficit," Mr. Clinton said. "But most people have the wrong prescription for it."
 
Health Costs and Economy
 He said deficit-cutters should look instead to the source of the problem: the growth in poverty that forced more people to become dependent on the Government's social safety net.
"If you don't believe we can bring health costs in line with inflation, or at least pretty close to it, then a lot of what I'm proposing doesn't hang together," he said. "If you do believe it, it is the central key to getting control of the Government deficit and bringing about the billions of dollars in the private sector for reinvestment."
Mr. Clinton indicated he had left room for compromise on several of his other economic proposals, including his plan to create a $200 billion fund for rail, highway and bridge improvements.
He said he would not proceed with the rebuilding plan, which would be paid for in part with $115 billion in new and higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, unless he could win Congressional approval for the tax increases.
"Would I do it totally through deficit financing?" he asked. "No."
Mr. Clinton said he would stand by the budget estimates that his staff devised for his proposal to increase taxes for the richest 2 percent of taxpayers.
He said he was convinced that his detailed plans would persuade voters that he should take over the reins from President Bush.
"What is killing us is people no longer believe that they're part of a larger community where they matter, and where they can make a difference," Mr. Clinton said. "That's why I've taken the unusual step of doing my best and exposing myself to considerable criticism in putting forward this plan and hammering it out.
"Roosevelt ran for President on a balanced budget," he said. "Kennedy ran for President on getting the country moving again. I've tried to do it, in part, to break throught the wall of cynicism that exists out there."
Mr. Clinton, some of the hoarseness from persistent allergies returning to color his voice, paused.
"I don't know," he said. "If it were easy, I'd have done it already."

HEADLINE: Focus: Spring Island, S.C.;
Development With an Environmental Bent

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

DATELINE: SPRING ISLAND, S.C.

 BODY:
Here among moss-draped live oaks and unspoiled ponds, a new style of island development based on strict environmental standards is being tested, and developers around the nation are watching to see if it succeeds.
"When I came to this island, I knew I had to find a way to spend the rest of my life here," said Jim Chaffin, one of the owners. "Not having $17 million to spend on my personal island, I knew we would have to do some sort of development." 
 Mr. Chaffin said he wanted development to have as little impact as possible on the pristine environment. Thus, he has imposed such restrictions as deep setbacks for homes beside the water, transplanting trees rather than cutting them down, large buffers between houses and streets, small lots and no paved roads. A third of the 3,500-acre island is to be left untouched as a nature preserve.
The state's Beachfront Management Act, which sets strict waterfront setbacks for homes, is being challenged in the United States Supreme Court by a property owner on the Isle of Palms -- north of here and just off the coast of Charleston. Whatever the decision, it would change nothing here because of the tight controls imposed by the owners in their deeds.
"Spring Island represents a marked improvement over some of the other developments on South Carolina islands," said Dana Beach, who as head of the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League is frequently a harsh critic of developers. "There are abysmally few examples of good developments along the coast."
In the last decade, as more and more people have moved at least part-time to seaside houses, the dozens of islands along this state's 187-mile-long coast have undergone massive development. Among them are Hilton Head, which now has 15,000 housing units on 23,000 acres; Kiawah, with 2,000 units on 10,000 acres, and Seabrook, with 1,700 units on 3,000 acres.
Thirty-three major islands lie off the mainland here, with 11 owned by the state or the Federal Government. Of the remaining 22, which are privately owned, five are permanently protected by deed restrictions or conservation easements. The rest are either already developed or slated for some sort of housing development in the next few years.
A host of other islands, like Spring Island, are in the rivers and harbors of the state, and developers are looking at them, too. Spring Island, between the Colleton and the Chechessee Rivers just east of Beaufort, S.C., has been privately owned since 1706. Early owners grew cotton here, while the most recent owners used it as a hunting preserve.
Mr. Chaffin and his longtime business partner, Jim Light, bought the island in 1989 for $17 million. They cut their teeth in development more than two decades ago on Hilton Head Island, a few miles south of here. They moved from there to Snowmass Village, Colo., in 1977, and recently have built housing developments at Semiahmoo, Wash., and on Callawassie Island, a neighbor to Spring. All are typical resort developments and all have made money for the two partners.
But Spring Island is a major risk, the owners say. When they were devising their development plan, Mr. Chaffin and Mr. Light asked eight key developers to visit the island and tell them how it should be developed. The consensus was that it should have at least 3,000 units and three golf courses.
The owners said no. Despite the county government's earlier approval for 5,500 units, the developers said Spring Island would have no more than 500 units and only one golf course designed to follow already existing cornfields.
The previous owners had planted the cornfields to attract wildlife. Anticipating development, they had obtained the approval for 5,500 units.
"People we respect think we're flipping out, that we've gotten too radical," said Mr. Chaffin, who lives on the island with his wife, Betsy, a member of the board of the South Carolina Nature Conservancy and head of the Spring Island Trust, which oversees the nature preserve.
MR. CHAFFIN, 47 years old, was recently elected vice president of the Urban Land Institute, a 14,000-member organization based in Washington that studies land management. Its new executive director, Richard Rosan, said he sees a real and growing interest by developers in applying strict environmental controls.
"This is the 90's," Mr. Rosan said. "The ones in the black hats left in the 80's."
But the bottom line is still money, and the verdict is not in yet on whether there are 500 people willing to pay from $155,000 to more than $1 million for lots of three-quarters of an acre to 10 acres of Spring Island. So far, 80 lots have been sold, at an average price of $300,000.
At the Hilton Head Plantation development, the average price of a lot in the first quarter this year has been $144,000. On Dataw Island, the average has been $129,000 and on Kiawah Island -- which also has tight environmental rules -- it has been $252,000. On Seabrook Island, which is under receivership, it has been $23,000.
Spring Island buyers are doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs and corporate executives. The head of a major national environmental organization, whom Mr. Chaffin declined to identify, has bought a lot here, he said. The average age of the buyers is 47; 30 percent will live here year-round, 40 percent seasonally and the rest will use Spring Island for a second home.
The first two houses are under construction now. Eight more will be begun by early fall. The houses range in size from 3,500 to 12,000 square feet to be spread over several buildings. There is no minimum size for homes, and the developers say they prefer that the houses be small.
"PEOPLE come here not to be seen, but to behold; not to be heard by others but to listen to that special wisdom which only nature and history can impart," said Mr. Chaffin.
When the partners started selling the lots in 1990, they sold 40 immediately, enabling them, with the approval of the Coast Guard and two state agencies, to build a bridge to the island from their own Callawassie Island.
The recession and Persian Gulf War brought business to a virtual halt, although sales have begun to pick up, Mr. Chaffin said. The partners -- Mr. Chaffin and Mr. Light own 20 percent each; Dr. Peter Lamont owns 10 percent and a Japanese company, Nippon Landis, owns 50 percent -- are under no serious financial pressure, thanks to Nippon Landis's infusion of cash, Mr. Chaffin said.
One of Spring Island's drawbacks is that there is no ocean frontage and, therefore, no beach. But it has a wealth of ponds, where a goodly number of alligators live. And the partners are counting on what they perceive to be the public's growing interest in marshes and rivers.
Oceanfront property, Mr. Chaffin said, is overcrowded and he wants Spring Island to be like a camp, with horseback riding, boating, walking, golf and bicycling available. A central dining facility and nature studies by a resident naturalist are provided as well.
"At this point in our careers, we risk not only money but also reputation," said Mr. Chaffin. "If you get too far out in front, you get arrows in your back."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
As Phoenix Opens 5th Season, Names Are Brighter

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
"WE are the exception that tests the rule," said Bram Lewis, the founder and artistic director of the Phoenix Theater Company, which opened its fifth summer season last week. Mr. Lewis was referring to the company's resilience in Westchester, where professional nonprofit theater has so often failed.
"The structures that make nonprofit theaters possible have been under attack," he said, "beginning with a restructured tax code. Given Jesse Helms, who made things uncomfortable with the National Endowment for the Arts. Given the 46 percent the New York State Council on the Arts has cut. Given the most serious recession to hit the country since the 1930's. 
 "All those givens notwithstanding, we've grown in community support, and here we are celebrating our fifth anniversary season."
 
'Morning's at Seven'
 That season began with Tuesday's preview performance, at the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New York here, of "Morning's at Seven," the 1939 comedy by Paul Osborn that was memorably revived on Broadway in 1980. It is directed by Ellis Rabb and is to run through July 12.
An East Coast premiere for a revision of "The Old Boy" by A. R. Gurney is to run from July 15 through Aug. 2. The play was seen at Playwrights Horizons in Manhattan last year with Stephen Collins, who is now directing the Phoenix production, in the title role.
"Twelfth Night," in which Mr. Rabb is scheduled to play Malvolio in Mr. Lewis's staging, and the mythical island of Illyria is transported to South America in the 1840's, concludes the season. It is to run from Aug. 5 through Aug. 23.
Although the Phoenix is, philosophically, all about action and plays, not stars and shows, the inescapable value of names sets this season apart from preceding ones. To those well versed in theater, the roster of actors appearing in these plays is formidable.
In the lineup for the current play are Tom Aldredge, Jacqueline Brooks, Meg Mundy, Josef Sommer, Frances Sternhagen and Richard Woods. Then, Joan Copeland, Maryann Plunkett and Jay Sanders are to be in Mr. Gurney's play. The talent blitz began two weeks ago with a benefit performance of Mr. Gurney's "Love Letters" in which Jason Robards and Elaine Stritch were the readers.
 
'Best and the Brightest'
 For Mr. Rabb, the name Phoenix has a special resonance. In 1960, he founded the Association of Producing Artists of which he was the artistic director for 22 years. From 1964 through 1969, the company was known as A.P.A.-Phoenix, when it formed an association with Manhattan's Phoenix Theater Company -- an inspiration for Mr. Lewis's organization -- and played during those seasons at Broadway's Lyceum Theater.
"If Rabb is here, or a reworked Gurney play is being directed by its original star," Mr. Lewis said, "the theater's best and the brightest will come running in pursuit of excellence and to reinvent a tradition -- of transformation by live theater -- that too many people don't know about."
Although Broadway audiences "are used to the glitz, the shine, the dazzle," Mr. Lewis said, it is the actors' imagination that "for us is the spark."
In its fifth season, the Phoenix is playing in its third theater in Westchester. The company had three summers of rotating repertory at the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry. Last season, it moved to the 300-seat Abbot Kaplan at the Performing Arts Center, and the repertory, which had included classical and new works, became popularly oriented. The plays were not performed in alternation.
 
477 Seats to Fill
 Now the Kaplan Theater, a flexible "black box" space, is to be used for a series of experimental plays to be presented by the Phoenix later in the season. The major works are being staged in Theater B -- "a more sophisticated space," Mr. Lewis said, and a larger one, with 477 seats.
"We set ourselves up as a rotating repertory theater, and we hope we'll have the money to get back to that artistically ideal format," he said. "But we can't keep such actors here for 15 weeks at the laughable developmental theater salaries we're paying."
Mr. Lewis added: "Half of our original gang went off to make names and careers in Los Angeles. I bless them and miss them. Michael Patrick King has been discovered. He wrote five episodes of 'Murphy Brown' last season. And Peter Francis James and Harriet Harris have been appearing widely in theaters all over."
After the move from Dobbs Ferry to Purchase, "we lost half of our subscribers," Mr. Lewis said. "But then we gained others and came out even. And now we're gaining more."
He said the group started out to prove that Westchester could be hospitable to professional theater and is now proving "that Westchester is the place for important talent to come and work."
"Westchester has 19 symphony and chamber orchestras and 3 world-class museums," Mr. Lewis said. "We are establishing ourselves as another cultural linchpin in a community that can now find excellence in theatrical terms. We're finding our audiences -- and our angels. It's a challenge to convince them that we're going to stick around."

HEADLINE: Flexible Hours: A Tool to Keep Employees

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
FOR four days a week -- Mondays through Thursdays -- Caron Palder arrives at her office at Nynex corporate headquarters in White Plains shortly before 7:15 A.M. She takes a half hour for lunch and leaves for home in Stamford at 4:30 P.M. On Thursdays, she leaves at noon and works at home for the rest of the day. On Fridays, she is off and stays at home.
Ms. Palder, a manager in the Nynex corporate human resources department, said she chose a compressed 35-hour workweek in order to spend more time with her 2 1/2-year-old son, William. 
 "I would hate to miss his toddler years," said Ms. Palder, who is 35 years old. "That way I can be with him for half the week, which is good. Nynex's flexible work plan has made it possible for me to combine two important facets of my life, work and home."
 
Countering a Downturn
 Nynex, one of several major Westchester corporations that use work schedules, inherited its family-friendly policies from its Bell parent, said R. Michelle Green, who is the director of work/family initiatives. And during this recession, Nynex is increasing, not decreasing, these efforts to reduce the effects of the economic downturn.
"It is in our best interests to retain our employees," Ms. Green said. "Training new workers is a very expensive proposition. The flexible policies are also a good recruiting tool. They have made us known to the world as a company of choice, which means that prospective employees hear about us by word of mouth and seek us out."
Work-family policies have expanded or remained stable during the current recession, according to a survey by the Conference Board, a business research group based in Manhattan, which polled 138 organizations that deal with work issues.
 
Increased Productivity
 Nynex recognizes that the work force is changing, Ms. Green said. "There are more men and women working. There are more single parents, and there are more families in which both the husbands and wives work," she said. "We want to make it easier for them to work at Nynex and harder for them to leave."
The bottom line, she said, is that flexible scheduling not only attracts and keeps the best workers but also increases productivity significantly. Toward that end, Nynex, with the cooperation of its two unions -- the Communication Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers -- recently contributed $6 million to a fund to increase the supply and quality of child care and the care of the elderly in communities where Nynex employees live and work.
"The company has 85,000 employees in the Northeast," Ms. Green said. "Obviously, we have too many work sites to have child-care centers at each one. So what we do is make investments in existing facilities that are recommended to us by our employees."
The method, she explained, is that employees make formal applications for grants, and those agencies deemed to offer the most benefit get financing.
Paradoxically, while it is in the process of reducing its work force, I.B.M., at its corporate headquarters in Armonk, is in the middle of expanding several family programs.
"It's part of our long-term strategy to keep our valued employees," said John C. Childs Jr., director of the program of work-force diversity at I.B.M. in Purchase.
 
Optional Schedules Available
 "Over the last 10 years we have developed work-life programs to help employees come to work and let them work with a minimum of distractions that are brought on by family problems," he said. "In 1984, for example, we were the first company to make child-care referral service available for employees."
Last year, Mr. Childs said, flexible working hours at I.B.M. were extended to a four-hour period. "What it means is that on either side of our normal work day, which is from 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M., our people have the option of working from either 6:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. or from 10:30 A.M. to 6:30 P.M.," Mr. Childs said.
"And we've extended our meal break, which means employees can take up to two hours for lunch. Some people use the time to visit an elderly relative or attend a child's school play, for example, or others choose to work out in a gym. They have to clear the time with their department manager, and it has to be made up the same day."
At Nynex, employees arrange flexible scheduling of work hours through their department heads. "We act as a clearinghouse for information on flexible scheduling," Ms. Green said. "Employees come to us with questions like, 'How do I approach my boss?' 'Will this harm my career?' We make clear to them that it is not seen as a negative occurrence."
Peter Benson, a manager of human resources at Nynex corporate headquarters, said that he not only makes other employees aware of the different facets of the program but also understands it firsthand, having participated in it himself for several years. By exercising his option to make his working hours 7:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M., Mr. Benson said, he is able to accomplish much more on the job.
"It has been an advantage to get to the office early, before the telephones start ringing," Mr. Benson said. "I find I can get a lot of work done in that period. And when necessary, I can stay later than 3:30 in the afternoon without any impact on my home life."
Mr. Benson, 44, said he chose his schedule to have more time with his two children, who are now 11 and 15. "Personally, it has been a very satisfying arrangement for our family," he said. "I feel I've been able to be a positive influence in my children's growing-up years, which is something it's hard for an absentee father to do.
"Working for a company like Nynex that shows concern for family life means a lot to many people. We have very loyal employees."
Recently, I.B.M. expanded a three-year flexible work leave-of-absence program the company began in 1988, Mr. Childs said. The program allows employees to work part time for three years with full benefits paid by I.B.M. With the expansion of the program they can now continue to work part time by paying some of the benefits costs themselves.
"Several hundred employees have taken advantage of this program," Mr. Childs said. "They include mothers with small children and people who have obligations to care for older family members."
The company has also expanded its work-at-home program, he added, but only employees who have jobs that can be done at home are eligible. An employee in the financial area, for example, can prepare weekly reports at home and file them by computer modem linked to a telephone line. Someone using a word processor can write a training manual at home and keep in touch by computer with people at the office.
"All flexible work programs have to be worked out with department managers," Mr. Childs said.
And although companies with flexible work policies are viewed favorably by employees, it is more than altruism that motivates the companies that install them.
"Of course, employee morale is important to us," Mr. Childs said, "but equally significant is our investment we make in employees. To recruit a skilled person in categories such as a systems engineer, it costs us $12,000 to $14,000. And training will cost an additional $100,000. Is it any wonder we want to retain them?
"As our work force becomes smaller, it is even more important that we retain valuable employees and do what we can to make them even more productive."

Development With an Environmental Bent

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

DATELINE: SPRING ISLAND, S.C.

 BODY:
Here among moss-draped live oaks and unspoiled ponds, a new style of island development based on strict environmental standards is being tested, and developers around the nation are watching to see if it succeeds.
 "When I came to this island, I knew I had to find a way to spend the rest of my life here," said Jim Chaffin, one of the owners. "Not having $17 million to spend on my personal island, I knew we would have to do some sort of development." 
Mr. Chaffin said he wanted development to have as little impact as possible on the pristine environment. Thus, he has imposed such restrictions as deep setbacks for homes beside the water, transplanting trees rather than cutting them down, large buffers between houses and streets, small lots and no paved roads. A third of the 3,500-acre island is to be left untouched as a nature preserve.
 The state's Beachfront Management Act, which sets strict waterfront setbacks for homes, is being challenged in the United States Supreme Court by a property owner on the Isle of Palms -- north of here and just off the coast of Charleston. Whatever the decision, it would change nothing here because of the tight controls imposed by the owners in their deeds.
 "Spring Island represents a marked improvement over some of the other developments on South Carolina islands," said Dana Beach, who as head of the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League is frequently a harsh critic of developers. "There are abysmally few examples of good developments along the coast."
 In the last decade, as more and more people have moved at least part-time to seaside houses, the dozens of islands along this state's 187-mile-long coast have undergone massive development. Among them are Hilton Head, which now has 15,000 housing units on 23,000 acres; Kiawah, with 2,000 units on 10,000 acres, and Seabrook, with 1,700 units on 3,000 acres.
 Thirty-three major islands lie off the mainland here, with 11 owned by the state or the Federal Government. Of the remaining 22, which are privately owned, five are permanently protected by deed restrictions or conservation easements. The rest are either already developed or slated for some sort of housing development in the next few years.
 A host of other islands, like Spring Island, are in the rivers and harbors of the state, and developers are looking at them, too. Spring Island, between the Colleton and the Chechessee Rivers just east of Beaufort, S.C., has been privately owned since 1706. Early owners grew cotton here, while the most recent owners used it as a hunting preserve.
 Mr. Chaffin and his longtime business partner, Jim Light, bought the island in 1989 for $17 million. They cut their teeth in development more than two decades ago on Hilton Head Island, a few miles south of here. They moved from there to Snowmass Village, Colo., in 1977, and recently have built housing developments at Semiahmoo, Wash., and on Callawassie Island, a neighbor to Spring. All are typical resort developments and all have made money for the two partners.
 But Spring Island is a major risk, the owners say. When they were devising their development plan, Mr. Chaffin and Mr. Light asked eight key developers to visit the island and tell them how it should be developed. The consensus was that it should have at least 3,000 units and three golf courses.
 The owners said no. Despite the county government's earlier approval for 5,500 units, the developers said Spring Island would have no more than 500 units and only one golf course designed to follow already existing cornfields.
 The previous owners had planted the cornfields to attract wildlife. Anticipating development, they had obtained the approval for 5,500 units.
 "People we respect think we're flipping out, that we've gotten too radical," said Mr. Chaffin, who lives on the island with his wife, Betsy, a member of the board of the South Carolina Nature Conservancy and head of the Spring Island Trust, which oversees the nature preserve.
 Mr. Chaffin, 47 years old, was recently elected vice president of the Urban Land Institute, a 14,000-member organization based in Washington that studies land management. Its new executive director, Richard Rosan, said he sees a real and growing interest by developers in applying strict environmental controls on their projects.
 "This is the 90's," Mr. Rosan said. "The ones in the black hats left in the 80's."
 But the bottom line is still money, and the verdict is not in yet on whether there are 500 people willing to pay from $155,000 to more than $1 million for lots of three-quarters of an acre to 10 acres of Spring Island. So far, 80 lots have been sold, at an average price of $300,000.
 At the Hilton Head Plantation development, the average price of a lot in the first quarter this year has been $144,000. On Dataw Island, the average has been $129,000 and on Kiawah Island -- which also has tight environmental rules -- it has been $252,000. On Seabrook Island, which is under receivership, it has been $23,000.
 Spring Island buyers are doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs and corporate executives. The head of a major national environmental organization, whom Mr. Chaffin declined to identify, has bought a lot here, he said. The average age of the buyers is 47; 30 percent will live here year-round, 40 percent seasonally and the rest will use Spring Island for a second home.
 The first two houses are under construction now. Eight more will be begun by early fall. The houses range in size from 3,500 to 12,000 square feet to be spread over several buildings. There is no minimum size for homes, and the developers say they prefer that the houses be small.
 "People come here not to be seen, but to behold; not to be heard by others but to listen to that special wisdom which only nature and history can impart," said Mr. Chaffin.
 When the partners started selling the lots in 1990, they sold 40 immediately, enabling them, with the approval of the Coast Guard and two state agencies, to build a bridge to the island from their own Callawassie Island.
 The recession and the Persian Gulf War brought business to a virtual halt, although sales have begun to pick up, Mr. Chaffin said. The partners -- Mr. Chaffin and Mr. Light own 20 percent each; Dr. Peter Lamont owns 10 percent and a Japanese company, Nippon Landis, owns 50 percent -- are under no serious financial pressure, thanks to the infusion of cash from Nippon Landis, Mr. Chaffin said.
 One of Spring Island's drawbacks is that there is no ocean frontage and, therefore, no beach. But it has a wealth of ponds, where a goodly number of alligators live. And the partners are counting on what they perceive to be the public's growing interest in marshes and rivers.
 Oceanfront property, Mr. Chaffin said, is overcrowded and he wants Spring Island to be like a camp, with horseback riding, boating, walking, golf and bicycling available. A central dining facility and nature studies by a resident naturalist are provided as well.
 "At this point in our careers, we risk not only money but also reputation," said Mr. Chaffin. "If you get too far out in front, you get arrows in your back."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 28, 1992, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 28 about development on Spring Island, S.C., misstated the financial condition of Seabrook Island, 45 miles to the north, and the cost of its lots. The island's homeowners' association is not in receivership. The first-quarter average price of its lots was $76,000, not $23,000.

WOMAN OF VALOR
Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control
Movement in America.
By Ellen Chesler.
Illustrated. 639 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $27.50. 
 Ellen Chesler, in "Woman of Valor," brilliantly reveals and revitalizes Margaret Sanger in the context of the tempestuous public battles for birth control that she waged through the first half of this century. Sanger once remarked to a lover that she was "not a peaceful or restful person to know at all." Ms. Chesler has come to know her about as well as anyone could at this distance from her life -- she died in 1966 -- by interviewing friends, associates and relatives and by exploring a vast body of published and unpublished material, ranging from sizable caches of private papers to her file at the Department of Justice. The letters and diaries expose a great deal about Margaret Sanger that she did not want the public to learn during her lifetime, but that, as Ms. Chesler notes, she apparently wished history to see.
Ms. Chesler is an independent scholar whose many years of work on this biography were interrupted by extended service as chief of staff to former New York City Council President Carol Bellamy. She brings a keen sense of political nuance to the conflicts that surround issues of reproductive rights. She approaches her subject with critical sympathy and informed psychological insight. "Woman of Valor" is at once richly detailed and capaciously conceived -- authoritative, readable and rippling with the energy of the life it conveys.
Margaret Sanger, nee Higgins, grew up in Corning, N.Y., in an Irish-American family in which, Ms. Chesler contends, "one parent taught her to defy, the other to comport." The teacher of defiance was her father, Michael Higgins, a ne'er-do-well stonecutter who was an apostate Roman Catholic, militant freethinker, labor-rights advocate and social pariah. The model of comportment was her mother, who remained pious throughout her life, bearing 11 children and dying, worn out, at the age of 50.
MARGARET HIGGINS went to New York City to study nursing, and there, in 1902, she met and married William Sanger, a handsome young architect and aspiring painter. The product of an observant Jewish family, he was, like his new wife, a Socialist and a rebel against religious orthodoxy. In 1910, having been driven out of a suburban house following financial reverses, the Sangers returned to Manhattan, short on cash and with three young children to support. While Margaret Sanger worked as a visiting nurse and midwife, the couple got involved in the Socialist Party and with many of the day's radical reformers, including William (Big Bill) Haywood, the head of the Industrial Workers of the World, and the anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman.
Ms. Chesler emphasizes that Margaret Sanger's conversion to the cause of contraception owed a great deal to Goldman, who for some years had been insisting that much of the solution to what European Socialists called "the woman question" lay in birth control. Emancipated from the reproductive consequence of sex, Goldman reasoned, women would be freed from repressive forms of marriage and motherhood, liberated to realize themselves sexually and spiritually. Emma Goldman's doctrines moved Sanger toward an increasing impatience with the attitudes of male Socialists like Haywood, who spoke of an economic commonwealth where women could have "all the babies they pleased," and against the indifference of most radicals to Socialism's call for women "to revolt from sex slavery."
Sanger's sexually radical thinking was reinforced by her midwifery, which brought her into contact with impoverished women who resorted to self-induced abortions, risking death to end pregnancies that they did not know how to prevent. In 1914, Sanger began publishing a periodical entitled The Woman Rebel, declaring that women were enslaved by "sex conventions," "motherhood," and "middle-class morality" and promising that she would provide information on contraception to help emancipate them.
In August 1914, she was arrested and charged with violations of the Federal Comstock laws, which prohibited the dissemination of obscene materials, and -- since an article in her magazine had discussed political assassinations -- with incitement to murder. She fled to Europe to avoid prosecution, returning in 1915 as the public debate on the issue of birth control was mounting rapidly. In February 1916, after much of what she had published about contraception was now common magazine fare, all charges against her were dropped. Suddenly she was famous.
Sanger adjusted rapidly to celebrity, shedding her radical rhetoric to promulgate the doctrine of birth control as a means to achieve both sex without fear and social transformation through lowered birth rates, without class warfare. In 1916, she established the first birth control clinic in the United States in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, advertising the facility in handbills written in English, Yiddish and Italian. During the early 1920's, she began publishing The Birth Control Review and organized the American Birth Control League. She fought opposition to birth control with persistence and flair. In 1929, when civic authorities forbade her to speak in Boston's Ford Hall, she stood silent on the stage, her mouth taped shut, while the Harvard University historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr. read her prepared statement.
All the while, in her private life she remained a rebel in both deed and belief, unwilling to repeat her mother's subordination or to let any man define her, least of all William Sanger, whose Socialist convictions regarding women stopped short even of Haywood's. She marched away from her marriage into multiple romances -- her numerous lovers included Havelock Ellis and H. G. Wells -- and sexually radical adventures (beds a trois or a quatre) with a circle of friends in England. Divorced from William Sanger in 1921, she confided that she would not remarry, except for money, describing herself as "no fit person for love or home or children or friends or anything which needs attention or consideration."
However, as Ms. Chesler points out, her instinct for comportment remained powerful. In 1922, she married Noah Slee, who was a Union Leaguer, an active Episcopalian 17 years her senior -- and a millionaire. Slee adored her enough to allow her independent life and liaisons, though at times he did so with considerable irritation. The marriage provided Margaret Sanger with the trappings of opulence, a financial angel for her activism and a respectability that was useful to her campaign.
Noah Slee was the largest individual supporter of the American Birth Control League, donating some $50,000 to the group by 1925, at least 10 times more than anyone else. In 1930, he bought a five-story town house for the birth control clinic on West 16th Street in Manhattan. Sanger also courted wealthy women for her cause, writing once that "little can be done without them." She allied herself with eugenicists against religious conservatives, contending that birth control was a powerful tool for limiting the reproduction of the unfit. American eugenicists claimed that a high degree of biologically determined unfitness characterized lower-income and minority groups, including not only people of color but also recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. Margaret Sanger publicly embraced such attitudes at times. However, Ms. Chesler contends that the alliance with eugenicists was principally one of political expediency, a misguided (and ultimately costly) bid for secular support. Weighing the evidence in the public and private record, she concludes that Sanger was neither racist nor anti-Semitic and that her championship of contraception was not primarily intended to check the proliferation of the lower classes.
The principal religious opposition to birth control came from the Roman Catholic Church. Spokesmen for the church hurled vituperations against Sanger and attacked her cause as introducing whoring into married life. Sanger was at first utterly shunned by the Administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt when she urged incorporation of birth control into the burgeoning public health programs of the New Deal (she was later given a serious hearing, thanks in part to the intervention of Eleanor Roosevelt). Ms. Chesler attributes the Administration's arm's-length treatment to its political dependence on -- and consequent fear of -- Catholic voters, and she notes that the birth control wars made Margaret Sanger an increasingly bitter anti-Catholic.
DURING the 1930's, Sanger and her allies lobbied unsuccessfully for Congressional repeal of the Comstock laws. But the courts, Ms. Chesler determines by tracking the cases, were steadily eroding Federal legal obstacles to the distribution of contraceptive information and devices by physicians. Moreover, public opinion polls showed increasing tolerance, even on the part of Catholic women, toward contraception. After World War II, Margaret Sanger busied herself with the issue of international population control until, in the 1950's, she was slowed and increasingly enfeebled by a series of heart attacks. Not only had she become respectable, but so had her cause -- at least in the socially sanitized guise of "family planning," stripped of its original radical aims for the reconstruction of society and the place of women in it.
Several pioneering historical scholars of birth control, writing from the perspective of the 1960's, criticized Sanger for trading social reform and women's public liberation for establishment alliances that merely helped women to enjoy sex without fear of pregnancy. Ellen Chesler vigorously challenges such ideas, contending that Margaret Sanger, wanting women "to have it all," saw birth control as necessary to that end, and pursued a strategy of "political accommodation" to make it widely available. Sanger had to deal with a society that was often conservative and always deeply divided about women's rights and reproductive freedom. In Ms. Chesler's view, Margaret Sanger sought in the birth control campaigns what her private life expressed -- freedom for women to work and to love as they might wish.
 
 
 
NEW TERMS FOR AN OLD DEBATE
 In the early 1970's, when women's studies was still in its infancy, Ellen Chesler was a graduate student in American history at Columbia University in New York. It was during her studies that she saw the need for a reappraisal of Margaret Sanger.
The existing Sanger biography by David M. Kennedy, Ms. Chesler said, argued that "Sanger turned women's concerns back to the personal, and that the personal is not political. I believed that the personal is political; this is the second stage of feminism."
Committed to the reinvestigation of Sanger's life, Ms. Chesler nonetheless interrupted her studies to work in local politics for Carol Bellamy, ultimately becoming Ms. Bellamy's chief of staff after a victorious 1977 New York City Council race. She didn't return to her graduate studies -- or to the biography -- until 1985.
In a telephone interview from her home in Manhattan, Ms. Chesler said that Sanger's work has resonance today, in light of the "family values" debate and the volatile issue of abortion rights. "I'd like to think that Margaret Sanger would get a group of women together in her drawing room to come up with a new term for abortion, as she did for birth control," she said. "They came up with the term 'family planning.' I'd like to think that she would recast the terms of the abortion debate to make a distinction between the first trimester, when 95 percent of abortions are done, and the second or third. She might have looked to Asia, where the evacuations in the first trimester are called menstrual regulation."
And on the future of the women's movement, Ms. Chesler says, "Margaret Sanger saw that history moves in fits and starts. Each generation pushes ahead. There is a tradition of using women for political purposes, a long tradition of making an issue of family values." -- NANCY SHARKEY

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
On the Economy, Bush Followed Reagan's Lead, Not His Success

SERIES: The Bush Record -- Fourth article of a series.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
By most gauges, the economy has performed worse under President Bush than under any other President since World War II.
Economic growth has been slower, more businesses have failed, fewer jobs have been created and the national debt has soared to a record high. 
 The poor have been affected most. One American in 10 is now on food stamps, the highest proportion ever. But the middle class has suffered, too.
The average salaries of college graduates and of managerial and professional workers -- once thought to be immune from the recession cycle -- have been falling since 1989. And for the first time since the Great Depression, there has been no appreciable increase in the number of white-collar jobs. Experts in labor and industry report that the job market for this year's high school and college graduates is the bleakest in memory.
If Mr. Bush does not win re-election, it is safe to say, his handling of the economy will have been the main cause of his undoing.
But the President's advisers say none of this is his fault. Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, blames "structural imbalances" over which Mr. Bush had no control. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady blames Congress for blocking Bush initiatives and the Federal Reserve Board for keeping interest rates too high for too long.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, says the price is finally being paid for the overindulgences of the 1980's, when Mr. Bush was Vice President.
For his part, Mr. Bush said in an interview with The New York Times last week that the recession lasted longer than it should have because Congress refused to go along with his proposals "to selectively stimulate the economy."
Mr. Bush and his observers also say that some of the economic news is actually quite good. Inflation seems to be under control, and short-term interest rates, the province of the Federal Reserve and not the Administration, are now the lowest in 20 years, having been cut time and again to stimulate the economy. The trade deficit has been reduced substantially from its peak in the middle 1980's. And in the last few months, at long last, the overall economy has seemed to be turning slowly around.
"I happen to think the economy is better than most of the people in America think," the President said.
But the political damage has already been done. Whoever's fault the recession was, Mr. Bush appeared slow to recognize the agony the sour economy was causing many Americans. And whatever lies ahead, the public has been unwilling to excuse him and believes he has been indecisive and insensitive.
The latest New York Times/CBS News poll last week showed that only 34 percent of adults approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling his job, and that only 16 percent liked how he was dealing with the economy -- a lower rating than even President Carter got at his worst moment.
That may be because for more than a year, with the economy deteriorating, Mr. Bush seemed detached -- if not without principle, then certainly without program -- and focused almost entirely on foreign policy. He had never prepared the public for bad news. He had never mentioned, for example, that a hangover might follow the high living of the Reagan years, or that cutting the crippling budget deficit would require more than a few painless nips and tucks.
As a consequence, when the hard times hit and when taxes were increased despite his pledge, the public was taken by surprise, and many were left with the impression that the President was not in charge or didn't understand.
 
Intentions
A 'Soft Landing' With No Hands?
 Ronald Reagan led the country through its longest period of peacetime economic expansion, and George Bush promised to pick up where his predecessor left off.
He committed himself to policies that he said would lead to strong growth in the economy and generate 30 million new jobs over the following eight years, twice the number created in the Reagan years. In one of the most memorable lines from any political convention speech, he declared, "Read my lips: no new taxes."
But once in office, rather than working for economic expansion, he accepted the view of his main advisers that he should favor a "soft landing" -- a period of slow growth that would permit an economy overheated from the Reagan years to cool off without crashing into a recession. Such careful calibration proved impossible, and after months of stagnation, the economy actually began to shrink in the summer of 1990.
Then that fall, in perhaps the political turning point of his term, the President agreed to a tax increase as the price for striking a deficit-reduction agreement with Congress.
Through all this, Mr. Bush, an economics major at Yale, often seemed disengaged from economic affairs. His closest advisers say the appearance was deceptive and actually resulted from a deep-seated view that the best role the Government can play in economic matters is to keep its hands off.
John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff until last December, described the Bush philosophy this way in early 1991 in the depths of the recession: "The President feels very strongly that the free-market system operates best when it does not have its hands tied by Government, is not shackled by a system that erroneously thinks it can improve it by command and control."
In the interview, Mr. Bush was asked whether the Government should have been more actively helping American industries that are losing out to those abroad.
"I don't think we ought to have industrial planning," the President replied. "I do not want to see the Government pick winners and losers."
But others in the Administration and elsewhere in the Government say Mr. Bush simply chose to focus on his main interest, foreign affairs, and to leave economic policy to others.
 
Illusions
Debts Come Due From Fat Years
 Looking back, the prevailing view of economists is that the prosperity of the 1980's was somewhat illusory, much of it borrowed from the 1990's. Companies, households and most of all the Federal Government went deeply into debt, and the borrowing was for the most part used to finance day-to-day consumption rather than investments that would pay off in the future. When businesses, households and the Government began paying off their debt in the last few years, the economy began to sag.
What Mr. Boskin calls "structural imbalances" also weakened the economy. Among them were more taxes and less spending by states and localities that must operate with balanced budgets, lower military budgets because of the collapse of Communism, restricted lending because of weak banks and the savings-and-loan disaster. The collapse of the commercial real estate market, in part because of tax-policy swings in the 1980's, also played a role.
Many economists predicted that the Reagan bubble would burst. But if Mr. Bush and his economic advisers recognized these problems in his first years in office, they never let on. The President's public statements about the economy were consistently upbeat. Budgets projected strong economic growth, if not at once then clearly in the near future. Budget deficits were vastly underestimated. The magnitude of the savings-and-loan losses was repeatedly misjudged.
"He was trapped by the Reagan legacy," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, who has worked for several Presidents. "Most Presidents can make changes when they come into office by blaming their predecessor. He couldn't do that."
The President's senior advisers, including Mr. Brady and Mr. Boskin, say even today that they do not know of anything significant they could have done differently. But if promised anonymity, others say that the President dawdled too long without addressing the economy.
 
All Attention Was on Persian Gulf
 "From an economic perspective and I would guess from a political perspective as well," said an Administration official trained in economics, "we would be better off today if Bush had gone to the people early on and said: 'Look, the party's over. We're going to have to tighten our belt now, and things will get better soon.' "
Instead, from early 1989 until the middle of 1990, the economy stagnated. With the President and Congress doing nothing to get a handle on the budget deficit, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unusually high as a hedge against inflation. By the time Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the economy was in recession. But all attention was on the Persian Gulf; the Administration and most outside economists did not immediately spot the turn for the worse.
Meantime, the White House was engaged in a titanic struggle with Congress over the budget. The President insisted on a reduction in the capital-gains tax, a measure Democrats portrayed as a windfall for the wealthy. Democrats demanded higher taxes on the wealthy, a step the White House said would stifle the economy.
The argument raged for weeks. Time and again the President changed course to the point where the term "flip-flop" became a staple of newscasts and editorial cartoons.
In the end, the President lost the fight, substantively and politically. The capital-gains tax remained essentially unchanged. The income tax rate the wealthiest Americans paid was raised to 31 percent from 28 percent at Congress's insistence. And Democrats managed to portray Mr. Bush as the patron of fat cats.
Even with all that, while the overall economy has performed poorly, some of Mr. Bush's policies have received high marks from economists for their boldness.
He addressed the savings-and-loan debacle from his first days in office, pushing through Congress a plan that now shows signs of resolving the worst disaster in public finance since the Great Depression. At some political risk, the President also stuck to a free-trade policy. And the budget agreement, for all the criticism it has received, did hold Federal spending below what it otherwise would have been. It forced Congress to find an offsetting spending reduction or tax increase every time lawmakers wanted to provide more money for some program or other.
But in other areas Mr. Bush declined to take risks. Early last year, for example, he announced that overhauling the country's anachronistic banking system was his chief legislative priority. Yet after sending his proposal to Congress, Mr. Bush never raised a finger on its behalf, and the measure died.
 
Consequences
Defining Moment Of the Worst Kind
 The President understood from the outset that the budget agreement would damage him politically, said Secretary Brady, perhaps Mr. Bush's closest friend. "He said, You know, 'It was nice while it lasted.' "
Two days after he signed the legislation, Mr. Bush told reporters that he regretted breaking his campaign pledge on taxes and that he would never accede to a tax increase again. But politically he never recovered.
In an article in the spring issue of Policy Review magazine, Christopher C. DeMuth, president of the American Enterprise Institute, a public policy research center, explained why the change in tax policy was so politically damaging: "President Bush's reneging on his 'no new taxes' campaign pledge was the bellwether event of his Presidency, comparable to President Reagan's handling of the air traffic controllers' strike in 1981. Both actions had consequences far beyond the issues at hand because they were convincing signals to political allies and foes, bureaucrats and private citizens of how the President would respond to political pressures in a multitude of other circumstances."
Yet the war against Iraq, and the political euphoria that followed, masked for a time the political consequences of the weak economy and the change in tax policy. By the spring of 1991, the recession seemed to have bottomed out, and polls showed the President's popularity rating at stratospheric levels.
Then disaster struck. To the astonishment of the White House, the Federal Reserve Board and almost all private economists, the economic recovery that seemed so promising right after the war ground to a halt as spring turned to summer and summer to fall. The unemployment rate continued to rise.
The nature of this recession had misled economists. In a normal recession, the economy plunges in and then vaults out. This time, the country slithered into recession and is still trying to claw its way out.
Month after month, Mr. Bush shrugged off the economic bad news. But his popularity rating, nearly 90 percent right after the war, went into a nose dive -- into the 80's, then the 70's and so on in the monthly polls, until last month it dropped below 35 percent.
Mr. Bush's casual approach to economic woes reinforced the view being spread by his political opponents that he was out of touch. "The feeling was that everything was out of control, and nobody was doing anything," said Stuart M. Butler, director of domestic and economic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research institute.
 
In Retrospect, Miscalculations
 Mr. Bush's political advisers say he seemed blase about the economy for so long because the people counseling him on the economic situation made two serious misjudgments.
The first was that the raw data they were looking at did not reflect the public's deep concern about the future. Mr. Greenspan, for instance, said the mood in the country was much worse than conditions warranted. "There's a deep-seated concern out there, which I must say to you I have not seen in my lifetime," the Fed chairman told Congress. People, he continued, are worried "about whether the current generation will live as well as the previous one."
The second miscalculation was that the economic advisers did not grasp how this recession was peculiarly damaging to a Republican President. Circumstances were especially severe in the Northeast and California, where the television networks and many of the leading newspapers and magazines are located, so the economy received an unusual level of news coverage. And the people who were struggling were not just blue-collar workers, people who mainly vote Democratic anyway, but managers and professionals, employees of banks, investment firms, military contractors and real estate agencies -- the kind of voters who should be mainstays of the Bush constituency.
On the other hand, Mr. Bush was not prepared to cut taxes or raise spending, the usual responses to recessions, in the face of a budget deficit approaching $400 billion. And those were really the only weapons at his command.
Treasury Secretary Brady argues that the President deserves special credit for not responding irresponsibly in the face of enormous political pressure to break the budget agreement. "I think what you should give Bush credit for," Mr. Brady said, "was his extraordinarily prudent management of the economy."
But what Mr. Brady sees as prudence, others, like Terry Eastland, a Reagan Administration policy strategist who is now writing a book about Presidents and the Presidency, calls timidity.
"Both as a political matter and as a public-policy matter," Mr. Eastland said of Mr. Bush, "a successful President simply must take more risks than he does."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Shaking the Schools; When Perot Took On Texas -- A Special Report.;
Education Initiative Revealed A Savvy and Abrasive Perot

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., June 23

 BODY:
It was a tale of Texan proportions, complete with epic name-calling, massive lobbying and political skulduggery. It was Ross Perot's foray into the turbulent world of education reform -- and it offers a rare chance to examine how he operates in a political arena.
Mr. Perot proved he could learn quickly, sell bold policies to the public and ram them through a reluctant Legislature. But he also showed a taste for attention-grabbing invective that alienated some of the very people whose help he needed to change the state's education system. 
 In 1984, Texas adopted one of the most sweeping education laws in its history, paid for by its first state tax increase in 13 years. Although he must share credit with top state officials, it was Mr. Perot who led the charge. It was he who barnstormed the state in his own jet convening public hearings on Texas's schools. It was his biting one-liners that sold many Texans on the changes. It was his money that paid for one of the biggest lobbying efforts this state capital had ever witnessed.
 
Measure of Leadership
 Mr. Perot touts the $2.8 billion education package as proof that business methods, plain speaking and listening to people are indeed what it takes to forge policies, make changes and lead a nation. The law established a state preschool program for children with disadvantages, shifted school aid from rich to poor districts, reduced class sizes in early grades, toughened academic standards, mandated testing for teachers and raised teachers' salaries but linked raises to performance. And in a state where football reigned supreme, the law required students to pass all their courses or give up extracurricular activities like team sports.
To shake up education in Texas, Mr. Perot used the very methods he says he would apply as President to all national policies: Convene experts; hold extensive public meetings; decide on a policy; and beat back every attempt to compromise it.
Mr. Perot did not answer messages left at his headquarters requesting
comment on his role in the education law.
It is clear that for all Mr. Perot's protestations about the evils of political action committees and political insiders, he knew how to leverage his considerable influence and money to railroad opponents.
"It was like being in a sword fight with a pocket knife," said Eddie Joseph, executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association. The coaches fought Mr. Perot bitterly on the law, along with most Texas teachers unions, the state board of education and several powerful legislators.
It is less certain whether Mr. Perot could have succeeded had he actually been in government. He did not have to worry about angering those whose support might be crucial for re-election. Some of his opponents say his acid tongue and occasional strong-arm tactics alienated many school insiders.
Ridiculing the widespread practice of making coaches principals, for example, Mr. Perot would ask all administrators to stand up during the public hearings he held across the state, recalled Becky Brooks, a teachers union lobbyist. Then he would ask those who were coaches to sit down. Nearly everybody sat, proving Mr. Perot's point, but humiliating coaches and many administrators.
Nor do observers agree on the lasting impact of the education law, although most believe it marked a dramatic step forward for Texas schools.
 
Texas Whirlwind
More Than State Had Bargained For
 The education law that Mr. Perot helped shape and pass sought far-reaching changes. It gave Texas a preschool program for poor and non-English-speaking children. It transformed school finances, the state's first step toward redressing huge gaps in spending between rich and poor school districts.
Teachers received raises, but had to pass a competency test to keep their jobs. The law set maximum class sizes of 22 in early grades and required high-school students to pass a proficiency test to graduate. The infamous "no pass, no play" rule took on some of Texas's most sacred institutions, including football and county fairs, by forbidding students who failed a course to participate in extracurricular activities.
Texas officials had not planned on legislation so sweeping. But Gov. Mark White had promised teachers raises, and he decided he needed an influential businessman to help persuade the Legislature to raise the taxes to pay for them. In June 1983 he asked Mr. Perot to head a Select Committee on Public Education.
 
9-Month Investigation
 Governor White got more than he had bargained for. Mr. Perot set the committee's agenda from the start, plunging it into a nine-month investigation of Texas schools. He paid education experts to testify before his committee, commissioned surveys of Texas teachers, held committee meetings in plush Dallas hotels with catered meals, flew an entourage of about 50 people around the state for public hearings and paid Thomas W. Luce, a prominent attorney and now head of his petition drive, to manage the effort.
Mr. Perot did not like what he found, and he told Texans so in blunt, uncompromising terms. Texas had world-class education in only a few areas, he said: "drill team, band and football." The state would no longer be able to count on oil to stay prosperous; it's children would need solid educations to compete in a high-technology world.
Texans did not care enough about education, he said. Schools spent money on towel warmers and multimillion-dollar stadiums. "Kids who can barely read and write are leaving school at noon to cook hamburgers so they can make payments on their cars," he told audiences. His signature anecdote was a story about the boy who had been absent from school 35 days so that he could exhibit his pet chicken at livestock shows.
But what got people talking was one state icon, Mr. Perot, taking on another: football, a game that defines Friday nights in Texas.
"It was very difficult to tell during the heat of that battle whether he was a hero or Public Enemy No. 1," said George Christian, a lobbyist who later worked for Mr. Perot.
Texans are still divided. Many who worked with him, and even some who fought him on the education bill, said he was a sympathetic listener, an engaging and convincing talker.
 
Visionary or Demagogue?
 Some people complain that he didn't budge in the end. "When he talks about his town meetings, maybe Ross Perot has a vision of how things ought to be settled pre-town meeting, and maybe he uses the town meeting to solidify that," suggested Ms. Brooks, then president-elect of the Texas State Teachers Association, which fought the bill.
Sonia Hernandez, then a high-school principal and president of a grass-roots group working on school-finance issues, remembers a different Perot. After he had angered Hispanic parents by criticizing bilingual education, she asked him to reconsider and visit her school. "A couple of weeks later, I got this phone call out of the blue: Mr. Perot's in his plane, and he's going to land shortly, and he'd like to see what you're talking about." He came, listened and modified his position.
Others, however, saw him as dictatorial, simplistic and inflammatory. His cutting remarks made implacable enemies, like the longtime chairman of the State Board of Education, whose portrait, Mr. Perot once suggested, "may glow in the dark."
He attacked courses such as drivers' education: "That's where they house the assistant coaches who are too dumb to teach regular classes."
Mr. Joseph of the coaches association said, "A lot of it was demagoguery."
Demagoguery or no, Mr. Perot's sound bite transfixed Texans, convincing many that their schools had to change. "That's where he came through, drawing up the final recommendations and selling them," said Camilla Bordie, who worked on the committee. "What was sold was the four or five main thrusts. You can kill the public with details, and he knows better than to do that."
 
Lobbying Tactics
Suffer No Fools, Take No Prisoners
 At the opening of the June 1984 special legislative session convened to consider education reform, it appeared that Mr. Perot's bill was in serious trouble. He had angered many of the state's most powerful political groups: teachers unions, vocational educators, coaches, the State Board of Education and wealthy school districts that feared a drop in state aid.
A member of the State Board of Education hosted a lavish barbecue for legislators at a lakeside retreat, with swimming, water skiing and volleyball. The message got through; a survey of legislators by a Texas newspaper when the session began showed only a few willing to vote for the bill.
In response, Mr. Perot unleashed a massive lobbying effort and drew on his influence in his home state. Mr. Perot loaned five of his own lobbyists and lawyers from Electronic Data Systems, his computer services company, to the effort, sent Mr. Luce to Austin to lead the charge, and hired three of the state's most influential lobbyists. He "hired anybody who was warm," recalled Bill Hobby, then Lieutenant Governor.
 
Inspired a Verse
 Mr. Perot even sent female employees from Electronic Data Systems to talk to legislators and help host parties -- a common practice and master stroke, Ms. Brooks of the teachers association says.
Mr. Hobby commemorated the E.D.S. women in a poem he wrote about the battle:
 
What with taxes and all,
Lobbyists were thick as roaches.
So it took all the Luce women
To win the war against coaches.
Mr. Perot helped forge a new alliance between traditional business groups and the state's growing high-technology industries, which were already demanding an improved education system. In the months before the session, he crisscrossed Texas addressing influential business groups: chambers of commerce, the Houston Board of Realtors, the Texas and Southwest Cattle Raisers Association. He videotaped his speech and sent it to places he did not visit personally.
"Mr. Perot did essentially what Reagan did; he went beyond the system and appealed to the people and sold them on the need for reform," said Jack Vowell, a Republican state legislator from El Paso who opposed the bill. "If pressure came to me to support the movement, it did not come from Mr. Perot; it came from my constituents, who felt like this was a good idea."
In the fight to move the bill through the Legislature, Mr. Perot, or at least the lobbyists he hired, proved to be masterful coalition builders. To pay for the expensive education wish-list, lawmakers would have to raise taxes for the first time in 13 years. Mr. Perot's allies chose to increase gasoline taxes, assuring the help of the powerful highway lobby because most of the tax revenues would be used for roads.
 
All or Nothing
 The same stubborn refusal to compromise that makes some people wary of Mr. Perot proved invaluable in forcing fundamental educational changes after years of failed efforts, veterans of Texas political battles say. He insisted that lawmakers pass all his recommendations or none of them.
"He did not permit the Legislature to cut it up in little pieces," said Craig Foster, executive director of the Equity Center, an association of poor school districts. "It shortcut all the usual nonsense. Leadership is bringing things to closure and getting on with it. That's what Ross Perot does better than anyone I've ever seen."
As influential as Mr. Perot was, he did not single-handedly turn around Texas education. Some of the most important political support and maneuvering came from Governor White, Lieutenant Governor Hobby and Gib Lewis, Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. When the House Education Committee gutted the school bill in a daylong session, Mr. Lewis reportedly threatened to strip the chairman of his post unless he introduced a bill that incorporated Mr. Perot's recommendations.
Mr. Perot got much of the credit for the new law, but it was Governor White who paid a political price. He lost his re-election bid in 1986 -- a defeat he and others attributed to the anger of the powerful teacher unions and the coaches association.
 
A Mixed Legacy
Time Has Dimmed Legislation's Glory
 At the time, the legislation was hailed by education experts as a quantum leap forward for Texas schools. The mid-1980's were a time when sweeping education acts were being enacted by several states, including Arkansas under Gov. Bill Clinton and Tennessee under Gov. Lamar Alexander, now Secretary of Education. Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, which monitors school reform around the country, called Texas's law a "reasonably good example," although he believes that South Carolina's changes were probably the best in the nation.
Yet even eight years later, some of the changes enacted in Texas's schools seem visionary -- particularly in early childhood education, school finance and public attitudes about education.
Texas was ahead of its time in creating a state version of the Federal Head Start program for preschoolers. Educators continue to call for more emphasis on early childhood education, and Ms. Hernandez, now director of education for Gov. Ann W. Richards, says the impact of these programs in Texas has been enormous.
The law overhauled school financing, marking Texas's first real effort to address huge gaps in spending between rich and poor school districts.
Mr. Perot's support for the last two provisions -- whose proponents at the time were generally liberals -- shows his political eclecticism.
And his fighting words forever changed the political landscape in education. "A lot of people in their very own school districts started asking a lot of questions," said Ms. Bordie, who was on the committee staff. "A lot of the reforms that occurred were not the result of the Legislature so much as Perot highlighting the issue and making people pay more attention to what was going on in their own school."
The "no pass, no play" law infuriated many parents who felt that their children were being unfairly penalized, and it spawned a rush of lawsuits. But it also drove coaches to insure that their students got tutoring help, Ms. Hernandez said.
Mr. Perot lost one major battle. He wanted a permanently appointed State Board of Education, reasoning that an elected group would not take on powerful vested interests. The law did establish an appointed board for four years, but voters turned down a referendum that would have made it permanent. Mr. Cole says that defeat allowed many who opposed further changes to sabotage the law effectively.
 
Mixed Record of Success
 And the 1984 law led to only modest improvements in student achievement. "We've had some changes in attitude, but, regrettably, many of the schools look the same as in 1983," said John Cole, president of the Texas Federation of Teachers, the only union that supported the bill.
Scores did climb steadily on the tests the law required, and the dropout rate fell from 34 percent to 21 percent. But that is still relatively high, and in the 1989-90 school year 23 percent of high-school seniors could not pass an English and math test required for graduation.
Some of the legislated changes brought unforeseen problems, particularly in light of the deep recession that hit Texas after the law was passed. Limiting class sizes to 22 in the lower grades is still widely praised, but it forced school districts to hire more teachers, and it strained budgets. The school-finance system has been ruled unconstitutional three times in the last four years, twice because, despite the 1984 law, huge inequities remained between rich and poor school districts, and once because the remedy was financed with an illegal tax. It is still being challenged in the courts.
Senator Parker, Governor White and nearly every teacher in Texas say that the teacher competency test, administered once in 1986, was a big mistake. Fewer than 1 percent of teachers failed, but the experience insulted and angered them.
"He got crossways with teachers, and that could have been avoided," Senator Parker said.
Education experts now say that the Texas law, like others of those years, focused too much on rule-making and too little on setting goals for students and letting teachers help them achieve those goals any way that works.

HEADLINE: New Direction for the New President In Manila: Away From Washington

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, June 26

 BODY:
A few weeks before Fidel V. Ramos was proclaimed the winner of the Philippine presidential election, Washington delivered a message to this former colony that many here interpreted as another slap from America: with the forced closing of the giant Subic Bay naval base, aid would be slashed by more than half, with more cuts likely.
That should not have come as a surprise, because Manila, trying to overcome objections to the huge United States military presence, had long characterized the assistance as a form of rent. But to many Filipinos, the drastic reduction was a telling symbol. 
 Indeed, the conventional wisdom here is that when Mr. Ramos takes office on Tuesday, he will not only be the first freely elected President in a generation, but he will also be the first who is forced to survive without the United States to back him up.
Mr. Ramos is frequently termed an "American boy" in the press here -- he is a graduate of West Point and has strong ties to the Pentagon -- and many people around him say his first challenge will be to shift the country more toward Asia.
He is expected to seek from his neighbors, especially Japan, the kind of benefits that once flowed from the country's closeness to the United States. But that will mean a wrenching readjustment, forcing a country that is perpetually preoccupied by economic crises and overpopulation to compete with some of the most successful economies in Asia.
 
Seeing Benefits of New Ties
 "Philippine relations with the United States are at an all-time low," said Leticia Ramos Shahani, Mr. Ramos's sister and a former ambassador who is head of the Philippine Senate's foreign affairs committee. "I think many people feel that the special relationship is gone. But closing this chapter may be good. It will make us less obsessed with the American relationship, make us look more to Europe and Japan, and force us to be more competitive."
Mr. Ramos says that the turn in relations has him concerned. Within the first 100 days of his Administration, he said at a recent news conference, he plans a "complete review" of relations with the United States.
"The economic and trade side of our relations also needs to be reviewed," he said. But so far he has carefully avoided offering any details.
Elected with only 23.5 percent of the vote, the former general has spent the last few weeks bringing old rivals aboard: He had a much-publicized dinner the other night with Imelda Marcos, who received about 10 percent of the vote in the presidential race. Mr. Ramos agreed in principle to allow the body of her husband, President Ferdinand E. Marcos, to be returned to the Philippines for burial.
 
Political Problems at Home
 Mr. Ramos is also drafting a plan to offer amnesty to both the Communist insurgents who have fought a guerrilla war with the Government for decades and to the right-wing military splinter groups that tried seven times to overthrow his predecessor, President Corazon C. Aquino.
Filipinos complain that while they expected the restoration of democracy under President Aquino would strengthen ties with Washington, the result has been just the opposite. With the Communist insurgency in the countryside losing strength, one Government official lamented the other day, "even the C.I.A. doesn't pay attention to us anymore."
For those here who viewed the dependence on the United States as part of the reason that the Philippines is the laggard of Southeast Asia, some benign neglect from America is overdue.
"The act of standing up and saying 'no' to a superpower was very important psychologically to Filipinos," Carolina Hernandez, a professor of political science at the University of the Philippines, said recently.
But it had its price. The Inquirer, a local newspaper, noted the other day, "It is apparent that the Philippines can no longer run to the United States for help after ejecting the bases."
There has been a detectable move in the Philippines to discover anew the country's Asian roots, beneath the endless string of fast-food outlets and striptease bars that are the most visible remnants of Americanization.
The latest trends in art and music here are toward the indigenous. The man elected Vice President under Mr. Ramos, Joseph Estrada, an economic nationalist who ran on a rival ticket, is best known as a former movie actor who endeared himself to the electorate by playing the role of a tough-guy common man fighting against oppression, and against the American presence here. Mr. Estrada's popularity stems partly from the fact that he talks to his constituents almost entirely in a Philippine language rather than in English.
United States officials here say that some of the sense of abandonment is exaggerated -- especially since it was the Philippines that decided to oust the American military -- and that fundamental ties remain strong.
"There may never be a day when the Philippines is under the kind of focus in America that it had in the 1930's and before," said Frank Wisner, who departed as American Ambassador a few weeks ago. "But there is still a lot to make this relationship special. The history has a dynamic to it," a continuity based on the two million to three million Filipino-Americans and Filipinos living in the United States.
Nonetheless, United States aid declined to $219 million this year, from $567 million last year, with the steepest cuts in military and development assistance and food programs.
Equally important, United States direct investment has fallen short of Philippine hopes. Though United States companies have invested billions here since the country became an American possession, today most seem focused on Eastern Europe and more promising opportunities elsewhere in Asia. Many executives say that kidnapping threats and the daily failures of the electricity-generating system make expansion particularly problematic.
As a result, Mr. Ramos's best hopes seem to be Japan and South Korea, which he hopes will be lured by low wages here. Japan is now the largest aid-giver to the Philippines, but Japanese companies say that the same troubles that scare away others are making them reluctant to build more than relatively small-scale projects.
Mr. Ramos's closest political ally, Jose de Vencia, says that the new Administration's first move is likely to be to offer the United States access -- but not basing rights -- to an airfield at Subic. Other Southeast Asian nations have recently offered similar rights, and even a small presence on Subic would be a gesture that Manila still wants Washington to play an active role in the security of the area.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media;
Networks Planning Cutbacks in Convention Time

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
After receiving abysmally low ratings in 1984 and 1988, the television networks are putting their collective foot down this summer and planning to cut their coverage nearly in half.
Although their plans are still under discussion, at this point no network is committed to more than one hour of prime-time broadcasting each night from the Democratic convention, which begins July 13. Network executives say, however, that they expect to have somewhat more coverage on the final night, when the nominee gives his acceptance speech. 
 Four years ago, the three major networks were already restricting convention broadcasts, but each still carried at least two hours nightly in prime time. As recently as eight years ago, it was common for networks to pre-empt all programs from 8 P.M. to 11 P.M. on convention nights. In earlier decades, the networks broadcast as much as 12 hours of a convention in single day.
"We are driven by a desire to have the amount of coverage have some bearing on the news value," Lane Venardos, director of CBS News's special events unit, said, referring to the cuts planned for this year. "Increasingly, the parties have squeezed every ounce of controversy and potential news out of the conventions to provide a seamless event for their candidates. They've ceased to become news events, and have become theater."
 
Sign of New Era
 The cuts in network broadcasts of the conventions are another sign that the 1992 campaign, which in recent weeks has been waged mostly on the talk-show circuit, is ushering in a new era of political reporting. For more complete convention coverage this summer, viewers will be able to turn to C-Span and the Cable News Network, both of which were in their infancy 10 years ago.
"We're probably a throwback to what the networks always did," said Tom Hannon, CNN's political director, adding, "Certainly it's not unpleasant for us to think they've abandoned the field."
Underlying the networks' concerns about the conventions' newsworthiness is a concern about the bottom line; at a time of slumping profits, they can ill-afford to pre-empt money-making shows for expensive broadcasts of often tedious speeches.
In addition, ratings for the convention have been sagging. The 1980 Democratic convention in New York City received an average rating of 9 points for all three networks combined, while the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta received an average rating only 6.6, according to Nielsen Media Research. By comparison, the program that received the top Nielsen rating last week received 16.9 points. One rating point is equivalent to 1 percent of all the country's households that have televisions.
As the networks have cut convention broadcasts, the rise of cable television news has made it easier for them, removing any civic obligation they once felt to carry the conventions gavel to gavel.
"We've been able to take the networks off the hook," Brian Lamb, the chief executive of C-Span, said. "These conventions are very low-rated. There's no drama; we know exactly what's going to happen. They're made to order for what we do."
Indeed, C-Span viewers need not miss a minute of the coming conventions, with the cable network planning 18 hours of live reports each day. CNN is planning to start its reporting of the Democratic convention in New York City at 8 P.M., and to follow each nightly session until it ends.
In an unusual co-operative effort, the Public Broadcasting System is teaming with NBC to provide prime-time broadcasts of the conventions on PBS. NBC reporters will appear together with correspondents for "The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour" on PBS stations from 8 P.M. to 10 P.M. Then the two teams will split up, with PBS continuing its broadcast, and NBC doing an hourlong prime-time program.
 
Plans Are Not Complete
 The arrangement will give PBS the benefit of NBC's resources and give NBC the chance to showcase its reporters without pre-empting prime time. The two plan to continue the arrangement for the Republican Convention, which starts on Aug. 17 in Houston.
"Given the realities of network economics, we weren't likely to get evening-long coverage on our own network," Bill Wheatley, executive producer of NBC's election unit, said. "So we thought it would be great if we were to have a partner."
Neither CBS nor ABC has announced its final plans for the conventions yet. But officials for both networks said that the prime time programs would be less than four years ago, and that they were certain only of broadcasting one hour of the convention proceedings each night. On Tuesday, July 14, CBS will be broadcasting the baseball All-Star Game.
Jeff Gralnick, executive producer of ABC's election reporting, said, "We'll be on at least from 10 to 11."
On the final night of the convention, all the networks are expected to begin broadcasting by at least 9:30 P.M.
Officials at the campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton insist that they are not concerned about the network cuts, saying they will be balanced by increases in local and cable television reports.
 
Some Loss, Some Gain
 "What you're losing on the network side, you're gaining on the local side," said Laura Quinn, the Clinton campaign's convention spokeswoman.
In anticipation of the networks' limited broadcasts, the Democratic National Committee has set up its own studio and editing rooms to provide tape of the convention by satellite to local stations. The Republicans have provided such satellite reports of its conventions since 1984.
Because of the restrictions on network time, Ms. Quinn said, the Democrats are trying to plan the convention program more painstakingly this year. She predicted, though, that if an important speaker took the podium when the networks were not planning to broadcast from the convention, they would change their plans.
"If Mario Cuomo starts talking at 9:30, it's hard to imagine them not tuning in," she said.
In the early years of television, the political conventions were a major broadcasting event that spurred sales of television sets and drew new viewers. But as the primaries grew in importance, the significance of the conventions waned, and by the early 1970's, many news executives say, the conventions had become dull viewing.
 
A Steady Decline
 "From '72 on, the networks tried to get rid of them and couldn't," said Reuven Frank, former president of NBC News. The national parties had become accustomed to the free television exposure, he said, and the networks, which are subject to licensing by Federal agencies, were loath to offend them.
"Licensed businesses," Mr. Frank said, "are gutless."
Since 1972, though, the number of hours the networks have devoted to convention reporting has steadily declined.
Twenty years ago, NBC and CBS each carried 36 hours of the Democratic convention, while ABC carried 19. By 1980, CBS and NBC's broadcasts of the Democratic gathering had dropped to 20 hours each, and ABC's to 10 hours. In 1988, the three networks each carried between 10 and 12 hours of the Democratic convention.
Following a similar pattern, average hours of viewership dropped from 5.8 hours per household during the 1972 Democratic convention to 2.8 hours during the 1988 convention.

HEADLINE: Ingeniero Jacobacci Journal;
Old Patagonian Express Puff, Puff, Puffs to Its End

BYLINE: NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INGENIERO JACOBACCI, Argen tina

 BODY:
The American travel writer Paul Theroux described it as "a kind of demented samovar on wheels, with iron patches on its boiler and leaking pipes on its underside and dribbling valves and metal elbows that shot jets of vapor sideways."
This rail relic, a steam engine that crosses 250 desolate miles of southern Argentina, is still running, a vital transportation link for a few thousand sheep farmers and Mapuche Indians, 12 years after the Theroux best seller, "The Old Patagonian Express," was published. It also employs several hundred workers 
 But the changing economic policies that have swept Latin American capitals, and a rush by Argentina to sell state companies, is about to doom this unusual piece of British technology. Its demise could mean the end also of the town of Ingeniero Jacobacci, named after one of the original railroad pioneers, and about a dozen other settlements from here to the town of Esquel.
The Government of President Carlos Saul Menem has asked for bids from investors who would like to buy the three state railroads that run through this province, Rio Negro. So far, it has received bids for only one of those lines, and not one for the Old Patagonian Express. And the Government has said that by the end of July it will shut the railroad down.
 
The Prospects Aren't Good
 Losses of $1 million a year may justify its passing in the minds of policy makers in Buenos Aires, some 1,000 miles to the north. But the tough Argentines who live along its track see this as just another in a series of blows to the economy and heritage of Patagonia, a land of stark landscapes that has inspired writers and attracted hardy British and South African settlers. Some outlaws have been drawn here, too, including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, who lived in Patagonia for years, out of the reach of United States justice.
"Without a doubt, this is an unprofitable railroad," said Jorge Ferreira, assistant to Governor Horacio Masaccessi. "We are trying to persuade Buenos Aires to give us more time to find a buyer. But the prospects are not good."
The truth is, the railroad is not called the Old Patagonian Express; the name was coined by Mr. Theroux. It is far from an express, making not only its 14 assigned stops but also numerous others as passengers jump out here and there.
Argentines call it the Trochita, a word that refers to the line's narrow gauge. This means that the engines, tank cars and passenger coaches are about one-quarter the size of normal railroad cars, making the Trochita seem more like a toy train.
On every trip, locals crowd the rickety wooden benches, drinking yerba mate, the hot Argentine drink, and huddling around the tiny wood-burning stoves in each car as the Trochita jolts on the 14-hour trip south to Esquel.
Though antiquated, it is a symbol of how important British technology was to the building of Patagonia's economy in the early part of this century. When work on the line started in 1922, it was decided that a full-scale railroad would be nearly impossible in this rugged area full of thorn bushes, sheep, foxes, guanaco -- the Argentine version of the llama -- and the ostrichlike rhea.
The railroad's golden days were after World War II, when the vast sheep ranches flourished, producing huge amounts of wool that the little boxcars would take up to Ingeniero Jacobacci, there to connect with the full-scale railroad line to the coast.
But as Buenos Aires became more and more a hub of economic activity and wool prices fell, the regional economy began to weaken. A paved road was put in along the northern border of Rio Negro, diverting large amounts of cargo. Soon the 14 hours it takes Trochita to go from Esquel to Ingeniero Jacobacci started to seem too long.
The industrial group owned by Amalia Fortabat, a close friend of Mr. Menem and perhaps Argentina's richest person after inheriting a vast fortune from her late husband, has offered to buy the profitable rail line that runs along Rio Negro's northern border. But efforts to have her buy the Trochita and the full-sized rail line running from San Carlos de Bariloche, a ski and lake resort, to Ingeniero Jacobacci and on to the coast have failed.
Ingeniero Jacobacci's Mayor, Edgardo Bujaryisqui, says that if this town of 6,000 inhabitants loses both railroad lines, there will be very little economic reason for its existence. He sees the Government's determination to shut down the little train as just another sign of its lack of concern for development outside of Buenos Aires.
"There is no one in Buenos Aires who talks of serious development in the interior of the country," Mr. Bujaryisqui said. "To them, we don't exist."
About the only hope he holds out is that investors will be persuaded that the Trochita has historical and tourist value. In the summer months, one station manager said, three out of four passengers are tourists, eager to ride the line before it dies.
Mr. Bujaryisqui's plan is to have tourists come from San Carlos de Bariloche by full-sized train, board the tiny train for Esquel, a town of 25,000, and return to San Carlos de Bariloche by bus.
"We think that is the only way to save the railroad," Mr. Bujaryisqui said. "This is one of the most unique train rides in the world in one of the most unique places in the world. People are always awed by Patagonia."

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
Mitterrand Trip Welcomed Only in Paris and Sarajevo

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 28

 BODY:
President Francois Mitterrand returned today from a daring six-hour visit to Sarajevo to face the dismay of Germany and his other European partners, the praise of most French people and the prospect of further friction in his country's strained relations with Washington.
Partly political theater and partly a statement that action is possible, the French leader's brief foray appeared less a major development in the search for peace in the Balkans than a boon to Mr. Mitterrand's standing at home. 
 President Mitterrand, who was whisked past bullet-riddled buildings to a meeting with the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alija Izetbegovic, characterized his visit as a purely humanitarian gesture rather than a move to upstage the European Community or the United Nations in their efforts to end the war.
 
Broader Political Picture
 It seemed clear, however, that he was trying to make a point to Washington about Europe's capacity for action at a time when France believes that United States influence is destined to decline on a continent no longer divided by the cold war.
"There's a lot of emotion about Yugoslavia in the United States, and President Bush has echoed this," said European Affairs Minister Elisabeth Guigou. "But a lot has been said there about possible action, only to come to nothing. We in France prefer to be more sober and act."
Senior Foreign Ministry officials have been particularly dismissive of statements by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, suggesting they were too little too late.
 
Annoyed at Baker
 According to Le Monde, a letter sent by Mr. Baker to European leaders at their meeting in Lisbon this weekend particularly annoyed Paris. The letter expressed outrage at the "barbarity" in Sarajevo and called for Serbia's exclusion from the United Nations.
"France opposed this letter, judging its message ineffectual, even harmful, in that it is important to maintain some sort of dialogue with Serbia," Le Monde wrote in a passage it hinted had originated in the President's entourage.
Foreign Ministry officials have pressed the view that Europe should lead the search for a solution to a European problem, but Mr. Mitterrand's visit hardly seemed an advertisement for united European action. Other countries, particularly Germany, reacted testily to a trip of which they had been told nothing, despite the fact that Mr. Mitterrand left directly from the meeting in Lisbon.
 
Germany Is Annoyed
 Close French-German ties are increasingly at the heart of Europe's drive for unity in foreign and economic policy, and President Mitterrand may have sacrificed this special relationship for a spectacular gesture whose efficacy remains obscure.
German officials said they were particularly irked because France, an ally of Serbia since World War I, when they both opposed the Austro-Hungarian empire, has been the most reluctant to act against the Serb-dominated Government in Belgrade.
Only at Lisbon did Mr. Mitterrand explicitly refer to the Serbs as the aggressors and agree to a strong statement in which the community said it did not exclude recourse to military measures to insure that humanitarian aid reaches Sarajevo.
British officials also expressed outrage, but Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd sought to put a good face on things, commenting that, "It's a brave act by an elderly president." Mr. Mitterrand is 75 years old.
With French television repeatedly showing films of the President being cheered in Sarajevo, it was clear that Mr. Mitterrand had gained a significant domestic triumph. His visit coincided with the 78th anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, whose killing in Sarajevo contributed decisively to the start of World War I.
"Europe's honor had to be saved and the President achieved this," a political analyst, Gerard Carreyrou, said in summing up the reaction in France.
Among leading politicians, only former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing voiced criticism. "We cannot at one and the same time declare that we want a common foreign policy in Europe, and then undertake such isolated action without even telling our partners," he said.
With a crucial referendum on European union due in the autumn, President Mitterrand needed the boost his visit seems to have provided. Because he has made European integration the cornerstone of his second seven-year term, which is to end in 1995, a rejection of union could spell the end of Mr. Mitterrand's presidency.
 
But Was It Effective?
 Beyond such domestic considerations, however, it was not apparent what President Mitterrand had achieved. Officials suggested that he had at last opened the door to a relief effort.
In an apparent effort to underscore the point, two French Air Force transport planes, each loaded with 6.5 tons of food and medicine, took off for Sarajevo as Mr. Mitterrand left. But officials at the Defense Ministry said later that the planes would go to the Croatian port of Split before proceeding to Sarajevo on Monday.
Bernard-Henri Levy, the French philosopher, said the President's decision to undertake his mission stemmed from a meeting he had had with Mr. Mitterrand last week in which he had handed over a message from the Bosnian President.
Mr. Levy, who recently visited Sarajevo, said Mr. Izetbegovic compared the situation of the 300,000 people in the city to that of the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto.

NEW YORK CITY
 
GAY PARADE BOTH FESTIVE AND SOMBER
Walking arm-in-arm, thousands of gay and lesbian marchers streamed down Fifth Avenue for the annual Gay Pride parade, a celebration of sexual freedom and tolerance. The mood was at once festive and somber. Some cheering and laughing marchers mocked themselves and stereotypes of their life styles. Others appealed for help in the fight against AIDS. B3.
 
CONVENTION CONTENTION
The Democratic Party, traditionally the party of organized labor, has been caught in an unexpected labor dispute as it prepares for the convention at Madison Square Garden. A four-day standoff kept power cables from being hooked into the television networks' trailers outside the Garden on schedule last week. B3.
 
20 YEARS AFTER THE KNAPP COMMISSION
As another scandal erupts over police corruption in New York City, the alumni of the Knapp Commission held a 20th reunion of the investigation aimed at killing graft and in many ways remaking an entire police department. One man who did not attend was David Durk, who persuaded a fellow detective, Frank Serpico, to go forward with the allegations that led to the creation of the Knapp Commission. But he has always been a loner anyway. Metro Matters. B3.
 
QUEENS CELEBRATES ITSELF
An estimated two million people gathered under turquoise skies and marshmallow clouds to celebrate the 15th annual Queens Festival in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park this weekend. As the smell of Ecuadorean empanadas, Italian zeppoli and Japanese bean-curd cakes were melded by the vibrating sounds of calypso, steel drums and Korean wedding music, it was not hard to tell that this year's theme was "Ethnic Pride and Cultural Diversity." B3.
 
DIPLOMAS DESPITE BARRIERS
Like most high school graduations, the one at the Upper Manhattan Outreach Center was a mix of elation over plans for the future and nostalgia for bygone days and friends. But there was something more. The 97 graduates of this alternative school shared a special pride: most of them had had problems in other schools and risked dropping out altogether. The school, started in 1980 to help young people who cannot make it elsewhere, is one of six such centers operated by the New York Board of Education. The centers have turned out 4,500 students over the past decade by adhering to the belief that "small is better." B2.

SUSPECT'S HELP CRACKS CASE
Investigators said they were finally able to find the body of Sidney J. Reso when one of the prime suspects in the kidnapping of the Exxon official, Irene Seale, agreed to cooperate. After 26 years of marriage, the influence of her husband, Arthur Seale, the other suspect being held, waned rapidly under the pressure of incarceration and the prospect of a lifetime behind bars. B5.
 
BUDGET SHOWDOWN IN NEW JERSEY
A Republican Senator said that he would not support his party's effort to override Governor Florio's veto of the Legislature's $14.6 billion budget, instead urging a compromise that the Governor had suggested. The decision by Senator Leonard T. Connors Jr. appears to leave the Republicans in the Senate one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto. B5.
 
CUOMO GETS A NEW WEAPON
In the fight over his ambitious plan for a state takeover of all Medicaid costs, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has added a major new weapon: he is increasingly linking the proposed fiscal bailouts for Nassau and Suffolk Counties to lawmakers' approval of the Medicaid plan. The Governor's tactic is aimed at the Republican-led State Senate, which is desperately seeking the local bailouts to avoid the likely alternative, huge property-tax increases that would enrage the Long Island voters who are crucial to the G.O.P's continued hold on the Senate.

SOARING AHEAD TO YESTERDAY
Thanks in part to its no-frills approach, Sussex Airport has weathered economic pressures that have shut down 5 of the state's 55 public airports in the last five years and pushed many others to the brink.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Is Tying L.I. Fiscal Bailouts to His Plan for Medicaid

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 28

 BODY:
In the fight over his ambitious plan for a state takeover of all Medicaid costs, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has added a major new weapon: he is increasingly linking the proposed fiscal bailouts for Nassau and Suffolk Counties to lawmakers' approval of the Medicaid plan.
The Republican-led State Senate is desperately seeking the local bailouts to avoid the likely alternative, huge property-tax increases that would enrage Long Island voters, who are crucial to the Republicans' continued hold on the Senate. 
 But the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Long Island Republican, has also been hostile to the Governor's Medicaid plan, which if fully put into effect would shift both billions of dollars in local tax revenues and billions of dollars in Medicaid costs to the state government.
The Democratic Governor has repeatedly made comments in recent days that suggest he would frown on the county bailouts, which involve new deficit-financing authority and increases in the county sales tax, as long as lawmakers refused to go along with an idea that he said would save the same counties money. The bailout plans are worth $91 million to help close the deficit in Suffolk County's $1.3 billion budget, and $100 million for Nassau's $1.8 billion budget.
In a telephone interview today, the Governor said, "How can you say to me that you're willing to let them borrow money because they're desperate, and then refuse our offer to give them millions and millions of dollars in Medicaid pickup?"
Mr. Cuomo has cast his Medicaid plan as a "win-win" program for local governments because, he says, New York City's and most counties' Medicaid costs are rising faster than the tax revenues they would give up.
The plan will be a plus for state leaders too, Mr. Cuomo argues, if they can succeed in working with him to drive down health-care costs once the state has full control of Medicaid. Republican leaders are skeptical, and many contend that the true cost of the takeover could be state tax increases in future years.
Mr. Cuomo vigorously denied that he would "start hostaging, or make it some quid pro quo" on the two issues, and he said he would never blanketly refuse to go along with the Long Island bailouts unless he got the Medicaid plan as well.
"I am generally opposed to hostaging," the Governor said. "I am generally in support of logical connections."
Whether the Governor will actually be willing to risk an all-out fight to secure his Medicaid plan remains to be seen, of course. After leading many lawmakers and lobbyists in Albany to believe that he would not sign redistricting bills this year unless they were accompanied by stringent new limits on campaign contributions and broad revisions of the state's election laws, Mr. Cuomo wound up settling for what was widely regarded as a tame package of changes.
But one official in the Democratic-controlled Assembly said today that on the bailout issue the Governor was trying to play the Senate's vulnerability for all it was worth.
"This is one of the very, very few times that the Senate wants something that the Governor can hold up and that doesn't hurt us," the official said. "Therefore, when the Senate says no to him on everything he cares about, when they say no to him six times in a row, he can say, 'Why should I give you this?' That's his game plan."
The Senate has said no to plenty of things the Governor wants, including a bond act that he says would help revive the state's economy and an environmental trust fund financed in part from taxes on beer and soda containers.
The Republican opposition stems in large part from the fears of several senators that they could get hammered by their opponents in this fall's elections for supporting "tax and borrow" policies. An unusually high number of state senators are facing potential primary challenges from Republican Assembly members who, because their party is out of power in that chamber, have always been able to vote against tax increases.
Now, however, the Republicans may have to weigh their desire for the bailout plans and reconsider their opposition to the Cuomo proposals.
The Governor said that he had serious concerns about the county borrowing in any event and that Long Island could slide down the same path that led to New York City's fiscal crisis in the 1970's.
"That is one of the most dangerous, and in New York City's case one of the most lethal, practices and should be shunned wherever possible," he said.
But Mr. Marino's spokesman, John E. McArdle, said Mr. Cuomo was holding the bailout plans "hostage to his entire political agenda."

HEADLINE: Japan's Top Party Agrees To Give Economy a Push

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, June 29

 BODY:
Japan's ruling party agreed over the weekend on a broad plan to stimulate the nation's sagging economy through increased Government spending and other measures worth more than $45 billion for the current fiscal year.
The plan, agreed to on Saturday, represents in part a response to calls from the United States and other nations that Japan accelerate its economic growth to help the world recover from the recession. 
 Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is expected to come under pressure to announce plans to jump-start Japan's economy when he meets with President Bush in Washington this week and with the leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in early July in Munich.
The Prime Minister said this morning that he would take the plan seriously and had already discussed it briefly by telephone with President Bush, according to NHK, Japan's broadcasting company.
 
Tentative Measures
 An increase in Japan's public spending could also increase the nation's imports and cut into a bulging trade surplus that is again threatening to make Japan a target of world anger.
The plan put forth by the Liberal Democratic Party is not in final form and could change by fall, when the specific steps and monetary amounts are to be determined.
As it stands, the plan calls for more spending on projects like water and sewage and waste-disposal, increased Government support for science and technology, the establishment of a fund for environmental projects, and incentives for small and medium-size businesses.
Parts of the Japanese Government, particularly the Finance Ministry, have opposed increased spending. But because the Liberal Democrats have tight control over the Government, their plan is expected to have great influence over what finally emerges.
A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said that no final decision had been reached and that the ministry had no immediate comment on the Liberal Democratic Party plan. He said an important unresolved issue is how such extra spending would be financed.
 
Pressures From Business, Too
 Japan had been expected to announce extra spending for the current fiscal year, with estimates of the supplemental budget ranging from 2 trillion yen to 10 trillion yen. Liberal Democratic Party officials, while not specifying the size of the supplemental budget agreed to on Saturday, said the aim for the overall stimulative package should be 6 trillion to 7 trillion yen, or about $47 billion to $55 billion.
In addition to feeling pressure from abroad, the Government is also being urged by businesses here to spur growth and help the stock market, which is at a six-year low. The Liberal Democratic Party in particular wants to announce such pump-priming measures before the election in the upper house of Parliament a month from now.
Japanese officials have said they want to stimulate the nation's economy through domestic spending to avoid setting off trade tensions that would arise if Japanese companies tried to fight the slump by increasing exports.
 
Debate Over Methods
 "It is important to grow though expansion of domestic demand," Sozaburo Okamatsu, director-general for international trade policy at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said in a news conference on Thursday. Already, because of diminished imports, Japan's trade surplus nearly doubled in May from a year earlier and its surplus with the United States rose by about 50 percent.
Still, there has been tremendous debate within the Government about what to do. The powerful Finance Ministry has been resisting a big fiscal stimulus, worrying that increased spending would add to the national debt, especially since tax revenues are expected to drop this year because of weak economic conditions.
Before deciding what to do next, Mr. Okamatsu said, the Government will wait to see the results of a package of stimulative measures taken in late March and early April. At that time the Government decided to push most of the public works spending for the fiscal year into the first half of the year, and the Bank of Japan cut the official discount rate to 3.75 percent.
Given the internal debate, Mr. Okamatsu said Prime Minister Miyazawa was not planning to discuss specific figures for the pump-priming measures when he meets with Mr. Bush and the other world leaders.
But now, with the presentation of the plan by the Liberal Democratic Party, it is not clear whether Mr. Miyazawa may be more specific in his promises to other world leaders.

HEADLINE: Officials Say Body in Forest Is Sidney Reso

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 28

 BODY:
The decomposing body unearthed from a shallow grave in a southern New Jersey state forest Saturday night was identified today as that of Sidney J. Reso, the Exxon executive kidnapped outside his home two months ago.
The authorities said that Mr. Reso had been shot in one arm and that he appeared to have died shortly after being abducted on April 29. They said the cause of his death had not been officially determined, and they refused to speculate on whether the gunshot wound played a part. 
 Mr. Reso's body was found about 8 P.M. Saturday in a secluded corner of the Bass River State Forest, about 20 miles north of Atlantic City. It had been buried about three feet beneath dense underbrush.
 
Led by a Suspect
 The discovery ended an eight-week search that F.B.I. officials today described as the most intensive kidnapping investigation since the abduction of Patty Hearst in 1974. One of the suspects in the kidnapping, Irene J. Seale, told Federal authorities of Mr. Reso's death and then helped a team of 40 law-enforcement officials find the grave Saturday morning, an official close to the investigation said.
The Morris County Prosecutor, W. Michael Murphy, said at a news conference today that he planned to file a felony murder charge in the case on Monday. He refused to say whether he would charge both Mrs. Seale and the other suspect in the case, her husband, Arthur, or just one of them. Arthur Seale, an ex-police officer, is a former security official at Exxon.
Michael Chertoff, the United States Attorney for New Jersey, declined to speculate at the news conference when and where Mr. Reso died. In New Orleans, where Mr. Reso grew up, the wife of his cousin Jerome Reso said that Mrs. Seale had told the authorities that Sidney Reso died on May 3, four days after the abduction.
Mr. Chertoff also refused to discuss any negotiations or legal deals that might have prompted Mrs. Seale to tell authorities about the death and the body.
But he seemed incensed at news reports that the 57-year-old man may have died of natural causes. "Nobody can say that a man who dies in captivity -- having been abducted from his family and having been held against his will -- died of natural causes," he said. "I cannot imagine causes that are less natural than the causes that apply in this case."
New Jersey's Medical Examiner, Dr. Robert Goode, began an autopsy at the state morgue here this morning and was to continue the examination on Monday, officials said.
Law-enforcement officials speculated, pending completion of Dr. Goode's autopsy, that Mr. Reso may have had a heart attack, perhaps fatal, during captivity. He suffered a heart attack three years ago, said Gary Penrith, the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's New Jersey office. Mr. Penrith said he understood that Mr. Reso was not required to take prescribed medicine for his condition, but took a daily aspirin as a blood thinner.
The search team arrived at the forest with Mrs. Seale about 8 A.M. on Saturday and scoured the wooded terrain for several hours before locating the grave, with the assistance of a state police search dog, in the late afternoon, said the official close to the investigation. Mr. Reso's remains were removed about 8 P.M.
The body of Mr. Reso, who was president of Exxon's international division, was positively identified today, Mr. Penrith said. He called the death "unbelievably despicable."
In a statement today, Exxon's chairman, Lawrence G. Rawl, said Mr. Reso had made an "invaluable contribution" to the company in his 35-year career. "Sid was one of the finest men I have known who combined outstanding professional competence with humanity and warmth," Mr. Rawl said.
 
Describing Murder Charges
 Mr. Reso vanished about 7:30 A.M. on April 29, moments after leaving home for the 10-minute drive from his home in Morris Township to his office in Florham Park. His car, its engine idling, was found at the foot of his 250-foot driveway.
The Seales, both 45 and unemployed, were arrested about 1 A.M. on June 19, after an aborted attempt to collect an $18.5 million ransom for Mr. Reso. Through a series of telephone calls and letters, the kidnappers led an F.B.I. team on a four-hour drive through four towns in Morris and Somerset Counties. The string of communications broke off abruptly after a rented Oldsmobile that other agents had been following near Far Hills, N.J., encountered a roadblock -- which was not related to the Reso case -- and drove off, officials have said.
The Seales were arrested about an hour later at a car depot in Hackettstown, N.J., where Mrs. Seale had rented the Oldsmobile on June 18.
The Federal Government has charged the Seales with kidnapping, extortion, conspiracy, using the mail to transmit ransom letters and interstate travel in aid of extortion.
State charges of kidnapping, extortion and conspiracy have also been filed by Mr. Murphy's office. The felony murder charge Mr. Murphy described applies when a crime victim dies during the commission of a felony.
The indictment Mr. Chertoff filed against the Seales on Thursday asserted that others had joined the couple in the kidnapping. No other suspects have been identified. But Mr. Chertoff vowed today to press on with the investigation.
"I promise that we will not in any way abate or relax our efforts until we have successfully completed the investigation," he said.
For Mr. Reso's wife, Patricia, the discovery of his body ends an anguishing 59-day vigil she kept at their home in Morris Township. She has said she prayed daily for his safe return and kept a journal that, she said, enabled her to speak directly to her husband.

 Twice during the 59 days, Mrs. Reso made televised appeals for the kidnappers to free her husband. The first, on May 15, came in response to a message the kidnappers left a day earlier on a light pole at the Rockaway Townsquare Mall in Morris County, officials have said.
If the authorities are right, the kidnappers' demand came even though they knew that Mr. Reso was dead.
Mrs. Reso's second appeal came June 16, the same day the kidnappers directed F.B.I. agents to a letter in Morris County that gave instructions for bundling the ransom -- $18.5 million in old $100 bills -- into laundry bags, officials have said.
In this appeal, Mrs. Reso said she was praying that her husband would be freed in time for Father's Day, June 21.
Mrs. Reso remained secluded at her home today.

HEADLINE: SUSSEX AIRPORT JOURNAL;
Where Wild Blue Yonder Is Untamed

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

DATELINE: SUSSEX, N.J.

 BODY:
TO imagine what this town's 47-year-old airport looks like, cast aside visions of sleek glass terminals, snarled parking lots and ominous jumbo jets.
This is a country airport.
The 150 small planes based here are arrayed in long rows on an open grass field near a meadow where horses graze. The "lounge" where recreational pilots spend hours swapping war stories, sipping coffee or just gossiping has no walls, just a soda machine, a ceiling bulging with exposed insulation and three fraying couches that spent their better years in private homes. 
 And then there's Wild Bill. A Navy flight trainer during World War II, Wild Bill Voorhis is Sussex Airport's senior flight instructor. He is 79 years old, and though the years have taken a few of his teeth, they have not diminished his enthusiasm --
or his sense of humor.
"We got a joke around here," he said on a recent Sunday afternoon between short hops with anyone who happened to drop by for a ride or lesson. "When I'm walking out to the plane, all the guys sitting around here yell, 'Hey Bill, did you take your heart pills today?' They do it just to scare the people."
Thanks in large part to its no-frills approach, Sussex Airport has weathered economic pressures that have shut down 5 of the state's 55 public airports in the last five years and pushed many others to the brink. Those stresses -- including high liability insurance, escalating property taxes and a fall-off in the production of small planes -- have tempted several airport owners to close down and sell their land to developers.
But not Paul Styger. Mr. Styger, an easygoing man with a deep tan and wavy white hair, bought part of Sussex Airport in 1946, a year after it opened, and has owned the whole thing since the mid-1950's. The small airport, in rural Sussex County 45 miles northeast of Manhattan, has not been lucrative, Mr. Styger says. His payback, he says, comes from sharing his passion for flying, which he calls "this good clean sport," with those who love it as much as he does.
To provide additional income, Mr. Styger has taken odd jobs over the years, once selling calendars, insurance and commercial refrigerators door to door. He has also postponed several renovations -- which he hopes to undertake soon -- including repaving the weathered, 3,500-foot runway and rebuilding the dilapidated main hangar.
"I don't say, 'My salary is X,' and take it every week," Mr. Styger says in the airport's narrow, cluttered office, which got its first computer recently. "Some weeks I don't take a salary at all."
Nevertheless, the airport has survived and even won an international reputation with the three-day air show in late August that it has staged for 20 years. The show -- which includes dozens of vintage planes, military fly-bys and demonstrations by stunt pilots -- drew 30,000 spectators last year, many of them children.
In the introduction to last year's program, Mr. Styger wrote: "To all the faithful friends, without whose support these shows would not be possible, we pledge always a friendly field, a helping hand, a place for hangar flying and old-fashioned camaraderie."
That spirit is apparent among the airport's several dozen regular pilots. On this Sunday morning, for example, a diverse group -- including the 61-year-old owner of a well-drilling company, a paralegal in her 30's and a 70-year-old retired American Airlines pilot -- flew together to an airport in the Catskills, just for breakfast.
Since it is a throwback to a simpler time before airports like Teterboro, about 40 miles to the south, became busy with corporate jets, Sussex attracts its share of elderly people.
Robert Templin, a 68-year-old retired ironworker, and his wife, Lorraine, 63, a former waitress, drive here almost every day from their home in Lake Hopatcong, N.J., about 40 minutes away. They don leather caps and fly for hours in a 50-year-old, open-cockpit World War II training plane that Mr. Templin assembled from pieces unearthed in an old hangar, a barn and someone else's cellar.
"There's always a thrill in doing a little acrobatic maneuver," he said. "It makes you feel really alive. And this airport is a friendly place. The hangar talk is as good as the flying."
Indeed, Mr. Styger has managed to imbue the airport with the feel of a general store, or, as he likes to call it, a bar without a liquor license.
"It's like a family," says Kathy Dylewski, the paralegal, from nearby Sparta. "Everyone fits in. You're just a number at other airports."

HEADLINE: Ocean Dumping Is Ending, but Not Problems;
New York Can't Ship, Bury or Burn Its Sludge, but No One Wants a Processing Plant

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
Late this afternoon the ocean barge Spring Brook will slip quietly into the East River and head to sea, carrying for the last time one of America's least loved cargoes: 400 tons of New York City's processed sewage.
It has been four years since Congress voted to ban the common practice of using the ocean as a municipal chamber pot, and with the Federal deadline set for tomorrow, New York is the only city that still does it. For environmentalists and many politicians, the final barge journey will be a moment of triumph, one they say will make the planet a cleaner, healthier place. 
But behind the public celebrations lie a host of anxieties. For New York, the end of ocean dumping means the beginning of a new and troubling era: a city that is already struggling to recycle, burn, export, sell and bury nearly 30,000 tons of garbage every day will have to find ways to handle some more. And despite plans, promises and years of negotiations, it won't be easy or cheap.
 
'We Rushed Into This'
 "This ban has been portrayed as an accomplishment that has no flaws," said Representative Thomas J. Manton of Queens, whose district will be among those that will be forced to process the city's treated sewage, called sludge. "But I worry whether this makes sense economically or environmentally. We rushed into this for political reasons and now we will have to deal with some harsh truths."
Perhaps the most painful of those truths is that while it will be nearly impossible to export, bury or burn most of the city's sludge, it is even harder to find a New Yorker eager to live near a plant designed to process it, either by turning that waste into useful compost or by baking it into fertilizer pellets at tremendous heat.
Over the next decade the city, which has one composting plant on Wards Island, plans to build at least three composting plants, in Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn, and one in the Bronx that will make fertilizer pellets. There are also plans for at least one chemical plant on Wards Island that would turn sludge into cover for landfills.
 
Needed but Unwanted
 Later, city environmental officials say, New York may need more sludge plants; plans for them, however, have proven as popular in city neighborhoods as incinerators, garbage transfer stations and recycling centers. Everybody may need them but nobody wants them. So besides battling for a new incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the city faces the prospect of placing as many as 10 plants over the next 15 years to bake and compost its sludge.
And it will have to do it at great cost to the residents of New York City. In the fiscal year that starts on Wednesday, the city will pay more than $250 million to dispose of its sludge on land. Last year it cost less than $20 million to ferry it 106 miles to the Deepwater Municipal Sludge Site on the edge of the Continental Shelf, where at least 40 million tons of waste have been deposited since 1986.
City water and sewer rates rose nearly 20 percent in 1991, mostly to accommodate the anticipated increased costs of sludge processing. And the City Department of Environmental Protection expects the increases to continue.
"It's not really a water bill any more," said the department's Commissioner, Albert F. Appleton, about the combined sewer and water bills that city residents pay. "It's a sludge bill."
 
Priorities Are Doubted
 Mr. Appleton says he feels strongly that ocean dumping is wrong and he is pleased to see it end. But he also says: "I just don't know if this is how I'd choose to spend my next $250 million. On the list of pressing environmental problems faced by this city and this country, I really wonder if ocean dumping is that high."
Nearly every working day for most of this century -- here and in hundreds of coastal communities from Los Angeles to Miami -- barges made similar journeys, laden with millions of tons of sludge they dumped into the ocean.
Congress banned the practice in 1988, after a summer in which tons of medical waste washed up on beaches and thousands of dolphins died mysteriously along the Atlantic Coast. Although government officials insisted there was no connection between the medical debris and ocean dumping much farther out to sea, environmentalists had a strong election-year issue and few politicians were eager to oppose a ban.
Sewage sludge had been dumped 12 miles out in New York Harbor since 1924. Citing evidence that enormous expanses of the inner coast had been degraded by the practice, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency in 1984 designated a new site, 106 miles off the coast of Atlantic City, that was assumed to be much safer.
 
Pollutants at Deep Levels
 "The evidence is harder to gather at that depth," said J. Frederick Grassle, director of the Institute of Marine and Coastal Studies at Rutgers University. "The effects of ocean dumping that far out are not severe. But there are effects, and clearly pollutants are penetrating into the deepest layers of the sea."
For most smaller cities the shift to 106 miles made the cost and trouble of dumping too high. But some, including many communities in New Jersey and in Westchester and Nassau Counties, continued until last year. New York, by far the nation's biggest ocean dumper, took a little longer to stop.
Environmentalists who campaigned hard for an end to dumping -- in part by likening the assault on the oceans to the greenhouse effect gases are feared to have on the earth's atmosphere -- say that using the ocean as a dump site is never an acceptable alternative to finding safe ways to dispose of waste on land. Many scientists also worried about the long-term effects of dumping waste beyond the edge of the continent, where the ocean floor drops to a depth of more than 6,000 feet from 600 feet.
Opponents of dumping say that sophisticated new technology allows sludge to be treated so that it can be used in many beneficial ways. Among the recent innovations are giant centrifuges used in New York, which, like washing machines, rely on a spin cycle to reduce sewage to concentrated form.
 
'Sludge Has a Bad Name'
 "Just dumping this stuff in the ocean and pretending to forget about it is not an answer to any problem," said Nina Sankovitch, a senior project lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Sewage contains nutrients that harm the ocean but that when properly treated can be beneficial to soil. Sludge has a bad name but it doesn't need to."
Good sludge, filled with nitrogen and phosphorus, is essential for plant growth, and when metals and other poisons are eliminated it can be better than most manure. The shrubs and grasses of the newly renovated Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan were planted on a bed of genuine New York City sludge and the flowers and lawns of Gracie Mansion have prospered with its use.
Under the administration of former Mayor Edward I. Koch, the city bitterly fought the Federal ban on ocean dumping and delayed its enforcement for years. But in the long run, the delays may have cost the city money because it was unable to establish joint sludge plants with neighbors like Westchester and New Jersey that also recently stopped dumping.
"We could have saved a lot of money and done the right thing here," said Sarah L. Clark, a scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. "But at least, after years, we are finally getting out."
 
Few Like Landfills Either
 Mayor David N. Dinkins, who supported the ban on ocean dumping, will join environmentalists and William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, at a celebration in New York on Tuesday.
Some of the city's sludge is now taken to southern Virginia and buried in a landfill, an alternative that few scientists consider any better than dumping at sea. And New York has contracted with several private companies to process its sludge and dispose of it. But by the end of the decade it plans to set up its own processing plants.
Where they will go remains a thorny issue. A Citizens Advisory Committee has been meeting regularly with the city environmental department for three years. Mr. Appleton has discussed with residents throughout the city the need for such plans, and most agree that they are essential. But neighborhood leaders often wonder why it is essential to put them where they live.
"This is going to be a real problem for the city," said City Councilman Stanley E. Michels of Manhattan. "We have to put the things somewhere. It's half of what our lives are consumed by. Where should we put this? Where should we put that? And the ban will put enormous pressure on the city. But we are doing the right thing and we will rise above the partisan problems. It'll just take time."

HEADLINE: An Economics of Reality Professed by Rising Stars

BYLINE: SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
A new brand of labor economics is emerging from two academic hubs: Princeton University, a school famed in the 1950's and 1960's for leading-edge research on the subject, and Harvard.
And three young economists at those universities are among the rising stars of this new economics. David Card and Alan B. Kreuger of Princeton and Lawrence H. Katz of Harvard have created a stir with their findings that a higher minimum wage has not led to cutbacks in jobs. 
 The three economists have often crossed paths as students, professors and, most of all, as research fellows of the National Bureau of Research, probably the most important sponsor of empirical economic research in the nation. All three were inspired by two older labor economists: Orley Aschenfelter at Princeton and Richard Freeman at Harvard.
What distinguishes the new labor economics is a credo that stresses reality-checking. "The economic model of the world seemed really useful to me," said Professor Kreuger, who is 31 years old. "But it also seemed to be largely untested."
Practitioners of this new discipline look for "natural" experiments where they can compare two real-life situations; they try to be credible, and they gather evidence as if they were creating a collage.
"The idea is to try to find sharp natural experiments where there are exogenous variations in the variables you're interested in," said Professor Aschenfelter, a 51-year-old Princeton professor who is one of the deans of the new labor economics.
For example, just when Americans were getting nervous that immigrants were grabbing jobs from natives, Professor Card, who is 35 years old, studied the impact of the Mariel boatlift on Miami's low-wage labor market. "No effect," was his finding.
 
Making Things Credible
 The new labor economists constantly talk about seeking results that are plausible. "You try to make the work credible, believable and straightforward," said Professor Katz, who is 33 and occasionally teams up with his Princeton colleagues. "The most important word is credible." That means describing how results are attained in a forthright, hands-above-the-table fashion, he said.
The new labor economists also pride themselves on casting a wide net to create a fabric of evidence drawn from as many different data, time periods and countries as possible. They weave in anecdotes, analogies and, when necessary, their own telephone surveys.

HEADLINE: Forging New Insight on Minimum Wages and Jobs

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Contrary to one of the most widely accepted orthodoxies of modern economics, raising the Federal minimum wage may not prompt employers to trim jobs, new studies suggest, and therefore may not be such a bad way to help America's working poor.
The findings are likely to influence the growing national debate -- re-ignited by the Los Angeles riots -- over how best to reverse the deteriorating fortunes of young, less-educated workers. 
 That is especially likely because the Federal purse is, for all practical purposes, empty, and because of the growing political appeal of taxing business to, in effect, provide employee benefits like health insurance.
"It's not ideal; it isn't going to solve the long-term, big problems," Lawrence H. Katz, a Harvard labor economist and co-author of one of the studies, said of the minimum wage. "But it can, in the short run, provide extra income to those who work."
 
Winners and Losers
 Both liberal and conservative economists have long been convinced that the minimum wage law priced bottom-tier workers out of jobs. They recognized that a more generous minimum wage was good for those who were not dismissed as wages were raised, but worried that the losers outnumbered the winners.
Now, two unorthodox studies by economists at Princeton University and Harvard University have concluded that the most-recent rise in the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour -- a 90-cent increase phased in from April 1990 to April 1991 -- did not prompt employers to chop jobs.
That finding makes the case for modest increases in the minimum wage as an ingredient in future anti-poverty measures. But liberal politicians are not likely to push for another increase soon.
Still, Gov. Bill Clinton, in his Presidential campaign, recently announced that he favored indexing the minimum wage for inflation, which is tantamount to increasing it annually. And a battle over minimum wage levels looms next spring, with the expiration of a provision in the law that permits employers to pay newly hired teen-agers less than the minimum.
The findings of the new studies, which ignited a controversy among economists and sparked criticism from other researchers, were borne out in interviews with executives employing minimum-wage workers.
"It really hasn't affected the number of jobs we have," said Jim Hennessey, operations manager for Andy Frain, a Chicago agency that provides 600 ushers for sports and entertainment events each week.
When the minimum wage was raised, the company increased its starting salaries even higher, from $3.90 an hour to $4.40, 15 cents more than the Federal minimum.
"Paying that extra 50 cents helped us recruit," Mr. Hennessey said. "We're getting better kids."
Tim Supples, manager of several Roy Rogers restaurants in Mercer County in rural Pennsylvania, reported a similar experience.
"Our head count didn't increase or decrease," he said. "You're just going to manage a lot more tightly to get more out of the people we've got."
The Princeton and Harvard researchers focused on teen-agers -- about a third of the low-wage workers affected by the increase in the minimum -- to get a handle on the entire low-wage labor market.
"Whatever you find for teen-agers, my guess is true for low-wage workers," said David Card, a Princeton economist and one of the authors of the studies.
About two million workers earn the minimum wage or less. They are hamburger flippers and garment workers, sales clerks and janitors. Two-thirds are adults, and though some of the remaining third are teen-agers from affluent families, most teen-agers earning minimum wages are members of low-income families for whom the wages are an important source of income.
It was concern for these workers that led Congress to raise the minimum wage. Until the 1990 and 1991 increases, the Federal minimum had been frozen since 1981 at $3.35 an hour. As other wages rose, the minimum wage fell to its lowest level relative to average hourly pay since the 1950's.
 
Isolating the Effects
 One problem economists face in studying how raising the minimum wage affects jobs is the difficulty in isolating the effect of a wage increase from that of the myriad other economic forces influencing the labor market.
But in the Princeton study, Mr. Card created a control group from states not affected by the Federal minimum wage increase because they already had higher or equal minimum wage levels of their own.
Comparing states where as many as 50 percent of the teen-agers earned less than the new Federal minimum with states where virtually all teens were already earning as much or more, Professor Card found that teen-age pay rose sharply in low-wage states where the higher Federal minimum wage had the biggest impact. But, contrary to expectations, teen employment did not suffer as a result.
 
Comparing the States
 Take, for example, what Mr. Card found in 3 of the 50 states he studied: In Georgia -- where teen-age wages are among the lowest -- the new Federal minimum increased wages 14 percent, but employment edged up by four-tenths of 1 percent.
In Minnesota, by contrast, where teen-agers were already earning more than the new Federal minimum, wages went up only 3.9 percent but employment fell 4.1 percent. For New York -- another high-wage state -- wages went up 2 percent but employment fell 3.2 percent.
By comparing fast-food outlets in Texas in the same way that Mr. Card compared states, Professor Katz at Harvard and Alan B. Kreuger at Princeton found more hiring in stores where wages were most affected by the new Federal minimum.
What is more, Professor Katz and Professor Kreuger found that only a small number of the Texas fast-food employers were using the sub-minimum "training" wage that lets them pay new teen-age employees less than the minimum for six months.
 
Aimed at First-Timers
 Before the passage of the 1989 minimum wage law, President Bush, supported by many economists and fast-food companies, fought to exempt newly hired teens from the full increase in the adult minimum. The hope was that employers would be more willing to train first-time workers if they could pay them less and that this would hold down the job losses from an increase in the minimum wage.
But Professors Katz and Kreuger found that just 6 percent of the Texas restaurants surveyed were using the training wage, despite the fact that most were aware of that option and many had been able to hire workers at wages below the new minimum before the change in the law. More than 95 percent of employers paid trainees the adult minimum or higher.
"If anyone was going to use the sub-minimum, you'd expect it to be these companies with high turnover," Professor Kreuger said. Roughly half of fast-food workers are teen-agers, turnover averages 200 percent in many stores and most teens can learn their jobs within a few weeks.
 
Some Unanswered Questions
 The standard economic model predicts that if something costs more, in this case labor, consumers, in this case employers, will buy less of it. Speculating about why businesses did not react as expected to the latest minimum wage increase, the authors of the studies said that the labor market may not work that simply.
"Some employers thought it was O.K. because they were already paying more," said Professor Card, "and others said they wouldn't mind paying more if everybody paid more because it made life easier for them."
He added: "You can have high wages and low turnover and less recruiting, or you can have low wages, high turnover and more recruiting."
The new studies have already circulated as National Bureau of Economic Research working papers. They will also appear in the October issue of the Industrial and Labor Relations Review along with critiques and earlier surveys of California and Texas by the same authors.
 
Position of Critics
 But critics contend that the new studies are flawed because they were conducted too soon after the increase in the minimum wage.
"It's not that everybody goes out and fires workers, but that job growth is slower than it would otherwise have been," said William Washer, an economist at the Federal Reserve whose own study of 50 states from 1977 to 1989 supports the established view that higher minimum wages lead to job losses.
He and others also argue that the recent contrary experience, even if it is verified by future studies, cannot necessarily be generalized.
But the studies' authors argue that the wage increase was well publicized in advance, and that restaurants had fully adjusted to it. They also note that the latest wage increases -- 12 percent or so in real terms -- were relatively modest.
 
A Blunt Instrument
 Professor Katz admits that the minimum wage is a blunt instrument for fighting poverty and that other ways of providing relief to the working poor are far more efficient.
"It's untargeted," he said. "A bunch of middle class teen-agers benefit, too."
But given the new evidence and the fact that the Federal budget is tied in knots by the high deficit, the idea of levying a hidden tax on employers to provide assistance to the poor in the form of higher wages is likely to gain appeal.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
After a Lull Capitol Gets In the Mood To Legislate

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
Congress seems to be easing into a law-making phase, dealing with legislation on issues from aid to the nations that used to be the Soviet Union to unemployment insurance and enterprise zones.
In the first three months of the year, about the only major bill to go through Congress was a middle-class tax cut that was more of a political statement than a serious policy proposal, let alone a measure whose advocates expected it to become law. Indeed, some supporters would not have voted for it without the certainty of a Presidential veto. 
 More recently, Congress has managed to pass legislation on campaign finance and fetal tissue research that it knew President Bush would veto, but that it still believed should become law. It has passed an urban aid measure that he could sign, and it is trying to work out an enterprise zone bill he will not reject.
The change is most striking in the House, which spent weeks on intramural backbiting over the House bank and bitter Republican charges that the Democratic majority behaves despotically. Those irritants have not vanished, but the tone of a backyard slanging match is decreasing and the resemblance to a legislative body is getting stronger.
This month alone, it has seriously debated a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget, and then trimmed the first three appropriations bills before it. The House expects to deal with the jobless and enterprise zones this week, and may even get to legislation on health care and keeping families together the week after.
The Senate? Well, it was behaving like the Senate, with a filibuster over its effort to pass its balanced-budget amendment. But by Friday it seemed to have arranged to vote on aid to the ex-Soviet republics this week.
There are several reasons for this incomplete metamorphosis.
One is simply the calendar. This is the time of year when appropriations bills start commanding floor time. Moreover, if Congress is going to adjourn to campaign full time by early October, after time out for the party conventions and a little rest in August, there are only 9 or 10 weeks of scheduled legislative sessions left this year. If anything is to happen legislatively, it cannot wait much longer.
A second is that the distraction of the bank and other scandals seems finally to have run its course, and even lawmakers with check problems are now focusing on passing some bills so they can argue they deserve to be forgiven their overdrafts.
That approach corresponds with the argument that Speaker Thomas S. Foley has been making for months. The public's disdain for Congress, and by now for Mr. Bush too, is not really based on scandals or flubs, the Washington Democrat says, but on a national sense that the Government is failing to sense and address the urgency of the country's real problems.
Another reason, and one that matters more to Democratic leaders than to their followers, is the idea that by passing reasonable bills on important issues, the Democrats in Congress can help their party's all-but-nominated Presidential candidate, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
Neither side of this awkward partnership is sure enough of the other to be pressing for a big, formal consensus. But if the Democrats can pass popular bills that Mr. Clinton favors and Mr. Bush opposes, or even vetoes, they can claim proof that Americans ought to vote for unified Democratic government. That sort of argument, made most insistently by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, is one major force behind the efforts on health care and supporting disintegrating families.
Finally, making laws is what most members of Congress came here to try to do. As Mr. Foley observed in a commencement address at the University of Washington this month "A strong dedication to legislating remains the driving force that inspires members of Congress," he said. "If it were not so, believe me, many fewer would be seeking re-election this year."
For all the apparent transformation, however, tempers are still raw, and offensive partisan hyperbole a basic fact of legislative life. The fact that the change is probably not permanent was demonstrated Wednesday when Representative Robert S. Walker, Republican of Pennsylvania, said the Democrats were either treating Republicans like Old South slaves or behaving like Nazis themselves.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN -- Voices: Miami;
On the Economy, Well-Being and Confidence

 BODY:
Political experts, local officials and ordinary voters in several cities were asked to appraise President Bush's handling of the economy.
 
ESTEBAN FERRER
65, law partner in the international division of the law firm Shutts & Bowen
The problem with the economy is not directly related with the President. It has to do with the overburdening of soft costs -- the mass of regulation and controls imposed on the small-business man -- that's kicked us out of the world market. We don't produce here anymore, just buy. There's nothing the President can do. I would give Bush a passing grade but not an excellent one. 
 He paid too much attention to world matters and basked in the glory in Saudi Arabia. World matters are serious and require a lot of time and energy; he could have done more pressing on the home front to incite business to action. Congress is the bad guy. All they do is burden the producing elements more.
There are no incentives to save. All you see here is spending, spending, spending. Somebody else is always to blame.
 
Matty Bloom
37, special projects coordinator for health care projects at the Stein Gerontological Institute
I'm a professional woman with a master's degree from a good college, and the job market is even frightening to someone like me. I'm having to think about ways to protect myself with other skills. Imagine what it's like for one of the secretaries at my institute. I've always felt a strong social responsibility. Now I find myself torn, having to give up some of my ideals to guarantee a certain level of economic security.
If I choose to become a parent, there's even more pressure on me. We've seen a feminization of poverty during the Bush Administration. Women have to go back to work to support the family and without adequate support it's very difficult to do. Bush has failed to back policies that support women, children and the family.
There hasn't been much difference between the Reagan and Bush Administrations. Reagan's "lie," that money would flow down to workers, they'd have more money and more money would then be spent, hasn't happened.
 
Donald M. Jones
40 years old, associate professor, University of Miami School of Law
President Bush suffers from a set of misplaced priorities. Under the Bush Administration we found money for the B-1 bomber and for the S.& L. bail-out, but didn't find money for our cities or the education of our children or jobs for black and brown people. This failure to develop priorities to rebuild the cities and revamp the crumbling education structure has a lot to do with why Los Angeles and Atlanta went up in flames.
Bush failed to take advantage of the peace dividends. Bush followed Reagan's failed domestic policy and continued the old Republican strategy, old slogans and rhetoric long past the point where it's clear they're not working. Bush still clings to the metaphor of "A Thousand Points of Light," as if these were just the private problems of individuals.
The economic problem is related to biracial harmony which has slipped farther away. The White House has at best ignored, and at times opposed, civil rights legislation. A large share of the economic problem can be traced to racial disharmony. If Bush is re-elected, any improvement we see in the economy will be limited unless there are fundamental changes in attitude and the creation of jobs. The mishandling of this particular Republican President has been nothing short of a minor disaster. I am black, but don't think I speak solely as a black person. We're in trouble if we don't make some changes.

HEADLINE: Tax Fight in Florida May Halt Services

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., June 27

 BODY:
Having already vetoed two "no new taxes" budgets, Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida has told the Legislature that he will begin shutting down the government at 12:01 A.M. on Wednesday unless lawmakers agree to increase taxes.
The state's budget crisis has come to a head after years of rapid population growth without a corresponding change in Florida's tax structure. 
 Since January, with an election looming, Mr. Chiles and the Legislature have been wrangling over how best to modify Florida's tax system.
Unless they can agree on a budget by July 1, when the new fiscal year begins, the government will have no choice but to suspend many of the state's most visible operations, starting with the lottery.
"The hour is late and the clock is ticking," said Mr. Chiles, a Democrat, at a news conference here on Friday. He called on legislators from both parties to "put aside partisan politics and do the right thing," and he expressed hope that they would not allow the state "to fall off the cliff."
 
A Test of Wills
 Both sides are vowing not to be the first to blink in a test of wills that could plunge the state into financial chaos if it is not resolved by Tuesday. But the dispute appears to have irritated an already restless electorate in a year when all 160 seats in both houses are up for re-election. Strategists for both branches of government and both parties acknowledge that no matter what the outcome, voters could take a "plague on both your houses" attitude.
Florida's population has more than doubled since 1970, to 14 million people, making it the fourth-most-populous state. But the state is saddled with a tax structure inherited from the early years of this century, when it was one of the most rural and sparsely settled states in the union. Florida is one of seven states that has no personal income tax, and no one in either party is proposing such a tax as a solution to the current budget crisis. In a further complication, Florida's Constitution requires that the Legislature adopt a balanced budget.
Mr. Chiles's insistence on a tax increase during this election year is part of a sweeping promise he made to overhaul the state's way of raising money. A plank in his populist platform was to reduce the tax burden that has been borne by lower- and moderate-income people.
Three-fifths of the state's revenue is derived from a 6 percent sales tax, which falls heavily on tourists and the state's poorest residents; regressive levies, like those on alcohol, cigarettes, gasoline and betting, account for most of the other sources of income.
 
Sales Tax Would Expand
 Ever since the Legislature convened in January, Mr. Chiles has been pushing for a repeal of some 100 sales-tax exemptions on goods and services and for an end to exemptions from the state's corporate income tax, which is limited and relatively low. If lawmakers would allow him to do that, he has argued, the state would receive up to $1.35 billion in new revenue that would allow it to maintain health, education, police, environment and social service programs at current levels.
On a television call-in program on Thursday, Mr. Chiles contended that his tax overhaul could be accomplished with virtually no inconvenience to the average Florida resident. He said state studies had found that though there were 1.25 million corporations in the state, a mere 800 of them accounted for two-thirds of all corporate tax revenue. Many companies paid no taxes at all, he said.
"We have to ask somebody else who is not paying now to pay a little money," he said. "I'm trying to broaden the base" for tax revenue, he added, because the existing system "just does not make sense to me." However, Mr. Chiles has said that he does not plan to introduce a state income tax.
Mr. Chiles said that he found it particularly difficult to justify what he characterized as elitist sales tax exemptions, like those that "special interests" have obtained for luxuries that include maid service, dry cleaning and tanning services. He has coupled his arguments about expanding tax revenue with a plan to cut the sales tax to 5 percent and to reduce property taxes on homes valued at $150,000 or less, an action that would benefit most of the state's homeowners.
 
New Taxes Are Resisted
 But many lawmakers, Republicans in particular, have been arguing that the state needs to tighten its belt instead, and they have demanded both cutbacks in spending and a ban on any new taxes. The Republican minority leader of the State Senate, Ander Crenshaw, has been particularly vocal, describing Mr. Chiles's plan as merely "a prelude to a state income tax" that would halt Florida's economic growth by discouraging workers and corporations from moving here.
Many Democrats who might ordinarily support Mr. Chiles out of party loyalty have been reluctant to come to his assistance, citing fear of a voter backlash at the polls in November. The Governor spent much of the spring traveling around the state to explain his tax plan at town meetings and on media talk shows, but many Democrats say that he has not been effective enough in selling the plan to the public and that, as a result, public support for it is not there.
The lower chamber, in which Democrats have a 74-46 majority, actually approved earlier this month a compromise budget plan that would have included $516 million in new taxes. But the Senate, where the Democrats have only a tenuous 21-19 majority, has simply refused to consider the House package, holding fast to a package that would limit spending to $30.65 billion and not raise taxes, a proposal that Mr. Chiles has described as "terrible." On Friday afternoon, the Senate failed to override Mr. Chiles's latest veto.
To override a veto, both houses have to muster a two-thirds majority. Leaders of both chambers planned to meet with the Governor's representatives throughout the weekend to discuss other compromise plans in an effort to avoid what they are describing as "a meltdown" of the government on Tuesday night.
 
Emergency Could Be Declared
 At his news conference here on Friday, Mr. Chiles announced that he would sign on Monday an executive order declaring a statewide "fiscal emergency" and ordering nonessential state services to cease operations starting Wednesday, July 1. He said the popular Florida Lottery would be the first state agency to close and said other nonessential public services would also be affected, but he declined to identify them and asked state employees to work on a volunteer basis if a shutdown was required.
However, members of the Legislature have said privately that they expect Mr. Chiles to close the state parks just days before the Fourth of July holiday and that the motor vehicle license bureau might also be shut down. Mr. Chiles has repeatedly said that no matter how bad the crisis gets, he would not allow law enforcement, medical care and other basic public services to be affected.
A few lawmakers have sought to make light of the situation. Some have worn buttons that read "Non-Essential State Employees" on the floor of the Legislature. But there are abundant signs that the 130,000 state employees who could be affected by a shutdown are not amused.
Across the street from the capital, one civil servant has been parading with a sign that reads, "State Employee -- Will Work for Food," on one side and on the other says, "If I did my job the way the Legislature has -- I would be fired."
 
Election Worries Abound
 Some legislators appear to be worried that they may be swept away in a tide of anti-incumbent sentiment and disgust with the political process that seems to be building around the state. Senator Rick Dantzler, a Democrat from Central Florida, warned his colleagues that "there is going to be a tremendous amount of chaos this fall" when voters go to the polls, and members of the House have been joking during their deliberations that up to half of the 120 members of their chamber may not return.
"I have had it," Mr. Dantzler complained. "I am sick and tired of the brinksmanship."
Senator Malcolm E. Beard, a Republican from the same area, said his constituents were telling him that if there were any bombs "left over from Desert Storm," they should "drop them right here," on the state Capitol.
Even though Mr. Chiles, who was elected in 1990, does not face re-election until 1994, he may also have been bruised by increasing voter dissatisfaction. In a recent statewide poll, a narrow majority of respondents said they approved of the tax proposals he has suggested, but support dropped once his name was associated with the package.
As Mr. Chiles has acknowledged, there is a certain irony in this turn of events. When he declined in 1988 to run for re-election to the United States Senate, where he had served for 18 years, he said one of the main reasons for his decision was the continual wrangling over the Federal budget between Congress and the President.

HEADLINE: Iran Allows Foreigners To Buy Its Companies

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, June 28

 BODY:
Government officials have recently signaled that they are serious about allowing foreign companies to control plants and businesses in Iran.
In the hope of increasing foreign investment, the High Council for Investments at the Finance Ministry approved a measure last month to allow full foreign ownership of Iranian companies. Foreign ownership was previously limited to 49 percent of an enterprise. 
 The controversial measure was intended to attract hard currency into the country's stagnant economy, but many people here were skeptical that officials would actually open the country to such an extent.
 
Guarantees to Investors
 There also are guarantees of free return of capital to investors' home countries and payments of hard-currency damages if property is nationalized or confiscated in the future.
Finance Minister Mohsen Nourbakhsh said the new laws "do not specify any restrictions, and the limits of foreign investment will be decided by the High Council for Investments, which is made up of several Cabinet members."
While the United States, Israel and South Africa have been legally prevented from investing in Iran since diplomatic relations were severed in the late 1970's, American companies have routinely been able to trade with Iran through subsidiaries based in Europe or Canada, or through Iranian partners.
There is no indication so far of whether the policy change has succeeded in attracting new interest from foreign companies. Officials of the Finance Ministry acknowledged that Iran's need for capital had not been met under the previous 49 percent limitation.
Despite a long political history of resistance to foreign ownership of natural resources and industry, which culminated in state confiscation of foreign interests after the 1979 revolution, senior Iranian officials now say that political and economic policy making have been merged into a comprehensive collective to serve investors and the Iranian economy.
Economic experts say that even though greater foreign investment has been made legal, the huge bureaucracy, Soviet-style labor laws and inefficiency of the system remain the main obstacles for prospective businesses.
Moreover, Islamic moral codes with restrictions on dress, food and some aspects of social behavior may further discourage companies and individuals from considering Iran as an investment opportunity.
"We have to begin to see ourselves as a contributor to the global economy," Mohammed Taghi Banki, president of Iran's National Steel Company, said in a recent interview. Mr. Banki's company is offering more than 20 plants and mines for sale to the private sector. "We must become productive and businesslike," he added, "because the actions and reactions of that global system affect us."

HEADLINE: U.N. Asserts World Growth Is Hindered by Budget Cuts

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 28

 BODY:
The United Nations said today that over-reliance on market forces could be self-defeating and that too much emphasis on reducing government budget deficits was hindering economic growth.
In a 227-page World Economic Survey, the organization forecast that the global economy might grow 1 percent this year and as much as 3 percent in 1993. 
 But it said this growth would do little to reduce unemployment.
The prediction is similar to some other major economic surveys, but the United Nations report is more pessimistic, saying the recovery is fragile because governments are putting too much emphasis on bringing down inflation rather than promoting investment.
 
Employment Projections
 By 1993, it said, unemployment should be about 7 percent worldwide and about 10 percent in Western Europe. Inflation should be held in check and budget deficits should come down sharply, particularly in the United States. Currently, the American unemployment rate is 7.5 percent.
The report said the collapse of Communism and the failure of central planning prompted people to overlook some important government functions.
"The pendulum may have swayed too far in the direction of market orientation, leading to a neglect of the role and responsibility of the state," it said.
The state, it said, had an "indispensable function" in insuring education and health, maintaining an acceptable distribution of income and safeguarding the environment.
Although the report backs medium-term goals to reduce government deficits, it says the United States, Germany and Japan would be better off with half the budget cuts they plan.
If the United States also restored a 10 percent tax credit to stimulate private investment by 1996, it could add $200 billion to the world's total investment, the report said.
 
Day-to-Day Fluctuations
 But it warned that too many governments were capitulating to day-to-day fluctuations of foreign-exchange markets.
"Financial markets react negatively to any announcement of a policy of economic stimulation that they suspect of being inflationary," the report said. "The result is likely to be a rise in the interest rates demanded.
"So governments anxious for market confidence press for wage repression and zero inflation."
But it said the social cost of driving down inflation was likely to be very heavy and discourage investment.
"There is in fact no other way to resolve the economic and political crises multiplying in the world community than to give priority to the restoration of growth," the report said.
Only then would the world be able to realize a peace dividend, since shifting resources from military to civilian uses was nearly impossible during years of economic decline.
 
Benefits 'Frittered Away'
 So far, the report said, the peace dividend had been "frittered away in budgetary squabbles in the West and engulfed by economic chaos in the former Soviet Union."
Specifically, the report said the economies of developed nations would grow about 2 percent in 1992, with inflationary pressures likely to ease in North America but to increase slightly in Europe.
Among developing nations, African economies barely kept up with population growth, Latin America seemed to stir after a decade of stagnation, and growth in Asia remained widespread despite the slowdown in world trade.

HEADLINE: Machine-Tool Orders Drop 27.5%

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools plunged in May, the second straight monthly drop, though they remain higher for the first five months of 1992 compared with depressed year-earlier levels, a trade group said yesterday.
Economists said the figures from the Association for Manufacturing Technology appeared to reflect a broader pattern of mixed signals that have characterized the recovery. 
 "The economy is expanding but not at a very impressive rate," said Richard Hoey, chief economist for the Dreyfus Corporation, a New York investment firm. "It's like when you start a car and it sputters along in the winter, not hitting on all cylinders."
The association, based in McLean, Va., said preliminary orders in May for machine tools totaled $159.1 million, a 27.5 percent drop from $219.5 million in April but 4 percent above the $153 million for May 1991. Year-to-date orders totaled $1.06 billion, a 5.8 increase from January-May 1991.
Machine tools represent a small industry, and the monthly numbers can swing sharply. But because orders are often placed months before shipments, they often are a signal of the capital spending plans and optimism of manufacturers. Some economists also consider machine-tool orders a useful indicator because they reflect the strength in industrial production. Machine tools are used to make products ranging from washing machines to pickup trucks.
Albert T. Moore, the association's president, said May has been a slow month for the last three years. Mr. Moore also said that other trends in manufacturing, notably improved corporate profits and higher factory utilization rates, were positive indicators for improved orders later.
The May decline came after a 9.6 percent decrease in April from a month earlier.
 
Fewer Foreign Orders
 Part of the weakness stems from a drop in export orders, a reflection of weakening economies abroad. Export orders in May totaled $25.1 million, down 14 percent from $29.2 million a month earlier. Year-to-date export orders totaled $129.6 million, down 43 percent from the January-May 1991 level of $227.6 million.
Last week, the first significant indicator of a long-predicted plunge in American exports surfaced when the Commerce Department reported a $6.97 billion trade deficit for April, up from $5.58 billion in March. A key reason for the increase was a sharp drop in sales of goods to Japan and Western Europe.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Timetable for Cutting Rates: Probably Later Than Sooner

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Most credit market analysts expect another cut in short-term interest rates, but probably not when the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee meets tomorrow in Washington.
Nevertheless, many analysts argue that such a step would do little to cure the peculiar, perhaps unprecedented, problems on the economic landscape. And some suggest that another easing could do more harm than good. 
 The circumstances that prompted the Fed to cut rates many times in the past three years are in place today, analysts said.
 
Little Price Pressure
 After expanding in the first quarter at its most rapid rate since 1988, economic growth once again appears to be slowing, if not stalling. And business activity in Europe and Japan is far from robust.
Given that backdrop, analysts said it was difficult to imagine that inflationary pressures would be anything but benign for a year or two. Money-supply growth is weak, as is private credit demand. And labor costs are rising at a very slow pace.
"The Fed should ease," said Alan Sinai, president of the Boston Company Economic Advisers. "The economy did not snap back this spring, and there is almost no inflation risk for the next year to 18 months."
A drop in the overnight Federal funds rate of a quarter to a half a percentage point from its current level of 3.75 percent would almost immediately prompt commercial banks to cut their prime lending rates, now at 6.5 percent. That kind of reduction, Mr. Sinai said, would reduce costs on loans, increase profits and help to improve personal income.
 
Minimal Impact
 But a cut would probably not do much to spur demand even in sectors like housing and construction that are sensitive to interest rates, many economists argue. Such areas are beset with structural problems, not merely cyclical ones. Nor would it induce companies to take on big numbers of new workers or make consumers spend more freely.
"A cut in the prime wouldn't help much," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "You have to have a need to borrow money."
Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities, said: "I think the Fed is perplexed and surprised the sharp decline in interest rates has not reinvigorated the economy. But this is a very unique period, and what is inhibiting stronger growth is not something they can fix."
Indeed, the Fed runs the risk of doing more harm than good if a cut in short-term rates causes bond yields to rise, analysts said.
"With the housing sector just sort of sitting there, you don't want to do anything to damage the chances that long-term rates might go lower," said Leonard J. Santow, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a New York financial consulting firm.
 
Expected Third Quarter
 Nevertheless, Mr. Santow said he expected the Fed to ease policy in the third quarter, because the economy will remain sluggish and political pressure from the White House to cut rates will probably intensify.
But unless important economic data to be released this week show the recovery is fading fast, President Bush's efforts to sway the central bank last week almost certainly mean that a move will come later rather than sooner.
Mr. Bush's remarks "were self-defeating," Mr. Levy said. "The best way to keep inflation expectations down and the bond market calm is not to challenge the Fed's independence."
As a way to defuse criticism that a rate cut may be politically motivated, Mr. Santow expects that rather than approve a cut at tomorrow's meeting, the Fed governors will instead give Alan Greenspan, the central bank chairman, the discretion to lower rates before Aug. 19, the next scheduled meeting of the Open Market Committee.
 
Await Job Figures
 The meeting and the economic data due this week will be the focal points of the holiday-shortened trading.
Important statistics will be released every day, through Thursday, when the Labor Department will report on the June employment situation.
According to most economists, nonfarm payroll employment probably rose by around 100,000 in June. That sort of gain is not normally associated with a vigorous recovery, but it would probably be sufficient to delay any easing. But a payroll increase of 50,000 or less would almost certainly lead to an easing, analysts said.
"Logic says the Fed should wait until after the payroll numbers come out," Mr. Fine said. "And if the numbers are weak, the Fed will go. But if they show signs of improvement, policy will remain on hold."

HEADLINE: Review/Film;
An American Jazz Master Through European Eyes

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
On June 2, 1964, Eric Dolphy played bass clarinet, alto saxophone and flute with a trio of Dutch musicians for a Netherlands radio show called "Jazz Magazine." Most of the time, the show's sessions were broadcast live and were not recorded; Dolphy's set was taped because he was leaving before the day of the show. It was fortuitous. On June 29 he died in Berlin after collapsing onstage; the doctors assumed that the black American jazz musician was on drugs. But Dolphy had slipped into a diabetic coma, and without treatment he never regained consciousness. The Dutch recordings became his album "Last Date."
The radio sessions were photographed but not filmed, so Hans Hylkema's documentary "Last Date -- Eric Dolphy," which will be shown today and tomorrow at the Film Forum 2 as part of the JVC Jazz Festival, becomes a tease. Although it is a kind of biography of Dolphy, its unstated and perhaps unintentional subject is the relation of Europeans to jazz, as perennial fans and inevitable outsiders, hearing a mythic America that they distrust and long for. The manager of the Berlin nightclub Tangente, who didn't understand until it was too late why Dolphy was wolfing down ice cream and Coca-Cola, says: "I thought he's a black musician, and so he'll be on drugs. I was tolerant, but. . . ." 
 The film follows Thierry Bruneau, who is writing a Dolphy biography, to the places Dolphy lived, where neighbors and colleagues are interviewed; it shows streets and bridges and black children playing as if congratulating itself on its authenticity. The film also returns repeatedly to the Dutch musicians who played with Dolphy. The pianist, Misha Mengelberg, apparently still bears a grudge that Dolphy called him lazy for the trouble he was having with the complex music; the drummer, Han Bennink, is still in awe.
A portrait of Dolphy does emerge. He was a "practiceaholic," one colleague said, and he wanted to be the first black musician in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. During a spell without work in New York, he lived on white beans, bags of them in his closet, but he'd also buy groceries for unemployed musicians. And he loved the sounds of birds, which turned up in his improvisations.
"Last Date" grows frustrating as the film details reactions to Dolphy -- like a Dutch bass clarinetist trying to recreate a Dolphy solo -- rather than showing the musician himself. In a few astonishing sequences, filmed the night that Dolphy told Charles Mingus he was leaving the bassist's group to stay in Europe, Mingus alternately abuses and commends Dolphy; the documentary then cuts away from the music. If that footage exists at greater length, it would be far more illuminating than the film's arty shots of hands taking apart a saxophone and nestling it in its case.
As it stands, "Last Date" only shows snippets of Dolphy performing until the closing credits. Behind the list of European and American names, the subject of the documentary finally has his own say.

HEADLINE: Challenging a Myth in Los Angeles

 BODY:
The young people of South-Central Los Angeles who try to make life work are almost invisible. News about their riot-torn community leaves the impression that black and Hispanic teen-agers are mostly gang members and welfare spongers. To learn how misleading that is, ask the Walt Disney Company.
Disneyland's employment recruiters visited South-Central and found themselves swamped by dynamic young applicants, many of whom will enter college this fall. The company wished it could have hired more than 200 of them. 
 That's a tiny fraction of the jobs needed. Congress has finally passed an aid program that will provide 350,000 summer jobs nationwide. And the city's own task force, Rebuild L.A., is working on long-term strategies. The Disney initiative provides an example of the rewards of private hiring programs for inner-city youth.
The rioting destroyed hundreds of small businesses, sources of many jobs for young people. Without work, they cannot help support their fragile families or save money for college this fall. The Los Angeles schools close for the summer tomorrow. Bernadette Graham, career counselor of Manual Arts High School, says three-quarters of her students are still seeking jobs. Marguerite LaMotte, principal of George Washington Preparatory High School, worries about what will happen to her 300 college-bound seniors.
The young men and women of South-Central competed hard for Disneyland's 200 jobs, despite a two-hour commute. Disney officials spoke glowingly, for instance, of 18-year-old LaRonda Jones, who hopes to become a police officer after college. They were happy to land Olivia Miles, headed for Grambling University.
Disney's surprise was evident: "They were wonderful kids, outstanding kids," a Disney spokesman told Sara Rimer of The New York Times. "We didn't know they were there."
But of course they are there. Initiatives like Disney's could pay big dividends -- not only in L.A., the point of greatest need, but in every big city.

HEADLINE: Bridge

BYLINE: By Alan Truscott

 BODY:
The modern one no-trump response, forcing for one round, is more heavily loaded than the old-fashioned non-forcing variety. This is workable provided players resist the temptation to use the bid when a clearer alternative is available. On the diagramed deal North should certainly have responded two diamonds to one spade. As it was, he was in difficulty when his partner followed with three clubs, showing a big hand.
North took a wild stab at six spades, which would have been a reasonable contract if South's spade suit had been strong. As it was South's chances were poor. Obviously six diamonds would have been easy, making an overtrick, and six no-trump would have been a desirable spot in a match-point game. 
 The declarer was Parthasaradhi Mallela of DeKalb, Illinois, a professor of economics at Northern Illinois University. He recognized that entries to dummy were likely to be crucial, and made a key play at the first trick. When dummy played low and East played low, he won with the ace instead of the ten, judging correctly that West held the queen.
He led a spade and West put up the queen and misjudged. Another heart would have allowed the defense to prevail, but he returned his remaining trump. It did not matter whether or not East played the king, and he chose to retain it. South cashed dummy's diamond winners and ruffed a diamond, reaching this ending:
 
[Diagram]
Thanks to his farsighted play at the first trick, South was able to reach the dummy by finessing the heart jack. He then cashed the heart king, throwing his club loser, and led diamonds. East was helpless in a coup position: whether he ruffed the 9th, 10th, 11th or 12th trick, his spade king was doomed and the slam was made.

HEADLINE: More Revenues, but Thinner Profits, for Law Firms

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Despite the recession, the nation's 100 largest law firms collectively took in a record $13.9 billion last year and suffered only a slight decline in profitability, according to a study to be released today by The American Lawyer, a legal magazine.
Five New York firms with a total of 377 partners -- Cravath, Swaine & Moore; Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; Cahill Gordon & Reindel; Sullivan & Cromwell, and Davis Polk & Wardwell -- averaged at least $1 million per partner in profits. The least profitable firm on the list, Venable, Baetjer and Howard, of Baltimore, had an operating income of $20 million, or $155,000 a partner, on revenues of $72 million. 
 "For all the talk about this being a terrible time for law firms, it's just been a case of nipping at the margins," said Stephen A. Brill, the magazine's publisher. "It's no longer a situation where people can make as much money as they want to, but it's still extremely profitable."
Still, the revenue growth of 3 percent was the smallest gain since the first survey in 1985 and was not quite enough to compensate for the extra lawyers the top 100 hired. Revenues per lawyer fell to $371,000, down $1,000. And profits per partner declined for the second year in a row, falling 6 percent to $400,000.
The earnings slowdown reflects a variety of trends, including a decline in mergers, real estate transactions and other business deals that generate huge fees; a drive by many large corporations to do more of their legal work with staff attorneys, and pressures to limit or reduce fees for some services.
The total figures masked broader swings in the fortunes of individual firms. Vinson & Elkins, of Houston, saw total revenues plunge from $275.5 million, or 6th on the list in 1990, to $185 million, or 22nd, last year. Average profits per partner fell by 34 percent to $370,000. Gaston & Snow, a Boston firm that predated the Civil War, ranked 86th in 1990, went out of business last year.
By contrast, revenues for Baker & McKenzie, still No. 2 on the list, jumped 19 percent to $477.5 million, but were accompanied by a 21 percent increase in profits per partner to $375,000.
 
Smaller Firms Fare Differently
 Lawyers say that some of the same trends and the recession have probably had an even bigger impact on smaller law firms, whose performance is not covered by the survey.
But a survey of 650 law firms of all sizes released in April by Altman Weil Pensa Inc., a Philadelphia legal consulting company, showed that average revenue per lawyer was still rising for the profession as a whole, climbing five percent in 1991 to $231,000. Income figures also edged up, Altman Weil said.
The figures in both surveys may paint a very different picture from the experiences of individual lawyers in many law firms, especially the top 100. Most large law firms are acting more and more like the profit-minded businesses they serve. Lawyers are more likely to be fired or forced into early retirement than in the past. Those that stay are more likely to be paid based on how they perform.
 
Stability Among the Largest
 "But there's remarkable stability among the firms as a group," Mr. Brill said, noting that 90 of the top 100 were also on the list five years ago. Mr. Brill said that figures were also more reliable than ever, with about 90 percent of the firms giving the magazine "the equivalent of tax returns." In the other cases, which the magazine did not identify, it made estimates based on interviews with partners.
One of the firms that the magazine said declined to provide figures was Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, which the survey has annually ranked as the top revenue producer. The American Lawyer estimated that Skadden, Arps's total revenue slipped to $490 million, from $503 million in 1990, with profits averaging $925,000 for each of 216 partners.
"These are changing times," said Peter Mullen, the firm's managing partner. "We are all trying to keep our fees down."
Mr. Mullen dismissed the survey as "of little interest," saying that Skadden, Arps preferred to participate in an annual Price Waterhouse survey that separates law firms by size, provides average performance figures within groups, and does not name any firms.
 
 
Closely Scrutinized Listing
 But others, including headhunters who specialize in the legal profession, say the American Lawyer survey is the most closely scrutinized in the industry.
"Clearly, law firms make their numbers as impressive as they can, but people believe they are accurate enough to make them useful," said Mitchell Berger, president of Howard-Sloan Legal Search Inc., a New York placement service. "Law firms use them in recruiting. Lawyers looking to move to another firm also use them."
The revenues of the top 100 are a rough measure of the economy in their regions, but many of the firms generate much of their business in Washington or other cities outside their home base. An extreme case is Baker & McKenzie, based in Chicago, which has 484 partners and nearly 1,100 associates, about 90 percent of whom are based in other cities.
Increasingly, the big firms' distant lawyers are overseas. Baker & McKenzie, a leader in the trend, has 44 foreign offices. Skadden, Arps has 12 foreign offices, less than five years after opening its first one, in Japan. Mr. Brill described legal services as a successful export.
 
Lawyers' Capital: New York
 No matter how the data are sliced, New York continues to be the nation's legal powerhouse. One third of the top 100 are based here. New York and Chicago, home of 14 of the top 100, account for nearly half the list.
Skadden and 14 other New York firms make up the top 15, as ranked by revenue per lawyer, a reflection of how active they are and how much they charge. New York firms also fill 14 of the top 15 slots in profit per partner, ranging from top-ranked Cravath's $1.46 million to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison's $580,000. The lone interloper at New York's profits banquet, Kirland & Ellis, of Chicago, ranked 10th at $710,000.
 
New York a Pro-Bono Laggard
 New York is an also-ran, though, when it comes to the survey's assessment of how much free work lawyers perform for clients who are unable to pay.
All lawyers, regardless of work load, are expected to participate in or support such "pro bono" work, according to the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct. Among the cities with more than one Top 100 firm, San Francisco and Washington stand out as leaders in pro-bono work, according to the survey.
The pro-bono rankings are in the form of grades, running A through F. Morrison & Foerster, a San Francisco firm that ranks 15th in revenue, is the biggest money producer to receive an A. Among the anomalies was Cravath, the most profitable firm in the nation, which went from an A in pro-bono ratings in 1990 to an F in 1991.
Mr. Brill conceded that the pro-bono ratings were the most speculative part of the survey, because many firms did not keep accurate records and there were disagreements about what kinds of activities qualified. As a result, some firms that have relatively good pro-bono records receive F's because they do not provide information on them.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 2, 1992, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Monday about the finances of large law firms misattributed the information that Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom did not respond to a survey by American Lawyer magazine. It came from Skadden, Arps itself, not from American Lawyer, which does not disclose whether firms respond.

HEADLINE: Lining Up to Inspect an Old Friend

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
At 9:15 A.M. yesterday, 45 minutes before the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum opened its newly expanded and refurbished Frank Lloyd Wright building to the public, only about a dozen people lolled around the entrance on Fifth Avenue, near 89th Street.
"When the line forms I'm No. 1!," shrieked Karen Wehman, a city planner from Chicago, who had flown to New York especially for the occasion and had been waiting since 6:15 A.M. "I grew up around Frank Lloyd Wright buildings, and this is an esthetic inspection. I got here early because I figured this would be a major New York happening." 
But most of the early arrivals sat quietly along the edge of the museum's planters, soaking up the sun, reading the Sunday paper and sipping coffee. After a week of glittering parties and nonstop media hype, the crowd to see the $45 million renovation -- a seven-year project that closed the museum for two and a half years -- took a while to grow.
"I'm surprised it's so quiet," said William Weiss, a New York advertising executive who said he was disappointed that he was only No. 2 in line. "When the Museum of Modern Art opened in June of '84 I was No. 6," he recalled. "But if the Whitney ever undergoes its renovation, when it reopens I'll make sure I'm No. 1."
 
'Our Favorite Museum'
 About 10:30 the line began snaking around both sides of the museum. By 5 P.M. museum officials estimated that about 5,000 people had visited the museum, and they were hoping for 1,000 more before the 8 P.M. close. People came from Hawaii and Canada, the Netherlands and Tokyo. For some, the opportunity to be one of the first to walk the famous spiral ramp again seemed irresistible. "It doesn't really matter what art they're showing, it's our favorite museum because of the architecture," said Ronald Richler, a lawyer from Toronto.
Even neighbors couldn't wait to get inside. "I've been watching the building change every day," said Mary Englander, who lives nearby and was in line with her husband, Alan. "I loved the building as it was and I'm anxious to see just how useful this new addition is."
Bernard Gross, a retired professor of economics from Baruch College, remembers when the Wright building first opened in 1959. "At the original opening the concept of modern art was still in the process of development," he said. "It was a great source of controversy. The lines went on for a mile, in part because the architecture itself created such a fuss."
But this time, the museum's officials are quick to point out, there were two entrances and six cashiers to accept the $7 admission fees, as compared with one entrance and one person handling admission in the old days. The museum has also doubled its capacity. Gail Harrity, the deputy director for finance and administration, said the building could hold about 3,500 people.
Inside the rotunda, some viewers were perplexed by the installation of fluorescent lights by the Minimalist artist Dan Flavin. "It seems kind of empty," said Lucette Selman, a New Yorker. Christof Hahn, a German musician who lives in Arizona, said he was surprised that there were no paintings in the famous rotunda space.
 
Starting at the Top
 Visitors approached the building's galleries in different ways. Some started on the ground floor and worked their way up. "We did it the old-fashioned way: we started at the top," said Alan Englander. "We were disappointed. Some of the new galleries seemed cramped. Even the sculpture terrace looked small. Still, it's nice to have the museum back."
Thomas Krens, the museum's director, chose not to mingle with the crowds, but was closeted in the new cafe, hanging historical photographs of the Guggenheim from the museum's archives. "I'm making the selection myself," Mr. Krens said. The director said the cafe would not open until tomorrow because of a delay in fabricating the large aluminum counter intended by Wright but only now being made for the museum.
The lack of the cafe may or may not have had something to do with the bustle around the hot dog stand at the corner of 89th Street and Fifth Avenue. "I have been here since 1976 and my father ran the business before that," said the vendor, Futios A. Velis. "When the museum closed I gave them $1,000 toward the renovation. The building is looking new and beautiful. Today I've made good money, so I'm happy."

BYLINE: By Alan Truscott

 BODY:
The modern one no-trump response, forcing for one round, is more heavily loaded than the old-fashioned non-forcing variety. This is workable provided players resist the temptation to use the bid when a clearer alternative is available. On the diagramed deal North should certainly have responded two diamonds to one spade. As it was, he was in difficulty when his partner followed with three clubs, showing a big hand.
North took a wild stab at six spades, which would have been a reasonable contract if South's spade suit had been strong. As it was South's chances were poor. Obviously six diamonds would have been easy, making an overtrick, and six no-trump would have been a desirable spot in a match-point game. 
 The declarer was Parthasaradhi Mallela of DeKalb, Illinois, a professor of economics at Northern Illinois University. He recognized that entries to dummy were likely to be crucial, and made a key play at the first trick. When dummy played low and East played low, he won with the ace instead of the ten, judging correctly that West held the queen.
He led a spade and West put up the queen and misjudged. Another heart would have allowed the defense to prevail, but he returned his remaining trump. It did not matter whether or not East played the king, and he chose to retain it. South cashed dummy's diamond winners and ruffed a diamond, reaching this ending:
 
[Diagram]
Thanks to his farsighted play at the first trick, South was able to reach the dummy by finessing the heart jack. He then cashed the heart king, throwing his club loser, and led diamonds. East was helpless in a coup position: whether he ruffed the 9th, 10th, 11th or 12th trick, his spade king was doomed and the slam was made.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 37.45 on Expectations of Rate Cut

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
Wall Street posted its sharpest gains since early May yesterday, as many investors bet that interest rates would drop soon.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 37.45 points, to close at 3,319.86. Advancing issues led declining ones by a solid 1,221 to 581 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 The rally was broad based and included secondary stocks as well as blue-chip issues. Over-the-counter stocks also surged, with the Nasdaq composite index gaining 10.96 points, or 2 percent, to close at 558.80. Big Board volume totaled 176.8 million shares, compared with 154.8 million on Friday.
 
Bonds Gain, Too
 Yesterday's strong rally was set off by speculation that the Federal Reserve would respond to continued signs of economic weakness by lowering interest rates, possibly as soon as its policy-making Open Market Committee begins its meetings today.
This speculation also pushed bond prices moderately higher, and short-term interest rates fell to their lowest level in more than two decades.
"People took a little comfort that bonds were up," said John Blair, head of trading at County Natwest. But he added, "I don't think it's the beginning of a rally."
But others disagreed. "The market tends to go up before a long weekend," said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards. "I think it will trade modestly higher over the next four to six weeks," he said, adding that recent high levels of pessimism suggested a rise was likely.
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation, said that despite yesterday's surge, "the real fireworks for this week will have to wait" until after the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting and the employment report on Thursday.
Mr. Goldman said that while he was encouraged by the market's performance, "the only disappointment is that volume is moderate, which reduces the credibility of the lift."
Glaxo Holdings led the Big Board volume list, down 1, to 25 1/8. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette cut its rating to neutral from buy.
Shares of DFSoutheastern jumped 9 1/2, to 28. It agreed to be acquired by First Union in an exchange of stock. First Union shares slipped 3/4, to 38.
Waste Management fell 2 3/4, to 34 3/8. Citing the weak economy, the company said it expected second-quarter earnings to be below analysts' expectations. Prudential Securities lowered its earnings estimates for the company.
 
Medical Issues
 Some medical-related stocks staged a comeback. Medtronic rose 3 5/8, to 80 1/4; United States Surgical added 5 1/4, to 96 3/8; Medical Care International added 2 1/2, to 50 1/4; United Health rose 3 7/8, to 81 3/4, and Critical Care added 2 1/4, to 36 7/8.
 Shares of Microsoft jumped 5 1/2, to 72 1/4. Shearson Lehman Brothers repeated a buy rating, citing continued strong fundamentals.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 5.49 points, to 408.94. The American Stock Exchange index closed up 3.06, at 377.10.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.76 points, to 224.44.
The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of New York, American and over-the-counter issues -- was up 51.01 points, or 1.32 percent, to 3,926.61.

HEADLINE: Argentine Chief Suffers Setback as His Senate Candidate Loses

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, June 29

 BODY:
President Carlos Saul Menem suffered a political setback on Sunday when voters in the Argentine capital, apparently upset over continued scandal involving Government officials, gave his Peronist party's candidate for the Senate just 32 percent of the vote, while the opposition Radical Party candidate won with 50 percent.
At the same time, in the first municipal elections held in Chile since the military coup of 1973 that brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to power, mayoral and city council candidates supported by the centrist President, Patricio Aylwin, won 53 percent of the vote on Sunday, compared with 30 percent for right-wing parties. 
 Political analysts said the outcome of the elections buttressed the two-year-old return to democracy in Chile, and that in Argentina it represented a warning to President Menem that there was growing unease about his apparent inability to stem corruption.
An elated Mr. Aylwin said his coalition Government now "appears to be the only solid alternative of government, and the electorate showed the tremendous inclination on the part of Chileans not to return to conservative positions."
 
Constitutional Changes Sought
 Analysts in Chile also said Mr. Aylwin was now likely to push Congress hard to change major parts of Chile's Constitution. He wants the authority to remove General Pinochet as head of the army, to dismiss eight Senators appointed for life by General Pinochet before he left office in 1990 and to restructure the National Security Council, which is a military stronghold.
The Constitution was written by General Pinochet in 1980 and accepted by opposition politicians as a condition for elections.
One indication that President Aylwin might be successful came from Andres Allamand, president of the National Renovation party, a center-right group that has defended some Pinochet policies. He said his party would be willing to discuss constitutional reforms.
But members of the Union for Democratic Independence, strong supporters of General Pinochet, said they would oppose such changes.
Of the 7.8 million eligible voters in Chile, 90 percent turned out. Voting is mandatory, and those who refused can be fined $25 to $125.
The country voted for 2,082 mayors and council members in 334 cities and towns. During the 17-year Pinochet rule, municipal officials were appointed.
When asked about the elections after he had voted, General Pinochet said, "I have fulfilled my civic duty, period."
In Argentina, while the vote involved only one Senate position, it was one of the first political setbacks for President Menem, who campaigned hard for his candidate, former Health Minister Avelino Porto.
But analysts said the vote was not against Mr. Menem's economic recovery plan. The Radical Party candidate and winner, Fernando de la Rua, campaigned on issues of corruption and morality, and never made Menem economic policies an issue. Those policies have been widely praised for reducing deficits and inflation and creating a stable economy that has attracted foreign investment.
In the last year, Argentina has re-established lines of credit with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and also reached agreement with creditor banks to reduce its overall debt by more than 30 percent.
But corruption continues to dog Mr. Menem, with members of his Government repeatedly accused of wrongdoing. Several have been forced to resign.
Also, the public seems concerned about the degree of political power Mr. Menem now wields, in effect controlling Congress and the courts.
"The public likes the economic plan, but it wants more control over corruption and the overall political equilibrium," said Felipe Noguera, a political analyst and poll taker here.

Brazilian Stocks Plunge
 BRASILIA, June 29 (Reuters) -- Prices plunged by more than one-seventh of their total value today on Brazil's main stock exchange as leaders of the principal political party backing the beleaguered President, Fernando Collor de Mello, tried to quell rumors that they would leave the Cabinet over a corruption scandal.
Mr. Collor has been enmeshed in crisis over allegations that a former close aide set up a network of allies in the Government to steal money and sell favors.
Today, shares on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange fell 14.7 percent. and the central bank was forced to intervene heavily to prevent the cruzeiro, the nation's fragile currency, from falling too precipitously against the dollar.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Excerpts From the Justices' Decision in the Pennsylvania Case

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's ruling today in the Pennsylvania abortion case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, and David H. Souter jointly wrote an opinion for the Court upholding a portion of the regulations -- an "informed consent" provision and a 24-hour waiting period -- and reaffirming the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion, but declaring unconstitutional a requirement that women seeking abortions notify their husbands. Justices John Paul Stevens and Harry A. Blackmun each wrote an opinion arguing that all the restrictions should have been found unconstitutional.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia each wrote dissenting opinions, joined in both instances by Justices Byron R. White and Clarence Thomas, arguing that the Court should have overturned Roe v. Wade.
 
FROM THE DECISION
By Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter
Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt. Yet 19 years after our holding that the Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages, Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), that definition of liberty is still questioned. Joining the respondents as amicus curiae, the United States, as it has done in five other cases in the last decade, again asks us to overrule Roe.
At issue in these cases are five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 as amended in 1988 and 1989. The Act requires that a woman seeking an abortion give her informed consent prior to the abortion procedure, and specifies that she be provided with certain information at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed. For a minor to obtain an abortion, the Act requires the informed consent of one of her parents, but provides for a judicial bypass option if the minor does not wish to or cannot obtain a parent's consent. Another provision of the Act requires that, unless certain exceptions apply, a married woman seeking an abortion must sign a statement indicating that she has notified her husband of her intended abortion. The Act exempts compliance with these three requirements in the event of a "medical emergency," which is defined in Sections 3203 of the Act. In addition to the above provisions regulating the performance of abortions, the Act imposes certain reporting requirements on facilities that provide abortion services.
Before any of these provisions took effect, the petitioners, who are five abortion clinics and one physician representing himself as well as a class of physicians who provide abortion services, brought this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Each provision was challenged as unconstitutional on its face. The District Court entered a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the regulations, and, after a 3-day bench trial, held all the provisions at issue here unconstitutional, entering a permanent injunction against Pennsylvania's enforcement of them. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, upholding all of the regulations except for the husband notification requirement. . . .
And at oral argument in this Court, the attorney for the parties challenging the statute took the position that none of the enactments can be upheld without overruling Roe v. Wade. We disagree with that analysis; but we acknowledge that our decisions after Roe cast doubt upon the meaning and reach of its holding. Further, the Chief Justice admits that he would overrule the central holding of Roe and adopt the rational relationship test as the sole criterion of constitutionality. State and Federal courts as well as legislatures throughout the union must have guidance as they seek to address this subject in conformance with the Constitution. Given these premises, we find it imperative to review once more the principles that define the rights of the woman and the legitimate authority of the state respecting the termination of pregnancies by abortion procedures.
After considering the fundamental constitutional questions resolved by Roe, principles of institutional integrity, and the rule of stare decisis, we are led to conclude this: the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed.
It must be stated at the outset and with clarity that Roe's essential holding, the holding we reaffirm, has three parts. First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State. Before viability, the state's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a confirmation of the state's power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger a woman's life or health. And third is the principle that the state has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. These principles do not contradict one another; and we adhere to each.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Men and women of good conscience can disagree, and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage. Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code. The underlying constitutional issue is whether the state can resolve these philosophic questions in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter, except perhaps in those rare circumstances in which the pregnancy is itself a danger to her own life or health, or is the result of rape or incest.
It is conventional constitutional doctrine that where reasonable people disagree the Government can adopt one position or the other. That theorem, however, assumes a state of affairs in which the choice does not intrude upon a protected liberty. Thus, while some people might disagree about whether or not the flag should be saluted, or disagree about the proposition that it may not be defiled, we have ruled that a state may not compel or enforce one view or the other.
Our cases recognize "the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child." Eisenstadt v. Baird. Our precedents "have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter." Prince v. Massachusetts. These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.
These considerations begin our analysis of the woman's interest in terminating her pregnancy but cannot end it, for this reason: though the abortion decision may originate within the zone of conscience and belief, it is more than a philosophic exercise. Abortion is a unique act. It is an act fraught with consequences for others: for the woman who must live with the implications of her decision; for the persons who perform and assist in the procedure; for the spouse, family, and society which must confront the knowledge that these procedures exist, procedures some deem nothing short of an act of violence against innocent human life; and, depending on one's beliefs, for the life or potential life that is aborted. Though abortion is conduct, it does not follow that the State is entitled to proscribe it in all instances. That is because the liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the human condition and so unique to the law. The mother who carries a child to full term is subject to anxieties, to physical constraints, to pain that only she must bear.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Although Roe has engendered opposition, it has in no sense proven "unworkable," representing as it does a simple limitation beyond which a state law is unenforceable.

 	 	 		. . .	 	But to do this would be simply to refuse to face the fact that for two decades of economic and social developments, people have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail. The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. The Constitution serves human values, and while the effect of reliance on Roe cannot be exactly measured, neither can the certain cost of overruling Roe for people who have ordered their thinking and living around that case be dismissed.
No evolution of legal principle has left Roe's doctrinal footings weaker than they were in 1973. No development of constitutional law since the case was decided has implicitly or explicitly left Roe behind as a mere survivor of obsolete constitutional thinking.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We have seen how time has overtaken some of Roe's factual assumptions: advances in maternal health care allow for abortions safe to the mother later in pregnancy than was true in 1973, and advances in neonatal care have advanced viability to a point somewhat earlier. But these facts go only to the scheme of time limits on the realization of competing interests, and the divergences from the factual premises of 1973 have no bearing on the validity of Roe's central holding, that viability marks the earliest point at which the state's interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions.
The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional judgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs at approximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of Roe, at 23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some moment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetal respiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future. Whenever it may occur, the attainment of viability may continue to serve as the critical fact, just as it has done since Roe was decided; which is to say that no change in Roe's factual underpinning has left its central holding obsolete, and none supports an argument for overruling it.
The sum of the precedential inquiry to this point shows Roe's underpinnings unweakened in any way affecting its central holding. While it has engendered disapproval, it has not been unworkable. An entire generation has come of age free to assume Roe's concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions; no erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left Roe's central holding a doctrinal remnant; Roe portends no developments at odds with other precedent for the analysis of personal liberty; and no changes of fact have rendered viability more or less appropriate as the point at which the balance of interests tips. . . .

 	 	 		. . .	 	Our analysis would not be complete, however, without explaining why overruling Roe's central holding would not only reach an unjustifiable result under principles of stare decisis, but would seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a nation dedicated to the rule of law. . . .
The root of American Governmental power is revealed most clearly in the instance of the power conferred by the Constitution upon the Judiciary of the United States and specifically upon this Court. As Americans of each succeeding generation are rightly told, the Court cannot buy support for its decisions by spending money and, except to a minor degree, it cannot independently coerce obedience to its decrees. The Court's power lies, rather, in its legitimacy, a product of substance and perception that shows itself in the people's acceptance of the judiciary as fit to determine what the nation's law means and to declare what it demands.
The underlying substance of this legitimacy is of course the warrant for the Court's decisions in the Constitution and the lesser sources of legal principle on which the Court draws. That substance is expressed in the Court's opinions, and our contemporary understanding is such that a decision without principled justification would be no judicial act at all. But even when justification is furnished by apposite legal principle, something more is required. Because not every conscientious claim of principled justification will be accepted as such, the justification claimed must be beyond dispute.
The Court must take care to speak and act in ways that allow people to accept its decisions on the terms the Court claims for them, as grounded truly in principle, not as compromises with social and political pressures having, as such, no bearing on the principled choices that the Court is obliged to make. Thus, the Court's legitimacy depends on making legally principled decisions under circumstances in which their principled character is sufficiently plausible to be accepted by the nation.
The need for principled action to be perceived as such is implicated to some degree whenever this, or any other appellate court, overrules a prior case. This is not to say, of course, that this Court cannot give a perfectly satisfactory explanation in most cases. People understand that some of the Constitution's language is hard to fathom and that the Court's Justices are sometimes able to perceive significant facts or to understand principles of law that eluded their predecessors and that justify departures from existing decisions. However upsetting it may be to those most directly affected when one judicially derived rule replaces another, the country can accept some correction of error without necessarily questioning the legitimacy of the Court.
In two circumstances, however, the Court would almost certainly fail to receive the benefit of the doubt in overruling prior cases. There is, first, a point beyond which frequent overruling would overtax the country's belief in the Court's good faith. Despite the variety of reasons that may inform and justify a decision to overrule, we cannot forget that such a decision is usually perceived (and perceived correctly) as, at the least, a statement that a prior decision was wrong. There is a limit to the amount of error that can plausibly be imputed to prior courts. If that limit should be exceeded, disturbance of prior rulings would be taken as evidence that justifiable re-examination of principle had given way to drives for particular results in the short term. The legitimacy of the Court would fade with the frequency of its vacillation.
That first circumstance can be described as hypothetical; the second is to the point here and now. Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe and those rare, comparable cases, its decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It is the dimension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.
The Court is not asked to do this very often, having thus addressed the nation only twice in our lifetime, in the decisions of Brown and Roe. But when the Court does act in this way, its decision requires an equally rare precedential force to counter the inevitable efforts to overturn it and to thwart its implementation. Some of those efforts may be mere unprincipled emotional reactions; others may proceed from principles worthy of profound respect.
But whatever the premises of opposition may be, only the most convincing justification under accepted standards of precedent could suffice to demonstrate that a later decision overruling the first was anything but a surrender to political pressure, and an unjustified repudiation of the principle on which the Court staked its authority in the first instance. So to overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to re-examine a watershed decision would subvert the Court's legitimacy beyond any serious question.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The Court's duty in the present case is clear. In 1973, it confronted the already-divisive issue of governmental power to limit personal choice to undergo abortion, for which it provided a new resolution based on the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether or not a new social consensus is developing on that issue, its divisiveness is no less today than in 1973, and pressure to overrule the decision, like pressure to retain it, has grown only more intense. A decision to overrule Roe's essential holding under the existing circumstances would address error, if error there was, at the cost of both profound and unnecessary damage to the Court's legitimacy, and to the nation's commitment to the rule of law. It is therefore imperative to adhere to the essence of Roe's original decision, and we do so today.
From what we have said so far it follows that it is a constitutional liberty of the woman to have some freedom to terminate her pregnancy. We conclude that the basic decision in Roe was based on a constitutional analysis which we cannot now repudiate. The woman's liberty is not so unlimited, however, that from the outset the State cannot show its concern for the life of the unborn, and at a later point in fetal development the state's interest in life has sufficient force so that the right of the woman to terminate the pregnancy can be restricted.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Yet it must be remembered that Roe v. Wade speaks with clarity in establishing not only the woman's liberty but also the state's "important and legitimate interest in potential life." That portion of the decision in Roe has been given too little acknowledgement and implementation by the Court in its subsequent cases.
Those cases decided that any regulation touching upon the abortion decision must survive strict scrutiny, to be sustained only if drawn in narrow terms to further a compelling state interest. Not all of the cases decided under that formulation can be reconciled with the holding in Roe itself that the state has legitimate interests in the health of the woman and in protecting the potential life within her.
In resolving this tension, we choose to rely upon Roe, as against the later cases.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Some guiding principles should emerge. What is at stake is the woman's right to make the ultimate decision, not a right to be insulated from all others in doing so.
Regulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the state, or the parent or guardian of a minor, may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman's exercise of the right to choose. Unless it has that effect on her right of choice, a state measure designed to persuade her to choose childbirth over abortion will be upheld if reasonably related to that goal.
Regulations designed to foster the health of a woman seeking an abortion are valid if they do not constitute an undue burden. That is to be expected in the application of any legal standard which must accommodate life's complexity. We do not expect it to be otherwise with respect to the undue burden standard. We give this summary:
(a) To protect the central right recognized by Roe v. Wade while at the same time accommodating the state's profound interest in potential life, we will employ the undue burden analysis as explained in this opinion. An undue burden exists, and therefore a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.
(b) We reject the rigid trimester framework of Roe v. Wade. To promote the state's profound interest in potential life, throughout pregnancy the state may take measures to ensure that the woman's choice is informed, and measures designed to advance this interest will not be invalidated as long as their purpose is to persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion. These measures must not be an undue burden on the right.
(c) As with any medical procedure, the state may enact regulations to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion. Unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.
(d) Our adoption of the undue burden analysis does not disturb the central holding of Roe v. Wade, and we reaffirm that holding. Regardless of whether exceptions are made for particular circumstances, a State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability.
(e) We also reaffirm Roe's holding that "subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother." Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at 164 165.

The portions of the Court's opinion that I have joined are more important than those with which I disagree. I shall therefore first comment on significant areas of agreement, and then explain the limited character of my disagreement.
The Court is unquestionably correct in concluding that the doctrine of stare decisis has controlling significance in a case of this kind, notwithstanding an individual justice's concerns about the merits. The central holding of Roe v. Wade, has been a "part of our law" for almost two decades. It was a natural sequel to the protection of individual liberty established in Griswold v. Connecticut, The societal costs of overruling Roe at this late date would be enormous. Roe is an integral part of a correct understanding of both the concept of liberty and the basic equality of men and women.

 	 	 		. . .	 	I also accept what is implicit in the Court's analysis, namely, a reaffirmation of Roe's explanation of why the state's obligation to protect the life or health of the mother must take precedence over any duty to the unborn. The Court in Roe carefully considered, and rejected, the state's argument "that the fetus is a 'person' within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment."
After analyzing the usage of "person" in the Constitution, the Court concluded that that word "has application only postnatally." Commenting on the contingent property interests of the unborn that are generally represented by guardians ad litem, the Court noted: "Perfection of the interests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth. In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense." Accordingly, an abortion is not "the termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection."
From this holding, there was no dissent, indeed, no member of the Court has ever questioned this fundamental proposition. Thus, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, a developing organism that is not yet a "person" does not have what is sometimes described as a "right to life." This has been and, by the Court's holding today, remains a fundamental premise of our constitutional law governing reproductive autonomy.

Three years ago, in Webster v. Reproductive Health Serv., four members of this Court appeared poised to "cas(t) into darkness the hopes and visions of every woman in this country" who had come to believe that the Constitution guaranteed her the right to reproductive choice. All that remained between the promise of Roe and the darkness of the plurality was a single, flickering flame. Decisions since Webster gave little reason to hope that this flame would cast much light. But now, just when so many expected the darkness to fall, the flame has grown bright.
I do not underestimate the significance of today's joint opinion. Yet I remain steadfast in my belief that the right to reproductive choice is entitled to the full protection afforded by this Court before Webster. And I fear for the darkness as four Justices anxiously await the single vote necessary to extinguish the light.
Make no mistake, the joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter is an act of personal courage and constitutional principle. In contrast to previous decisions in which Justices O'Connor and Kennedy postponed reconsideration of Roe v. Wade, the authors of the joint opinion today join Justice Stevens and me in concluding that "the essential holding of Roe should be retained and once again reaffirmed."
In brief, five members of this Court today recognize that "the Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages." A fervent view of individual liberty and the force of stare decisis have led the Court to this conclusion.

 	 	 		. . .	 	At long last, the Chief Justice admits it. Gone are the contentions that the issue need not be (or has not been) considered. There, on the first page, for all to see, is what was expected: "We believe that Roe was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases." If there is much reason to applaud the advances made by the joint opinion today, there is far more to fear from the Chief Justice's opinion.
The Chief Justice's criticism of Roe follows from his stunted conception of individual liberty. While recognizing that the Due Process Clause protects more than simple physical liberty, he then goes on to construe this Court's personal-liberty cases as establishing only a laundry list of particular rights, rather than a principled account of how these particular rights are grounded in a more general right of privacy.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Under the Chief Justice's standard, states can ban abortion if that ban is rationally related to a legitimate state interest a standard which the United States calls "deferential, but not toothless." Yet when pressed at oral argument to describe the teeth, the best protection that the Solicitor General could offer to women was that a prohibition, enforced by criminal penalties, with no exception for the life of the mother, "could raise very serious questions." Perhaps, the Solicitor General offered, the failure to include an exemption for the life of the mother would be "arbitrary and capricious."
If, as the Chief Justice contends, the undue burden test is made out of whole cloth, the so called "arbitrary and capricious" limit is the Solicitor General's "new clothes."
Even if it is somehow "irrational" for a state to require a woman to risk her life for her child, what protection is offered for women who become pregnant through rape or incest? Is there anything arbitrary or capricious about a state's prohibiting the sins of the father from being visited upon his offspring?
But, we are reassured, there is always the protection of the democratic process. While there is much to be praised about our democracy, our country since its founding has recognized that there are certain fundamental liberties that are not to be left to the whims of an election. A woman's right to reproductive choice is one of those fundamental liberties. Accordingly, that liberty need not seek refuge at the ballot box.
In one sense, the Court's approach is worlds apart from that of the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia. And yet, in another sense, the distance between the two approaches is short -- the distance is but a single vote. I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on this Court forever, and when I do step down, the confirmation process for my successor well may focus on the issue before us today. That, I regret, may be exactly where the choice between the two worlds will be made.
 
FROM THE DISSENT
By Chief Justice Rehnquist
Dissenting in part and concurring in part
 The joint opinion, following its newly-minted variation on stare decisis, retains the outer shell of Roe v. Wade, but beats a wholesale retreat from the substance of that case. We believe that Roe was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases. We would adopt the approach of the plurality in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, and uphold the challenged provisions of the Pennsylvania statute in their entirety.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter cannot bring itself to say that Roe was correct as an original matter, but the authors are of the view that "the immediate question is not the soundness of Roe's resolution of the issue, but the precedential force that must be accorded to its holding."
Instead of claiming that Roe was correct as a matter of original constitutional interpretation, the opinion therefore contains an elaborate discussion of stare decisis.

 	 	 		. . .	 	In our view, authentic principles of stare decisis do not require that any portion of the reasoning in Roe be kept intact. "Stare decisis is not . . . a universal, inexorable command," especially in cases involving the interpretation of the Federal Constitution. . . . Erroneous decisions in such constitutional cases are uniquely durable, because correction through legislative action, save for constitutional amendment, is impossible. It is therefore our duty to reconsider constitutional interpretations that "depar(t) from a proper understanding" of the Constitution.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Our constitutional watch does not cease merely because we have spoken before on an issue; when it becomes clear that a prior constitutional interpretation is unsound we are obliged to reexamine the question.

 	 	 		. . .	 	In the end, having failed to put forth any evidence to prove any true reliance, the joint opinion's argument is based solely on generalized assertions about the national psyche, on a belief that the people of this country have grown accustomed to the Roe decision over the last 19 years and have "ordered their thinking and living around" it. As an initial matter, one might inquire how the joint opinion can view the "central holding" of Roe as so deeply rooted in our constitutional culture, when it so casually uproots and disposes of that same decision's trimester framework.

 	 	 		. . .	 	There is also a suggestion in the joint opinion that the propriety of overruling a "divisive" decision depends in part on whether "most people" would now agree that it should be overruled. Either the demise of opposition or its progression to substantial popular agreement apparently is required to allow the Court to reconsider a divisive decision. How such agreement would be ascertained, short of a public opinion poll, the joint opinion does not say. But surely even the suggestion is totally at war with the idea of "legitimacy" in whose name it is invoked.
The Judicial Branch derives its legitimacy, not from following public opinion, but from deciding by its best lights whether legislative enactments of the popular branches of Government comport with the Constitution. The doctrine of stare decisis is an adjunct of this duty, and should be no more subject to the vagaries of public opinion than is the basic judicial task.
There are other reasons why the joint opinion's discussion of legitimacy is unconvincing as well. In assuming that the Court is perceived as "surrender(ing) to political pressure" when it overrules a controversial decision, the joint opinion forgets that there are two sides to any controversy. The joint opinion asserts that, in order to protect its legitimacy, the Court must refrain from overruling a controversial decision lest it be viewed as favoring those who oppose the decision. But a decision to adhere to prior precedent is subject to the same criticism, for in such a case one can easily argue that the Court is responding to those who have demonstrated in favor of the original decision.

My views on this matter are unchanged from those I set forth in my separate opinions in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services and Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health. The states may, if they wish, permit abortion-on-demand, but the Constitution does not require them to do so.
The permissiblity of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting. As the Court acknowledges, "where reasonable people disagree the goverment can adopt one position or the other."
The Court is correct in adding the qualification that this "assumes a state of affairs in which the choice does not intrude upon a protected liberty," but the crucial part of that qualification is the penultimate word. A State's choice between two positions on which reasonable people can disagree is constitutional even when (as is often the case) it intrudes upon a "liberty" in the absolute sense.
Laws against bigamy, for example -- which entire societies of reasonable people disagree with -- intrude upon men and women's liberty to marry and live with one another. But bigamy happens not to be a liberty specially "protected" by the Constitution.
That is, quite simply, the issue in this case: not whether the power of a woman to abort her unborn child is a "liberty" in the absolute sense; or even whether it is a liberty of great importance to many women. Of course it is both. The issue is whether it is a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States. I am sure it is not.
I reach that conclusion not because of anything so exalted as my views concerning the "concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of life." Rather, I reach it for the same reason I reach the conclusion that bigamy is not constitutionally protected -- because of two simple facts: (1) the Constitution says absolutely nothing about it, and (2) the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The Court's description of the place of Roe in the social history of the United States is unrecognizable. Not only did Roe not, as the Court suggests, resolve the deeply divisive issue of abortion; it did more than anything else to nourish it, but elevating it to the national level where it is infinitely more difficult to resolve.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
Disunity Is a Tradition That Hurts Democrats

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
Paul E. Tsongas was chatting with Ross Perot last week. Jesse Jackson did his flirting the week before. Both men are Democrats, but both seem in a persistent state of pique with their party, and neither seems to pay much of a price for it.
Party discipline is not a fashionable concept, but it is a useful one when it comes to winning elections, especially in a three-way race. The Republicans know this. Their President remains stuck in the low 30's in public approval polls, he has been unable to find a galvanizing, positive message, and his performance on the trail has been shaky at best. But Republicans dutifully embarked on a surrogate strategy over the last few weeks aimed at shoring up their candidate by redefining Mr. Perot. And while doubts and frustrations about the course of the Bush campaign are rampant in the Republican Party, very few of them are publicly aired. 
 There is a certain clarity in the Republican mind when it comes to the business of elections, the getting and holding of power. Shortly before he fell ill in 1990, Lee Atwater, Mr. Bush's campaign manager, said in an interview about the 1988 election: "We had only one goal in the campaign: to help elect George Bush. The only reason we existed was to help George Bush." Mr. Atwater was Mr. Bush's man, and one of the most driven political operatives of modern times, but that attitude was not confined to him.
Democrats rarely display that singleness of purpose in Presidential politics. Perhaps, as some Democrats suggest, it is because the party has been out of power for so long; insurgent candidacies come and go, each with their own claim to legitimacy, and there is no Democratic Presidency to reward, punish and keep the warlords in line. Democrats also have a hard time ending primaries and closing ranks, which is one of the hallmarks of a successful party; losing candidates will often not leave the stage.
Mr. Tsongas is a case in point. The former Senator from Massachusetts won the New Hampshire primary, but then proceeded to lose, and withdrew from the race after overwhelming defeats in Illinois and Michigan. A few weeks later, he changed his mind, and opened the door to a re-entry in New York. A few days after that, he changed his mind again and announced that he would not re-enter the race.
He has undergone similar conversions on the question of endorsing Mr. Clinton. He told CNN on the night of the California primary that he was ready to support Mr. Clinton. A few weeks later, he apparently de-endorsed him.
Last week, Mr. Tsongas met with Mr. Perot, graciously described him in The Boston Globe as a man who "genuinely wants to do what is right for the country," and made the less-than-sweeping statement that it was "extremely unlikely" that he would support Mr. Perot.
Last weekend, after apparently striking a deal with the Clinton campaign that allows some of his pet policy proposals to be debated on the convention floor, Mr. Tsongas seemed ready to return to the fold. "He's not a traditional politician," said Ted Van Dyk, one of his advisers. "But he'll get there. He'll endorse and support the ticket."
It is a measure of the Democratic psyche that many in the party grumble not about Mr. Tsongas's conduct but about the Clinton campaign's being insufficiently solicitous of him.
This inability to recognize that the other guy won is not confined to Mr. Tsongas or to Edmund G. Brown Jr. Mr. Jackson chose not to run this time, yet still has a hard time leaving the stage. He offered himself as a running mate in April, unveiled his economic platform in May. He is not ending this primary season with more than 1,000 delegates and 6.8 million votes, as he did in 1988. He did not turn into the broker of the black vote in the primary season, as many expected.
Still, Mr. Jackson has a talent for drawing news coverage, and he has a long and strained relationship with Mr. Clinton, which was only exacerbated when the Governor chose to rebuke Mr. Jackson's Rainbow Coalition for giving a platform to the rap performer Sister Souljah. For several days Mr. Jackson winked and nodded and said open-minded things about Mr. Perot. The flirting chilled after a top political adviser to Mr. Perot, Edward J. Rollins, suggested on television that the Perot campaign was not terribly interested in Mr. Jackson's endorsement.
Mr. Jackson has argued throughout his career, explicitly and implicitly, that his cause and his message transcend conventional politics. So does Mr. Tsongas. But presumably both men are Democrats because they consider the Democratic Party, and a Democratic Presidency, most amenable to their cause and to the constituents they hope to serve. The logical outgrowth of that, in olden days, was the art of rallying around the nominee when the primaries were over.
It could be, and has been, worse for the Democrats. Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, correctly notes that the party has far less of the bitter ideological feuding that has riven it in years past. But in a three-way race, with the Democratic nominee currently in third place, the Democrats will badly need some of the Republican single-mindedness.
One of the biggest tests will come at next month's convention. Can rank-and-file Democrats restrain themselves from holding forth on the weaknesses of their nominee? Will the various warlords and 1996 wanna-be's summon some enthusiasm for Mr. Clinton? Or will they revel in their diversity, their openness to debate, their moral authority, and look down on the Republicans' grubby little obsession with winning?

HEADLINE: Markets Surge as the Fed Prepares to Discuss Rates

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
Financial markets surged today on the eve of a Federal Reserve Board meeting as investors bet that the Fed would soon reduce interest rates -- just as President Bush called for last week.
But many Fed watchers said Mr. Bush's call for lower rates could end up delaying a rate cut because the Fed cannot be seen as bowing to political pressure. They say a Fed that is viewed as responding to the White House might lead investors to question the central bank's commitment to fighting inflation. That could push up the long-term rates that are crucial to home-building and capital investment, defeating efforts to help the economy by lowering rates. 
 Even so, the financial community was looking hopefully today to the Fed and its key meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Wall Street, the stock market posted its sharpest gains since early May in a rally that pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up 37.45 points, to 3,319.86. In the credit markets, short-term interest rates fell to their lowest level in more than two decades. [Pages D8 and D16.]
Many Fed watchers think that some recent weak economic reports -- including one today -- have heightened the chances of a rate cut. The Government reported today an unexpected 5.6 percent decline in sales of new homes in May, while the April figures were revised from a gain to a 2.7 percent decline.
Last week, economists were surprised when the Government reported a 2.4 percent decline in May for sales of cars, refrigerators and other durable goods. In addition, retail sales and personal income have shown anemic growth in recent reports.
"The economy is in a kind of modest recovery, but it's not the kind of recovery that I would like to live with," said Stephen Axilrod, a longtime economist for the Fed who is vice chairman of Nikko Securities. "It needs a little more bolstering, and particularly it needs some bolstering in the housing area, which is critical to recovery."
But even if the Fed agrees, it will have a harder time acting now, some economists said. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's main policy-making group, which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, comprises the Fed's seven governors and the five presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks.
The Fed's governors are said to be more split than usual going into this week's meeting. As a result, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, might be not only the helmsman but also a swing vote.
David M. Jones, a longtime Fed watcher at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York securities house, said the three Bush appointees -- Lawrence D. Lindsey, Susan Phillips and David W. Mullins Jr. -- were leaning toward a rate cut. He said the Reagan appointees -- Wayne D. Angell, Edward W. Kelley Jr. and John P. LaWare -- had indicated in recent weeks that they were satisfied that growth was taking hold and no further cuts were needed. Fed watchers say there are also divisions among the branch bank presidents on the Open Market Committee.
Many economists say that rather than heed political pressures or pull out his hair over the meaning of the latest money-supply figures, Mr. Greenspan might do what he has often done before: let economic statistics steer him.
"I think the Fed will weigh heavily this Thursday's employment and unemployment numbers," said Henry Kaufman, head of a New York economics consulting firm, noting that the May numbers were disappointing.
"If there should be further weakness in the unemployment situation, I think they will respond with a lowering of the Federal funds rate, and there is an even chance if the employment numbers are weak, even a modest reduction of the discount rate."
Mr. Kaufman, who supports a rate cut, called the President's remarks "unfortunate." "The central bank tries to display its impartiality," he noted, and what Mr. Bush said "reduces the chances of a central bank response."
Other economists agreed. "Bush's statement makes the situation much more difficult for the Fed to move," Mr. Jones said.
He added: "If a President in an election year, who is looking bad in the polls, tells you to ease, and you ease immediately, then you will be perceived as easing for political purposes. Then long-term bondholders might give up on the Fed as a credible inflation fighter, and that might push up long-term rates."
 Not everyone agrees that the Fed should cut rates now. Some economists -- including some Fed governors -- argue that the recovery has taken hold and no further stimulus is needed. They fear that further easing could send inflation out of control once the economy picks up.
Some economists say the recent weak economic numbers should be discounted somewhat, arguing that they look weak mainly because the first-quarter housing and retail spending numbers were so strong, buoyed by mild winter weather.
The Fed has lowered the Federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge on overnight loans to one another -- to 3.75 percent from almost 10 percent three years ago. The discount rate, the rate at which the Fed makes loans to banks, is 3.5 percent, down from 7 percent in 1989. But despite the Fed's cuts in short-term rates, long-term rates seem to refuse to budge much below 8 percent.
 But supporters of a rate cut argue that the Fed is being too cautious. Mr. Bush, for example, said last week, "Inflation appears to be under control."
Advocates of a rate cut point to low growth in M-2, the most closely watched gauge of the money supply, and say this could mean not enough money is being made available for loans. M-2, which includes most bank deposits and money market funds, inched up less than 2 percent in the last year.
In a news briefing today, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said he worried that the slow growth in the money supply could drag down economic growth.
Within the Fed itself, governors are debating how to interpret, and how to react to, the weak M-2 numbers. Some governors say it is not worth paying much attention to M-2, asserting that it is often dragged down by unusual factors. For example, many people are moving their money from certificates of deposit, which are counted as part of M-2, to mutual funds, which are not.
Mr. Brady said that since the Fed's governors are no longer certain how trustworthy their money-supply gauges are, it would be wiser for them "to overinsure in terms of money supply" to sustain economic growth.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Justices Ease Way to Challenge Land-Use Rules That Prevent Development

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
Ruling in a closely watched case on property rights, the Supreme Court today made it easier for some property owners to challenge land-use regulations and demand compensation from the government if "confiscatory regulations" prevent them from developing their land.
But the 6-to-3 decision stopped well short of the sweeping vindication of property rights that many conservatives had hoped for when the Court agreed last year to hear a South Carolina property owner's challenge to a state law barring waterfront development. 
 The Court, in a majority opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, overturned a ruling by the South Carolina Supreme Court that found David H. Lucas, the owner of two valuable waterfront lots on the Isle of Palms, entitled to no compensation after he lost the right to build on his land. The law, the Beachfront Management Act, took effect in 1988, two years after Mr. Lucas had paid $975,000 for the two lots in the expectation of building two houses on the barrier island.
 
Defining 'Regulatory Taking'
 Mr. Lucas argued that the new law was a "taking" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, which forbids the government to take private property without "just compensation" to its owner.
Historically, the "takings clause" was thought to apply only when the government actually took physical possession of the property, as in an eminent domain proceeding. But more recently the Court has created and then struggled to define the concept of a "regulatory taking," under which the government must pay compensation when the value of private property is impaired by regulation while still remaining in private hands.
The Court today did not declare that Mr. Lucas was entitled to compensation. Rather, the Court said in effect that the South Carolina Supreme Court had been too quick to say that he was not. Justice Scalia's majority opinion sent the case back for further findings in the state courts.
The case, Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, No. 91-453, had the potential to produce a broad ruling that could affect nearly all environmental regulation and other land-use regulations like the designation of private property as landmarks.
 
Court Wrote Narrow Opinion
 But the Court wrote a narrow opinion, discussing the concept of a regulatory taking only in the context of a regulation that deprives a property owner of all economic value in the property. That is a small category of property owners, because government regulations are much more likely to reduce the economic value of land rather than render the property entirely worthless.
"When the owner of real property has been called upon to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economically idle," Justice Scalia said, "he has suffered a taking."
But the Court emphasized that even in such a circumstance, the government was not necessarily required to pay compensation. It must pay, Justice Scalia said, only if the regulation prohibiting development cannot be justified under the state laws or state court decisions concerning land use.
For example, Justice Scalia said, the owner of a lake bed could be denied a permit for a landfill operation that would result in flooding nearby land, because under common law principles that prohibit people from using land in a way that harms the public, filling in a lake bed would never have been permitted.
 
'Changed Circumstances'
 Similarly, he said, a public utility could be required without compensation to close and remove a nuclear power plant from a newly discovered earthquake fault line, even if the value of the property was completely destroyed, because the common law has never permitted people to create public nuisances on their property.
Justice Scalia also indicated that newly perceived dangers, to the environment or in other contexts, may be sufficient to validate a land-use regulation. "Changed circumstances or new knowledge may make what was previously permissible no longer so," he said.
In reconsidering this case, the South Carolina courts will now have to decide whether there are principles of state land-use law that support the state's decision to restrict further development on the barrier islands. Justice Scalia said that to carry this legal burden, the state cannot be "conclusory" and "must do more than proffer the legislature's declaration that the uses Lucas desires are inconsistent with the public interest."
His opinion suggested that the state would have a difficult time meeting this test. But Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, suggested that there was considerable weight on the state's side. He said that regulating the use of the beachfront "is a traditional and important exercise of the state's police power, as demonstrated by Hurricane Hugo, which in 1989 caused 29 deaths and more than $6 billion in property damage in South Carolina alone."
 
Dissenting Opinion
 Factual examinations of this sort are likely to become the hallmarks of land-use debates. Jerold S. Kayden, a lawyer and land-use regulation expert in Boston, said today that the decision could have the effect of increasing the role for state courts. He said the decision took a "responsible" approach that was "in no way a radical departure" for the Court. "It continues to allow government to go quite far in regulating land use," he said.
Justice Scalia's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy filed a separate concurring opinion.
Justice David H. Souter filed a separate statement, saying that the Court should have dismissed the case without deciding it because the evidence in the state courts had been insufficiently developed to show whether, in fact, the Lucas property had lost all its economic value.
In addition to Justice Stevens, Justice Harry A. Blackmun also filed a dissenting opinion. "Today the Court launches a missile to kill a mouse," he said, adding that the majority had devised an unworkable test and displayed an "unjustified hostility" toward state legislatures.
 
Other Developments
 In other developments on the final day of the Supreme Court term, the Justices indicated that they had no interest in further exploration of the First Amendment's prohibition against the official "establishment" of religion. The Court denied review in a dozen cases that had been awaiting consideration while the Justices were reviewing the commencement prayer case from Providence, R.I., that they decided last week.
Justices White, O'Connor and Thomas voted to hear an appeal by the city of Zion, Ill., which was founded as a religious utopian community in 1902 and has always had explicitly Christian imagery on its city seal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, last year declared the seal to be a violation of the establishment clause. Because four Justices must vote to hear a case, the Seventh Circuit's decision stands undisturbed. (City of Zion v. Harris, No. 91-299).
Accepting an appeal from the State of Nevada, the Court agreed to decide whether prison officials violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by placing a nonsmoking prisoner in the same cell as a chain smoker. This issue has been raised in a number of prison systems, producing different results. In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled that the Eighth Amendment did apply if the nonsmoking prisoner could show that his health was at risk and that the prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his welfare. (Helling v. McKinney, No. 91-1958).

HEADLINE: The Summer Forecast: Widespread Wanderlust

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
More Americans will be traveling this summer than at any time in recent years, barring prolonged bad weather, a steep rise in gasoline prices or some other unexpected calamity.
At beach resorts, national parks and big cities across the nation, hotels and rental car companies are bracing for a robust summer, starting with the Fourth of July weekend and running through Labor Day. 
 One exception to the summer optimism is Los Angeles, where even before the Southern California earthquakes on Sunday, tourism was expected to be down as a result of the riots in the spring. Another exception is Hawaii, where reservations were canceled as people booked flights to less expensive destinations. Hawaii and Alaska were not included in the recent 10-day half-price sale on air fares, in which more than 25 million tickets were sold for summer travel in the 48 contiguous states.
"People who never flew before and probably won't fly again came in here and bought tickets just because they wanted something for half price," said Mayo Read of the Palmetto Travel Service in Charleston, S.C. "When seats to their preferred destinations were already filled up, they bought tickets to wherever there were seats available, figuring at that price they might as well see places they hadn't seen before."
Dr. Miriam Hoffman of Harding Township, N.J., for example, is flying to Albuquerque, N.M., on July 20. "I recently returned from vacation in Egypt," said Dr. Hoffman, who is in charge of staff development for the East Brunswick, N.J., public schools. "But I've always wanted to see the American Southwest, and when I read that I'd be able to fly to Albuquerque for $190 round trip, I couldn't resist."
 That sale aside, the increased travel seems to be driven by pent-up demand: last year many people stayed home, pinched by the nation's economic slump. And foreign travel to the United States is also expected to increase 6.5 percent over last summer, to 12.4 million visitors, says the United States Travel and Tourism Administration in Washington, which is a part of the Commerce Department. Seattle, San Antonio, Washington, Atlantic City and Orlando, Fla., are all expected to have record numbers of foreign visitors, as are the Grand Canyon and Alaska.
The number of Americans taking vacations overseas also appears to be on the rise, helped by some attractive advance-purchase air fares offered in the spring.
Jeffrey Beer, a New York television and movie producer, said he and his wife and infant daughter planned to vacation in Sweden in July.
"But we're going to buy our tickets from a 'bucket shop,' " he said. A bucket shop, also known as a a consolidator, sells tickets for seats the carriers are unable to fill. Offering discounts of up to 50 percent, most consolidators specialize in international flights.
Club Med, which sells packaged vacations, reported that bookings were up as much as 30 percent from last summer. Michael Kubin, the president of Club Med Sales Inc., said, "It's pretty well across the board, but the Caribbean and Mexico are both strong."
 
Most Travel Still by Car
 But for all the excitement created by the discount air fares, the vast majority of summer travel will be by auto. Before the sale on air fares, more than 80 percent of summer vacations this year were expected to be made by auto, and that figure is not expected to change substantially. The cost of travel by car has risen by one of the smallest rates in 15 years, and the American Automobile Association says the average family of four traveling by car should expect to pay $210 a day for food, lodging and auto expenses, just 90 cents more than last year.
The frenzy generated by the air fares spilled over to buses, trains and motor-coach tours, each of which has reported increased summer bookings. Hertz is adding 30,000 cars this summer, to cope with the demand generated by air travelers.
Garry Wasserman, a New Orleans lawyer, recently flew to Las Vegas, Nev., with his wife, Lynn, and their 8-year-old daughter, Allison, then rented a car to drive to the Grand Canyon and Colorado.
 
Saved Enough to Rent a Car
 "When we originally booked our flights, it came to $360 each," Mr. Wasserman said in a recent telephone conversation from the Grand Canyon. "After the air fare discounts, we got a $458 credit on our credit card." That, he said, was more than enough to pay the $179 weekly rate on his rental car and a $200 fee for returning it in Denver.
Many hotel chains say reservations are running as much as 30 percent ahead of the last several years, largely from people traveling only because of the low air fares. Howard Johnson and Days Inn of America say guests are booking rooms for more nights than usual -- a sure sign, they say, that the reservations are for recreation, not business. Other signs of a robust summer abound.
The nation's national parks are expecting more than 276 million visitors in 1992, up from 267.9 million last year.
"Last year we had 4.2 million visitors, up about 12 percent," said Maureen Oltrogge, a spokeswoman for the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. "Through May of this year we have been up 26 percent. But our attendance could very well increase even more this summer, because the low air fares have made it cheaper for some people to get here."
Cheaper, but not necessarily easier once they arrive. Many popular parks were already overflowing with cars and visitors in recent summers, and at some, even campers and backpackers need permits.
"The best advice I can give is to arrive before noon, and come during the week rather than on weekends," said Chris Gomez, a ranger at the Rocky Mountain Regional Office in Lakewood, Colo. While 14 parks accept telephone reservations for campgrounds, each also sets aside campgrounds for first-come, first-served arrivals.
Lodging, though, is another matter. All 905 rooms in Grand Canyon National Park and the 125 rooms a few miles outside "are basically sold out every year from March until Nov. 1," said Jane Gillespie, the sales director for lodging. An additional 575 rooms are scattered among hotels and motels within 80 miles of the park, but hardly enough to accommodate the more than 20,000 visitors who descend on the park each summer day.
 
Rebound for Theme Parks
 In Orlando and Anaheim, Calif., where theme parks and other attractions suffered in last year's economic slump, officials say the air fare sale has led them to increase their estimates for an improved 1992 summer season.
"We had some concern after the Los Angeles riots, but the low air fares caused an immediate flurry of bookings at our hotels," said William Snyder, president of the Anaheim Area Visitor and Convention Bureau.
Because of the air fares, "What was turning into a recovery summer is now shaping up as outstanding." said Bill Pepper, the director of the Orlando/Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau.
The Excalibur and Flamingo Hilton, the two largest hotels in Las Vegas, saw bookings spurt after the air fare sale, which ended June 5. "We had fairly heavy advance reservations for the summer," said Vince Manfredi, a spokesman for the 4,032-room Excalibur, "but after the fare slash the phone calls and bookings went through the roof."
Washington expects an increase in visitors over last year, when many popular tourist destinations experienced a downturn. "Our increase may be more than we planned on," said Marie Tibor, the director of tourism for the city's Convention and Visitors Association, "because the drop in air fares generated thousands of additional calls for tourist information."
Alaska also appears headed for another big season. Even though flights to Alaska and Hawaii were not included in the sale, Conn Murray, the state's director of tourism, said cruise ships to Alaska were heavily booked, as were hotels along the Alaska Highway, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary.
"So far we have not seen signs that people are canceling their airline reservations to go elsewhere," he said.
Hawaii is a striking exception to the rosy forecasts.
"We expect our visitor traffic to be down 1 to 3 percent during the third quarter," said Hillary Kelly, vice president of sales for the Hawaii Visitors Bureau, adding that visits from the mainland are expected to be off as much as 5 percent.
Travel agents and hoteliers in Hawaii say the low fares for travel among the 48 states led to many cancellations of bookings. Ms. Gillespie at the Grand Canyon said, "Our California numbers are up because people in Southern California can't afford to fly to Hawaii."
 
Caution in Los Angeles
 In Los Angeles, the scene of riots and looting in late April after the acquittal of police officers in the beating of Rodney King, tourism officials are not optimistic.
"We were looking for a general citywide hotel occupancy of 65 to 68 percent," said Shelby Allen, at the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau. "Now it's probably going to drop into the low 60's or high 50's."
But New York City expects a strong summer, including its strongest July in five years, because of the Democratic National Convention, which will be held in Manhattan from July 13-16, and the Columbus Quincentennial, which will be celebrated over the Fourth of July weekend.

HEADLINE: Agreement Reached on Restoring $900 Million for School Rebuilding, Officials Say

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration and the Board of Education have agreed to a plan that would restore $900 million to the long-term effort to rebuild New York City's schools, officials involved in the talks said yesterday.
The agreement is to be announced this week, perhaps as soon as today, the officials said. It represents a major turnaround for the $4.3 billion, five-year school reconstruction program, which was trimmed by more than $900 million a year ago when the city had to cut back substantially on its capital budget because of the region's severe recession. 
 Many of the city's 991 schools, which serve more than 973,000 students, are in dire need of repair. More than half are at least 50 years old. The five-year rebuilding plan includes 50 new schools, 30 annexes and the remodeling of 70 schools. The cuts ordered last year represented a 20 percent reduction in the rebuilding effort.
Some of the reductions were restored in the following months, but disappointment over the major pullback in the ambitious plans to overhaul the schools was so deep that the president of the city's School Construction Authority, Charles E. Williams, resigned in anger over the cuts last September.
 
Plan to Issue Bonds
 Since April, the Dinkins administration and the Board of Education have discussed an innovative plan that would allow them to restore nearly all the school construction money that was eliminated last year.
The two sides have now settled on the unusual arrangement, in which the city for the first time would issue bonds backed by state aid for school construction.
The state money is distributed under formulas based on the amount of school rebuilding that municipalities undertake. Because the city has significantly stepped up its reconstruction efforts in the last three years, it qualifies for a larger share of the state money, the officials said. The city has been receiving about $40 million a year in state rebuilding money, but the size of the annual aid is expected to grow to as much as $95 million by 1996.
The expected revenues from this increased state aid would be used to finance $900 million in long-term city bonds, which would then be spent on renovating schools and building new ones. The plan would not involve additional spending by the city, which has trimmed its capital budget drastically in the last two years to reduce the amount of interest it must pay each year for rebuilding.
 
Fighting Over Cuts
 The agreement follows months of sometimes bitter sparring between the Dinkins administration and the Board of Education. Officials have fought over the size and nature of city budget cuts -- both for ordinary operating expenses and for reconstruction -- and whether budget cuts were responsible for a drop in city reading and mathematics test scores that were announced last week.
Each side has also accused the other of not living up to fiscal commitments and of failing to disclose budget information in an accurate and timely matter.
James S. Vlasto, a spokesman for the Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, declined to comment on the plan yesterday. Mayor David N. Dinkins's chief spokesman, Leland T. Jones, said last night that both Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Fernandez were pleased about the agreement.
"If minds are our most important product, then our schools are a vital means of production," Mr. Jones said. "This is something the Mayor would very much like to do and that the Chancellor would very much like to do."
Mr. Jones said that both sides had agreed in April to restore about $700 million in the rebuilding cuts, and that they had now agreed, after recalculating the financing, that they could restore $900 million.
The restored money is to be used during the last two years of the School Construction Authority's five-year rebuilding plan. The authority was created to reduce building costs and construction delays that had plagued the Board of Eduction.
The authority is completing the third year of its plan today. It committed more than $1 billion in construction contracts over the last 12 months, and has met its rebuilding goals in each of its first three years.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Long Fight for Local Support Hampers Bush on Education

SERIES: The Bush Record -- Fifth article of a series

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEMPHIS

 BODY:
Four years after George Bush took office proclaiming himself to be the "education President," he can point to few tangible accomplishments that have improved the nation's schools.
But President Bush and his aides do claim credit for starting a movement called America 2000 that they say will force fundamental changes in American education. It has spawned local education reform drives like one here in Memphis and in more than 1,000 other communities across the country. 
 Memphis is a laboratory for Mr. Bush's contention that the answer to American educational ills lies not with Federal Government programs but with local initiative.
Asked in a recent interview to name his most significant domestic initiatives, the President's very first response was: "I think clearly the education initiative," and he pointed specifically to the "many America 2000 communities" across the country.
 
The Bedrock Assumptions
 His strategy assumes that American schools will be transformed, not with more money but through vouchers that allow parents to use public funds to pay private school tuitions, through local community efforts like Memphis's, and through the use of innovative new schools as well as national tests and curriculum standards.
Yet from educators and others on the right and the left come the same complaints that dog Mr. Bush in many other areas of domestic policy as well -- that he has articulated lofty conservative principles but has failed to rally the nation behind them or to follow through so his plans are actually put into action.
"The President has talked a good game," said Elsie Lewis Bailey, principal of Booker T. Washington High School in Memphis and a leading member of the drive to improve the city's schools. "But I can't applaud anything at this point that he has done to make a difference."
Mrs. Bailey's school stands amid housing projects where students fight daily battles with drugs and death. Washington High is a stark illustration of the policy rift between Mr. Bush and his critics. The President assumes that education problems are best solved through a process like the one under way here, in which parents and communities take the responsibility to encourage academic achievement and counter social breakdown.
But many educators believe the ills of American schools require a larger Federal plan, a detailed urban agenda and a great deal more money than Mr. Bush shows any sign of wanting to spend.
These educators say there is little hope that Washington High's students can conquer the poverty and despair that are the blight of so many inner-city lives until the Government also offers broader initiatives to counter the urban ills that so often lead to school failure. Chief among them are drugs, street violence, inadequate health care, glaring inequities between rich and poor school districts and broken families.
At Washington High, Fredderick Dupree, Sharon Page and Kalinda Garner had little trouble listing what their school does not have: a chemistry or biology laboratory, enough athletic equipment, up-to-date textbooks.
"We have a lot of honor students here, and they do want to be somebody," said Fredderick, who hopes for a career in math, science or medicine. "When you don't have the equipment, it just saddens you."
Even though all three students are excelling in school, in many ways they are exceptions. They watch as their neighbors and classmates struggle and, in some cases, succumb to poverty, teen-age pregnancy, parental neglect and violence.
"From what we see, people are dying every day," Fredderick said. "You don't know when you might go."
 
Vision
A 'Summit' Yields National Goals
 President Bush gets praise from educators for the first concrete action he took as education President: an "education summit" in Charlottesville, Va., in 1989 at which he and the nation's governors agreed on six broad, national goals. These include making sure all children are healthy and intellectually stimulated enough to start school; catapulting American students from near the bottom among industrialized nations to the top in world math and science achievement; raising the high school graduation rate from about 75 percent to 90 percent; erasing illiteracy and making schools safe and drug-free.
But educators waited nearly two years for clues about how President Bush thought Americans could achieve these goals. Then, in March 1991, Mr. Bush appointed Lamar Alexander as Secretary of Education. While Governor of Tennessee, he won praise for trying to improve Tennessee's schools. In Washington, Mr. Alexander quickly drew up the new education strategy.
The Federal Government has never spent much money on education -- it now pays only 6 percent of all public education costs, from kindergarten through high school, a drop of almost 40 percent from the level before President Ronald Reagan took office. But even without a White House pledge of major new spending, most educators welcomed Mr. Bush's emphasis on parental responsibility, local community action and curriculum standards.
At the same time, though, critics have attacked Mr. Bush's plan, saying it depends too heavily on model schools while neglecting inner-city issues. In fact, even his advisers concede that Mr. Bush's overall approach to education works best for his core Republican constituency -- white, middle-class, suburban families.
"Crisis one is middle-class kids who aren't learning much," said Chester E. Finn Jr., a key architect and still a backer of the Bush policy who is now helping to design a national network of private, for-profit schools organized by Christopher Whittle. "Crisis two is underclass kids for whom not learning much is just one of their problems. The same solutions don't apply to both. It may be that America 2000 over all is better tailored to crisis one, but that's probably two-thirds of American kids."
 
Behind the Voucher Plan
 Still, President Bush and his aides claim to be champions of the poor as well, asserting that their voucher proposal serves that end. Vouchers -- allowing parents to take their children out of public schools and use the money that would have been spent on them there to pay private school tuition -- is an idea dear to the Republican right wing.
In his current budget proposal, President Bush is asking for $500 million for vouchers of $1,000 that families with low or middle incomes could spend each year on public, private or parochial schools. The idea, Mr. Alexander says, is to give poor and middle-class families the same choices in schools that the well-off already have.
But Mr. Bush's endorsement of vouchers has also drawn vehement and well-organized opposition from those who believe it is nothing less than an attack on the very idea of public schooling. Critics believe it would skim off the best students with the savviest parents for private schools, leaving public schools to teach only the students who are handicapped, disruptive or neglected.
"This is a fundamental mistake, driven by ideological concerns," said Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, a Democrat who has led the governors' efforts on education improvement and who has worked closely with the White House on education policy. "It's like saying we're going to shock you into change by taking your best students and resources out of here."
 
Reality
Needed: Cash And Consensus
 While President Bush and his aides say his greatest legacy will be the long-range education plan, they also point to some increases in spending. The Education Department's budget has increased by 22 percent after inflation during his term, and Federal spending has risen for college tuition grants as well as for math and science programs.
The biggest increases have gone to the Head Start preschool program. During his first campaign, President Bush pledged to finance Head Start so all eligible 4-year-olds could take part. He has asked for and got the largest increases in Head Start spending since the program was founded in 1965 -- the budget has risen by 78 percent since he took office -- and he is requesting another 27 percent increase for next year. By the Administration's estimate, this will create enough slots to serve all eligible children for one year, instead of the 60 percent the Administration says it now serves.
But critics say the program has always been designed to serve 3-year-olds as well as 4-year-olds. And so, they add, the program now serves only 28 percent of those eligible.
Mr. Bush's supporters also say the Government has made progress in some other areas of the President's overall education plan. Education specialists in and out of government, using $5 million in Government money, are drawing up broad standards in several subjects that will lay down what students should know by certain points in their academic careers.
But many of Mr. Bush's key proposals have died in Congress. Democratic majorities have refused to approve vouchers, and there seems to be little chance they will do so soon. Congress has turned down a request for $500 million to begin operating 535 new showcase schools because Democrats believe that creating such schools will not improve the 110,000 existing public schools.
Even conservative organizations, though they praise the President's ideas, say Mr. Bush has failed to do what leaders must: drum up enough support for his proposals.
"The stuff on paper is great," said Stuart M. Butler, director of domestic policy studies for the Heritage Foundation. "But there is absolutely no follow-through politically with any of these items. It's a deficiency of the White House in general in the domestic area."
Democratic aides on Capitol Hill who negotiated with the Administration on the President's education proposals say officials essentially gave up on Congress when they realized they would have to compromise. "I think they wanted 100 percent, and when they couldn't get 100 percent, they just sort of walked away from it," said one Democratic Senate aide.
Mr. Alexander, who is normally quite genial, stiffens when he hears such talk. He tells of deals that fell through when Democratic legislators got pressure from teachers' union leaders and other educators.
"By instinct, I'm a big coalition builder," he said. "Right now, with the current composition and leadership of Congress, it's almost a waste of my time."
Mr. Butler says the President should have joined the battle himself.
"There's a very stark alternative -- Lyndon Johnson," Mr. Butler said. "He put the political finger on people and said, 'These people are holding up a solution to these problems.' "
 
Commitment in Memphis
 Mr. Bush's defenders say the view from Washington is skewed, because the real results of his policies can be seen in places like Memphis.
As for the Bush plan, Mr. Finn said, "It seems to me in a year's time to have done much of what it was intended to do. It's had a consciousness-raising effect, a catalytic effect on a lot of states and communities to at least take the pledge."
At the same time, he added, "I don't know how much of an effect it's had so far on real practice."
By the Education Department's count, 44 states and 1,200 communities have agreed to draw up plans to improve their schools. Mr. Alexander says this is the vanguard of a "populist crusade" that will transform public education.
Others are more skeptical. Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, dismisses all of it as a "dog and pony show," a series of pep rallies that cost nothing but make people feel as if they are doing something.
Memphis shows both the possibilities and the limits of this approach. A bipartisan, multiracial coalition of 850 local leaders and citizens is analyzing what ails the city's schools and how to change them. Many, like Mrs. Bailey, refused to join unless the effort specifically repudiated the Bush voucher plan. They got that assurance and hope to have a final plan this fall.
Everyone who has worked on "Memphis 2000" praises it as serious and broad-based. The question is whether the well-meaning effort will actually improve the schools.
Mayor Willie Herenton, who served as Memphis's superintendent of schools for 12 years and was an early skeptic, said his test will be whether this coalition calls for higher taxes for education. Memphis spends $3,568 per pupil, well below the national average of $5,237. And leaders of the Memphis drive say they now have a powerful new coalition that would campaign for more money if the schools adopt the changes they want.
In Washington, Mr. Alexander has made no estimates or promises, other than to say that more money might come from the Federal Government if the America 2000 communities can present a good case.
 
Prospects
What Investment Beyond Money?
 In the end, the judgment on Mr. Bush's education record will rest on how to define what an education President should do.
Many educators believe part of the answer is more money. But President Bush has consistently denounced spending more on a system he sees as flawed.
"Putting money first -- we did all that in the 1980's, and it didn't work," Mr. Alexander said.
Overall spending on education at all levels of government has actually risen 33 percent in inflation-adjusted terms over the last decade, without dramatic improvements in American schools. But as the Federal share of that spending has shrunk, other cuts in Federal aid to cities and states for social programs have also left them less able to pay for education.
Mr. Bush claims that a President should provide leadership, not money. He does win wide praise for trying to shake Americans from their complacency, issuing a long-overdue call to parents and local communities to take their share of responsibility.
But others say vigorous leadership in education demands much more than President Bush has given. An education President, they say, should urge voters to approve local bond issues or new taxes if schools present a convincing reform plan. And they add that the crisis in American education demands a bolder, more ambitious Federal plan.
"I believe so much in the need to go to grass-roots America," said Governor Romer. "But it doesn't do anything for people to go out and get them all ginned up and then give them no design to proceed. There's not enough substance to it. You need to have a President out talking not about those generalities, but who's going to pay for what and who's going to do each piece of it, what's our time line and our priority, and I want to put that above a Sea Wolf and a bomber."
Critics as far apart politically as Governor Romer and Mr. Butler of the Heritage Foundation say that President Bush comes up short partly because he seems unable to galvanize the electorate the way Ronald Reagan did.
But his defenders say Mr. Bush just isn't being heard.
"If anyone will listen to President Bush on education," Mr. Alexander said, "he has a wonderful vision."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Ease Push for Policy Shifts by Germany and Japan

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
After long pressuring Germany and Japan to do more to stimulate world growth, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that the United States would not prod them so hard at the economic summit meeting in Munich because they seem ready to adopt policies that Washington has favored.
With the United States plagued by slow growth for more than two years, Mr. Brady had been pushing other major industrial nations to focus more on spurring growth, not only to help increase American exports but to help bolster the economies of the former Soviet bloc and the developing world. 
 In a news briefing today about the meeting of the seven largest industrial democracies in Munich next week, Mr. Brady said he was pleased that Japan's ruling party said it would stimulate that nation's faltering economy through increased Government spending and other measures worth more than $45 billion in the current fiscal year. Mr. Brady called this move "substantial" and said "it certainly addresses growth."
Mr. Brady also praised the German Government for indicating that it would hold spending growth to 2.5 percent or less next year. American officials have clashed with Germany in recent months after Washington called on Germany to reduce its budget deficit to give Germany's central bank some leeway to reduce its interest rates, which have helped push up rates elsewhere in Europe. German officials responded angrily to Washington's pressures, saying it was hypocritical for the United States to scold others about budget deficits.
Today, Mr. Brady talked as if his differences with Bonn were a thing of the past. He praised Bonn's promised spending discipline, saying "That is the first step to bringing down interest rates."
Mr. Brady said aid to Russia would be one of the main topics at the summit meeting, which will bring together the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations from July 6 to 8. President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia will be flying to Munich to meet with the Group of Seven leaders.
The seven nations are the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
In briefings today, American and Canadian officials said the leaders would also discuss the fighting in Yugoslavia, the environment, debt relief for developing nations and aid to the other former Soviet republics.
At the summit, the Group of Seven leaders are expected to approve a vast aid package to help the former Communist nations make their nuclear reactors safer.
Mr. Brady said he also hoped that the summit meeting would give some impetus to stalled world trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round. The talks are deadlocked because of a dispute between the United States and the European Community over how much to cut subsidies to farmers.
"If I could wave a magic wand over one problem" at the summit, Mr. Brady said. "I'd wave it over the Uruguay Round."

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Administration's Regulation Slayer Has Achieved a Perilous Prominence

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
In an airy office down the hall from the Vice President's, an Indiana lawyer with dark eyes and dawn-to-dusk work habits basks nervously in the limelight of power.
At the age of 34, David M. McIntosh has amassed great influence in the loftiest councils of the White House, and his ideas, praised by industrialists and vilified by conservationists, have lifted the President's environmental policies to the top of the domestic and international agenda. 
 In Washington's power stakes, Mr. McIntosh is hot. As executive director of the President's Council on Competitiveness, chaired by Vice President Dan Quayle, he is the leader of the Bush Administration's sweeping assault on environmental regulations and on the public's authority to intervene in Government decisions on natural resources.
 
Regulation Slayer
 It was Mr. McIntosh who championed the Administration's move last week to give companies broad rights to increase their emissions of air pollution. The new rule was vintage McIntosh.
Last summer he wrote the Administration's proposal to open half the nation's wetlands to development. The rule has been held up because of disputes in the Administration over the provision.
It was he who developed the legal and philosophical basis for the President's decision in January to halt new regulations and rewrite old ones to make them friendlier to American industry. The impact has affected dozens of regulations to date.
Last month, the competitiveness council proposed easing restrictions on testing and marketing genetically engineered crops and organisms.
Mr. McIntosh was also at the center of a group of young White House aides who proposed removing restrictions on storing and disposing of 45 percent of the nation's hazardous wastes.
 
Enmeshed in Rio Leak
 But in the heave and surge that characterizes policy making in Washington, only the slimmest barrier separates being hot from getting burned. Though Mr. McIntosh is virtually unknown outside the Government, his prominence within it has generated resentment, envy, even fury among his enemies, who include prominent Democrats in Congress and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, William K. Reilly.
Earlier this month, Mr. McIntosh found himself at the center of an international furor that threatened, at least momentarily, to halt his ascent. Mr. Reilly, the chief United States delegate at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, sent a confidential message to Mr. Bush urging him to reverse his position and sign a treaty to protect wild species.
The President was deeply embarrassed when the message was made available to The New York Times by Mr. Reilly's opponents, who thought he might succeed. And Mr. Reilly accused the Vice President's office and the Council on Competitiveness of being the source.
Mr. McIntosh denied the allegation, and Bill Kristol, the Vice President's chief of staff, called it "totally false." But the blowup, which revealed the struggle between conservatives and moderates in the Administration, brought tension to the formerly confident council. Mr. Bush called the disclosure "insidious" and ordered the Department of Justice to investigate. Mr. McIntosh, who had freely expressed his views to reporters, was ordered not to grant interviews or make public statements.
Mr. Reilly made the accusation because Mr. McIntosh was the principal author of an April memorandum that persuaded President Bush not to sign the treaty because it would harm American biotechnology companies. The decision earned the United States international condemnation at the Earth Summit, isolating it from its closest allies.
 
'A Rational, Objective View'
 In an interview before the disclosure, Mr. McIntosh carefully chose his words. "We have a small staff, seven or eight people," he said. "What we are trying to do, to the extent possible, is looking at issues and deciding what to do based on a rational, objective view of the facts. Too often, policies have been undertaken that are not based on a rational view.
"You get a scare about cyclamates years ago, so saccharin is brought in as a replacement. That turns out to be worse for you, but you have a political backlash and can't do anything about it. To some extent you can't avoid that. Politics is bringing the public to a position to support your policy initiative. It's imprecise."
Mr. McIntosh's work is much admired among the executives, landowners and other conservative groups the White House is courting to shore up political support before the November election. But environmental leaders and consumer groups have loudly condemned the closed manner that characterizes the council, and they accuse Mr. McIntosh of being the Administration's chief lobbyist for big business.
Last week, the House Appropriations Committee voted 30 to 18 to shut down the council by preventing the White House from spending any money in fiscal 1993 on salaries for Mr. McIntosh and his staff. The full House is scheduled to vote on the issue, perhaps as early as Tuesday.
"The council has become an off-the-record, no-fingerprints operation for subverting necessary and appropriate regulatory activity of the Federal Government," said David E. Skaggs, a Democrat of Colorado, who proposed the measure.
 
Early Admirer of Quayle
 Mr. McIntosh says the spark that ignited his career was a 1976 speech in Kendallville, Ind., by a young Congressional candidate named Dan Quayle.
"There was this bright young man running against somebody older that I didn't really relate to as a young kid," said Mr. McIntosh. "I remember him focusing on the need to make Government more accountable to the people and not have unelected representatives here making decisions for people back in Indiana. That appealed to me because it meant more self control. It's what got me interested in politics."
But it hardly explains Mr. McIntosh's mastery of his job. He spends hours reading documents, gathering facts and pursuing a single goal: to loosen the environmental regulations enacted in the last 25 years.
In some cases, that means rewriting Federal laws, including a core provision of the Endangered Species Act and wetlands provisions of the Clean Water Act. In other cases, it means delaying new rules considered too costly for business.
 
Smart and a Little Mean
 Mr. McIntosh, the dutiful aide, said the council's influence is entirely owed to the support of the Vice President and the group's other members, especially Richard G. Darman, the Budget director, and Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
To a considerable extent, though, the Council's influence is due to Mr. McIntosh. With his blue suits cut a touch too big for a thin frame, prematurely grey streaks in his hair, and a disarmingly polite manner, he hardly cuts an imposing figure. But allies and enemies in the Administration say that beneath the Middle Western reserve is a man with a prodigious intellect, keenly focused ideas and just enough of a mean streak to make life uncomfortable for those he considers disloyal to the Administration.
Equally important, say his friends and opponents in the Administration, is his careful, steady cultivation of like-minded aides. From his office overlooking the White House's West Wing, Mr. McIntosh has put himself at the center of a circle of conservative influence in the Federal buildings that ring the Washington Mall.
Among his allies are Teresa Gorman, special assistant for environment and energy policy development in the White House; Linda G. Stuntz, who was recently promoted to deputy secretary of energy; Tom Weimer, the chief of staff for Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.; and Arthur Fraas, chief of natural resources at the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.
 
Portrait of a Conservative
 Born in Oakland, Calif., the oldest of four children, Mr. McIntosh was 5 years old when he moved with his mother to her Indiana hometown of Kendallville after his father died of pancreatic cancer. After graduating from Yale University, he earned a law degree at the University of Chicago, where he studied under some of the nation's most prominent conservative scholars, including Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court Justice.
In 1986, he joined the Justice Department briefly before being named a special assistant to President Ronald Reagan. In 1989 he was hired by Vice President Quayle as deputy counsel, then was named deputy director of the Council on Competitiveness. In January he became its executive director.
"What we are trying to do is what President Bush says he wants done: to get environmental protection and at the same time to encourage economic growth," said Mr. McIntosh. "It means that we need to change the debate about how we get the most environmental protection for the limited resources this society can spend on it."

A Busy '92 for Wall St. Underwriters

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr.

 BODY:
Wall Street's money-raising bonanza extended through this year's second quarter, as the value of stocks and bonds taken to market again topped $200 billion and set a record.
Domestic underwriting in the three-month period that ends today reached $212.9 billion, up 53 percent from the $139.5 billion raised in 1991's second quarter, and just higher than the previous record of $210 billion in offerings that hit the market in the first three months this year, IDD Information Services reported. 
 With interest rates low, corporations across the country have been taking advantage of the seemingly endless public appetite for stocks and bonds. Initial public offerings dropped in the second quarter, but the demand for refinancing debt by companies did not, and may continue to keep bond underwriters busy for the rest of the year.
 
'Markets Aren't Always Logical'
 "Logic dictates that it has to drop off at some point," said John Keefe, a securities analyst and the president of Keefe Worldwide Information Services. "But markets aren't always logical. It almost seems a freak of nature that the numbers are so close" in the first and second quarters.
Over the first six months of the year, total domestic underwriting reached a new high of $422 billion, a stunning 69 percent increase over the $249 billion of securities issued in 1991's first half.
Underwriting fees earned by Wall Street in the second quarter reached $1.67 billion, only a small step down from the $1.78 billion earned in the first quarter.
Merrill Lynch clung to its position as Wall Street's dominant underwriter, with 17.1 percent of the market's domestic issues. Lehman Brothers was in second position with 14 percent, and Goldman Sachs was in third at 13.7 percent.
In underwriting fees, Goldman Sachs led Merrill Lynch, earning $308.3 million compared with $247.3 million. Lehman Brothers was third with $217.3 million.
Common stock offerings reached $19.2 million, compared with $21.2 billion in the year's first quarter. The recent drop in stock prices and in the market's receptivity to initial public offerings of stock may spell a slowdown in stock underwriting.
"June was certainly a difficult month for I.P.O's," said Thomas W. Davis, head of equity capital markets at Merrill Lynch. "But the quarter was strong over all. Volume will probably come off some in the third quarter."
For the quarter, initial public offerings totaled $7.9 billion, down from the $10.4 billion in 1992's first quarter and almost on a par with $8 billion in 1991's second quarter.
Debt markets, where the vast majority of cash is raised on Wall Street, still seem ready to swallow a lot more corporate issues.
"There is still a lot of refinancing to be done," said Edson Mitchell, head of Merrill Lynch's global debt financing division. "We think the second half of the year could be even stronger than the first."
Mortgage-backed securities reached $98.1 billion, only slightly lower than the first quarter's record $98.9 billion.
Junk bond issues grew sharply, raising $11.6 billion, compared with only $2.5 billion in the corresponding period a year ago, and $7.5 billion in 1992's first quarter.

A Slower Flow Into Stock Funds

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE stock market has gone nowhere fast this year, but only now are investors finally beginning to slow their headlong rush into stock mutual funds.
Several fund groups said yesterday that June had been the worst month of the year in terms of drawing cash into stock funds, and Fidelity Investments, the largest of the fund groups, reported seeing a significant reduction in investor demand in the last week. 
 During the first five months of 1992, a total of $34.7 billion poured into stock funds, nearly matching 1991's record annual total of $38.4 billion, according to figures released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute. The May figure of $6.6 billion was down from April's record inflow of $7.5 billion, but was still greater than any month prior to last December, when the flood of cash soared as share prices leaped.
For June, which ends today, some fund groups said yesterday they had sharp falls from the levels that had been prevailing through May. "Equity funds were flat, with almost no net inflows," said Gavin Quill, a spokesman for Scudder, Stevens & Clark.
At T. Rowe Price, the amount of cash taken in by stock funds fell by about 40 percent from May, said Steve Norwitz, a spokesman for the fund group. "It is not a bad month by historical standards," he said, "but it is a little bit of a letdown compared to what we've gotten used to."
In late June, however, some fund groups have seen cash moving out of stock funds. AMG Data in Arcata, Calif., a research organization that receives reports from many funds, said that in the week ended last Wednesday, $1.1 billion was removed from the stock funds it covers. Weekly figures are volatile, but the number could indicate greater caution on the part of investors.
The burst of cash into stock funds that began late last year was stirred in large part by aggressive easing by the Federal Reserve, which cut the discount rate in December, setting off a strong stock market rally. Both rising stock prices and falling yields on bank accounts and money market funds spurred investors to move money into stock funds.
The December rally proved short-lived; most major stock averages have lost ground in 1992. But the cash flows did not slacken until recent weeks, as short-term interest rates continued to slide.
That slide in rates has also prompted many investors to move cash into bond funds, a flow that has continued. In May, $8 billion came into bond funds, up from $7.3 billion in April, and many fund groups said flows continued in June.
But Neal Litvack, a senior vice president of Fidelity, said that the last week also saw a softening of demand in the bond area.
Much of the demand in bond funds has been for funds that provide relatively good yields at little principal risk. Both T. Rowe Price and the TNE Fund Group, a subsidiary of the New England, said that adjustable-rate mortgage funds were among their best sellers.
Among stock funds, the biggest falloff in investor interest has been in aggressive growth funds, particularly those devoted to small stocks, which have generally performed poorly this year. At the Janus Group, "we had a small outflow of cash from the Janus Venture Fund" in June, said Chrissy Snyder, a spokeswoman.
Over all, aggressive growth funds had a net cash inflow of $951 million in May, the smallest for any month this year. The cash-flow figures include new sales minus redemptions, as well as cash moved between funds in the same fund group. But they exclude reinvested dividends.
Despite waning investor interest, the aggressive growth funds have lots of money to invest, reflecting the reluctance of money managers to invest the cash available. At the end of May, 10.3 percent of such funds were in cash, up from 10.2 percent a month earlier and 6.5 percent at the end of January. That bulge of cash, coupled with the growing short interest in small stocks, could provide a surge of buying power to accelerate a rally, were one to begin.
As interest in American stock funds has waned, interest in foreign ones has grown. The weakness of the dollar has aided performance of such funds, but even funds invested in markets that have been plunging have done well. The Japan Fund, managed by Scudder, took in more than $20 million in each of the last three months.
Over all, funds that solely or largely invest in foreign stocks had a net cash flow of $1 billion in May, the highest for any month since July 1990. The flow into funds oriented to domestic stocks was $5.6 billion, the lowest of any month this year.

Short-Term Rates Fall Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Fresh signs of economic weakness sent short-term interest rates to their lowest level in more than two decades yesterday on expectations that the Federal Reserve Board would soon ease its monetary policy.
The catalyst behind the drop was a report from the Government showing that new-home sales fell by 5.6 percent in May, to their lowest level since September. 
 The report stimulated bidding at the weekly auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills, pushing yields to levels not seen since the first half of 1972.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 3.59 percent, down from an average rate of 3.67 percent a week ago. It is the lowest rate on a three-month bill since the auction of May 8, 1972, when three-month bills were sold at a rate of 3.46 percent.
Bids on the new six-month bills generated an average discount rate of 3.66 percent, down from 3.77 percent at last week's auction. It is the lowest rate on a six-month Treasury bill since the auction of Feb. 18, 1972, when six-month bills were auctioned at a rate of 3.51 percent.
 
Decline in Home Sales
 The drop in home sales was the fourth in a row, and puts new-home sales 20 percent below their January peak. Given the rise in housing starts during May, most analysts had been expecting that sales would show an increase.
"The housing report was disappointing," said Stuart G. Hoffman, a senior vice president and senior economist at the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh. "These sales numbers seem to contradict what the starts figures showed, and lead one to ask what will happen to housing starts going forward."
The report reinforced the notion among traders that the Fed will answer continued signs of weakness in the economy by once again lowering the overnight Federal funds rate.
"Every number we have gotten since the durable-goods report last week has been weaker than consensus estimates," one government bond trader said. "This is just another one in the same direction, and it is tilting expectations about a Fed easing move."
Speculation about the Fed and its intentions will remain strong throughout the week, since the central bank's policy-making Open Market Committee is scheduled to begin two days of meetings today.
Most of the trading, and rise in prices, was concentrated among securities with maturities of five years or less, continuing a pattern that has been in place for the last few weeks. Bond prices rose only modestly. Consequently, the gap, or spread, between short-term and long-term interest rates widened further.
"The short end is now priced for better than a 50 percent probability of Fed easing over the near term," analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company, noted in their daily market commentary.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2 year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 102 27/32, up 1/8 of a point, to yield 7.76 percent, compared with 7.77 percent late Friday.
 
Outstanding Treasury Issues
 Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 26/32, up 1/4 of a point, to yield 7.09 percent. And the 7 percent seven-year notes were offered at 101 22/32, up 6/32, to yield 6.68 percent.
Issues auctioned last week continued to gain in when-issued trading.
The new 5 percent two-year notes were offered late yesterday at a price to yield 4.80 percent, compared with 4.88 percent late Friday. And the new 6 3/8 percent five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.26 percent, down from 6.32 percent at the end of last week.
A number of corporations chose to price new debt issues as the second quarter nears a close.
Among the issuers was Wisconsin Power and Light, which offered $72 million worth of 13-year first mortgage bonds through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. The 7.60 percent noncallable securities were priced at $100, or par, to yield 49 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing. The securities are rated AA-2 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Demand for outstanding securities in the tax-exempt municipal bond market remained strong in anticipation of an influx of cash from the huge volume of bonds scheduled to be redeemed on Wednesday.
Analysts have estimated that as much as $12 billion worth of tax-exempt issues will be called on July 1. Traders said that prices of most widely quoted tax-exempt issues rose by about 1/8 of a point yesterday.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Fell 5.6% in May

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell in May for the fourth straight month, the Government reported today. Economists said the decline provided more evidence that the housing industry had lost its usual role of leading the economy out of recession.
Sales dropped 5.6 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 501,000, according to the departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development. That was the lowest level since September, when home sales slowed to a 499,000 rate. 
 In addition, the median price of a new home fell to its lowest level in almost five years.
 
 
No Further Lift?
 "This is confirmation that housing has given us all that it's going to give," contended Daryl Delano, a housing analyst with Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass. "The recovery will have to be sustained by improvements in other sectors."
Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor who is now a consulting economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, agreed.
"There is every reason to expect gradual improvement in the second half, and that will spill over into other areas of the economy," Mr. Gramley said. But, he added, "Housing will not be strong enough to drag the economy along with it."
The May decline in home sales was led by a 34.4 percent plunge in the West, the largest drop since the Government began keeping track of sales in 1973. Sales also fell in the Midwest, although they rose in the Northeast and in the South.
 Analysts were unable to explain the big drop in the West, but they saw it as another sign that the region -- particularly California -- would be the last to emerge from the recession.
They said that since the West generally had the highest housing costs, its sales drop contributed strongly to the 11.6 percent drop in the national median price of a new home, to $106,000. That was the lowest level since July 1987, when homes sold for a median of $105,000. The median means half of homes cost more and half less.
The report also indicated that sales activity in April was weaker than first estimated. Last month's report had showed a 1.3 percent advance in April, but that was revised today to a 2.7 percent decline. The department also revised the 15.9 percent decline in March to just 12.9 percent.
Kent Colton, executive vice president of the National Association of Home Builders, said his organization still thought "there will be a recovery in 1992 in new-home sales and starts."
But he added, "It will be a modest recovery."
 The home builders group is forecasting that sales will rise 20 to 25 percent from the 509,000 reported in 1991, when the industry began its rebound. Mr. Colton said sales jumped more than 70 percent after the 1981-82 recession.
 
 
Permit Applications Fall
 The May sales activity left the seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of the month at 274,000, down from 275,000.
Although housing starts jumped 11 percent, applications for building permits dropped seven-tenths of 1 percent. It was the third straight decline in permit applications.
Regionally, the 34.4 percent plunge in the West left home sales there at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 105,000. That was the lowest level since July 1982.
Sales fell 7.5 percent in the Midwest, to a 98,000 rate. But they jumped 28.3 percent in the Northeast, to a 68,000 rate. Sales were also up 8.5 percent in the South, to a 230,000 rate.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
South Africa Unrest Sends Platinum Prices Surging

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Unrest in South Africa and signs of freshening demand fed an explosive rally that lifted the prices of platinum futures to a four-week high yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Gold and silver futures rose moderately, while copper futures posted strong gains. 
 Platinum for July delivery soared $16.60, to $377 an ounce, in New York, the contract's highest daily settlement since June 2.
The more heavily traded October contract jumped $16.70, to $384.80 an ounce.
A platinum selling streak linked to the weak Japanese economy screeched to a halt last week amid worries that the June 17 massacre of 40 South African blacks would lead to new violence and strikes in the world's largest platinum-producing country.
As fears of supply disruptions have grown, so have hopes for increased platinum demand from auto makers as the world economy recovers. Platinum is a key ingredient in catalytic converters, which reduce harmful exhaust gases.
"Add physical demand to the possibility of a supply threat and that's like throwing fuel on the fire," said Martin Reichenberg, manager of trading services for the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
 
Gold Rises to $345.10
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August delivery rose $1.20, to $345.10 an ounce; July silver climbed 3.3 cents, to $4.008 an ounce.
July copper rose 3.10 cents, to $1.1045 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange, extending gains posted during last week's national rail shutdown.
Cocoa for July delivery climbed $36, to $897 a ton, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York. It was the third straight day of a recovery from last week's 19-year low of $785.
Oil futures retreated on the New York Mercantile Excahnge in a sell- off that left gasoline more expensive than home heating oil.
Light crude oil for August delivery fell 20 cents, to $22.24 a barrel; July home heating oil dropped four-tenths of 1 cent, to 61.87 cents a gallon; July unleaded gasoline plunged 1.32 cents, to 61.58 cents a gallon; August natural gas fell 1.1 cents, to $1.508 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Cattle futures made strong gains on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting stronger cash markets and buying by speculative funds.
Hog futures were mixed and pork bellies fell sharply in light trading ahead of a quarterly Agriculture Department inventory of hogs and pigs, due out after today's close.
Grain futures ended mixed.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Loses Some Ground On Decline in Home Sales

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed in lackluster trading yesterday, as a new report showing weak home sales in the United States provoked limited selling.
The departments of Commerce and of Housing and Urban Development reported a 5.6 percent decrease in new-home sales in May. Many economists expected a 3 to 4 percent gain. 
 Jeff Mondschein, foreign exchange manager at the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in Chicago, said the housing report had not caused much excitement in the market. The weakness of the dollar is well known to traders, who shun it because of uncertainty before the November elections and higher interest rates abroad.
 
Some Traders Were Encouraged
 The fall of the dollar abated somewhat as it reached technical trading levels against other currencies, encouraging some traders to buy dollars, Mr. Mondschein said.
Some other traders disagreed with the buyers, saying the weak housing report supported the case that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates again to revive the economy. Lower rates would weaken the dollar's value abroad.
The dollar traded at 1.5160 German marks late yesterday, down from 1.5385 marks late Friday. At the closing in New York, the dollar fetched 1.5215 marks, down from 1.5355 late Friday.
In Tokyo the dollar closed at 125.50 yen, down 0.10 yen from Friday's close. Later in London the dollar was quoted at 125.15 yen. The trend had reversed by the closing in New York, where the dollar fetched 125.80 yen, up from 125.70 yen late Friday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9070, up from $1.8925 late Friday. The pound was quoted at $1.9030 at closing in New York, up from $1.8945 late Friday.

New Russian Car: Pretty Good Deal

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

DATELINE: TOGLIATTI, Russia

 BODY:
OUTSIDE the Zhiguli Trade Center, the nation's largest new-car dealership, throngs of men loiter. They represent a growing phenomenon in Russia today: the car merchant. Their specialty is to collar people who have just bought new cars and to try to persuade them to sell their shiny vehicles on the spot. Sometimes new-car owners are offered double the amount they paid minutes before to the dealer.
Clearly, the free market has come to car sales in Russia today, but in a form not easily recognizable in the United States. In the United States, the supply of new cars is more than the American public will buy, so a new car's value begins to fall the minute it leaves the dealer's lot. Here, the Government has allowed dealers to raise new car prices twentyfold since Jan. 1. But even at the higher prices, long waiting lists exist for new cars and their value keeps rising after dealers sell them. 
 "The American car market may be satiated, but here it is like a hungry dog; you throw it a new car and it gobbles it up," said Aleksandr G. Zibarev, a vice general director of the Vaz Auto Works, which manufactures the Zhiguli in this Volga River city. Zhigulis, similar in appearance to Fiats, account for more than half the nearly 700,000 new cars sold annually in the former Soviet Union.
That helps to explain why car merchants gather outside Zhiguli dealerships in many cities, and particularly at the Zhiguli Trade Center here. It sells more cars than any other dealership, averaging 60 vehicles a day, all of them delivered straight from the Vaz factory two miles away. Many of the merchants are Azerbaijanis who bring fruit and other merchandise north from their home republic, sell it and then invest the earnings in cars.
New-car buyers who pick up their vehicles at the center often snub the merchants on the street outside. Nevertheless, the majority of new-car owners soon resell their cars, to a friend or to a friend of a friend. Whoever the buyer, Ismailov Yasin of Baku, Azerbaijan, one of the merchants outside the Trade Center, illustrates how the new- car resale market often works.
Because demand for new cars is so great, particularly for the Zhiguli, the Government in effect rations new vehicles. It does this by requiring dealers to sell new cars only to people with coupons that they have obtained from an employer, a trade union or by putting their names on a waiting list, as Mr. Yasin said he did.
The coupon entitled him to buy a new Zhiguli 2106 from a dealer at a fixed price, one that is almost always much lower than a new car's immediate resale value. In Mr. Yasin's case, the fixed price was 160,000 rubles, or $1,600, and the resale value today is 380,000 rubles, or $3,800.
Leaning against his month-old blue sedan in the street outside the trade center, Mr. Yasin said that he had sought for more than a week to exchange the car for a fancier Zhiguli 2199, which dealers sell for 500,000 rubles. Since the 2199's immediate resale value is nearly 800,000 rubles, Mr. Yasin says he has offered to pay more than 300,000 rubles in cash, in addition to his less valuable Zhiguli 2106. So far, he has had no takers.
While Mr. Yasin sought to trade up to a fancier car, one that he will almost certainly resell later for an even higher price, others are in the market for a different reason. Many buy the model 2199 to trade down. In a nation without auto loans, trading down is a way to finance the purchase of a car.
Trading down works this way: A consumer with, say, 100,000 rubles in savings gets a coupon that gives him the right to buy a model 2199 from a dealer for 500,000 rubles. After borrowing 400,000 rubles from family and friends, he buys the car and quickly resells it for 800,000 rubles. Once the debt is repaid, the consumer is left with his original 100,000 rubles in savings and the 300,000 profit. That is enough to buy a nearly new Zhiguli 2106. The 300,000 ruble profit becomes, in effect, an auto loan.
"Everyone wants the Zhiguli 2199 because the car is so easy to resell," said Zinaida R. Sankina, director of the Zhiguli Trade Center, owned by Vaz. "I have seen people beg and cry for a 2199."
The resale market for new cars is certain to endure as long as the Government maintains ceilings on dealer prices, a policy intended to keep new cars within the reach of low-income families. Inflation also feeds the marketplace. In a nation short of cars, their value tends to rise in lockstep with the inflation rate. That makes owning a car a hedge against inflation.
Whatever the lifespan of this market, some Russians say they find the car merchants too profit oriented and their sidewalk marketplace unseemly.
"It is somehow not ethical," said Pavel Ansonov, a retired Vaz worker who drives a 15-year-old Zhiguli. "It is based on mutual deceit; people trying to outwit each other."

HEADLINE: Ridden With Debt, U.S. Companies Cut Funds for Research

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
SCIENTIFIC research by private industry, the traditional powerhouse of innovation and technological leadership in the United States, is suffering deeper financial woes than previously disclosed, suggesting that America is slipping in the international race for discoveries that form the basis of new goods and services.
The National Science Foundation reported in February that industrial spending on research and development had begun to shrink after decades of growth. The most recent numbers showed that, in inflation-adjusted dollars, such financing peaked in 1989 at about $79 billion, dropped slightly in 1990 and was projected to fall further in 1991. Such declines worry analysts because foreign rivals are increasing their research investments at a brisk pace. 
 But it turns out that things are bleaker than the figures suggest. The science foundation, a Federal agency, now says it includes in such calculations the money spent by foreign companies doing research in America, for instance, by leading Japanese computer and electronics firms. Such work soared during the 1980's, going from 6 percent of the national total in 1980 to 13 percent in 1989, the most recent year available. Analysts fear this influx of foreign dollars is now masking the true size of the American research decline.
Whatever its magnitude, the drop is prompting hot debate among experts over its causes. A prime suspect is the mountain of corporate debt accumulated in the 1980's during the blitz of takeovers, mergers and acquisitions that swept American business. That debt, some experts say, is putting a squeeze on investments in the inherently risky realm of scientific research, where payoffs, if they materialize at all, may be years or decades in the making.
"It's a major factor -- and could be the major factor" behind the drop in research spending by business, Erich Bloch, former director of the National Science Foundation, said in an interview.
Charles F. Larson, executive director of the Industrial Research Institute, a trade group based in Washington, agreed that corporate restructurings had taken a hefty toll. "Just the threat of a takeover changes a company," he noted.
For instance, the Phillips Petroleum Research Laboratory, located on 300 acres of land in Bartlesville, Okla., in the early 1980's had more than 1,000 workers generating more patents than any other American oil company. The lab studied not only traditional topics like developing new products from gas and oil but also exotic ones like controlling the enormous forces of nuclear fusion to produce electrical power, a feat scientists hope to achieve sometime in the 21st century.
Then in 1984, T. Boone Pickens mounted a hostile takeover of Phillips. To protect itself, the company leveraged itself heavily with billions of dollars of debt in order to buy back stock. Scientific research was one of areas curtailed after the successful defense.
"We got cut in half," said Dr. Charles F. Cook, then head of research for Phillips and now retired. "We lost a lot of our experienced people, and in research that's devastating."
The jolt to scientific research from corporate restructuring in the 1980's "is much more severe than has been recognized," Dr. Cook said in an interview. "I think it's a real problem and a serious mistake," he said. "But Wall Street demands it."
Not all analysts agree, especially ones who realized big profits in the shake-ups. The largest and most aggressive acquirer of all, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, or KKR, as it is commonly known, in 1989 published a 34-page defense of its work, saying leveraged buyouts were beneficial to many aspects of corporate health, including research. Companies acquired by KKR, the study asserted, immediately after buyouts raised their spending on research and development by 19 percent.
"Managers trying to maximize value," the study asserted, "do not stop research and development, which generally does not constitute a large cash outlay, unless such spending is wasteful."
Experts agree that there are cases where research rose. For instance, Owens-Illinois, a leader in the glass-container industry, in 1987 underwent a KKR-sponsored buyout to dodge a hostile takeover. Kenneth H. Lemke, the company's technical director, later told Congress that Owens-Illinois research added 10 engineers and scientists just after the acquisition, for a force of 194.
 
 
R.& D. 'Prone to Suffer'
 But more typical, many experts say, is a drop wrought by debt or a bid to cut duplication. When the General Electric Company took over RCA Corporation in 1986, one of the first things to go was RCA's prestigious David Sarnoff Research Center, the last of the nation's major laboratories devoted to television research. In 1987 G.E. gave the center to SRI International, a contract research group. Its work force was quickly cut to 850 from 1,200.
Alarmed at such trends, the research subcommittee of the House Science Committee held a hearing in July 1989 on the impact of corporate restructuring. There the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment said it had studied the fate of 19 manufacturing firms involved in some kind of merger or acquisition, including Stauffer Chemical, Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, Radian Corporation, Polaroid Corporation, Tenneco, G. D. Searle & Company, USG Corporation, Reliance Electric Company, Zenith Electronics Company and Caterpillar Inc.
"Our results support the contention that R.& D. is prone to suffer as a result of heavy debt loads," Dr. Julie Fox Gorte of the assessment office told the hearing.
The National Science Foundation also presented a study at the hearing that showed 24 companies after restructuring had, in inflation-adjusted dollars, an average decline in research financing of 8.3 percent. William L. Steward, director of the science agency's division of science resource studies, called the findings disturbing.
"It is worrisome to see our industrial research investment declining when we face increased competition from abroad," Mr. Steward said.
But other analysts at the hearing dismissed such sentiments, saying restructurings often increased the quality, if not the quantity, of industrial research.
 
 
Hostile Boardrooms
 In the 1990's, the topic has continued to spark debate among scholars and scientists, more so with the recent drops in the financing of industrial research. More quietly, it is also being discussed in corporate boardrooms, which still feel the heat of debt.
"All of you are a variable overhead expense," a Wall Street adviser told corporate research chiefs in 1990 at a meeting of the Industrial Research Institute. "Let me repeat," he said, wagging his finger at the audience, "you are all a variable overhead expense."
Dr. Alvin W. Trivelpiece, director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and former chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, bemoaned this type of pressure in "Science Under Stress," a round-table discussion of 10 experts published in the February issue of Physics Today, a professional journal.
"Industrial research of a basic nature got badly gored" in the corporate shake-ups, Dr. Trivelpiece said, adding that "those pressures are not going to go away very soon."
Trying to gauge the pressures has fallen to such scholars as Dr. Bronwyn H. Hall, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. She recently wrote a lengthy study that carefully weighed a large body of evidence about corporate research, including most of the previous studies as well as her own research. "Massive changes in financial structure," she concluded, "do appear to be accompanied by reduced investment of all kinds."
A glimmer of hope seen by some analysts is that corporate indebtedness is in some cases being reduced in the 1990's. David J. Ravenscraft, a business professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who is studying the fate of industrial research, said that within three or four years, a quarter to a third of the restructured companies plan a stock offering to swap equity for debt.
But more typically, Dr. Ravenscraft said, companies use their cash flow to pay off debt, a process that can take years to decades. As the burden lessens, he said, American corporations might become more competitive globally.
 
Japan's Ascendancy
 The United States once enjoyed a commanding lead in high-technology industries, with corporate scientists inventing items like nylon, Teflon, the transistor, the computer chip, fiber optics and instant color film. But now the nation faces stiff competition in many fields.
In 1991, all the top holders of United States patents were Japanese companies. Toshiba was granted 1,014 patents last year, Mitsubishi 936 and Hitachi 927. Eastman Kodak ranked fourth with 863 patents, Canon fifth with 823 patents and General Electric, which once dominated the top spot, dropped into sixth place with 809 patents.
America's recent retreat from its peak financing of industrial research was spelled out by the National Science Foundation in February with the release of "Science and Engineering Indicators," a biennial report on the health of the nation's research enterprise. After rising rapidly in the 1970's and early 80's, the report said, industrial research leveled off in the mid-to-late 80's and began to fall in 1990.
Bright spots fighting the trend include the pharmaceutical industry, where spending on research is rising fast. But overall, the drift is downward.
In recent interviews, analysts at the science agency disclosed that the national figures included industrial research done by foreign companies in America. The rationale for this, they said, was to show domestic activity. But analysts admitted that the rise of foreign research here, amounting to $10.3 billion as of 1989, or 13 percent of the national total, suggested they might have to separate such categories in the future.
 
Labs Around the Globe
 Behind the flood of foreign research dollars is the purchase of American companies and the hiring of some of the nation's most creative scientists for new research centers. For instance, the NEC Corporation recently opened a laboratory in Princeton, N.J., and Canon started one in Palo Alto, Calif.
Analysts at the science agency say American corporate research may be somewhat stronger than the gloomy numbers suggest because their national totals do not include research done by American business overseas. For instance, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the St. Paul company that makes everything from Post-it notes to optical data disks, now has 2,500 technical people stationed abroad.
In general, however, this globalization of American research is too small to offset the foreign influx. Moreover, overseas research has been shrinking, according to the most recent numbers. Between 1988 and 1989, research done by American corporations in foreign countries dropped from $7.3 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars to $7.2 billion, about 9 percent of the national total.
Mr. Bloch, the former director of the National Science Foundation, said the empirical evidence was that so far the dust from the restructurings of the 1980's had yet to settle.
"Look at some of the big companies," he said. "They're still reducing their R.& D."
Mr. Larsen of the Industrial Research Institute said the downward trend had dark implications for the technological health of the United States.
"We're going to suffer later on," he said. "We're not looking to the long term."

Marine Life
By Linda Svendsen
165 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $17.
Images of water -- as a metaphor for the amniotic fluids of birth, the terrors of drowning and the fresh, clean promise of redemption -- surface again and again in the stories that make up "Marine Life," Linda Svendsen's astonishing debut book.
Adele Nordstrom, the narrator of these interlinked stories, remembers playing at the beach as a child, "listlessly filling a bright yellow pail with the waves" while waiting for her brother and his girlfriend to pay her some attention. Years later, she recalls a story about her boyfriend, Bill, how he and his brother watched a mother turtle struggle to make her way back to the water, after laying some eggs in the sand; if only she had been with him, she thinks, "witnessing this event might have made us kinder to each other." 
 An older Adele remembers accompanying her aging mother to a swimming lesson at the local recreation center, watching her "going away from me" in the pool, her breathing erratic and rapid. And she remembers receiving the news that her niece has jumped off a bridge and drowned: dead at the age of 16.
There's nothing heavy-handed or contrived about the way these images are made to echo one another. Indeed, "Marine Life" is as seamless as a fine piece of music, effortlessly held together by Ms. Svendsen's strong, clear voice, a voice capable of moving back and forth from the lyrical to the irreverent, the somber to the silly with complete fluency and ease.
Some of the descriptions Ms. Svendsen tosses off so cavalierly are poetic: Adele's boyfriend using a sparkler to write her name against the nighttime sky, each letter disappearing as soon as it's completed. Others are comic, in a ghastly sort of way: Adele's unhappy sister, Joyce, opening a birdcage and deliberately vacuuming up the small pink finch inside; or Adele removing all the fruit from the kitchen so her estranged boyfriend can't feed his next girlfriend a suggestive apple or banana.
Jumping about in time, Ms. Svendsen conjures up Adele's childhood in small-town Canada and her adult life in New York City with quick, sure strokes, giving us pictures of her family that possess all the immediacy of snapshots, all the lasting emotional resonance of more formal portraits. To begin with, there's Adele's mother, June, a cocktail pianist, who believes it's better to have a bad marriage than no marriage at all: she loses her first husband to another woman, and she spurns her second -- a nice, ineffectual man who is Adele's father -- for No. 3, a crass, foul-mouthed man named Robert, who is 10 years her junior. Robert makes Adele feel embarrassed in front of her friends; toward her own father, she feels a mixture of irritation and sorrow. She pictures him driving home after their Saturday afternoons together, alone and tired and discouraged; to make sure he's gotten home safely, she calls and calls until he answers the phone -- and hangs up the instant she hears his voice.
Adele is the family's baby -- "the afterthought," one of her sisters calls her -- and she grows up idolizing her older brother and sisters. Over the years, as she slowly loses her innocence, she will begin to see their lives shorn of the glamour she always imagined they possessed. Her brother, Ray, has earned his forklift operator certificate, and changes girlfriends as frequently as he changes jobs; he drinks too much and drives so recklessly that Adele is reluctant to get in his car. Her elder sister, Irene, marries a Belgian immigrant, and proceeds "to do boring Belgian things -- bake sour pastries, fuss with tulips, and raise a prim daughter."
Adele's other sister, Joyce, suffers a nervous breakdown in the wake of her divorce; though her former husband, an unemployed aviation freak named Eric, beats her black and blue, she still looks up at the sky whenever a plane flies overhead, remembering his passion. Joyce tries to rationalize the fights she and Eric used to have by citing "Princess Margaret and Lord Tony, and the bickering couple on 'Bewitched'."
As for Adele, she grows up, an observant, watchful child, protective of her lovelorn mother. As a teen-ager, she smears her face and arms with Sea & Ski self-tanning lotion so she'll look as if she's been somewhere warm. Years later, she will transform these fantasies of escape into a vocation: she majors in cultural anthropology and sets off for the Arctic to do research on her thesis. Eventually, she lands in New York City, where she acquires a husband and two children; the marriage, like so many others in her family, will end in divorce.
Elliptical yet compelling, Ms. Svendsen's use of a series of overlapping short stories to relate Adele's story recalls a similar technique used by Stephanie Vaughn in "Sweet Talk" and Tim O'Brien in "The Things They Carried." It's a highly effective device, resulting in a book that has all the cumulative narrative power of a novel, all the compacted energy of a volume of short stories. In the case of "Marine Life," it's also a device that showcases the talents of a remarkable new writer.

Dream Team Routs Might Mean Lowly Ratings

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
No doubt about it, the men's Olympic basketball team proved it was the Dream Team on Sunday night. So soothing, so numbing was its 136-57 embarrassment of Team Cuba that I confess I slept, perchance to dream of competitive basketball -- and Fidel Castro posting up big-time in the paint.
My, oh, my, Jordan, Magic, Bird and Barkley lived up to all the Dream Team promotion we have been inundated with on NBC. Granted, there are other teams in the Tournament of the Americas who are better than Cuba and there will be teams in the Olympics who will give Team USA a bigger fight. 
 But what constitutes a bigger fight than losing by 79? A 42-point squeaker?
Can the Dream Team be a ratings magnet for NBC in Spain if competition-starved viewers would rather pull out tapes of luge from Albertville? Will hoops addicts reach into their money clips for as much as $125 for a pay-per-trouncing on the Olympics Triplecast? To be decided in Barcelona.
"We expected a blowout," said Marv Albert, NBC's basketball announcer, "but not to that extent. Brazil will be a little tougher, and they have Oscar Schmidt. Someone here said, 'Schmidt's just a shooter. He makes Kiki Vandeweghe look like Dennis Rodman.' They say Puerto Rico may be good."
Albert and his partner Mike Fratello were in super-fill mode most of the game, with plenty of time to vamp with the research compiled for them.
"There was still stuff I couldn't get in," said Albert, "like the Cuban economic situation is so bad they wash their uniforms in the hotel sink."
Anything else? "Guess who plays for Panama?" he said. "Stuart Gray! He was an Army brat who was born in Panama."
Team USA's vanquishing of the Cubans did not dim Albert's support of National Basketball Association players, who hold 11 of the 12 roster spots.
"It's easy to say what the U.S. is doing is ridiculous," he said. "Is this what they want to do, beat up teams by 75? You know that'll be written. But the rest of the world is moving closer to us in talent, and if they didn't do this now, the U.S.A. would be beaten again."
Albert is hoping for a better game Sunday when NBC airs the tournament championship game (TNT will air Dream Team games tomorrow and Friday).
"You can't judge things on the Cubans," he said. "I expect more sophisticated coaching from Brazil. The Cuban coach had nothing going."
Sunday's game earned a 9.3 rating in Nielsen's preliminary survey of 25 markets. It will be interesting to see if the ratings plummeted during the game, when it was apparent that the Cubans could not erase the inhuman deficit.
 
Hunt to Replace Wolf
 Warner Wolf has been gone from WCBS (Channel 2) since the end of May, and still there's no replacement for the longtime sports broadcaster who took his videotapes back home to Washington. The station's search for a successor is shaping up as the biggest since David O. Selznick casted a wide net for the actress to play Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone With the Wind."
Except right now there are no obvious beauties like Vivian Leigh. Rock Rote is the temporary regular. Dave Sims is the weekend fill-in. None of the nearly 100 suspects under any consideration has impressed Bud Carey, the general manager, or Dean Daniels, the news director. Candidates like CBS's Greg Gumbel and WFAN's Mike Francesa have had flirtations with the station.
"This isn't something you jump into," Carey said. "If you choose somebody, you do it for the long term. We're closer than we were a few weeks ago. Remember, Warner was a relatively easy hire. He was in the market."
Carey and Daniels may be debating the need to follow Wolf with a high-power big name, and how much that person could affect ratings in the last five minutes of the newscast.
But there is a possible solution, according to a station source, which would be to keep Rote indefinitely until WCBS's former No. 1 candidate, Bernie Smilovitz, of WDIV-TV, in Detroit, gets out of his contract in 1994.
Recently, the station wanted to hire Smilovitz, who uses a lot of video and humor in his sportscasts, but he wasn't allowed out of his deal.
 
AIRWAVES
 ESPN is making great use of super slow-motion replays of pitch releases, most notably on Sunday comparing White Sox knuckleballer CHARLIE HOUGH with Yankee right-hander MELIDO PEREZ . . . . Agents for New Jersey Nets Coach CHUCK DALY are shopping a weekly coach's show to WWOR-TV, SportsChannel and WNBC-TV. . . . DAN O'BRIEN showed grace in the wake of his failure to qualify for the Olympic decathlon and wrecking Reebok's Dan and Dave campaign, talking to BOB COSTAS on Sunday and KATIE COURIC Monday on "Today."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Israeli Gamble

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Consider:
Later this summer, a free election will be held in an important Mideastern Muslim state, under the rules of parliamentary democracy.
The opposition will win on a platform of peace through major concessions to Israel and an end of enmity toward Jews. It will create a new government dedicated to those ends. The defeated government will step aside peacefully. 
 Well, of course -- the idea of a critical free election taking place in a democratic environment in the Muslim Mideast is absurd. And we do not dream of Muslim leaders telling their people, plain, the time has come for peace through concessions to Israel.
Yet the contrast is not only worth noting, but essential to an understanding of the Israeli elections, the future of the Mideast and the peculiar Western attitude toward Israel and her Arab neighbors.
Israelis want peace and, in their freedom, are willing to pay what could be a dangerous price for it -- full autonomy for Palestinians.
That was a concept of the Likud's own Menachem Begin. And without the stubborn determination of Yitzhak Shamir to get autonomy negotiations free of international interference the current talks would not be taking place.
But a plurality of Israelis decided to go with Yitzhak Rabin's promises of stronger, faster action toward autonomy. They trust him to do his best to get them both peace and security.
But both Mr. Rabin and Mr. Shamir recognize the risk in autonomy that neither has answered yet. Independence, not autonomy, is the Palestinian goal. Israelis hope that autonomy will not turn into the independent Palestine most of them see as a dagger. It is a gamble, taken in the hope of peace, without guarantees -- worthwhile and honorable, but a gamble.
The reality is that under any government Israelis survive in a jungle of dictators hunting for Israeli weaknesses. Economically, there are plenty. They could lead to military slippage for Israel -- an invitation to disaster.
Mr. Shamir was defeated in large part because Israelis correctly blamed him for failing to fix Israel's economy -- over-subsidized, over-politicized, under-privatized.
But Mr. Rabin and his Labor Party also failed to deal with that in their three decades in office. In fact, the corrupting system of favors-to-favorites was part of Labor's socialist roots. Mr. Rabin will have to control strong Labor leftists who will keep fighting for socialism.
The U.S. has interests in Israel. Mostly they are in the pragmatic advantages of a shared democracy. But they seemed more vivid to Washington when the U.S. also saw Israel as a bulwark against Soviet intervention in the Mideast.
And the U.S. has interests with the Arabs -- chiefly oil flow and oil profits. They are important but no excuse for moral equivalency -- the political perversion that ignores the greater American interests that lie in the difference between democracy and dictatorship.
Democracy makes for peace, dictatorship for war. American apologists for the Soviet Union suffered from that disease, as do American appeasers of Communist China, and of Mideast dictators.
One day, after the honeymoon, Mr. Rabin will have to confront Western moral equivalency, Israel's great enemy. But I hope he will not have to bear one burden carried by Mr. Shamir: the incessant merciless attempt of some American and European "friends" of Israel, Jews among them, to destroy him or pressure their governments to do so.
Foreigners' support of and friendship to Israel never involved obedience -- that was always part of the vicious "double allegiance" lie. But any friendship does involve a certain constancy, a lovely word.
To me, it rules out attempts by foreigners to destroy an Israeli government, Rabin or Shamir, because it is not submissive to their own vision of what is right for the country. Choosing or defeating their government is a job for Israelis.
At City Hall a few months ago, Mayor David Dinkins gave a breakfast for Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem. They like each other. Mr. Dinkins read from the Bible:
"Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: They shall prosper who love thee." In my office, I read in the Revised American Version the lines that come next:
"Peace be within thy walls, and security within thy palaces."
Both. Psalm 122.

HEADLINE: Third World Women Aren't the Big Polluters;
There's Plenty of Room

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Anna Quindlen states that in the next century the population may double "on what already seems to be a 'No Vacancy' planet" (column, June 10). What planet is she referring to? It can't be Earth.
If the world's population of more than five billion were put in Jacksonville, Fla., every person would have about 4 square feet of standing space. If that were too crowded, we could all move over to Texas and each have about 1,400 square feet, the area of a good-sized two-bedroom apartment. 
 The world is just not very crowded. The population density of China (288 people per square mile) is less than that of West Germany (626), Switzerland (406), Denmark (305) and New Jersey (1,034). In the United States, there are a mere 68 people per square mile. Crowded cities result from free choice or government policies. There is no natural population problem.
Neither is there evidence that population growth impedes economic growth. On the contrary, places Ms. Quindlen might regard as crowded, Hong Kong and Singapore, say, have demonstrated that vigorous growth is perfectly compatible with, even attributable to, population growth.
Yes, the world's population increases -- and every resource gets cheaper every year. After all, people are the source of intelligence, which the economist Julian Simon calls the "ultimate resource."
Isn't it time wealthy white people stopped telling third world peasants who aspire to a better life how many children and what kind of economies to have?

HEADLINE: Marijuana vs. Alcohol for Teen-Agers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a New York City police officer, I was intrigued by Peter Passell's June 17 Economic Scene column about research showing that teen-agers who are priced out of the market for marijuana turn to alcohol. Particularly important are the statistics that show that the risks for accidental injury and auto accidents are less serious for marijuana than for alcohol.
From 1976 to 1980 I was assigned to some of the Schaefer Beer concerts in Central Park. When we had a crowd in the park that was predominantly beer drinking, there were so many fights and other problems that we had our hands full, and so did the burly security guards hired specifically to keep things under control. On the other hand, when we cracked down on the beer drinking, marijuana smoke wafted overhead, and the few problems we encountered were usually the result of police officers arresting marijuana users. 
 To spend enormous sums of money and tie up large numbers of police personnel to reduce the lesser evil of marijuana, but thereby increase the greater evil of alcohol among teen-agers, seems so counterproductive that only our political and religious superstitions and taboos could support such policies.
Decriminalization of marijuana might at first lead to some excessive use, but we would all be a lot safer for the teen-agers who stayed away from alcohol.

HEADLINE: Marijuana vs. Alcohol for Teen-Agers;
Drinking Drops Off

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Less Marijuana, More Alcohol?" (Economic Scene column, June 17), Peter Passell implies that the United States should fight alcohol abuse by decriminalizing marijuana. He must be joking.
According to Government statistics, underage drinking is at its lowest level since 1974; accidents involving teen-age drunken drivers are down 39 percent since 1982; binge drinking among high school seniors has dropped more than 20 percent in the last 10 years. 
 America has made dramatic, measurable progress to reduce underage drinking. It has done so through education and persistence.
The solution to underage drinking is not easy. It involves the cooperation of parents, teachers, churches, the mass media, the Government and the industry. This approach is working -- and will continue to work if it is not subverted by outlandish and facile proposals.
