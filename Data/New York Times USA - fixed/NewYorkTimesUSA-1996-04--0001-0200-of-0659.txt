HEADLINE: Is Downsizing a Myth? Ask the Downsized

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Downsizing Myth" (Op-Ed, March 25): 
 H. Erich Heinemann says the American economy is "upsizing" because the number of civilian workers has risen by eight million since March 1991 and half the new jobs can be classified as managerial or professional.
Sounds great, but it's not true.
Growth in employment since March 1991 is only 7.1 million jobs, well below the 10 million to 12 million gain that occurred after the previous two recessions. Manufacturing employment is still 172,000 below the March 1991 level.
In fact, 40 percent of the jobs created since 1991 are in low-wage industries, largely in the service sector, paying an average of $7.47 an hour -- just about the poverty level for a family of four.
A manager at McDonald's may earn only $20,000 a year. But under Mr. Heinemann's analysis, the job is still managerial, and that's supposed to be good news.
Tell that to a middle-aged, downsized AT&T manager whose two kids were hoping to go to college.
Commerce Department statistics show that while wages may have risen 18 percent since 1989, prices have risen 22 percent and business profits 64 percent.
Real earnings for workers have declined 12 percent since 1979.
During the same period, productivity increased 24 percent. And so has executive compensation, by 360 percent since 1980.
Mr. Heinemann acknowledges that deep anxiety exists and that the economy's transitions are painful. But he calls only for more investment and productivity to spur growth.
What about greater fairness? What about shared sacrifices and shared rewards? What about economic and social justice?
That's what the 1996 elections also should be about.

HEADLINE: Don't Finagle a Way To Build Yankee Park

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Creating a sports authority to finance a new ball park for the New York Yankees (news article, March 28) would only be a smokescreen to insulate Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki from the politically unjustifiable decision to ask taxpayers to pay for an $800 million stadium for George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner. 
 The credit of the city and state would still be needed to raise the money for the stadium.
It would be fiscally irresponsible to commit nearly $1 billion on a single ball park when the city and state face huge budget shortfalls. Even under the best circumstances, it would be risky to finance a new stadium. Stadiums do not cover their fixed and operating costs and do not add significant new revenues to the city's economy, and sports teams usually have fewer than 100 full-time employees. And most New Yorkers could not afford the increased ticket prices.
New York would remain a "major league" city with or without the Yankees. The city would be better off fixing deteriorating schools or restoring quality service to the subways.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: DOLE'S COURSE;
Senator Lets Experience Guide Policy on Economy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
Although Senator Bob Dole avoids the kind of detailed economic policy debates that President Clinton is known to relish, the all-but-official Republican Presidential nominee nonetheless has a loose grouping of economic advisers who are helping to shape his views and sharpen his message.
And they seem likely to play an increasingly important role as Mr. Dole's Presidential campaign develops its economic strategy and formulates more specific positions on issues like how to promote greater growth and end the long stagnation in average wages. 
 Reflecting the Kansas Senator's background and political instincts, the team is generally composed of Washington insiders, including Republican Senators and a former member of the Federal Reserve Board, and it hews to mainstream conservative economic thought. But it is also sprinkled with real-world experience, which Mr. Dole values far more than graduate degrees, aides said.
The team's job, several members said, will be to take the legislative agenda that will provide the framework for Mr. Dole's campaign -- balancing the budget, cutting taxes and reducing regulations -- and insure that its details will have the desired effect in the real world while also selling its merits to voters.
Mr. Dole frequently relies for economic advice on Senate colleagues like Robert F. Bennett of Utah, a wealthy entrepreneur serving his first term; Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and Connie Mack of Florida, a former banker who as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee in Congress has taken a lead role in attacking the Administration's economic record.
The only professional economist to have Mr. Dole's ear is Wayne D. Angell, a fellow Kansan who was appointed to a seat on the Federal Reserve in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan with strong backing from Mr. Dole. Mr. Angell, who was a farmer, a small-town banker and a state legislator before serving on the board, is now chief economist at Bear Stearns, the Wall Street brokerage firm.
Mr. Dole also relies on a small cadre of current and former aides. Most notable is his chief of staff in the Senate, Sheila P. Burke, a former nurse who received a master's degree in public administration from Harvard. Another is Robert E. Lighthizer, who was an aide to Mr. Dole on the Senate Finance Committee, served as a deputy to the United States trade representative and now, as a Washington trade lawyer, is treasurer of the Dole campaign.
"I see Dole putting together a team that will agree with him in his overall vision, which is to unleash the inherent powers in the economy by cutting regulations, simplifying the tax structure and putting more trust and opportunity in the hands of ordinary Americans, and then letting that team work out the details and come back to him with proposals," Senator Bennett said. "Then the decision will be made on instinct, and that's what has always attracted me to Dole -- his instincts.'
Many of the advisers have their own areas of expertise and their own agendas.
Mr. Dole, by all accounts, relies heavily on Mr. Bennett to provide him with perspective on how legislation would affect business people, especially entrepreneurs. Before being elected to the Senate, Mr. Bennett built a company in Utah called Franklin Quest, which produces day planners and organizers and now employs 2,700 people. He sold his stake in the company before his election in 1992.
"The net growth in jobs is going to come out of the entrepreneurial side of the economy," Mr. Bennett said.
Mr. Dole often speaks to Mr. Angell about tax issues and the economy's performance. And Senator Mack not only compiles critiques of Mr. Clinton's economic record but also has a strong interest in monetary policy and in keeping the Federal Reserve focused on fighting inflation.
Senator Dole will frequently ask one or more of his advisers to look at a particular issue and provide him with a brief rundown on the economic and political implications of it. He has been happy to contrast his style of economic decision-making and the kinds of people he relies on with those of Mr. Clinton.
"Many top Clinton Administration officials, including the President himself, claim degrees from the world's most prestigious universities," Senator Dole, who graduated from Washburn Municipal University in Topeka, said in a speech last fall. "But in their graduate programs and policy schools, they seem to have learned everything about our economy except what really makes it go -- the hard work, creativity and idealism of a free people."
To his political opponents in the New Hampshire primary last month, Mr. Dole clearly displayed a lack of interest in economic policy when he told workers at an electronics factory, "I didn't realize that jobs and trade and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last days of this campaign."
Even some of his supporters acknowledge that the Senator has had difficulty finding his voice in talking to voters regarding their concerns about job security and the economy's long-term health.
But they said it would be a mistake to conclude that Mr. Dole does not have a grasp of or interest in economic policy. Indeed, they said, as a former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and as the Senate majority leader at a time when balancing the budget has topped the political agenda, he is well versed in the details of tax and economic policy and has a good grounding in how legislation works in the real world.
"The view of Dole that he's not interested or too political is not justified," Mr. Angell said. "If he is not interested in economic ideas, how is it that he has always been a reliable supporter of opening the world to freer trade when there is always pressure from special interest groups that want to close off imports."
Instead of deliberating on the subtleties of policy, advisers said, Mr. Dole wants to get straight to deciding how enactment of a policy will harm or benefit those who would be affected.
"You have to learn to come to the point very quickly, because if you don't, his attention will wander to other topics," Senator Bennett said. "Dole will not sit down and have a discussion about the intricacies of movements in the discount rate by the Fed, but he is much more interested in the impact of Federal economic decisions in the real world of commerce, Main Street as well as Wall Street."

HEADLINE: Tenants' Choice: Their Dog or Their Home;
Pet Owners Face Eviction in New Rule by Connecticut Housing Project

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn., March 25

 BODY:
In a housing project where gangs deal drugs and the playgrounds are sprinkled with shattered glass, the risk posed by Teddie, a 3-year-old Pomeranian the size of a football, might not seem to be grounds for eviction.
"He's scared of a knock on the door," Nick Nation, his 15-year-old owner, said. 
 But to the New London Housing Authority, there is no difference between a Pomeranian and a pit bull. Last week, all dogs were ordered out of the Briarcliff and Bates Woods projects by May 31 or their owners would be evicted. According to the housing authority, tenants are being terrorized by packs of vicious dogs that roam the streets and occasionally attack children.
"I don't think of this as banning dogs," Frederick L. Wallace, the authority's executive director, said. "I see it as liberating people."
The issue has emerged here as housing authorities around the nation are cracking down on pets. In Allegheny County, Pa., last October, after a court battle that went to the State Supreme Court, the local housing authority demanded that tenants part with not only dogs and cats, but also chameleons, goldfish and gerbils. Since July, the San Francisco Housing Authority, plagued by what some consider the worst pit bull problem of any public housing in the nation, has evicted about 50 residents for keeping dogs.
And in New York City, Ruben Franco, the housing authority's chairman, provoked an uproar last year when he sent letters to 600,000 tenants saying: "Do not jeopardize the roof over your head. If you have a dog, get rid of it." Only after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who owns a yellow Labrador retriever, weighed in was the policy narrowed to animals that residents complained about as threats to health or safety.
Animals are not allowed in Federally financed housing projects, unless the owner is elderly or disabled, but the law is often disregarded. Still, the issue has become more pressing in recent years with the growing popularity of pit bulls and a host of well-publicized incidents in which these dogs have mauled small children.
The two New London projects, which comprise 300 brick two-story townhouse apartments, receive no Federal money and are financed by state and local governments. They are intended for the working poor, charging $260 monthly to families for a two-bedroom apartment.
For years, these projects have allowed dogs, as long as they were insured and licensed by the city and had the proper shots. Recently the animals have met growing opposition from tenants, and in June, the projects banned any new dogs and prohibited pit bulls, Rottweilers and Doberman pinschers.
"The policy was impossible to enforce," Mr. Wallace, the housing director, said. "You'd see a dog wandering in the street and you didn't know whether it was legal or illegal." He recalled questioning one owner about a dog that looked to Mr. Wallace to be a Rottweiler and being told that it was part German shepherd.
Over the last five months, dogs have bitten at least three people, including a 5-year-old girl on roller skates, and Mr. Wallace said that when he took the job in December, one of the first things that tenant groups urged him to do was get rid of the dogs. Although no exact count has been made of dogs in the projects, Mr. Wallace said that it was easily more than 30.
"One night I came home from bingo and had to sit in my car for a half-hour because of these big dogs in front of my house," Iris Gilbert, a tenant, said.
On Friday afternoon, as Mr. Wallace toured the grounds, another tenant, Eleanor Tate, 53, an advocate in a Head Start program, gave him a thumbs-up sign as she drove by. "I step in dog feces all the time," she said. "Why say little Fluffy can stay, but a Doberman can't? A dog is a dog."
But the dog owners, who are raising money to hire a lawyer, contend that all dogs are not alike and that a dog is only as good as its owner.
Pedro Morocho, a 28-year-old unemployed laborer, walked his yellow Labrador retriever, Nestor, through some paces for visitors the other day. "Dame la mano," he told the dog in Spanish, and Nestor wagged his tail, gave Mr. Morocho a paw and then licked his face. A few minutes later, Nestor was distracted by his tail and began enthusiastically spinning in circles as he tried to catch it.
When encouraged to pose for a picture, the dog kept trying to kiss the photographer.
"What are we supposed to do, kill him?" Mr. Morocho said glumly, noting that he and his wife were looking for another apartment but were not sure where they could find one for so little money.
"Why don't they just take the bad dogs?" he asked.
The problem is that "bad" may be in the eye of the beholder. At first glance, another dog in the projects, a lean German shepherd named Blitz with a bark as loud as a howitzer, might be considered bad. He lives behind a door with the sign "Warning, Property Protected by Guard Dog."
Blitz, a graduate of a $600 guard-dog training program, answers only to commands in German. When introduced to visitors recently, he strained at his leash and bared his teeth. "Platz," his owner, Tina Chappell, said, and the dog sat.
But Ms. Chappell, 29, considers Blitz, who has never bitten anyone and never goes out without her, a hero. The run-down Briarcliff project, which is strewn with litter and pocked with broken windows and abandoned apartments, is troubled by crime. A murder took place there a year or so ago, and burglaries are not uncommon.
One night, Ms. Chappell said, someone tried to force his way into her apartment, and Blitz barked and "hit the door so hard" that no sane person would have dreamed of entering. When she leaves late at night to work the graveyard shift at a Dunkin' Donuts, she feels that her two children are safe because of the dog, she said, echoing a sentiment voiced by other dog owners.
"I cleared it with the authority five years ago before I got him," Ms. Chappell said. "Now it's like a landlord saying you can't have your kids. My son and daughter are in tears."
Others say the ban is outright discrimination. "What about the cats?" a longtime tenant said.
Mr. Wallace, the housing director, who has owned some big dogs in his life, said that he is not anti-dog, but a pragmatist. It is "a privilege to live in public housing," he said, and sometimes people have to "sacrifice some freedom for the greater good."
The best protection is not dogs, but getting to know your neighbors and establishing block watches, Mr. Wallace added. He has started a dog adoption program to try to avoid having any of the pets put to sleep and to find good homes for them.
Are cats next?
"They don't bother me," Mr. Wallace said. "They're nice. They eat mice. They don't bite kids."

HEADLINE: Wood Pulp Prices Off 40% Since Autumn

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: TORONTO, March 31

 BODY:
The prices of North American wood pulp have fallen 40 percent since last fall, one of the sharpest price reversals in the history of the industry, and consumers of many paper products, from tissues and paper towels to stationery and envelopes, are expected to find lower prices.
Surging inventories and slower growth in paper consumption worldwide are behind the price cuts, which have dropped the price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp, a bellwether grade, from $985 a metric ton in November to $575 in mid-March, the lowest level since 1991. The decline, however, followed big increases over the last several years. 
 "I would think there would be even more slippage as producers compete on price," said Harold Cody, director of a forecasting service for Pulp and Paper magazine, a trade journal. Pulp is made from wood chips and other residue at lumber mills.
Mr. Cody estimated that prices of some grades of printing papers at the wholesale level were down 20 to 30 percent. Linerboard, which is used for boxes and cartons, has been under similar pressure.
The Procter & Gamble Company said last week that it was cutting list prices for its facial tissues, bath tissues and paper towels by 4.8 to 8.6 percent, citing the lower pulp prices.
Competitors are expected to make comparable cuts.
Though many newsprint producers have their own integrated pulp mills and do not buy pulp on the open market, the weakness in pulp prices has been a factor in their recent decisions to cancel price increases for newsprint.
Canada is the world's largest supplier of pulp. In the first two months of this year, shipments fell 18 percent, according to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association.
As producers increased prices in 1995, pulp on hand at mills in Canada, the United States and the Nordic countries, the principal supply points, shot up to 2 million tons from 1.1 million, the fastest rise in inventory levels since the mid-1970's.
Struggling to get inventories down to more manageable levels, North American mills have announced extensive shutdowns. MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., a giant producer in British Columbia, is closing its lumber and sawmill operations until May 4, affecting 1,250 workers.
Crestbrook Forest Industries, Slocan Forest Products and Repap Enterprises are among other Canadian companies that have announced temporary shutdowns. Georgia-Pacific idled 14 lumber mills from Maine to Arkansas in the last two weeks of December.
After price weakness and the severe winter, which has also affected bottom lines, analysts expect that first-quarter earnings of many paper companies will take a dive.
"In the first quarter we'll see virtually every company with far lower earnings and further deterioration in the second quarter based on the sharp drop that's already occurred in pricing," said Mark Rogers, paper industry analyst for Prudential Securities in New York.
Yet some analysts expect a turnaround later this year. Patricia Mohr, a vice president of economics at the Toronto headquarters of the Bank of Nova Scotia, pointed to the "relatively favorable" underlying demand for most paper products. "This is a big inventory correction but it will come to an end over the next few months," she predicted.
And Sam Magid, an analyst with Salman Partners of Vancouver, British Columbia, said that as mills go through temporary shutdowns to reduce pulp, they also reduce supplies of lumber, a commodity that has recently had rising prices. Since the fourth quarter, the producer price of a bellwether grade of two-by-fours has risen to $295 for 1,000 board feet from $244. "The death of the pulp market," Mr. Magid said, "brings with it breaths of life to the lumber market."

Making an Elegant U-Turn Toward Indulgence

BYLINE: By By AMY M. SPINDLER 

 BODY:
Robert Hughes, in his book of essays on art, "Nothing if Not Critical," takes this swipe at those who would measure the art market in decades: "The inflation of the market, the victory of promotion over connoisseurship, the manufacture of art-related glamour, the poverty of art training, the embattled state of museums -- these will not vanish, as at the touch of a wand, now that 1990 is here."
Substitute fashion for art and stores for museums and that pretty much sums up fashion's sluggishness in recovering from 1980's excess. There has been no wand for fashion, either. But this is the first season in a while in which -- in New York, the most commercial of fashion's capitals -- some designers have begun to embrace connoisseurship again. 
 The conservative chic that the boring past year produced offered expensive clothes for women who really didn't like fashion at all. How could anyone who loves fashion take pleasure in the joyless suits and dull sheaths? In Paris, the best example of fashion returning to its creative mission was at Comme des Garcons. In New York, it was certainly at Marc Jacobs, where hints of Bloomsbury, the 20's and the English eccentric were secondary messages; the first love here was the love of getting dressed up, a ritual that for some women will never be part of a dull routine.
Victor Alfaro and Mr. Jacobs both offered caviar clothes this season -- Mr. Alfaro, pure chic richness, and Mr. Jacobs, an elegant, ornate collection full of charm and more than a hint of decadence in the gilded, shiny fabrics and precise cuts.
Though Ghost's clothes were more minimal, its designer, Tanya Sarne, picked up the mood of the weekend, showing in the former American Savings Bank on Union Square, with film crews tucked around the teller's cage and with caviar, toast points and Absolut vodka on every table.
It was another kind of indulgence that drove Betsey Johnson's show, an upbeat tribute to Patti Smith's styles through the years. Nicole Miller, who seemed to have lost confidence in her quirky style last season, was back to off colors, alarming prints and personal take on hip.
Indeed, it was a weekend in which confidence was the key to success. Nowhere was it more winning than at Mr. Jacobs's show, where the designer seemed to have dipped everything in molten gold or silver for a collection that glowed from within. It was an optimistic, heartening vision, from trench coats glazed lightly and worn with a golden leather skirt to velours that glittered to tweeds that sparkled to the shimmering panne velvet dresses that closed the show. There were sweet indulgences: a hand-embroidered candy-colored camisole beneath a double-faced cashmere coat with feather trim and a platinum leather coat over a red-and-brown damask 1920's-style dress.
Mr. Jacobs is one of fashion's most prescient designers. This collection was the best news the industry could possibly receive, a sign of heady hedonism to come.
It would have been possible over the last few years to have underestimated Mr. Alfaro as a guy who makes nice dresses. As Lawrence of Arabia once said, "Nothing is written."
With a combination of sheer will, smart politics and an enviable ability to figure out the needs of such coveted clients as those recently well-married Miller sisters, Mr. Alfaro has made himself into much, much more than a dress designer. There are many designers as talented as Mr. Alfaro. But without his other qualities, they couldn't possibly expect to be where he was on Saturday, working with some of the most sumptuous fabrics this season and with impressive front-row guests, including the fellow Latin American Oscar de la Renta.
In the deepest ink blue, olive, burgundy and camel, Mr. Alfaro's mink-trimmed camel-hair jackets, belted cashmere cardigans, thick leather jackets with mink collars, open-weave crocheted cardigans and slim belted suits offered fresh, clean luxury, a step above conservative chic.
Mr. Alfaro seems to have determined that he will dress the young ladies who lunch. And what is clear is that, if Mr. Alfaro determines something, he gets it.
There is perhaps no designer more underestimated than Ms. Johnson, who has more life, youth and energy in her shows than there are in the average mosh pit. This season, she gave tribute to Patti Smith's fashion, with each segment tailored to landmarks in the rocker's life: the Chelsea Hotel, Max's Kansas City, the Kitchen, CBGB, the Factory, the Village Gate and Lady Astor's. With all the models in black Patti Smith wigs, Ms. Johnson showed baby doll and earth mother, monastic and metal and what she called "lava-lamp blue minithong dress" and "chlorine blue Buddha jeans and fur kimono."
It was all to the tunes of "People Have the Power," "Dancing Barefoot" and "So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star," ending with Ultra, a new all-black collection in jersey that will be more expensive than the main Betsey Johnson line. It seems time for Ms. Johnson to seize her own star status.
While plying the audience with caviar and salmon, Ms. Sarne showed the least decadent-looking clothes of the group, many in blinding white. There were minimalist tunics slashed up the front, hooded dresses, lean mandarin collar suits with tiny hooks up the front and pretty long bias-cut dresses. She also played with tweeds for the first time, in salt-and-pepper stretch fabrics.
And Ms. Miller, who took her minimalism a bit too far last season, bounced back with computer-generated prints, hexagonal pieced color-blocked sheath dresses and cool new Sergeant Pepper jackets that snapped up the front. Ghost and Ms. Miller both offer fashion for a fair price, and it is the spirit of their shows that make them work on the runway in a pricey world that excludes far too many women.

HEADLINE: Don't Capsize the U.N.

 BODY:
The United Nations is in financial straits that are deep, dangerous and only partly deserved. As of the beginning of this year, half its members had not paid last year's dues in full, with the United States leading the pack. The deadbeat total has swelled to $3.1 billion. According to Joseph Connor, the Under Secretary General for Administration, the U.N. faces a cash crisis that could curtail or even shut down its operations by November.
The U.N. is out of fashion these days, and alarms about its financial problems have been raised before. But this time the crisis is acute. While the organization still needs much reform, it should not be allowed to wither for lack of money. 
 In past years, the U.N. kept afloat by borrowing from separate peacekeeping accounts to cover shortfalls in its $1.3 billion operating budget. But a reduction in peacekeeping has eliminated this option. America's debt, which represents a default on a treaty obligation, is an inexcusable embarrassment. Washington owes $699 million for this year's regular budget and $909 million for peacekeeping operations. No country has a worse record.
Americans rightly ask whether the U.N. has done its share to cut costs. Mr. Connor, who has applied rigorous American accounting standards to U.N. bookkeeping, maintains that financial management demands by Congress have been met. The U.N. budget has not been increased since 1994. A new inspector general, Germany's Karl Paschke, is aggressively investigating waste and fraud.
Some abuses persist. Senior echelons of the U.N. are clogged with patronage appointees. Trade, trusteeship and development agencies overlap with other U.N. offices. The American share of the budget needs to be cut to 20 percent from 25 percent.
Over the decades the U.N. has unquestionably helped end wars and preserve the peace in many regions, mediating and monitoring cease-fires. It has helped put human rights, including women's rights, on the diplomatic agenda. Its specialized agencies track epidemics, provide shelter for millions of refugees displaced by war and disasters and perform other indispensable tasks to which little attention is paid or credit accorded.
Congress has agreed to a foreign affairs budget that meets the Administration more than halfway with a five-year plan for paying back dues. It provides $823 million instead of the requested $934 million for dues, and the full $445 million for peacekeeping sought by the White House.
Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina insists in return that Mr. Clinton agree to fold any one of three now-independent Federal agencies dealing with arms control, information and foreign aid into the State Department. It is not a pleasant choice, but Mr. Clinton should settle on one, preferably the Agency for International Development, and end the deadlock with Mr. Helms.
If Washington fails to come up with money solemnly promised by three successive Presidents, not only downsizing but capsizing the U.N., it would be a moral and financial default by the organization's principal founder.

HEADLINE: After 12 Years of Delay, New Snag Clouds Coliseum's Future

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
After 12 years of debate and delay in deciding the fate of the New York Coliseum, a new snag has left the project's future as murky as ever as the city and state continue to haggle over whether to set aside part of any new building for trade shows.
The standoff, between John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, and Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, has pushed the next step in the project past a deadline. That is because both officials had promised to solicit proposals from prospective developers by the end of March. 
 Mr. Dyson insists that the project include convention space. His staff analyzed the benefits of a new convention center on the Columbus Circle site last year, finding that it would generate $30 million a year in taxes for the city and create thousands of jobs.
But Mr. Gargano has rejected the city's plan, saying that "setting aside any part of that property for exhibition space would simply lower its value."
After years of public protest and court challenges since the Coliseum site first went on sale in 1984, one more missed deadline is hardly provoking an outcry from neighborhood groups, who have vowed to fight any proposal they consider too large, or developers, who are eagerly waiting to bid on one of New York City's most valuable real estate parcels.
But the dispute between City Hall and Albany hinges on conflicting agendas for the city's economy, and has thrown the shape and timing of the Coliseum project into greater doubt.
And delaying the project further, critics say, will only add to the huge financial losses that the city, the state and the coliseum's owner, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, have already sustained by keeping the building mothballed or in partial use.
In the background of the dispute is the M.T.A., which proposed last year that the sale of the Coliseum be postponed for a decade or more until Manhattan's weak real estate market recovers. The agency has since reopened the building for trade shows.
In recent months, with both Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki hoping that the Coliseum project will be a showpiece of their campaigns to privatize government operations, the M.T.A.'s chairman, E. Virgil Conway, a Pataki appointee, has accepted a back seat in the negotiations while quietly siding with Mr. Gargano.
"Our real estate people feel that some combination of retail and residential development would give us the best return," said John Cunningham, an M.T.A. spokesman. "But the bottom line is we want the highest possible use and, if somebody can come up with something that includes exhibition space, we won't necessarily object."
The disagreement between city and state officials has as much to do with New York City's shifting economic landscape as it does with politics.
If the Coliseum site is offered for sale any time soon, it will be at a time when the economics of real estate development are vastly different than in 1984, when the M.T.A. put the building on the market. Manhattan was beginning a development boom then, and Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the publisher and builder, won preliminary approval to erect apartment towers on the site that would have filled almost every inch of height and density allowed by the city.
That deal, presided over by Mayor Edward I. Koch, came as the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was nearing completion, when the Coliseum's exhibition space was considered redundant. But the scale of Mr. Zuckerman's project provoked a storm of protest and lawsuits that ultimately forced him to walk away in 1994.
Although the blocks on the Upper West Side surrounding the Coliseum have since attracted several new projects -- including Donald J. Trump's redevelopment of the Gulf and Western Building into a hotel and apartment building -- most of Manhattan's real estate market is considered too weak to support new construction. That makes it difficult for anyone to predict how much the Coliseum site would fetch.
And executives in the tourism and convention industry, lending some strength to Mr. Dyson's argument for new convention space at the Coliseum site, say that New York has lost ground to cities like Chicago, San Francisco and New Orleans because the Javits Center cannot accommodate enough trade shows and conventions.
Indeed, while the Javits Center has been close to fully booked in recent years, the city's share of the most profitable convention business -- the kind of gatherings that attract out-of-town visitors who stay in hotels -- has dwindled.
According to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, the city attracted 346 out-of-town conventions and trade shows last year, down from 478 in 1994 and 568 in 1993. "It is safe to say we have lost a lot of business opportunities over the decade that the Coliseum has been out of operation," said Steven Morello, executive director of the Convention and Visitors Bureau.
But if that seems to support Mr. Dyson's case, he said, the equation is actually even more complex.
"By itself, the Coliseum would not be the solution," Mr. Morello said, adding that the site was too small for a convention center that could compete with those in other cities. He said a better approach was to expand the Javits Center or find another large site.
Amid the uncertainty about when anything will be built, the M.T.A. has been trying since January to fill the Coliseum with conventions and exhibitions. To enable a development plan to proceed, it says it will take reservations no more than a year in advance but has nonetheless filled much of its calendar this year. The biggest event will be in June, when the Smithsonian Institution's 150th Anniversary Show will fill all four floors.
But even with such business, the M.T.A. said it was collecting far less in fees from exhibitors than the Coliseum did before it was closed in the 1980's. Mr. Cunningham said the agency expected to collect $1.4 million this year, compared with $3 million in 1984, the last year the Coliseum was in full operation.
To make matters worse, he said, the M.T.A. will have to spend $5 million this year to fix the building's leaky roof and complete other long-delayed repairs, making the Coliseum a "money-losing situation."
For now, no one promises any immediate insight into the Coliseum site's long-term future. Mr. Dyson said he hoped, but could not be certain, that the city, the state and the M.T.A. could agree to a joint request for proposals within three months. Mr. Gargano declined to speculate. "I couldn't set a date," he said.

GRAPHIC: Chronology: "CHRONOLOGY: The Coliseum Saga"
 
December 1984 -- The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city reach a deal to sell the New York Coliseum and to use the proceeds -- an estimated $200 million -- to improve the city's transit system.
 
July 1985 -- The M.T.A. chooses Boston Properties, headed by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, to redevelop the Coliseum site. The project is immense: 2.9 million square feet for stores, offices and apartments. So is the sale price: $455.1 million.
 
September 1986 -- Three community boards in Manhattan object to the Zuckerman plan as neighborhood opposition grows. Critics say the project is too big.
 
December 1987 -- Salomon Brothers, a co-owner and principal tenant of the project, withdraws amid widespread layoffs in the securities business. The developer vows to press ahead.
 
January 1988 -- The city and the M.T.A. agree to a new price of $357 million.
 
June 1988 -- Mr. Zuckerman scales down his plan by 500,000 square feet, making the towers shorter and thinner.
 
April 1989 -- To resolve legal and administrative challenges, the project is redesigned again and the price is cut to $338 million. It now calls for 2.1 million square feet. Community boards voice support, but the Manhattan real estate market descends into a deep slump.
 
May 1989 -- The Board of Estimate approves the 59-story project.
 
November 1993 -- Boston Properties submits its final proposal, cutting the space to about 1 million square feet and preserving the existing office building. Officials say construction will begin in late 1994.
 
June 1994 -- Mr. Zuckerman and the M.T.A. agree on a new deal in which he would pay $80 milion for half the original site. Mr. Zuckerman agrees to put up a nonrefundable $17 million deposit.
 
July 1994 -- After nine years of challenges and court battles, Mr. Zuckerman's deal collapses when he misses a deadline to sign a contract with the M.T.A.
 
January 1995 -- The M.T.A. begins seeking short-term tenants for the vacant Coliseum.
 
September 1995 -- After minimal renovation, the Coliseum reopens as what it was designed to be in 1954, a home for commercial trade shows.
 
November 1995 -- The state and city agree to look for a new buyer for the Coliseum. Officials promise that requests for new development proposals will be issued before the end of the year.
 
March 1996 -- The requests for proposals still haven't gone out, despite a March 31 deadline, because state and city officials cannot agree on whether the redeveloped Coliseum site should include convention space.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: IN CONGRESS;
The Speaker's Gruff No. 2 Takes Charge in the House

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
When he arrived on Capitol Hill in 1985, the Almanac of American Politics promptly summed up the politically crude, rough-edged and brooding Texan as someone "hardly likely to be a power in the House."
Representative Dick Armey is still politically crude, rough-edged and brooding. But 12 years after quitting a college classroom to run for Congress, he has become one of the most powerful politicians in Washington. 
 Several predecessors could be cited to rival Newt Gingrich for the title of most powerful Speaker of the House in the nation's history. But it is almost universally accepted in Washington these days that never has a majority leader, the No. 2 job in the House that Mr. Armey holds, commanded so much authority.
Unabashedly partisan, fiercely conservative and with a tongue as sharp as barbed wire, the 55-year-old Mr. Armey has emerged as the leading Republican voice in the House as well as the majority's biggest political stick.
"Nobody enjoys confrontation, I certainly don't," Mr. Armey said in an interview last Wednesday. "But it is a tool and sometimes you use it."
Since the start of the second session of the 104th Congress in January, Mr. Gingrich's low poll ratings have become a drag on the Republican majority and its agenda, which has been suffering. In the face of that and, more important, to free himself to travel around the country raising money for Republican candidates, the Speaker has ceded more and more of the day-to-day power to his deputy. As a result, Mr. Armey has a decisive voice in determining which bill will be brought to the floor, in what form and when.
It is rare for any leader to trust his No. 2 with such power. But Mr. Armey describes himself as "a man totally without guile," and Mr. Gingrich, and even some of Mr. Armey's most ardent critics, agree.
"He hasn't tried to trim his sails as majority leader and he has not been one who looks for compromise," said Representative Martin Frost of Texas, whose district abuts Mr. Armey's and who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "He does not have a hidden agenda. What you see is what you get with Armey."
Mr. Armey, who is 6 feet 3 inches tall, gravelly voiced and usually scowling, has cultivated a reputation as a political brawler.
In the 103d Congress, which overlapped the first two years of the Clinton Administration, it was Mr. Armey who frequently led the jousts with the White House over the budget and taxes. In the debate over health care he once denounced Hillary Rodham Clinton, who led the Administration's fight on the issue, as a Marxist.
"I was just being my naturally charming self," Mr. Armey said later. Mrs. Clinton called him "the Dr. Kevorkian of health-care reform."
Leadership has not dulled Mr. Armey's tongue or his style.
Barely three weeks into the 104th Congress, he was engulfed in controversy when, in a radio interview, he referred to Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, a Democrat who is a homosexual, as "Barney Fag."
Mr. Armey called it an "unintentional mispronounciation" of Mr. Frank's name and he apologized immediately. But six months later the majority leader was again under attack when, in a television interview, he referred to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People as "a misguided special-interest organization."
Politically safe in an affluent district that is anchored by Dallas suburbs, nearly 90 percent white and staunchly conservative, Mr. Armey has been known for wry jokes and quick-fire oratory that has kept him and the Republicans on the defensive as much as it was intended to keep the Democrats on their heels.
"Dick Armey is becoming more and more aware that he cannot shoot from the hip," said one of his advisers. "It took him awhile to realize that he does not only speak for Dick Armey any longer, but for the Republican majority in the House of Representatives."
Mr. Armey readily concedes as much: "When we first came into power, both Newt and I were besieged by the media and we frankly were too generous, and both of us had a couple of stumbles early on. I have learned to be much more sparing. And another thing I have learned is not to respond to hypothetical questions."
Richard Keith Armey was born on July 7, 1940, in Cando (pronounced CAN-do), a small farming town in North Dakota. He worked at a grain elevator and as a lineman for a rural electric company.
Along the way he developed a passion for running, even running marathons, and fishing, especially at a favored spot on the upper Potomac River, where he wades into chest-deep waters in search of bass. He often goes fishing with Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court, whose wife, Virginia, is a senior aide in Mr. Armey's office.
Mr. Armey's other passion is keeping Big Government at arm's length. "I've always been taught that if you make a deal with the Government then you are the junior partner," he said.
Except for being a favorite speaker on the conservative circuit, political power has not placed Mr. Armey on the Washington social register. He is a devoted homebody -- "just like an old nag," he said, "once they take the bridle off on Capitol Hill, I just head to the barn."
Mr. Armey, who received a bachelor's degree from Jamestown College in North Dakota in 1963 and a master's from the University of North Dakota a year later, left his home state for the University of Oklahoma, where he received a Ph.D. in economics in 1969.
A job offer from North Texas State University brought him to Texas, and a C-Span broadcast of proceedings in the House helped lure him to Washington. As Mr. Armey likes to tell it, he and his wife, Susan, were watching the broadcast when he remarked, "Honey, those people sound like a bunch of darn fools."
"Yeah," his wife replied. "You could do that."
Despite his lack of political experience, Mr. Armey defeated a freshman Democrat, Representative Tom Vandergriff, in 1984, and arrived in Washington as a self-described "budget commando."
"Jack Kemp told me when I was a freshman, 'You're scary, you're a very scary guy,' " Mr. Armey said. "I think there's something about my physical appearance. I'm a big guy and I have this stormy look."
"But I'm funny," he added. "I'm really one of the funniest guys I know."
When he arrived on Capitol Hill, the off-beat college professor and father of five soon provided some amusement with his much-publicized decision to sleep in the House gymnasium, and later in his office, as a way to save money. Ten years later, as part of the Republican leadership, he declined to ride herd on several freshmen who took up residency in their offices.
Mr. Armey first came to national prominence in 1987, when he proposed an independent commission operating outside politics to shut down hundreds of obsolete military bases; Congress approved the legislation a year later. In 1990, he led a bipartisan coalition in a winning assault on agricultural subsidies.
And Mr. Armey was one of the earliest and most vocal proponents of the flat tax.
His rise as a political power in Washington began slightly less than three years ago, when he won the chairmanship of the Republican Conference Committee in the 103d Congress. That made him No. 3 in a party hierarchy that had Mr. Gingrich as second-in-command as the minority whip and Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois as the minority leader.
Mr. Armey and Mr. Gingrich were the major architects of the Contract With America, the political manifesto that helped the Republicans take control of the House in the 1994 elections for the first time in 40 years.
And it was Mr. Armey who supervised the effort to turn the political promises into draft legislation and then held together the Republican majority, including the unruly freshmen, to force House passage of all but one of the 10 parts of the contract.
Behind the scenes, Mr. Armey has acted as a restraint to the sometimes impulsive Mr. Gingrich. "Newt is a history professor and has this very broad sweep of the world," Mr. Armey said. "I'm a micro-economist and I look at the details."
"I'm fascinated by policy," he continued. "I'll do politics when I have to, and I think I do it well, but it's not my favorite pastime."
More times than not, he has played the role of "bad cop," manipulating the rules of debate to shut out Democrats and his own party's moderates. Although Democrats did the same thing to their opponents when they were in power, Mr. Armey's actions have brought him some criticism. But they have also won him a fiercely loyal following among conservative groups -- and adoration from a freshman class that sees the majority leader as a political soul mate.
"Dick Armey has the same bent not to waver even if there are problems in public perception about what we are doing," said Representative John Hostettler, a Republican freshman from Indiana. "He is not going to go along just to get along."
Republican conservatives insisted that Mr. Armey be brought into the White House discussions on balancing the budget, along with President Clinton, Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, and Mr. Gingrich.
Some who were involved in those budget talks have said that Mr. Armey acted as a political counterweight to the hard-line stance taken by two top officials in the Clinton Administration, Vice President Al Gore and the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta.
"I don't have much fear that the Speaker will compromise all our goals away," Mr. Hostettler said. "But I can tell you that, in a supporting role, there was absolutely no fear of that when Dick Armey is in the room."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ECONOMY;
Can the President Capitalize On the Economy's Strength?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom in American politics is that a strong economy greatly helps incumbents, especially incumbent Presidents, and that a weak economy hurts them badly.
Some academics have gone so far as to quantify the point. Michael S. Lewis-Beck, a politicial scientist at the University of Iowa, has shown that almost every time since World War II that the unemployment rate was falling in the second quarter of an election year, the incumbent's party won the Presidency in November. Ray C. Fair, an economist at Yale, has found that the percentage of the popular vote a Presidential candidate receives can be explained by a formula that measures the rate of inflation, the overall rate of economic growth and the number of calendar quarters in a Presidency in which the economy has been particularly strong. 
 But many believe that the old rules about voters and the economy may not apply. One reason is that the economy today is so mixed.
On the one hand, unemployment and inflation are extraordinarily low. Fears of recession have faded. Business investment and exports are strong. And the stock market seems to break new ceilings weekly.
On the other hand, the pace of economic growth is excruciatingly slow, wages and family income are flat and the degree of public anxiety about layoffs is unusually high.
But there is another, perhaps more important reason that the economy may not be the central force this year that it has been in past Presidential elections, and it is an anomaly that political analysts are just beginning to discuss. The public seems to be giving President Clinton little credit for his economic accomplishments and little blame for the economy's shortcomings.
When the economy was strong under Ronald Reagan and George Bush, The New York Times/CBS News polls show, the public gave the Presidents credit. When the economy was weak, their poll ratings plunged.
But in the last two years, while the polls have consistently shown that most people believe the economy is relatively strong, not once has a majority approved of the way Mr. Clinton is handling the economy.
Why that should be the case is a matter of some dispute.
Lloyd Bentsen, who was Treasury Secretary in the first two years of the Clinton Administration and who now practices law in Houston, said the fault lay with Mr. Clinton's staff and Cabinet. "They don't talk about it enough," Mr. Bentsen said. "They have to be out there selling the jobs that have been created and the other accomplishments, and they're not doing that."
Prof. Charles O. Jones, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin who specializes in Presidents, said that to the contrary, the fault was Mr. Clinton's for not taking personal responsibility for the economy, or, for that matter, much else.
"You never have a feeling that this is the guy who's in charge," Professor Jones said. "If he is not projecting an image of being in control, then why should people give him any credit or any blame?"
Professor Lewis-Beck at the Univeristy of Iowa agreed with this assessment and said his models for forecasting the outcome of elections based on economic factors might no longer be valid if the public no longer sees the President as the central figure in the Government.
Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said the biggest difference in this respect between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Clinton was that Mr. Reagan articulated a direct relationship between his actions and how the economy responded, while Mr. Clinton had never managed to do this.
"Reagan would talk about how he disciplined Government, how he cut taxes, so there was a story in people's head about why he deserved the credit," Mr. Garin said. "This Administration says they reduced the deficit, which led to lower interest rates, and they opened up foreign markets, but they never establish a cause and effect between this and the state of the economy."
On the White House staff and among Mr. Clinton's political advisers, the question of how he should deal with the economy is a matter of the highest order and one that has not been fully resolved.
Before the days of overarching budget deficits, Presidents could prime the economic pump in election years, distributing new programs here and new projects there, and people could see the connection between Government action and the economy. But this is not a luxury President Clinton can afford.
Gene Sperling, an economic adviser in the White House, put the situation this way: "In the economy we inherited -- high deficits, slow job growth and a stop-and-go economy -- the improvements we could make in the economy are fairly substantial but fairly subtle."
Mr. Sperling said the economy would "definitely be a plus" for Mr. Clinton in the fall campaign, but that too presents a problem.
This time four years ago, when the economy was struggling out of a recession, Mr. Bush maintained that the economy was strong, and Mr. Clinton told strapped voters that he felt their pain.
So what does the President say this year? If he stresses the strength of the economy, he risks seeming insensitive, a trap that may have cost Mr. Bush the election. But if he paints the economy as weak, then voters have every right to ask why he has not fixed the problem.
In his recent speeches, he has emphasized how the two biggest promises on the economy he made in his campaign four years ago have been fulfilled: eight million jobs have been created, and the budget deficit has been cut in half, to an estimated $140 billion this year from $290 billion in 1992.
But then he quickly says that much more needs to be done. For example, in a speech to the Ohio Democratic Party in Columbus last weekend, the President said: "This is a record to build on, not to stand on. We have to meet the challenges of all those Americans out there who do not feel strong and certain about the future."
It is a delicate dance, because so many Americans do not feel strong about the future. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll found that twice as many (29 percent) felt the economy was getting worse as felt it was getting better (14 percent), while 55 percent believed the economy was staying about the same.
"At least he has avoided one hit," Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat, said of Mr. Clinton, referring to the favorable unemployment and inflation numbers.
"Whether he can turn that to his advantage," the Senator added, "is quite a different matter."

Placing Blame for a Scandal
Paul Rodriguez is head of a social services agency in East Harlem that was a more highly rated bidder for two city contracts to monitor welfare recipients, but lost out to a politically connected agency in Queens. After Mayor Giuliani canceled the contracts following questions of propriety, he placed the bulk of the blame for what happened outside his administration -- squarely on Mr. Rodriguez's agency. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. [B1.]

H.I.P. Failing to Pay Bills
The Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, the state's largest and oldest health maintenance organization, routinely fails to pay millions of dollars of its members' medical bills each year, leaving subscribers to either cover the bills themselves or fight collection agencies and lawsuits from doctors demanding overdue payments. Complaints against H.I.P. to the State Insurance Department outnumber those against any other health maintenance organization in the state -- even accounting for size -- and they are overwhelmingly about bills that H.I.P. ignored, often for years. [Page A1.]
 
Snag Mires Coliseum Project
After 12 years of debate and delay in deciding the fate of the New York Coliseum, a new conflict has left the project's future as murky as ever. John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, insists that the project include convention space, saying that it would generate $30 million a year in taxes for the city and create thousands of jobs. Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, says that "setting aside any part of that property for exhibition space would simply lower its value." [B1.]
 
Plattsburgh's Future on a Train
When a military base closed in Plattsburgh, N.Y., the victim of Federal cuts, the city of 22,000 began courting manufacturers and other businesses that might resuscitate its economy. By offering a package of state and local tax breaks and other incentives, Plattsburgh wooed Bombardier Inc., a Quebec-based aerospace and manufacturing giant. Now, Bombardier and a partner have won a $611 million contract to build high-speed trains for Amtrak, and Plattsburgh is expecting a small economic boom. [B1.]
 
Arson Suspected in Blaze
A two-alarm fire that burned a six-story building in Washington Heights and injured eight tenants -- including five children -- was deliberately set, city firefighters said. A flammable liquid was poured on the third-floor landing as well as on the stairs up to the sixth floor before the building at 214 Audubon Avenue was set ablaze, fire officials said. [B3.]
 
A Summit on the Wet Stuff
Water, the liquid link between rural Catskill communities and New York City residents, was the focus of a weekend "Watershed Youth Summit" in Denning, N.Y., a meeting for 90 students from schools as varied as Brooklyn's Midwood High, enrollment 3,500, and Ulster County's Rondout Valley High, enrollment 300. The meeting was the latest attempt to break the three generations of hostility between the city and the communities whose terrain acts as the catch basin and filter for the city's drinking water. [B3.]
 
Painting the Town Orange
Students and citizens around Syracuse are awash in the team colors of the Syracuse University basketball team -- orange and blue -- and are united in one wish: that the Syracuse Orangemen not be left blue by a defeat in the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball championship final. It is a wish with undercurrents of apprehension; in 1987, the last time the Orangemen made it to the final game and lost, a drunken melee on campus led to smashed beer bottles, shattered windows and damaged cars. [B5.]
 
Officer Arrested in Shooting
An off-duty police officer on the force for less than two weeks was arrested for shooting a woman four times with his service weapon, leaving her critically injured and on a respirator, the police said. [B7.]
 
Message Screens for Subways
The New York City Transit Authority plans to improve communication with riders by placing electronic message screens in 54 stations, to inform riders of the general frequency of trains at a given time and of any delays or complications. [B2.]

In Projects, Dogs Beware
Housing authorities around the nation -- in New York City, San Francisco and New London, Conn. -- are beginning to crack down on pets. Animals are not allowed in Federally financed housing projects, unless the owner is elderly or disabled, but the law is often disregarded. Still, the issue has become more pressing in recent years with the growing popularity of pit bulls and a host of well-publicized incidents in which these dogs have mauled small children. In many cases, residents must get rid of pets or face eviction. [B1.]

HEADLINE: After Losing Air Base, Plattsburgh Glimpses Brighter Future

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: PLATTSBURGH, N.Y.

 BODY:
For more than 180 years, life in Plattsburgh was tied to the military.
Three forts were built here in the War of 1812 to fight the British fleet on Lake Champlain. A few decades later, Army barracks were added. The barracks became a staging area for troops in World War II. In 1952, Plattsburgh Air Force Base opened. At its peak in 1987-88, 5,000 military personnel were stationed at the base, and 900 civilians worked there. 
 When Federal cuts closed the base last year, Plattsburgh lost its sense of self.
Shaken badly, the city of 22,000 began courting manufacturers and other businesses that might resuscitate its economy. By offering a package of state and local tax breaks and other incentives, Plattsburgh wooed Bombardier Inc., a Quebec-based aerospace and manufacturing giant, which opened a plant in the southern part of the city last August. Last month, Bombardier and its partner, GEC Alsthom, a French-British venture, won a $611 million contract to build high-speed trains for Amtrak.
Now Plattsburgh is expecting a small economic boom. Bombardier expects to hire 75 to 150 additional people at its plant here once production of the high-technology trains begins. And that is just part of it.
Amtrak estimates the project will create 6,000 jobs worldwide, many at subcontractors. Before the contract was announced on March 15, Plattsburgh was negotiating with three Bombardier subcontractors to relocate to the city. The Monday after the announcement, there were calls from six more.
For Plattsburgh, the contract means more than jobs and money. It means this city has a future.
"Right through, from the country's birth up to last September, there was a military presence in Plattsburgh," said Mayor Clyde M. Ribideau Jr., a Democrat in his fourth term. "But it's time to move on. Had we not lost Plattsburgh Air Force Base, maybe our community wouldn't have been as aggressive or accommodating to new industry. Maybe our city wouldn't have been ready for Bombardier. It changed our attitude; it made us more aggressive."
"It may be our saving grace for years to come," the Mayor said. "I know it will be."
Battered by layoffs, communities across the country have developed more aggressive strategies, particularly in former military towns like Plattsburgh where the realization has set in that the era of cold war has become the era of cold economics.
David M. Cuttler, Bombardier's vice president for United States operations and general manager of the Plattsburgh plant, credits the Mayor for the deal. "I had a drop-dead day when I would cut my losses and go to an alternate site," Mr. Cuttler said. "He made it."
With so many skilled workers, especially former Air Force employees and farm laborers, looking for jobs, Clinton County turned out to be a perfect place to build trains, Mr. Cuttler said. The plant opened last August and now employs 120 people. They have been working since August on a contract with Metro-North to build 34 train cars.
"It was a psychological victory," the Mayor said. "Not that it was going to be the biggest industry; it would not. Not that it would bring the most jobs; it would not. But we snagged it. We grabbed it. We came home with it and it's ours. We won something on our own merit and it felt good."
The Amtrak deal, the Mayor said, "is really a validation. Our investment is paying off."
The Amtrak project is expected to start early in 1998. Bombardier expects to use the Plattsburgh plant to assemble the power cars, which will whisk the new American Flyer trains through the Northeast Corridor at 150 miles an hour.
But in today's economy of uncertainty, what appear to be clear victories are often ambiguous. Hector Perales loves his job assembling Metro-North railroad cars for Bombardier. But he is not totally jubilant about the Amtrak deal. In the summer, he will probably be laid off.
Before the Bombardier plant here hires more workers to construct high-speed trains for Amtrak, it plans to reduce its work force for the smaller and more immediate task of building monorail cars for the city of Jacksonville, Fla.
Such is the nature of contract work. "We can't offer them work if we don't have work," Mr. Cuttler, the plant's general manager, said.
No one is complaining. The jobs at Bombardier are among the best in Clinton County. They pay well, starting at $10 to $12 an hour, and can lead to good benefits for full-time employees. Full-time workers are not protected from layoffs if there is a lull between contracts. They are hired back based on seniority.
Such circumstances make for confusing economic data. Clinton County's unemployment is now 6.1 percent, lower than when the air base was in full operation. But hardly anyone feels secure. The other big institutions in Plattsburgh are the State University and the Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital. Both have had cutbacks. The state prison system, another major employer, has also been scaling back.
To get a job with Bombardier, workers had to volunteer for 40 hours of unpaid training, learning how to read blueprints and use special tools. Then they were tested and interviewed before they were hired.
People like Sue Gough, who had been selling automotive parts for Sears, was undeterred by the risks of working for a contractor.
"There is no such thing as job security these days," said Ms. Gough, who is 31 and single. "I didn't have anything to lose. If anything else, it would be good experience."
Considering Bombardier's stellar reputation in the transportation industry, workers and company officials say the risks are more than worthwhile. Bombardier is part of a consortium designing the Florida Overland Express, a high-speed rail link between Miami and Tampa through Orlando. Bombardier will soon be competing to build 740 New York City subway cars.
"We are going to be in production here from early 1998 into the year 2000," said Paul J. Harris, the Plattsburgh plant's production manager. "That's a pretty big horizon for people to look at these days. It's nice for employees here to look at a company that just moved in and see a future that is now four years down the road."

HEADLINE: Pension-Fund Group Faces Its Own Governance Battle

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
The Council of Institutional Investors, a collection of large pension funds that has pushed numerous companies to make changes in how they are governed, faces a showdown today over how it governs itself. Corporate members are seeking representation among the group's officers, but union members are vehemently opposed.
The stakes are high: some corporate members have suggested that they may quit the council if they are denied representation in its leadership. If they do, the council will be weaker in number and in its financial resources, and more disagreements between shareholders and managers could be confrontational. 
 Since the mid-1980's, the council and its members -- 100 pension funds with combined assets of more than $900 billion -- have led what is known as the shareholder rights movement. They have provoked changes in policy and leadership at General Motors, Westinghouse Electric, American Express and I.B.M., among other large companies.
Numerous studies have shown that such campaigns have led to more management accountability and improved economic performance, which increases shareholder value for individual investors and for pension funds that invest on behalf of millions of workers.
For more than a year, though, corporate members have fought behind the scenes for a voice in how the council is run. The battle is expected to become public -- and to come to a vote -- today at a meeting in Washington, when Martin A. Coyle, executive vice president and general counsel of TRW Inc., is nominated from the floor for one of the council's three co-chairmen slots.
The outcome will depend to a large extent on the feelings of public pension funds, the council's third and largest contingent. They appear to be split on the subject.
"This is a defining moment for the council," said Richard H. Koppes, deputy executive officer of the California Public Employees Retirement System, whose $97 billion in assets make it the country's largest public pension fund. Calpers, as the fund is known, favors allowing corporate members as officers.
The unions, which say that corporate pension funds should not share in the leadership, contend that corporations are members primarily to keep tabs on shareholder-rights advocates and to remain familiar with participants in case of confrontations, several people close to the thinking of the unions said.
"The concern is which hat the corporate members are wearing, a fiduciary hat or not," said one union official, who insisted on anonymity. He said many corporate representatives came from the investor relations department, not from the pension fund office. "Most of them are the people you sit across the table from when you are negotiating," he said. "Corporate members by and large get what they want, and that's access to active shareholders."
Corporate members, who work at such companies as Coca-Cola, ITT and Consolidated Freightways, take a different view. Though not present at the creation of the council, they have been members since the early 1990's, and they pay the same dues.
"I think all the corporations feel strongly about this -- we think it's time," Mr. Coyle said. "We all have the same aims. We believe that good corporate governance leads to good economic performance."
Last year, corporate representatives campaigned quietly for one of the council's six officer slots. They were told to wait.
This year, they proposed Mr. Coyle to the committee making the nominations for co-chairmen. But that panel, headed by Jon Lukomnik, a deputy comptroller of New York City, selected Michael McGrath, the Minnesota State Treasurer.
A member of the nominating committee, who insisted on anonymity, said the deliberations centered on "what the corporate members are there for."
"If we have an issue with Philip Morris, and a corporate member is in the room when the officers are deciding what to do, the discussion is different," the member said. "The counter-argument is equity."
In the end, Mr. Lukomnik said, "it was unanimous" for Mr. McGrath.
Alan G. Hevesi, New York City's Comptroller, and Bill Patterson, director of corporate affairs for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, were renominated as co-chairmen for a second year. The third co-chairman, William Crist, chairman of Calpers, has served two terms and is ineligible for re-election.
The other officers, also from public or union funds, are running uncontested: Ash Williams Jr., executive director of the Florida State Board of Administration, for executive committee head; Carol Casey, chief investment officer of the Maryland State Retirement Agency, for treasurer, and Bill Lucy, of the Association of Federal, State and Municipal Employees, for secretary.
The election outcome will turn on who attends, since votes -- one fund, one vote -- must be cast in person.
If he loses, Mr. Coyle will neither quit the council nor give up. "We will bring it up again next year," he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 3, 1996, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about a contested election at the Council of Institutional Investors, a group of large union and company pension funds, referred incorrectly to the union of which Bill Lucy, an uncontested candidate for secretary, is secretary-treasurer. It is the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, not the Association of Federal, State and Municipal Employees.

HEADLINE: Where the City Meets Country

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

DATELINE: DENNING, N.Y., March 30

 BODY:
A cluster of teen-agers stood giggling and squirming in the moonlight on a forested hillside 100 miles northwest of Manhattan, trying their best to be silent. "Just for one minute," implored a naturalist leading them on a nocturnal hike. "Then tell me what you hear."
After a few seconds, the high school students -- some from New York City and some from the villages and towns dotting the Catskills -- stopped whispering and simply listened to the landscape. In every direction, the only sound was the gurgle, drip and rush of water. 
 In two months, the students were told, some of the water flowing down the thawing slopes would be coursing through pipes in New York City apartments. This liquid link between rural Catskill communities and city dwellers was the focus of a weekend "Watershed Youth Summit" here for 90 students -- from schools as varied as Brooklyn's Midwood High, enrollment 3,500, and Ulster County's Rondout Valley High, enrollment 300.
The meeting was the latest attempt to break the three-generation sense of hostility between the city and the dozens of communities whose terrain acts as the catch basin and filter for the city's drinking water. To many who live in the Catskills, New York City represents a foreign force that over a century has displaced thousands of people and imposed limits on development to build and protect its water supply.
"The goal is to get people to stop thinking upstate versus downstate, and start thinking we're all New Yorkers with a shared responsibility," said Arlene de Strulle, education director for the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development. The group organized the conference along with regional agricultural officials and New York City's Department of Environmental Protection.
DeAndrea Gumbs, a senior at Manhattan's High School for Environmental Studies, on West 56th Street, had spent weeks on research projects she and 11 classmates were presenting at the meeting.
"We learned all about the watershed," DeAndrea said. "But to see that water coming out of a spring from nowhere, and to know it's going to be in my faucet, that makes me want to conserve."
Students from New York City mingled with their counterparts from towns ranging from Somers to Woodstock as they hiked forest trails and examined streams around the grounds of the Frost Valley Y.M.C.A., an environmental education center in this community in the heart of the Catskill Park.
Agricultural agents in the Catskills and New York City first proposed bringing students from the city and its watershed together in 1993. But the idea lay dormant until last year, when negotiated a deal in which the city would spend some $1 billion to protect its water supply in ways that do not impede development in the economically depressed watershed communities.
As she toured the Rondout Reservoir with the students, Marilyn Gelber, the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner, said the watershed accord -- many details of which are still being hashed out -- is a milestone, but bringing children from city and countryside together is equally important.
"The adults can sign documents and argue over dollars and terms," Ms. Gelber said. "But ultimately, this agreement has to have a human face. The relationships between these young people are an important part of that."
The students were quick to point out that their projects, all related to water supply were more than just classroom exercises. A study by Rondout students of road salt storage in the town of Rosendale concluded that a cheap enclosure could prevent harmful runoff into streams. When the students presented their findings to the Town Board two weeks ago, a resolution was passed to build a shed, said Stephen Ashton, an Ulster County agricultural agent.
Bonds formed quickly, but some were already well forged before the conference got under way. Inseparable were Adam Toschler, from Kingston, Ulster County, and Rishi Maharaj, from Manhattan's High School for Environmental Studies. The two computer enthusiasts had been communicating over the Internet for weeks, but met face to face for the first time on Friday night, Adam said. "I practically know him better than some of the people in my own group," he added.
Clayton Brooks, the Town Supervisor for Denning, population 524, guided the students on a bus tour along the shores of the Rondout Reservoir, now a shining eight-mile-long expanse of water, but 50 years ago a thriving valley of dairy farms, sawmills, homes, schools and churches. He reminded the visitors that the building of the reservoirs came at an enormous cost. As the bus passed a submerged spot that was once a town, he pointed to the water and said, "That was Bittersweet."
Clarine St. Ange, a senior at Midwood High intent on becoming a doctor, said she first appreciated the importance of clean water when she visited relatives in Haiti. On several visits there, she became ill, she said. Today, she doggedly pursued each water official or local resident she could find and asked probing questions.
After a tour of the beef cattle farm of Richard Coombe, she pointed to the deep pools of manure on a hillside and told Mr. Coombe there could be risks from runoff into the reservoirs. "When decaying organic matter mixes with chlorine, it can cause cancer in laboratory animals," Clarine said.
Caught speechless for a moment, Mr. Coombe, a former state legislator now working with other farmers to cut watershed pollution, quickly reassured her that grass and other vegetation downstream acts as a filter, absorbing most of the nutrients before they can taint the water.
Ms. Gelber jokingly whispered to a colleague that she would hire Clarine as a public affairs aide in an instant.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 15, 1996, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 1 about a meeting of students from New York City and communities around the city's upstate reservoirs misstated the stance of the Rosendale Town Board on a recommendation by students that the town build a storage shed for road salt. The board took the proposal under advisement; it did not vote approval.

Dollar Climbs Against the Yen, And Strength Aids Rise vs. Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday, bolstered by concerns about the Japanese banking system and by expectations that Japanese investors would move more money abroad as their fiscal year began.
The dollar reached a 25-month high against the yen in Tokyo trading, before paring its gains in New York. Still, "there wasn't a lot of heart in the move up" against the yen, said Jerry Egan, managing director at the MTB Bank. 
 The dollar also rose against the German mark, largely in sympathy with its strength against the yen, traders said. It also drew support from persistent expectations that the Bundesbank would cut interest rates in coming months.
The dollar rose as high as 107.65 yen, its highest level since Feb. 11, 1994, when it hit 108.45 yen. In New York trading, it settled at 107.56 yen, up from 107.22 yen on Friday. The dollar was quoted at 1.4835 German marks, up from 1.4765 marks. The British pound fell to $1.5243 from $1.5262.
Many Japanese companies and investors returned their funds to yen before the weekend, the end of their fiscal year. Currency traders now expect that much of that yen will be converted back into the currencies of foreign markets -- including those of the United States -- where investment yields are higher.
The view that the Japanese are likely to look overseas to invest was bolstered by more signs of trouble in Japanese banking. Yesterday, the Long-Term Credit Bank said that American banking authorities were investigating its New York-based subsidiary for misreporting bond trades.
"I suspect that this isn't the end of the world, but every time one of these things happens you worry about the next one," said Varick Martin, manager of foreign exchange at the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company. "I don't want to hold yen for the moment."
The dollar held its gains against the mark because investors still expected Germany to lower rates to stimulate economic growth. Lower interest rates often hurt the mark by diminishing the appeal of some German investments.
The Bundesbank last week decided not to trim interest rates, but it might yet do so this quarter, traders said. That helped the dollar today, said Bruce English, head of institutional currency sales at the ABN Amro Bank in Chicago.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Mixed, But Long End Shows a Gain

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with the long end of the market moderately higher and shorter maturities weaker.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 13/32, to 91 26/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.64 percent, from 6.67 percent on Friday. Shorter maturities were held to a narrow range in lethargic trading for most of the day as supply pressures weighed that end of the market. 
 The gains in bonds came after a report that showed continued weakness in manufacturing, although some analysts said the report suggested that weakness in manufacturing might be coming to an end. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported yesterday that its March index of manufacturing activity rose to 46.9 from 45.2 in February. While a reading below 50 indicates weakness, accompanying data showed signs that the contraction was slowing.
Traders said a firmer dollar in curency trading helped bonds, making them more attractive to foreign investors. The dollar touched a two-year high against the Japanese yen yesterday in Tokyo trading, before paring some of the gain in New York.
The market's ability to hold prices steady after the purchasing managers' data helped raise investor confidence, drawing in more buyers.
Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the market's initial negative reaction to the purchasing managers' report reflected in part signs that the recent weakness in the industrial sector was bottoming out. "While the overall index level of 46.9 still indicates considerable slack in manufacturing, both new orders and production seem to have turned the corner," he said. "And with inventories at a very low level, further improvement should be expected. Price pressures remain very subdued, but here too a plateau may have been reached given the relative flatness of the price index over the past four months."
There are a number of other important economic reports scheduled this week including revisions to fourth-quarter gross domestic product and the index of leading indicators, both to be released today. But the market's focus is set firmly on one report: the April employment data, to be issued on Friday.
"After all," Mr. Fine said, "any revision to G.D.P. is not likely to alter the concept of a rather soft economic performance during the fourth quarter, and given that the second quarter has just begun tends to place these revision in the realm of economic history."
The April employment report, however, will be released on a day when the Treasury cash market has a shortened session and the stock market is closed in observance of Good Friday. "Should the payroll number be outside the range of forecasts, it could subject the market to even greater volatility because of the shortened trading session on Good Friday," Mr. Fine said.
The Treasury's regular weekly sales of new three- and six-month bills went well in light of the day's poor performance by the bill market, traders said. The average rate for a three-month issue was 5.07 percent, up from 4.99 percent last week, while the six-month was 5.06 percent, up from 4.97 percent for the same week.
The Treasury also sold $30.01 billion in nine-day cash management bills at an average rate of 5.31 percent, a higher rate than the regular weekly auction. Cash management bills are sold to meet the Treasury's short-term borrowing needs beyond the money raised through the Government's regularly scheduled auctions.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of new three- and six-month bills and nine-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Republicans Oppose Retroactive Tax Laws

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
The Republican chairmen of two Congressional committees moved to reassure Wall Street that several tax proposals made by President Clinton would not be applied retroactively should they become law.
The statement by the legislators is likely to stimulate the resumption of certain transactions, such as the corporate sale of 100-year bonds, and such stock market strategies as "selling short against the box," which investors employ to defer or eliminate capital gains. 
 Such transactions were frozen last year after the Clinton Administration proposed ending related tax advantages, and making the tax law changes take effect the date of their first proposal.
Investment bankers said the statement, which was made on Friday by Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, meant companies could begin selling the 100-year bonds and other securities with confidence again.
"From the standpoint of corporations, there's a green light for issuing 100-year bonds and all other hybrid-type securities," said Arthur Hyde, head of corporate bond syndication at Salomon Brothers Inc.
Salomon underwrote the Korea Electric Power Corporation's sale last week of $365 million of 100-year bonds. It also underwrote a sale of roughly $875 million of so-called century bonds last year by the BellSouth Corporation.
"U.S. companies have been in suspense for three or four months while overseas corporations have been coming to the U.S. market with 100-year paper," Mr. Hyde said.
But for some companies, such as the Monsanto Company, the strategy no longer makes as much sense.
In December, the St. Louis-based chemical producer canceled a planned sale of $200 million in 100-year bonds after the Administration proposed prohibiting companies from taking tax deductions on interest paid on bonds that mature in more than 40 years.
Juanita Hinshaw, Monsanto's treasurer, said the company would not be interested in selling century bonds now because interest rates have risen nearly three-quarters of a percentage point since Dec. 8, when Monsanto canceled its issue.
Other companies also changed their plans, even though the proposals are given little chance of passing a Republican Congress.
The Administration also proposed prohibiting investors from "shorting against the box," in which an investor first borrows, then sells, a quantity of shares equal to the number of shares in a company he or she owns. That effectively hedges against losses in case the stock's value declines, and lets investors pocket the proceeds from the short sale.
But more importantly, from the Administration's perspective, the loophole lets investors avoid paying capital gains taxes on their profits until they buy back the stock to close their short positions. Indeed, capital gains taxes can be avoided entirely if the short position is kept open until the owner of the stock dies.
On Friday, Senator Roth and Representative Archer issued a joint statement saying that any legislation incorporating the proposals would not be retroactive.
"These new revenue proposals will receive careful attention and consideration" by the committees, Mr. Roth and Mr. Archer said in the statement. But they added that so as not to disrupt normal market activities and business transactions, they intended that the effective date of any of the proposals "will be no earlier than the date of appropriate Congressional action."

HEADLINE: Law Comes to Public Housing

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has offered a new plan to bring a higher level of decency and safety to the nation's public housing projects. It includes the eviction of drug dealers and tougher screening of tenants to keep out criminals. It also threatens the eviction of entire households even if only one member sells drugs. The plan poses civil-liberties risks. But the risks can be averted with due-process protections like those in force in New York City.
In much of the country, what began as decent housing for the working poor has degenerated into dumping grounds for the troubled and the terminally unemployed. New York's public housing is regarded as the best in the nation, but it too has suffered. Tenants in more violent projects elsewhere live in terror and feel that the authorities have left them to fend for themselves. 
 Such tenants can take heart from President Clinton's plan to remove criminals from public housing. Mr. Clinton said Federal law had authorized so-called "one-strike" evictions since 1988, but added that in some cities, law enforcement in public housing projects had "not been a priority."
As part of the plan, HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros has ordered public housing authorities to establish tough new screening procedures to keep criminals out of their developments. Mr. Cisneros also wants leases modified so that criminal activity of any kind -- including "all drug-related criminal activity on or off the premises" -- becomes grounds for eviction. Arrest and prosecution would not be needed to trigger eviction. There would instead be an administrative hearing during which witnesses would be called and each side would make its case. Mr. Cisneros will offer incentives to local governments to adopt stricter screening and law enforcement measures. Those who apply the measures will have greater access to Federal improvement funds.
The American Civil Liberties Union worries that whole families will be unfairly evicted to get at one lone criminal in the household. But there is nothing wrong with making leaseholders responsible for those who live with them. Further, the HUD proposal makes clear that the entire household would be evicted only as a last resort.
New York City has adopted a sensible approach. The family is first placed on probation and encouraged to exclude the criminal member. The eviction process goes forward only if the criminal fails to leave. At that point the family is given an administrative hearing, a review by the housing authority board and yet another hearing before a judge in housing court. If evicted, the family is free to appeal.
The policy may sound harsh. But people in public housing deserve as much peace, quiet and safety as the rest of us. Right now, many of them are prisoners in their apartments.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Head: He Speaks, and Money Talks

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH and ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
If Boris N. Yeltsin is re-elected President of Russia in June, he will owe his victory in some part to one of Washington's least-known but most powerful people: Michel Camdessus.
The 63-year-old Frenchman is head of the International Monetary Fund, the obscure global lending organization that gave a vital lift to Mr. Yeltsin's campaign when it formally approved a $10.2 billion loan to Russia last Tuesday. 
 Although the monetary fund is not supposed to take sides in elections, the extraordinary deal -- the second-largest loan in the fund's history -- was driven by the West's desire to impede the comeback of the Communist Party in Russia.
The United States and Germany urged that the loan be approved, but Mr. Camdessus had cleared the way by rewriting fund rules in 1994 to ease credit to Russia, and Mr. Camdessus went on Russian television to announce the largesse that Mr. Yeltsin's economic reforms had won.
Even Mr. Camdessus recognizes the inevitable political consequences of taking such an activist course.
"It can be seen and will be seen by many as betting on Yeltsin or a waste of money," Mr. Camdessus said in an interview in his office, three blocks from the White House. "But nothing more important could be done today for the prosperity of the entire world. So we must do it."
The case of Russia illustrates how Mr. Camdessus has played the roles of gambler, preacher and politician in his nine years as managing director of the fund. In the process, he has reinvented a staid organization whose role -- originally, the limited one of stabilizing currency markets -- has grown to the point where it can now virtually dictate broad economic policies to a major power like Russia.
But Mr. Camdessus's greatest moments of activism -- the record $17.8 billion loan to Mexico last year and the loan to Russia last week -- have brought criticism that he and the fund failed to anticipate Mexico's financial collapse and were slow in lending money to Russia. The two loans are almost half of the monetary fund's $55 billion in outstanding loans, leaving it at its greatest concentration of risk in decades.
That shift away from its original mission has led some conservative economists like Allan H. Meltzer to advocate significantly reducing its role.
"The I.M.F. has become a government-to-government welfare agency that transfers wealth at its own discretion yet fails to promote real market reform," said Mr. Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie-Mellon University, "like in Russia, where the fund hasn't pushed them to create institutions for capitalism, like a legal system."
At the same time that the fund has broadened its reach, it has been slow to shed its tradition of secrecy. Even Mr. Camdessus's most serious effort to be open -- a report he commissioned last year to analyze why the fund had failed to see Mexico's deteriorating financial situation -- was undercut by his decision to keep it secret.
He bent the fund's rules to accommodate the United States, the fund's largest shareholder at 18 percent, when he agreed to the loan to Mexico, which far exceeded the fund's lending guidelines, before consulting the 24-member board, the fund's governing body.
His strong opinions and ambitions have repeatedly put him at odds with the United States and the other rich countries that control an institution that lent $27 billion last year.
 
'Always Finding Things to Do'
"Damn right he can be tough," former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said. "Sometimes you have to lean on him real hard to get things done."
Mr. Camdessus remains undaunted. Despite mounting opposition to foreign aid, he is asking his donors to double the amount of money they invest in the fund, which for the United States would mean doubling its quota to about $80 billion.
The fund pools the financial resources of richer nations to provide short-term assistance to countries that cannot pay their debts. In return for their loans, borrowers promise to take corrective actions that can cause economic pain.
Since the end of the cold war, the fund's membership has grown from 152 to 181 countries. The number of countries that need the fund's programs to rehabilitate their economies has risen more sharply: from 63 to 90.
"By temperament he's an activist," said Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. "Without his active leadership, the fund might have receded into desuetude. He's always finding things to do."
Mr. Camdessus is the sort of man who sends handwritten notes of thanks, remembers the names of his colleagues' children, moves with ease from French to English to Spanish and smiles even when he brings bad news.
A graduate of the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration and the University of Paris, he detonated mines in Algeria as a second lieutenant in the French Army before working his way to the top of the French Treasury and then became head of France's central bank.
 
Economic 'Gospel' And Sweet Talk
The Spanish he learned as a child growing up in the southern French city of Bayonne helped him solidify important ties with key Latin American countries, which along with France and Germany provided crucial support to win him his current job.
A Catholic and former Socialist who attends Mass every Sunday, he weaves his Christianity into his philosophy of management and portrays himself as an advocate for the poor even as he plays politics to fulfill what he calls his economic "gospel."
He once sweet-talked Japan into a promise to invest in a special program to make low-interest loans to poor nations. He later used that pledge to persuade 13 African countries -- all former French colonies -- to drastically devalue their currencies. That delighted his native country, France, which had helped him get his job in the first place.
Although Mr. Camdessus purposely keeps a low profile in Washington, he is seen as both Grim Reaper and economic savior in countries that borrow from the fund.
In 1987, after bread riots in Zambia followed the imposition of austerity measures to meet monetary fund guidelines, President Kenneth D. Kaunda accused the fund of waging a "smear campaign" against his country.
By contrast, on the day after Leonid Kuchma was elected President of Ukraine in July 1994, the first foreign dignitary he called to invite for a visit was not Bill Clinton or Mr. Yeltsin but Mr. Camdessus. A few days later, he was on a plane to Kiev, and only two months later Ukraine concluded its first agreement with the fund.
 
Unchastened After Failed Gamble
One of the most revealing episodes about the way Mr. Camdessus operates was his ill-fated gamble at the fund's annual meeting in Madrid in 1994 to take on the world's seven largest industrialized countries. The object of his power play: to create $50 billion in global reserves with the help of the donors.
Instead, he was roundly criticized by the United States, Germany and Britain, which accused him of empire-building. His unwillingness to compromise diminished his political capital with his main shareholders and led to speculation about whether he would be asked to serve an unprecedented third term.
Unchastened, Mr. Camdessus called a midnight news conference to justify his position, saying, "I am possibly too immodest, but I am the managing director of the I.M.F." He added: "My duty is not to look at what the industrial countries think. My duty is to give a judgment on what is in the global need."
But he bounced back a few months later with a loan package to relieve Mexico's financial crisis.
In response to an early morning plea from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, Mr. Camdessus committed the fund to lend a total of $18 billion to Mexico without obtaining the necessary approval of his board. An hour later in the 12th-floor conference room next to his office, he announced his decision as a fait accompli.
The move endeared him to the Clinton Administration but incurred the wrath of Britain, Germany and other large donors, which saw it as an inter-American matter and were upset about the high-handed way he had handled it.
Mr. Camdessus makes no apologies. Instead, he gets visibly excited when he describes his central role in rescuing the Mexicans and helping the Clinton Administration in the process.
 
'I Don't Ask Your Permission'
"I told my executive board, 'Gentlemen, I don't ask your permission because you would have to speak with your ministers or governors, and you have no time for that,' " Mr. Camdessus recalled saying. "The only question I ask you is the following, 'Is that my job or not?' And they said yes."
Mr. Camdessus acknowledged that the Mexico crisis had exposed "a global problem with the culture of the fund." He himself had touted Mexico as a model of austerity just two months before the crisis erupted.
In the interview, he admitted that he was a friend with Pedro Aspe, then Mexico's Finance Minister, and acknowledged that access inevitably compromises objectivity.
"It's a problem we can never get rid of," he said. "The danger is always there, and no one can escape from that."
Mr. Camdessus is proud of his decision to ask a former fund official to re-examine the fund's failure to recognize the troubles brewing in Mexico before it was too late -- the first such critique in the fund's history. But he bristled when asked about his refusal, even at the Clinton Administration's repeated requests, to make the critique public.
"I didn't want the report to be public," he said. "You don't accuse people without giving them the chance to explain their views."
The report criticized the fund's monitoring of Mexico as inadequate and its tendency to give too much credence to the optimistic pronouncements of Mexican officials, according to a review of the Mexico crisis by the General Accounting Office, the Congressional auditing arm, which itself was denied access to the report.
 
Fund's Tradition Of Secrecy
Mr. Camdessus's reluctance to release the Mexico critique is symptomatic of a much larger tendency: the fund's longstanding tradition of keeping things secret.
Board meetings are closed. The minutes are sealed, as are the annual reviews of each member country. Even the amount of hard currency the fund has to lend at any given moment is kept confidential.
"The I.M.F. strangely enough is without any professional scrutiny in the world," said Jeffrey Sachs, director of Harvard University's Institute for International Development. "It has to be exposed to the glare of bright light."
Mr. Camdessus insists that he has tried to make the fund more open by meeting more with labor unions, non-governmental organizations, journalists and religious leaders, but that the fund still needs to maintain a high degree of confidentiality to protect its members.
Even publishing the amount of money that donors are prepared to turn over to the fund would call into question the financial health of those countries who did not take part, he said. "We would trigger a crisis," he said. "This is not the raison d'etre of the fund. We haven't been created to cry wolf."
On the other hand, he knows that the only way to maintain the primacy of the fund's mission and the adequacy of its resources is to warn of future peril. "We will have new Mexicos," he said.
And will he be around for Mexico redux? His job, which pays him $190,000 tax-free and an additional $95,000 allowance, expires in January. Before then, the fund's board will either choose a successor or give Mr. Camdessus a third five-year term.
But to hear Mr. Camdessus tell it, the decision is his: "I will decide in due time."

HEADLINE: Merger Plans Spur Stocks; Dow Rises 50.58

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
A couple of multibillion-dollar mergers helped drive stock prices upward yesterday, with all three major indicators advancing together for the first time in almost a week.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 50.58 points, to 5,637.72, ending near its high of the day. Among the broader indexes, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks added 8.23 points, to 653.73, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 5.17 points, to 1,106.57. 
 In one of yesterday's merger announcements, SBC Communications offered to buy Pacific Telesis Group for $17 billion. Pacific Telesis surged 6, to 33 3/4, and other Baby Bell regional telephone companies -- now possible merger candidates themselves -- followed.
 The other big merger proposal came from Aetna Life and Casualty, which agreed to acquire U.S. Healthcare for nearly $9 billion. Shares of U.S. Healthcare, a health care organization, also soared 6, to 51 7/8, and shares of other companies in the industry were also higher.
 "The stock market likes mergers, especially among big companies," said Harry Laubscher, senior vice president of Tucker Anthony. And looking ahead, he said, the leading economic indicators report for February, due this morning, is "expected to show the sharpest gain since 1982."
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,468 to 928. Turnover on the Big Board eased to 392.1 million shares, from 413.8 million shares on Friday, and was less than the year's daily average trading of 424 million.
The bond market also climbed yesterday, after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that manufacturing activity slowed in March for the eighth consecutive month and the Commerce Department reported that construction spending dropped in February. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond was up 13/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 6.64 percent, from 6.67 percent on Friday.
Among the telephone issues that surged on the Pacific Telesis deal, Nynex rose 3 1/8 a share, to 53; U S West rose 1 1/4, to 33 5/8, and Ameritech was up 2 5/8, to 57 1/8. As is usual for an acquiring company, SBC's shares fell, 2 3/4, to 49 7/8.
Fueled by the Aetna offer, shares of other health care companies also advanced strongly. Humana jumped 3/4, to 25 7/8, and United Healthcare increased 2 1/2, to 64 1/8. Again, the shares of the prospective acquirer dropped; Aetna's declined 3 1/2, to 72.
The Big Three auto companies hit new 52-week highs after the board of General Motors approved splitting off its Electronics Data Systems unit. The action renewed speculation that it might spin off part of its Hughes Electronics unit. G.M. closed at 56 1/8 a share, up 2 7/8; Ford Motor closed at 35, up 5/8, and Chrysler closed at 64, up 1 3/4.
Pollution-control stocks were lower. IMC Global fell 3 5/8, to 32 7/8, and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan shares fell 5/8, to 61 7/8.
Some leading technology issues also closed lower. Digital Equipment closed at 54 1/4, off 3/4; I.B.M. closed at 110 3/8, off 7/8, and Microsoft was at 102 3/4, off 3/8.
Announcements of lower earnings or prospects of them led to lower stock prices. Shares of Datalogix International lost almost half their value, plummeting 6 5/8, to 6 7/8, after the company said it would have a loss in its third quarter. Pacific Scientific fell 2 1/4, to 18 7/8, after lowering its first-quarter profit estimate. And Ameridata Technologies dropped 1 7/8, to 9 1/2, after reporting lower-than-expected fourth-quarter net income.

HEADLINE: In the Queens Mosaic, A Turkish Inlay;
Community Takes Root in Sunnyside

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
Knowing next to no one, Mesut Yaktubay stepped off the plane from Turkey two weeks ago and became an instant regular at Sunny Grocery, a postage-stamp-sized market on an unremarkable corner in Sunnyside, Queens.
He does not come for the fava bean paste dip, the fried liver, the shiny pistachio-dappled squares of sobiyet pastry or anything else that the little shop sells. Mr. Yaktubay is much more interested in what Sunny Grocery gives away. 
 Through the Sunny Grocery network, for example, Hatice Cetinkaya has been able to rent an apartment at a price she can afford, even though she is in the United States on a six-month tourist visa and must shuttle back to Turkey before the visa expires to get another visa to return to New York a few months later.
And Ayse Sevinc and her family, who arrived in New York with no money, found a Turkish bakery to give them bread and cakes, a Turkish greengrocer to deliver free fruits and vegetables and Turkish families to donate furniture for the one-bedroom fourth-floor walk-up she shares with her husband and three children.
Sunny Grocery, through its owner, Vedat Evren, has become the social club, real estate agent and employment office for the latest arrival at New York's perpetual ethnic festival: a growing community of Turkish immigrants that is quietly taking root in the brick and garden neighborhood of Sunnyside.
Relying as it does on an ad hoc life-support system, Sunnyside's fledgling Turkish community is a case study in how an immigrant enclave is created and nurtured, even side by side with traditional foes. It is an echo of the first city neighborhoods settled by immigrants, the constellations of Italians and Jews, Irish and Chinese.
"Little Italy must have been like this," said Nur Emirgil, who was among the first Turkish settlers of Sunnyside 14 years ago. "Chinatown was probably like this once. We are just the seeds of a community. We have a network from ear to ear.
"Somebody calls or knocks on the door and asks, 'Can this person stay on your couch for a few days?' 'Do you know any job they can get, someplace that doesn't care about green cards?' 'Can you go with them to the doctor to translate?' "
The birthing process is difficult as the Sunnyside Turks try to establish themselves in their new country without cutting ties to the old culture. They want their children to learn English but not lose touch with Turkish. They want to find good jobs and learn to function in the American system, but many need a translator just to visit the doctor, take a driving test or ask for directions.
"The community wants to be Turkish, but they also want to be New Yorkers," said Ms. Emirgil, who heads a women's group trying to raise money for a Turkish school and social center in Sunnyside. "They also want to contribute their share to the hubbub. It's past time this community moves on to where it's living now, but not to forget its culture. And the kids should not be squeezed between two cultures and wind up cultureless."
From the old country, these immigrants, who seem to come from all economic classes and regions of Turkey, have transplanted some of the tensions and conflicts from Turkey to New York.
In Sunnyside as in Turkey, for example, the majority of Turks are secular Muslims, who believe religion should be kept separate from government and education. But there is also a minority of conservative Turkish Muslims, who, like an increasingly active Islamic movement in Turkey, are much more traditional in their religious practice and are trying to gain ground in Sunnyside. The group's leader, Necdet Camli, said they are particularly interested in shaping the education of Turkish children and have set up a masjeed, or a small mosque, where children are taught academic subjects together with Islam.
The Turks are also learning to coexist with their country's traditional enemies, the Greeks, who dominate nearby Astoria, and the Armenians, many of whom also live in this northern swath of Queens. In one-on-one relationships, the Turks say, there is virtually no tension. Often, there is even warmth, as though the loud struggle of life in a new country drowns out the ethnic clashes from home, reducing them to a murmur. Armenians buy pita and grape leaves at Turkish stores, and Turks rent from Greek landlords and work at Greek gas stations.
But the Turks are aware that the leaders of the Turkish government and the other ethnic groups do not exactly exude the same harmony. Some said they have seen small groups of Greeks at the annual Turkish-American Day Parade in Manhattan chanting slogans about the divided island of Cyprus. Even the date of the parade, meant to correspond with Turkey's National Independence and Children's Day, had to be changed several years ago because it fell a day before the Armenian community's commemoration of the 1915 massacres under the Ottoman Turks.
Turkish organizations in New York read Greek and Armenian newspapers and watch Greek cable television "to know what is going on and how they are trying to influence the U.S. government," said Nihal Kustimur Green, who is president of Dost Turkish American Community Service, a Manhattan group.
"Greek television here, they have a lot of programs that put down the Turkish in Cyprus," said Ahmet Sandik, who heads a New York group called the U.S. Council for Human Rights in the Balkans and stops by Sunny Grocery every morning for coffee and Turkish newspapers. "We keep watching out of the corner of our eye."
For years, Turkish immigrants have dotted the Upper East Side of Manhattan and settled among other Muslims and Orthodox Jews in the Midwood, Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay sections of Brooklyn. In 1990, the Census reported about 9,500 Turks in the city; Turkish leaders say the number, swelled by illegal immigrants and those who do not respond to the census, could be three times that. In the last five years, as economic conditions in Turkey have worsened, more Turks have been immigrating to the United States.
In Sunnyside, a trim neighborhood of about 30,000 people, small family-run stores and low brick apartment buildings, a small cluster of Turks has swelled to the point where the sashaying sounds of the Turkish language can be heard on the streets, and the syrupy smell of flaky pastries drifts onto the sidewalk.
The number of Turkish children in Public School 150, the neighborhood's elementary school, has nearly quadrupled in the last three or four years, and Turks now make up nearly 20 percent of the 1,000 students, said the principal, Gloria Guzman. Ms. Guzman said that P.S. 150 now brings in a Turkish-speaking counselor for parent-teacher meetings and includes in the curriculum Turkish folk tales, music and dance.
Of the approximately 900 Turks who immigrated legally to New York City from 1990 to 1994, 75 went straight to Sunnyside, more than to any other neighborhood except the larger, more diffuse Midwood and Brighton Beach areas.
The heart of Sunnyside -- between 39th and 50th streets, and Skillman and Greenpoint avenues -- has become a magnet for Turks who had lived for several years in Brooklyn, or even in Long Island, New Jersey or Manhattan. Mr. Evren and others estimate that 400 to 500 Turkish families now live in Sunnyside.
"Every year, year by year, the Turkish community there in Sunnyside is growing," said Fuat Tanlay, the Turkish Consul General, who will pay his first official visit to Sunnyside on Saturday. "Of course, as a consul general, I want that this community be organized. That's why I would like to go there and see in place all the problems and try to help them."
Like Mr. Yaktubay, 38, who was a marketer for a large ice cream company in Turkey, most newcomers land with no job and no place to live. They stay on someone's couch for a while or find a good deal on an apartment from one of Sunnyside's Turkish apartment managers or superintendents.
They find work in other people's businesses, generally low-skilled jobs that require little English. Mustafa May, a French teacher, found himself doing construction work. A dancer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is working here illegally got an off-the-books job with a greengrocer in Jackson Heights. Ms. Sevinc's husband, Ragip, a tax inspector for the Turkish Ministry of Finance whose family had a sumptuous house in Turkey, managed to find only a summer job selling Mr. Softee ice cream. Their son, Kubilay, began supporting the family at age 18 working 17 hours a day, seven days a week in a Turkish bakery on Queens Boulevard.
Lowery Bakery is one of only a few Turkish-run businesses that have managed to open in Sunnyside, including a meat market and a combination flower shop and greengrocer. A Turkish restaurant opened about three years ago but closed a few months later because, residents said, the food was not very good.
"We are a very closed community right now," said Ms. Emirgil, whose group recently helped 150 people apply for legal immigration status in the visa lottery. "Voters are not registered. People do not speak English. They don't know who their representatives are. Some of them do not know their rights under Social Security, medical care, immigration laws."
Ms. Cetinkaya, who shuttles back and forth on a tourist visa, is not legally allowed to open a bank account and does not know what to do with her money. Once, she said, she got mugged on the subway and was robbed of the $485 she was carrying.
In the meantime, there is Mr. Evren and Sunny Grocery.
On a recent Friday night, Mr. Yaktubay stood -- there is not even an upended milk crate to sit on -- among the plasticene sacks of paprika and tahini, the watery troughs jiggling with olives, the snug trays of filo dough and feta cheese. Turkish music slithered under the fluorescent lights, and the beneficent gaze of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, shone from several portraits hung high on a wall.
"I buy my bread every day here and talk to Vedat, ask him if he hears something, will he let me know," said Mr. Yaktubay, who was on his way to a billiard hall a few blocks away where young Turkish men hang out.

HEADLINE: BIRTH OF A GIANT: A LEADER'S VISION;
Gambles, and Successes, at the Top

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

 BODY:
Edward E. Whitacre Jr. is as far from flashy as anyone gets in the communications business: laconic, unflappable and largely uninterested in spinning visions of the future.
But appearances are deceiving. As the chairman and chief executive of SBC Communications, parent of the Southwestern Bell telephone company, Mr. Whitacre has proved to be one of the shrewdest and toughest executives in the telephone industry. 
 SBC is growing faster than any of the other seven regional Bell companies, and it is one of the most profitable. But Mr. Whitacre has also attracted heaps of criticism from consumer groups and from aspiring rivals, who complain that the company has repeatedly thrown up legal barriers to choke off competition in its core local telephone business.
Mr. Whitacre is a towering 6-foot-4-inch figure who was born in Texas and came up through the old Bell System. While other communication executives boast about their vision, Mr. Whitacre prefers to pick his shots carefully -- and watch his back.
It has not been a quiet strategy. Twice before in the last 10 years, Mr. Whitacre has surprised the industry with billion-dollar bets, and both were huge successes. In 1986, when Mr. Whitacre was chief financial officer, SBC stunned many of its counterparts by paying $1.4 billion for Metromedia Inc.'s cellular systems in cities like Chicago, Washington and Baltimore.
The price seemed outlandish at the time, particularly to telephone companies steeped in the conservative culture of regulated utilities, but Mr. Whitacre adamantly argued that the deal would make sense. He was right: today, analysts estimate those systems are worth at least five times what SBC paid for them -- based on the prices that AT&T paid in 1994 for McCaw Cellular Communications.
More significant, SBC has built up its cellular business faster than any other Bell company. Subscribership in its markets is the highest of any company, as is the amount of money generated per cellular subscriber. Largely because of the cellular business, in fact, about one-third of the company's revenues come from outside its core telephone business.
Mr. Whitacre's second big gamble came in 1991, when the company paid $1 billion for a 10 percent stake in Telefonos de Mexico, the formerly state-owned telephone company in Mexico. Notwithstanding Mexico's economic convulsions last year, Telmex stock is now trading about about twice what SBC paid for it, and the company's long-term prospects appear good.
SBC had avoided much of the merger frenzy that took place in recent years. It came close to forming a joint venture with Cox Cable, a unit of Cox Enterprises of Atlanta, but then walked away from the deal after the Federal Communications Commission imposed strict rate regulation on cable companies in 1993.
SBC remained conspicuously out of the big wireless alliance of Bell Atlantic, Nynex, U S West and Airtouch Communications. Though his company continues to use the Cellular One brand name, Mr. Whitacre has shown no interest in building up a national wireless network that would compete against those being built by AT&T and Sprint.
Wall Street has been grateful. Shares of SBC, which closed yesterday at $49.875, are trading at about 17 times its earnings -- one of the the highest valuations in the industry and far higher than the valuation given to Pacific Telesis.
Even as SBC races to enter the long-distance telephone business, it has fought tenaciously to make life difficult for aspiring rivals in the local telephone business.
In Texas, the Southwestern Bell unit lobbied successfully last year for a state law deregulating telecommunications that could make it difficult for AT&T, MCI Communications or Sprint to enter the local telephone market.
Under that law, adamantly opposed by consumer groups and others, the long-distance carriers can only become certified as local telephone carriers if they provide at least 60 percent of their service over their own networks. But MCI and AT&T are planning to enter the local market largely by leasing capacity from local telephone carriers, a concept at the core of the new sweeping telecommunications law.
"Bell has worked very hard and won a lot of regulatory relief, claiming there was going to be competition in local market, when in fact they have erected so many barriers to entry that consumers are in a lose-lose position," said Janee Briesemeister, a senior policy analyst for the Consumers Union in Austin, Tex. "They're going to make everybody go to court and spend a lot of money on lawyers, instead of getting competitive phone service to consumers in Texas."
The new Federal law generally pre-empts state laws that restrict competition, but Southwestern Bell executives are intent on defending the Texas statute.
"There are some semantic differences, but this is surprisingly consistent with the Federal legislation," said David Cole, president of Southwestern Bell Telephone of Texas.The concept behind the state law, he said, was to promote investment in new telephone networks built from the ground up. "They want people to invest in Texas and create jobs, and not just to create an environment where you create rate arbitrage," Mr. Cole said today.
Regardless of how that and similar disputes are resolved, SBC Communications seems clear about its reasons for wanting to acquire Pactel.
Thanks to Pacific Telesis's slumping price, the price is relatively cheap. Beyond that, analysts said today, the two companies will be far better positioned to jump into the long-distance market because a very high percentage of long-distance calls can be handled over their own network. The two companies can also share the big back-office costs associated with billing and service in the long-distance business.
Pactel, with its huge California market, should help strengthen SBC's relationship with Telmex as cross-border communications traffic with Mexico continues to expand. And California is an important gateway for telecommunications traffic between the United States and Asia, another potentially lucrative and fast-growing market.
But this merger is driven more by nuts-and-bolts pragmatism than by sweeping strategic visions.
"They aren't working off the big themes; they work off the numbers," said Daniel P. Reingold, telecommunications analyst at Merrill Lynch, referring to Mr. Whitacre and SBC.

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Monthly Sales Drop While Chrysler's Increase

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 1

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation announced today that its March sales dropped 2.2 percent from levels a year earlier because a long strike interrupted its production. But the Chrysler Corporation reported an 8.1 percent gain for the month.
One reason G.M. car sales declined, according to Ed Lechtzin, a company spokesman, was that it delayed until April the delivery of some cars to fleet buyers in order to conserve its scarce supply of cars for retail buyers during the 17-day strike. The work stoppage involved two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, that led to a gradual closing of most of the company's North American assembly plants and some shortages of cars on dealer lots. 
 Retail buyers tend to be much more willing to look elsewhere if they cannot find what they want, Mr. Lechtzin said. He added that G.M. expected to recover during the second quarter the sales lost last month.
G.M.'s sales of passenger cars fell 3.8 percent in March while truck sales rose by an anemic one-tenth of 1 percent. Without the strike, "we would have probably been equal to last year or slightly above" in passenger cars, Mr. Lechtzin said.
There were 26 selling days in March of this year and 27 a year earlier, so percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate.
The real effect of the strike on G.M. sales, some auto analysts say, may not come until the third quarter. That is when the auto maker will be closing several assembly plants for retooling for new models and will need to depend on inventories of unsold vehicles that have already been partly drained by the strike. G.M. officials have told financial analysts that the company will be lucky to recover half of the production lost in the strike.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission today, G.M. said that the strike in Dayton, which closed 26 of its 29 North American vehicle assembly plants for a week or more, would cost the company $900 million after taxes in the first quarter. G.M.'s figure was higher than virtually any estimate by Wall Street analysts.
G.M. may also face other local labor troubles. About 2,700 workers at two suspension parts factories in a Dayton suburb are threatening to strike next week, the company said today. The workers are members of the International Union of Electronic Workers.
While G.M. struggles, Chrysler has continued to prosper. The company had its best first quarter since 1988, with record sales for the Dodge Ram pickup and Chrysler Town & Country mini-van. The mini-van is one of Chrysler's most popular vehicles, with profit margins estimated by analysts at up to $8,000 for each mini-van sold. Chrysler car sales in March were up 2 percent whiles its light-truck sales rose 12 percent.
Dealers and auto analysts said that a combination of good weather, rebate programs and rising consumer confidence in the economy all helped sales in March.
J. Chapman Morris Jr., a Chevrolet and Oldsmobile dealer in Fillmore, Calif., said that he had lost some sales of pickup trucks to the Ford Motor Company and to Chrysler dealers because the strike in Dayton had interrupted his supply. But the overall demand for new cars and trucks was so strong that the dealership had its highest sales ever in the last two weeks of March, he said.
Many of the cars being traded in have more than 100,000 miles on them. "It's not an impulse buyer -- these are calculated buyers who should have bought a car a year ago, two years ago," Mr. Morris said.
Dennis R. Sawyer, the general sales manager at Don Bulluck Chevrolet in Rocky Mount, N.C., said that sales there had also been strong in March after suffering heavily from the bad weather in January and February. The dealership ran low on popular models during the strike but never ran out, he said.
"I've got some holes on the lot, but the strike is over," Mr. Sawyer added.
Ford is not scheduled to announce its March sales figures until Wednesday. Analysts expect it to show little change from March 1995, when the company had especially strong sales of trucks.
Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Volvo, Saab and Suzuki each reported today that their March sales were down slightly from a year earlier, while Subaru announced higher sales.

HEADLINE: 2 BELL COMPANIES AGREE TO MERGER WORTH $17 BILLION

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
In the first marriage of two regional Bell telephone companies and one of the largest corporate mergers ever, SBC Communications announced yesterday that it would acquire the Pacific Telesis Group for $17 billion.
The deal would create a communications colossus, providing service to more than 30 million residential and business telephone lines in seven states west of the Mississippi, including California and Texas. 
 The combined company would also provide wireless service coast to coast, with cellular and other wireless franchises that reach a potential market of 80 million people from Boston to Los Angeles.
Coming just two months after Congress passed a sweeping telecommunications bill, the deal underscores how telephone and media companies are rushing to bulk up for the untrammeled competition of an open marketplace.
Nynex and Bell Atlantic, the regional phone companies serving New England, New York and the other mid-Atlantic states, have been mulling a merger for months, and several analysts said yesterday's deal could goad them to consummate their courtship.
Together, SBC and Pacific Telesis would be the nation's second-largest phone company with more than $21 billion in annual revenues. Only AT&T, the long-distance carrier, would be larger; both SBC (originally Southwestern Bell) and Pacific Telesis were created in the 1984 breakup of the Bell System.
Unlike AT&T, which is in the process of cutting more than 30,000 jobs, SBC and Pacific Telesis said yesterday that they planned to hire 1,000 employees to augment their combined work force of 100,000.
The new company will be named SBC Communications and will be based at SBC's headquarters in San Antonio. Telephone service to customers in California and Nevada, however, will continue to be provided by companies named Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell.
"We could have survived as an independent company," Philip J. Quigley, the chairman of Pacific Telesis, said yesterday. "But this is going to be an industry with a handful of strong global players."
By negotiating quickly and mostly in one-on-one sessions, Mr. Quigley and his counterpart, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the chairman and chief executive of SBC, were able to keep the deal almost completely under wraps until yesterday. Mr. Whitacre will become the chief executive of the combined company, while Mr. Quigley will become vice chairman.
The deal is subject to approval from the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission. Despite the size and the first-of-its-kind nature of the deal, legal experts predicted yesterday that the transaction would not run aground on antitrust or regulatory issues.
"Like the Disney-ABC or Westinghouse-CBS deals, as long as there is robust competition, this should lead to economies of scale," said James H. Quello, an F.C.C. commissioner, "Success in these things is usually based on better service and more attractive prices for consumers."
Wall Street's strong reaction also indicated that investors believed the deal would go through. The merger is intended to be a tax-free exchange of stock, with SBC giving 0.733 share of its stock for each Pacific Telesis share. That gives the deal a value of $39 a share, or $17 billion -- a 40 percent premium to Friday's closing share price of Pacific Telesis.
The shares of Pacific Telesis rose $6 , to $33.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. But stock of the acquiring company, SBC, dropped $2.75, to $49.875. SBC is expected to have lower earnings per share for a couple of years, as it issues additional stock to finance the takeover.
The secrecy and haste of the negotiations between SBC and Pacific Telesis stood in sharp contrast to the long-running talks between Nynex and Bell Atlantic. Neither of those companies have yet publicly acknowledged holding merger discussions, but the talks are such an ill-kept secret that speculating on their status has become a virtual parlor game on Wall Street and in the press.
As a result, analysts and other experts were somewhat nonplused by the surprise deal, involving two companies on the other side of the country, serving geographic territories that do not even abut each other.
"There are a lot of things that make sense about this, and a couple that are tough to figure out," said William C. Bane, a communications consultant at Mercer Management Consulting in Washington.
Like other analysts, Mr. Bane had been viewing Pacific Telesis as a possible acquisition candidate. The company, which offers phone service in California and Nevada, has struggled under a double-whammy of intense external competition and restrictive state regulations in its home market.
Moreover, by spinning off its cellular properties two years ago into a separate public company, AirTouch Communications, Pacific Telesis unlocked the stock market value of that business but also gave up having a continuing stake in the fastest-growing segment of the industry.
For its part, SBC Communications has been one of the top performers among the seven so-called Baby Bells. State regulators in its region -- Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri -- have tended to be far more protective than California's utilities commissioners in shielding SBC from outside interlopers like AT&T or MCI. As a result, SBC's franchises in local and toll calls have not been eroded nearly as much as those of Pacific Telesis.
SBC has also aggressively acquired cellular properties in markets like Boston, Chicago and Washington. It has the most cellular subscribers -- 3.2 million -- of any Baby Bell.
Then, too, SBC has bet heavily on its proximity to Mexico -- acquiring a 10 percent equity stake in the Mexican national phone company, Telefonos de Mexico, for $1 billion. It is this strategy, analysts said, that best explains why SBC wants to own Pacific Telesis. More than 50 percent of all international calls to Mexico originate in states served by Pacific Telesis and SBC -- namely, California and Texas.
The fact that Pacific Telesis and SBC do not share any state borders is not seen as a major drawback. Although phone companies can cut some costs by consolidating contiguous operations, some analysts said that cost-cutting was not the prime motivation for this merger.
One potential problem in the merger, however, is the difference in the nontelephone strategies of the two companies. Pacific Telesis has committed itself to an aggressive overhaul of its telephone network to enable it to carry television programming. As an interim strategy, the company has even spent heavily to acquire wireless cable providers.
Along with Bell Atlantic and Nynex, Pacific Telesis is a partner in Tele-TV, a media company that has spent $120 million so far to develop interactive video programming.
SBC, by contrast, has been far more tentative about television, spending less to upgrade its network and eschewing wireless cable. SBC is a member of a video consortium, Americast, which has spent a fraction of what Tele-TV is spending to get into the business.
Mr. Whitacre sought to play down the importance of those differences yesterday, through a tepid endorsement of the video business. "In the scheme of things, it's not that big a deal for us," he said.
With the announcement of this deal, the industry's attention will now very likely swivel back to the East Coast and the Nynex-Bell Atlantic talks. Mark Bruneau, the president of Coba M.I.D., a consulting firm based in Boston, predicted at least one more big merger of telephone companies would occur in 1996.
"Instead of seven Bell companies, plus three long-distance carriers," Mr. Bruneau said, "you're going to see four plus two."

HEADLINE: A MERGER OF HEALTH INSURERS;
A Big Day for Mergers in the United States

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Only one day into the second quarter and the mergers business is already on a tear.
United States companies announced about $28 billion worth of mergers yesterday, more than 10 percent of the amount announced in the entire first quarter. Bolstered by rising stock markets and low interest rates, the torrid pace indicates 1996 may exceed the record $866 billion of mergers last year. 
 "It's staggering," said M. William Benedetto, who is with the investment banking firm of Benedetto, Gartland & Greene.
The transactions announced yesterday include: SBC Communications Inc.'s plan to buy Pacific Telesis Group for $17 billion, creating the nation's second-largest telecommunications company; the Aetna Life and Casualty Company's agreement to purchase U.S. Healthcare Inc. for $8.9 billion, forming the largest United States managed-care provider; the Allegheny Ludlum Corporation's bid to buy Teledyne Inc. in a $2.04 billion stock swap, and the Masco Corporation's decision to sell its furniture business to an investment group for $1 billion.
And that does not include the sales announced that were worth less than $1 billion.

HEADLINE: For Helms, His Home State Is Source of Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C., April 1

 BODY:
As the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Jesse Helms leaves little doubt how he feels about the Communist leaders of Vietnam.
Nine months after the Clinton Administration formally recognized the Vietnamese Government, Mr. Helms is still blocking financing for the newly opened American Embassy in Hanoi until the President certifies that there are no obstacles left in the search for possible American prisoners of war or the missing in action. In a speech last week he denounced Vietnam as one of Asia's "repressive governments," attacking its record on human rights. 
 So it might seem surprising that on Sunday night Mr. Helms had a convivial, laughter-filled dinner here at the Angus Barn, a popular local steakhouse, with Le Van Bang, Vietnam's Ambassador-designate to Washington, along with six other envoys from Southeast Asia.
"He told me we would get along very well," Mr. Bang said, surprised to find himself at Mr. Helms's dinner table. "After all, he is interested in promoting North Carolina."
In fact, Mr. Helms boasts that he intends to use his chairmanship to bring the world's most lucrative emerging markets to North Carolina's door. And the dinner on Sunday was given by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a subsidiary of RJR-Nabisco and a longtime supporter of the Senator, which has invested $21 million in a joint-venture cigarette factory in Da Nang.
At a moment when tobacco executives are fending off Federal grand juries and corporate whistle-blowers armed with embarrassing internal documents, Mr. Helms is doing what he can to make sure that North Carolina tobacco gains opportunities in Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.
Mr. Bang, who is acutely aware that Mr. Helms is Vietnam's chief obstacle in Washington, plays the tobacco card with skill. Opening a presentation to North Carolina business executives this morning, he looked at Mr. Helms in the front row and said, "You know, in Vietnam we have a custom now of greeting each other by offering a cigarette."
Later, Mr. Helms said he was impressed, both with Mr. Bang and the market opportunities. "I was with some Vietnamese recently, and some of them were smoking two cigarettes at the same time," he said. "That's the kind of customers we need!"
Then, pondering his own enthusiasm, he added: "Well, not exactly."
In fact, among the ambassadors here only Mr. Bang seemed truly interested in North Carolina's traditional crop, while the rest had come to strike up relationships with biotechnology and electronics companies in Research Triangle Park and to meet with regional bankers.
But the real drawing card was Mr. Helms, whose threats to cut off China's trade privileges and sharp critiques of Administration policy toward Japan, Taiwan and India have made him the biggest wild card in American policy toward Asia.
So when Mr. Helms invited the ambassadors from all seven countries in the Association for Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, to visit his home state for three days, including a excursion of more than two hours on Tuesday to the R. J. Reynolds tobacco factory in Winston-Salem that is closed to reporters, they all cleared their calendars.
"When Mr. Helms invites, everbody comes to listen," said S. R. Nathan, the Ambassador from Singapore -- where almost every vice, starting with smoking in public, is punishable by a stiff fine or worse.
Mr. Helms's interest in Asean is new, fueled by the phenomenal growth of their economies -- the gross national products of the seven countries had roughly doubled over the last five years, and totaled more than half a trillion dollars last year -- and their relative openness to American investment. "I made up my mind when I became the second North Carolinian in history to head the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that I would do all I could to promote the exports of North Carolina," he said today, "as well as other parts of the country."
His eagerness meshes nicely with the strategy for dealing with Washington that Japan pioneered and other Asian nations follow today: do your deals in the right Congressional district. Like the Japanese, other Asian countries are beginning to spread their contracts and investments around the country, to build influence in Congress.
Mr. Helms's chairmanship is therefore good news for North Carolina. But it is also the hope of the tobacco industry abroad, because the Clinton Administration has put the brakes on Washington's once aggressive efforts to pry open markets in Asia to the cigarette trade.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representive, will still negotiate market openings on behalf of American cigarette makers. But he invites officials from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency to sit in on the talks to evaluate whether the other nation's trade restrictions are actually "legitimate efforts to address health issues," as the Administration puts it.
Recently South Korea passed the test, and the Administration revised a Reagan-era trade agreement to permit the South Koreans to impose any restrictions they want on cigarette advertising or other promotions, as long as the same rules apply to South Korean makers.
"Jesse's their last friend abroad," an Asian diplomat on the tour of North Carolina said of the American tobacco makers.
Sometimes, as in the case of Vietnam, that results in some interesting diplomatic footwork for Mr. Helms. Faced with the conflicting pressures of his disdain for its Communist regime and his interest in promoting business in his state, he has simultaneously praised Mr. Bang here and bashed his Government. "He's my friend," he said this morning, just before denouncing Vietnam today before the Asean representatives as repressive and suggesting that the country is still blocking a full accounting of missing American soldiers.
Mr. Helms makes it clear that he did not specifically invite the Vietnamese Ambassador-designate to North Carolina, but since Vietnam joined Asean last summer, he could hardly exclude one country. "I'm trying to work with the Ambassador," he said. "We have a give and take, and we're all going to profit from it."
Mr. Bang is technically not yet the Ambassador because the United States has yet to appoint its first ambassador to Vietnam. But even without the title, the slight, energetic Mr. Bang is already lobbying hard in Washington for a trade agreement with the United States and the low-tariff benefits that come with "most-favored nation" status. He knows the 74-year-old Mr. Helms is the key to obtaining any of those accords, and he expects the process will take a lot of massaging, and a lot of cigarettes.
But Vietnam, he says, is ready to rise to the challenge.
"We'll smoke for 10 more years, until we are a more developed country," he predicted. "Then we'll quit, just like you."

HEADLINE: U.N. Plans Deep Cuts In Budget For First Time

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 1

 BODY:
Caught in a financial crisis and constrained by the first no-growth budget in its history, the United Nations expects to cut $250 million from its operating expenses by the end of 1997, the organization's chief administrative officer said today. Of the total, $98 million in savings has already been identified.
The official, Joseph E. Connor, Under Secretary General for Administration and Management, said at a news conference that the United Nations hoped to eliminate 800 professional jobs. Severance and other costs are estimated at $30 million, but the layoffs should yield substantial long-term savings, he said, adding that job evaluations would identify candidates for dismissal. 
 Speaking in language almost never heard in this bastion of international bureaucracy, Mr. Connor, a former chief executive of Price Waterhouse, said there were "too many people in this organization doing the same job for 20 years."
"Mobility in a world organization is very, very important," he said, adding that there was "nothing like a little creative tension" to get the United Nations moving.
For the first time in the half-century of its existence, the United Nations will scale down not only personnel but also reports and publications, policy analyses and construction and repair costs. Upgrading telecommunications and interpreting equipment has been put on hold.
The United States mission greeted the news with elation. The Administration has said the United Nations must demonstrate that the organization can be slimmed down, or Congress will never even start to pay the $1.5 billion that Washington owes in dues and assessments.
James P. Rubin, spokesman for the American mission, said today, "Reforming the United Nations is no easy task, but this does mark a milestone in our efforts to force it to downsize and to come to grips with the problems of unnecessary construction, redundant meetings and unnecessary paperwork."
To prevent backsliding, the Administration has proposed a five-year plan to Congress during which money would be released for arrears as long as reforms continued. But many diplomats fear Congress will reject the plan, leaving others to pay.
Many diplomats see Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali as needling the United States in a report that proposes cuts in some areas of special interest to Washington. Mr. Connor's remarks were based on that report.
Americans hold more Secretariat jobs than citizens of any other nation, and American companies get about half the procurement orders -- $197 million of $396 million in 1995.
The largest cuts will come in administrative services, including conference costs, weekend and night work, publications, statistical and policy analyses and planning programs to fight poverty and enhance the status of women, the Secretary General said.
Allocations for regional economic commissions for Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia, are to be reduced sharply. The work of the commissions often duplicates that of other development bodies, but American diplomats say the proposed reductions -- totaling around $18 million -- are not enough.
Cuts will also be made in appropriations to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Human Rights Center, both in Geneva.
In demanding a no-growth budget, the United States opened itself to some unexpected consequences that added tension to the increasingly frayed relationships between Washington and the United Nations, and between the Secretary General and Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States representative.
Most recently Mr. Boutros-Ghali, chafing under new restraints, threatened to cut off two programs the United States strongly supports: the human rights missions in Guatemala and Haiti. Both are considered successes.
He said he was trying to alert member nations to the untenable situation they create when they order new missions without allocations to pay for them.
If this was intended to get Washington's attention, it did. Mr. Rubin, the American spokesman, said the Secretary General should look for other cuts, and promised a fight to keep the Haiti and Guatemala programs, which could cost $52 million over two years.
In a letter March 12 to the President of the Assembly, Diego Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, Mr. Boutros-Ghali said there was no way to pay for human rights work in Guatemala and Haiti. Similar constraints could affect Burundi, Rwanda and El Salvador.
The Secretary General said this was not just a budgetary problem, but an issue that "goes to the heart of the purposes for which this organization was created." 
 Because of another editing error, the article referred incorrectly to a budget cut of $98 million. Out of a proposed $250 million in overall cuts, the $98 million was trimmed last year; the sum does not represent cuts that have been identified in this year's budget.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 3, 1996, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about trimming the United Nations' 1996-97 budget misstated the method proposed for reducing the staff. The plan is for buyouts, not layoffs; a new system of performance evaluations could lead to dismissals later.

HEADLINE: A MERGER OF HEALTH INSURERS: THE INDUSTRY;
Managed Care Empires in the Making

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Leonard Abramson decided about a year ago that U.S. Healthcare Inc., his enormously successful health maintenance organization, needed a new strategy to keep its profits up. A flock of competing H.M.O.'s, led by Oxford Health Systems, was vying for customers on his home turf, in Philadelphia and New Jersey. Even more threatening, hospitals and doctors were melding into groups big enough to resist when the H.M.O.'s try to squeeze their fees.
Mr. Abramson, the founder and chief executive of U.S. Healthcare, turned over daily operations to his lieutenants and set out to find a strategic partner. He ended up selling his managed care company to the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, he said yesterday, to get the "mass we needed, the power to negotiate with the physicians, the hospitals, the drug companies" and force down their charges. 
 The deal is the biggest in a wave of consolidation as health care companies seek to become big enough to get the upper hand in negotiating prices with their medical suppliers so they can woo employers with low-cost health plans.
In many cases, the deals have involved mergers between managed care companies and between managed care companies and traditional insurers. But in the future competition may come from a different direction. Some analysts say that the most formidable competitors might be groups of hospitals and doctors that have united to deal directly with employers and skip the managed care middleman.
Aetna's deal to buy U.S. Healthcare for $8.8 billion in cash and stock will create a combined health care business that would cover 14 million people. Of those, 4.2 million would be in health maintenance organizations, the most tightly controlled system of delivering care. In addition, Aetna has 3.8 million people in traditional insurance plans. The remainder would be in other types of managed care plans.
In a number of other recent deals, managed-care companies have acquired insurance companies that had big groups of customers in traditional lines of fee-for-service coverage. In these deals, the insurers also hope to broaden their appeal to employers by offering a variety of lines and eventually to convert their people to managed care, under which the payer's costs are lower and insurer's profits are higher.
Last year the United Healthcare Corporation, a big health maintenance organization based in Minneapolis, bought Metrahealth, a joint health insurance venture of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and the Travelers Life Insurance Company, in a deal valued at $1.65 billion.
And there were at least three smaller acquisitions recently of insurance companies by H.M.O.'s: Last January, California-based Wellpoint Health Networks bought the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. Last year, Humana Inc., based in Louisville, Ky., bought Emphesys Financial Group of Green Bay, Wis. And HealthSource, based in Concord, N.H., bought the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company of Chattanooga, Tenn.
"There are probably going to be only three to five national players in five years or so," said Larry Feinberg, a general partner in New York with Oracle Partners, a health care investment firm. "The whole health care market is overbuilt. We are still pretty early in the ball game in terms of consolidation."
Doug Sherlock, an analyst in Philadelphia with the Sherlock Company, a health care investment banking firm, recalled that Wall Street analysts used to say that health maintenance organizations were a temporary fad that would be taken over by the insurance companies. "It looks like the little fish ate the big fish," he said.
Ellie Kerns, a securities analyst in Boston with Alex. Brown & Sons, said most managed care companies needed to expand into new markets, which could be a drain on earnings while taking years for them to establish a forceful presence.
U.S. Healthcare, which already has networks with 12,000 primary-care doctors in 13 states, could form combinations with Aetna in 21 states where the Hartford-based insurer has 20,000 primary-care doctors in its networks. These doctors -- including internists, general practitioners and pediatricians -- play a central role in restraining the costs of care.
Mr. Abramson, who would be Aetna's largest shareholder under the deal, said he expected the insurers to continue growing, while hospitals will be "downsizing and closing." He was skeptical about the prospects for a hospital company entering the health insurance business, as the Columbia-HCA Hospital Corporation says it will do in Cleveland and perhaps other markets. Columbia-HCA announced last Friday that it had agreed to buy most of the business of Cleveland-based Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ohio for $299.5 million.
"Look what happened to Dave Jones, and he is a smart guy," Mr. Abramson said, referring to problems that arose when Mr. Jones's combination H.M.O. and hospital company, Humana, angered doctors and competing insurers, who boycotted the hospitals. Columbia eventually bought the Humana hospitals.
But Rick Scott, chief executive of Columbia-HCA, thinks things will work out differently in Cleveland, where Blue Cross is the biggest health insurer.
Indeed, Mr. Feinberg of Oracle thinks the balance of power may be shifting to hospitals and doctors at the expense of the insurers.
"The H.M.O.'s have had the greatest power over the last five years, relative to physicians and hospitals," he said. "They had the information, the demographic data about patients, and they were smart enough to understand what their costs would be."
Now, he said, "Hospitals and physicians are becoming empowered with better understanding of demographics and costs. For H.M.O.'s over the long term, this will have a negative impact on the balance of power."
J.D. Kleinke, an economist in Baltimore with HCIA, a health care information company, said the Aetna deal was "a classic consolidation play in an industry that is fragmented and ultimately will shake out." He added, "Unfortunately I think it will shake out a lot more drastically and thoroughly than Aetna realizes in the long term, say over 10 years."
Mr. Kleinke said "the Columbia-HCA purchase of an insurer was much more illustrative of where the entire industry is going in the long term." He said hospital groups in Minneapolis, Detroit, Portland, Ore., and Southern California were "already eliminating the middleman, the H.M.O.," and dealing directly with payers such as employers.
At at least one big customer, the Xerox Corporation, the amount of money involved in the Aetna purchase was worrisome. "As a purchaser I always get nervous when lots of money is shelled out by one organization that is acquiring another, say for $9 billion," said Helen Darling, manager of health care strategy at Xerox.
She added: "My worry is that the acquiring company will want to recoup their investment at a time when we are trying to control costs. I would watch them both like hawks, nervously worrying that this will fuel medical inflation, and that this might make everyone, including legislators, more cynical about managed care."

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about mergers in the health care industry misstated terms of two recent acquisitions. Wellpoint Health Networks Inc. bought the group life and health division of the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, while Healthsource Inc. bought the medical services business of the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company. Neither buyer acquired an entire company.


GRAPHIC: The acquisition of U.S. Healthcare by the Aetna Insurance company is but the latest example of the ongoing consolidation in the managed-care industry. Most of the mergers have been between H.M.O.'s, but, like the Aetna-U.S. Healthcare merger, there have also been combinations of H.M.O.'s and insurance companies with traditional health care plans.

HEADLINE: Splendor in the Mud: Unraveling the Lives of Anacondas

BYLINE: By CAROL KAESUK YOON 

DATELINE: MANTECAL, Venezuela

 BODY:
IN one of the murky, hyacinth-choked pools in these vast savannas, whorls of thick spotted coils appear and disappear at the water's surface, hinting at the mass of snake hidden below. Three researchers tensely circle their submerged quarry when suddenly, cornered, the leviathan strikes, her dripping jaws shooting out of the water. Instantly they are upon her, grabbing head and tail, and she upon them, coils tightening around arms, legs, waists. For a moment it seems an even fight as the men, knotted in serpent, struggle even to remain upright. But eventually they manage to extract all 15 feet of her from the muddy lagoon. She is taken, the anaconda, the biggest snake in the world.
Here in these savannas, as elsewhere, the giant anaconda provokes both wonder and fear. Yet almost no scientific studies have been done that might dispel the colorful folklore of monstrous man-eating horned snakes that breathe poisonous gas and have the power to hypnotize human victims. 
 Now, in what researchers say is the first field study of the species, a team of American and Venezuelan biologists is providing a long-awaited glimpse into the life of this mysterious snake and beginning to sort anaconda fact from fiction.
"It's the only project of its kind in the world," said Dr. Robert Henderson, curator of herpetology at the Milwaukee Public Museum and co-author of the forthcoming book "Tales of Giant Snakes: A Historical Natural History of Anacondas and Pythons" (Krieger Publishing). "This is a wonderfully spectacular snake that's piqued the imagination of people for literally hundreds of years."
Researchers say that though poorly understood, the anaconda is far from untouched by humans, with thousands of skins traded each year, many illegally, for use in boots, belts and wallets. Biologists say the new work will help wildlife managers and conservationists to decide how the illegal trade might be replaced with a managed harvest aimed at conserving the species.
Almost nothing is known of anacondas' life in the wild. The snakes are secretive and often lie submerged in inaccessible rivers and lagoons. Biologists seeking to study anacondas must first catch them, one by one. No capture is routine: finding and subduing a single snake can easily require the determined efforts of three or four researchers.
The species, known as Eunectes murinus, ranges throughout South America's Orinoco and Amazon River basins. But Dr. John Thorbjarnarson, a conservation biologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York, and his team chose to study the snakes here in the Venezuelan savannas, known as the llanos, at a ranch called Hato El Cedral.
"I'd kept hearing about this mythical place," said Dr. Thorbjarnarson who heads the joint effort of the Wildlife Conservation Society and Profauna, Venezuela's national wildlife department. "I'd heard these tales of El Cedral, that snakes were everywhere, hanging from the trees, that you had to push them out of the road."
A working cattle ranch, El Cedral is also a preserve rich enough in wildlife to attract a healthy ecotourism trade, particularly in the dry season. Its extensive savannas, navigable only by boat in the rainy season, turn in dry weather into a patchwork of isolated pools, where more than 500 snakes have been found and marked since the project began in 1992.
In tracking these snakes, biologists have got a first peek into the love life of anacondas. When it comes to anaconda sex, they have found, the more the merrier. In the breeding season, which has now begun in the llanos, a single female can be found entwined with as many as 12 much smaller males in a heaping mass known as a mating ball. Researchers say the females appear to hang out in a pool of water, draped in and visited by as many as 17 consorts for as long as four to six weeks.
"Talk about foreplay," said Jesus Rivas, an ecologist at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville who has carried out much of the field work along with Maria Munoz, an ecologist at Simon Bolivar University in Caracas, Venezuela.
The discovery of the mating balls raises numerous questions, including just which of the males fathers the snakes and what the snakes are doing in these heaps for so long. To begin to answer these questions, Mr. Rivas is extracting blood from females, males and newborns to determine paternity using DNA tests. Researchers are also implanting radiotransmitters in young snakes to learn their fate, which for many is probably to make a snack for a caiman, the alligator-like creature that throngs the murky waters.
Biologists have found that life is dangerous for the adult anacondas too, even though they are the top predators. For while the anacondas feed on relatively docile prey like ducks, some of their other meals can be quite dangerous. After subduing their victims in squeezing coils, asphyxiating and sometimes drowning them as well, anacondas typically swallow their prey head-first. Large females can eat giant rodents called capybara, which reach the size of a small dog, and even caimans and white-tailed deer. But it is not a simple matter to swallow a five-foot-long caiman or to fight off sharp-clawed capybara struggling to free a mate. The female anacondas often bear numerous scars as the price of lunch.
Some snakes' appetites outstrip their intellect. Dr. Thorbjarnarson said he once found a dead deer with anaconda teeth marks on its heavily antlered head: the snake had presumably tried again and again to swallow the buck headfirst until the antlers forced it to accept defeat. Dr. Thorbjarnarson said he had also heard of anacondas consuming deer from the rear only to discover at the end a pair of antlers too magnificent to swallow. One snake found by the biologists had sliced itself open by gulping down a turtle with razor sharp shell edges.
Another way of studying the anacondas' menu is by examination of the feces. Even a large capybara, after its transit through an anaconda, is reduced to little more than a few claws and some tufts of fur. With turtles there may be a bit of shell and with caiman perhaps some tell-tale scaly skin.
Anacondas are rumored to partake of humans as well. In the llanos when someone is missing, fingers are often pointed at the giant snake, but biologists say there is no real evidence so far that people are part of the anaconda diet.
For females, the half-year long pregnancy is also a tough experience. While pregnant, they eat little or nothing. Yet these fasting females, said Bill Holmstrom, another researcher on the project from the Wildlife Conservation Society, can give birth to as many as 78 or more baby snakes. After a birth, a female's weight can drop by nearly half.
Two of the biologists, Mr. Rivas and Ms. Munoz, decided to make a study of the gestating females. To make sure the snakes were indeed pregnant, they found they had to establish a kind of reptilian maternity ward, where they checked the waiting mothers with ultrasound.
Seeking to establish the range required by an anaconda, the biologists tagged the snakes with radiotransmitters. They found that during the dry season, the snakes roam a regular area to which they return each year. Researchers say males, the smaller of the sexes, and nonpregnant females seem to remain in a 50-acre area. On the other hand, pregnant females, often among the biggest and bulkiest of anacondas, barely move at all, content to keep within a mere third of an acre until the job is done, sunning their ever more hulking bodies on the water's banks.
The biologists here say they still do not know enough to judge whether anacondas can be harvested safely and profitably. In particular, because of the difficulty of taking an anaconda census, researchers are concerned that it might be easy to overharvest a population without even knowing it.
Dr. Gordon M. Burghardt, an evolutionary ethologist at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, said the anaconda researchers had developed a handful of tricks of the trade that should be of great help to others beginning work on giant snakes. The subject of the researchers' most recent publication is the sock trick.
If a sock is pulled over an anaconda's head, it calms the snake, allowing researchers to transport it to their makeshift laboratory. But measuring even such a relaxed anaconda can be difficult. Researchers, after much experimentation, found the most reliable method was to trace the snake's long, coiled spine with a string, which is then measured.
When it comes to anacondas, questions of weight and length loom large. So far at Hato El Cedral, the heaviest snake has weighed in at 214 pounds and the longest at more than 17 1/2 feet.
While clearly the heaviest snake in the world, anacondas get competition from reticulated pythons when it comes to length. Reports of anacondas that are 60, even 150 feet long, have never been verified. Dr. Thorbjarnarson said the tallest of these tales was of a snake so long it took two days' march to get from one end to the other. He said the most frequently cited, and presumably reliable, report of an outsized anaconda is of a Colombian snake that was said to have measured 37 1/2 feet with a surveyor's tape. It subsequently escaped.
Even in the hands of biologists determined to take accurate readings, a snake that can tense and relax is hard to measure. The fear and boasting that such creatures inspire may also contribute to a general inflation in reported sizes.
So while scientific study has begun to replace legend, the anaconda still has not yielded its secrets to probe and calipers.
Sometime around 1910, Theodore Roosevelt offered a $1,000 reward to anyone presenting a live snake measuring 30 feet or more. Over the years the reward has been increased and the Wildlife Conservation Society's offer now stands at $50,000, a reward that to this day remains uncollected.

HEADLINE: In A-Plant's Backyard in Connecticut, Trust Ebbs

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: WATERFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
At the very tip of this town, where Millstone Point forms the eastern shore of Niantic Bay, three nuclear power plants owned by Northeast Utilities sit idle, under intense scrutiny by Federal regulators because of a long record of safety-procedure violations.
In Waterford, where the reactors are largely out of sight, and next door in East Lyme, where they dominate the view from Main Street along the bay, people who have lived with atomic energy in their backyard for nearly three decades are re-examining their comfort level, knowing now that the state's largest utility skimped on safety to cut costs. 
 In a corner of Connecticut where nuclear-related industries have powered the economy since the U.S.S. Nautilus was built in Groton in the early 50's, confidence in the Millstone reactors remains high. Of New London County's 270,000 residents, 40,000 are active or retired personnel from the Navy base in Groton or their relatives, and tens of thousands more work at the Electric Boat shipyard, or are related to workers there, where nuclear-powered submarines are built, or work at Millstone itself.
But increasingly, the confidence expressed is personal, based on faith in the friends and neighbors who work on Millstone Point, rather than trust in Northeast Utilities or its watchdog, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
"I have a philosophy about this that I think many people share," said David Cini, the First Selectman of East Lyme. "I know people at Millstone, and I believe that the hundreds of people who work there all want to be safe. These are not people who would allow things to happen to jeopardize the safety of their families and themselves."
Laura Fitch, the 80-year-old president of the Waterford Historical Society, put her opinion more bluntly. "We live with these people who work there, and I assume they know what they're doing," she said. "I'd like to think that none of them want to die of radiation, and I don't worry about what I don't have control over."
There are people, of course, who do worry, particularly the whistle-blowing employees at Millstone who drew attention to lax safety procedures there, and members of a citizens group who helped publicize their charges.
The focus of the charges was the utility's practice of replacing all fuel rods in Millstone 1 at one time, putting a full load of hot radioactive rods in water-cooled holding tanks for spent fuel, instead of only a third at a time as required by its operating license.
As a result of their efforts, in January the Nuclear Regulatory Commission put Millstone 1, Millstone 2 and Millstone 3, once among the nation's best-managed nuclear plants, on its watch list of troubled plants. They were safe, the agency said, but it cited years of violations as the utility tried to cut maintenance costs.
Then in March, Time published a cover story charging the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with failures to rein in nuclear utilities that put savings before safety, and Millstone was its chief example.
In a town where utility booklets on what to do in case of a nuclear accident arrive in the mail once a year, where telephone books show evacuation routes, where the Millstone sirens are heard during tests the first Wednesday of the month, few people called Waterford's First Selectman, Tony Sheridan, to express alarm.
Northeast Utilities had been a good neighbor, Mr. Sheridan said. Its property taxes pay for 70 percent of the town's budget, its employees serve on town boards, and in an area where jobs building submarines are being replaced by jobs dealing cards at casinos, it is a valued employer, too.
"People here tend not to be uncomfortable with nuclear power -- we build the finest nuclear submarines in the world here -- though they may be uncomfortable with the carelessness of Northeast Utilities and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission," he said. "If you talk to people, it's not a panic, but there is a concern that wasn't here a year ago. Most people are generous with their trust, but once you lose it, it's lost, and that's what Northeast Utilities should be concerned about."
Northeast Utilities has already lost the trust of its whistle-blowers and many members of a group called the Citizens Regulatory Commission that has rallied around them. While the group's mission is to see that the Millstone plants follow Federal regulations, some members say they do not think that any nuclear power plant can be operated safely.
Having begun to accept the possibility of a nuclear accident in their community, they now question every contingency: the practicality of the evacuation plan, and the plants' protection from earthquakes, hurricanes and planes falling from the sky.
"They make it seem like you're going on vacation," Ellen Lazerow, a New London resident who belongs to the group, said of the evacuation booklet. Yet the utility, she said, advises parents to leave town without picking up children at school, trusting buses to get them.
The Citizens Regulatory Commission's founder, Susan Perry Luxton, a Waterford native, said that people had put too much trust in Northeast Utilities and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
"I think I was in a state of denial," she said. "I never really liked nuclear power, but when it came in, I was in high school. We never learned much about nuclear power. There was talk about how electricity was going to be cheap, and so people were putting electric heat in their houses."
Three years ago, she said, she bought her dream house on Great Neck Road, directly east of Millstone, to raise a second family. So last summer, when she read about the safety concerns raised by a Millstone employee, George Galatis, she took it personally.
"I'm finally settled here for life," Ms. Luxton said, "and then to realize that Northeast Utilities is screwing up a mile away, I saw red."
Mr. Sheridan credits Ms. Luxton's group for helping the whistle blowers to be heard, and for raising public awareness about what he sees as the real problem at Millstone: the holding tanks contain the reactors' spent fuel because the Federal Government has not established a disposal site. People should be concerned, he said, over the existence of a nuclear dump on Millstone Point.
But most people also express confidence that the problems will now be resolved. Some say that the people who are most alarmed don't understand how small the risks are.
"Doing nuclear power is expensive, so in some ways it's counter to someone trying to make a profit," said J. W. (Bill) Sheehan, a former submarine commander. But the people who have responded emotionally, he said, "don't understand what is an acceptable risk."
"They don't recognize when they go out their door in the morning and get in their car," he said, "that they have entered an area of risk."
That stark divide between those who are alarmed and those who feel reassured, however, is typical when people confront risks from radiation and other invisible, long-lasting threats to health, sociologists say.
In areas like New London County, or southern Nevada, where the population is long accustomed to a military nuclear presence, people's confidence may be higher to begin with, said Kai Erikson, a professor of sociology and American studies at Yale who has studied the nuclear accident at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania. But when people lose trust, they tend to lose it completely, he said.
"Having invested a great deal of faith in one institution, or technology, or company, and having come to feel that they haven't been treated fairly by it, they begin to have questions about almost everything," he said. "The whole world seems less reliable."
Northeast Utilities, at the request of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is now going over every detail of Millstone 1 and Millstone 2 to insure that upon restarting, they will operate in exact compliance with all specifications and procedures.
"All of our employees have been asked to examine their work, past and present, and to identify and to help resolve any issues they feel need to be followed up on," said a company spokeswoman, Deborah Beauchamp.
But another challenge for the company, Professor Erikson said, is to acknowledge every public concern, no matter how small the actual risk.
Engineers, he said, calculate risks in different ways from, say, mothers of small children, and denying there is any risk because the odds are extremely low can often fuel larger, more unreasonable doubts.
"To be a mother and to have children is to be afraid of the future in ways that demand respect," he said. "It would make a very great difference if someone came along and said, "I understand your fear and I worry about that, too, but here are the actual odds.' "

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Remains Little Changed; Jobless Data on Friday Awaited

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed in quiet trading yesterday ahead of the Passover and Good Friday observances later in the week.
Currency traders were also cautious ahead of Friday's widely awaited Government report on the job market in March. The previous employment report showed the creation of 705,000 jobs in February, stunning financial markets and raising worries among investors that the economy was overheating, possibly leading to a burst of inflation. 
 Many traders said they were content to stay on the sidelines until Friday's jobs report came out.
"The fact that we have a payrolls number on Friday, which is typically unpredictable, means people aren't willing to put on big positions ahead of that," said John Rothfield, an international economist at Nationsbanc-CRT.
The dollar managed to climb as high as 107.62 Japanese yen during trading in Asia and New York.
But it retreated as some Japanese companies sold dollars to capitalize on the currency's strength, traders said. There were also rumors that a large hedge fund based in the United States sold dollars for yen.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 107.57 yen, up from 107.56 yen on Monday. The dollar was quoted at 1.4827 German marks, down from 1.4835 marks. The British pound fell to $1.5227 from $1.5243.
Trading is expected to be thin this week, with the Jewish observance of Passover beginning tonight, and then Good Friday. Most European financial markets will be closed on Friday and Monday. United States stock markets will be closed on Friday.
While the coming employment report all but paralyzed foreign exchange traders, there were factors suggesting the dollar will continue its recent rally against the yen, traders and analysts said.
There are expectations in the foreign exchange market that the dollar "is going to head higher almost regardless of what happens with payrolls," said Kevin Harris, an international economist at MCM Currency Watch.
Japanese investors are expected to shift more funds abroad now that the new Japanese fiscal year has started, which would tend to lift the dollar.
"The new year leads to anticipation that there'll be an outflow of savings from Japan into other markets," Mr. Harris said.

HEADLINE: An African Forest Harbors Vast Wealth and Peril

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: EVELA, Gabon

 BODY:
The forest grows so thick at the edge of this tiny settlement that even the N'tem River, a sizable Central African waterway, is completely obscured in the riotous greenery. Asked what lies beyond, a Fang villager shrugs and says "nothing."
From time immemorial, for the Fang -- one of the Bantu peoples who make up the bulk of Central Africa's population -- this area has been known as the edge of the world. But in fact, the land beyond this point has always been home to others: small groups of Pygmies, whose hunting-and-gathering livelihood had until recently changed little in a millennium. 
 The equatorial forest inhabited by Gabon's Pygmies, an area about the size of New York state, is at the heart of Africa's last intact belt of rain forest. It is still peopled by fewer than 40,000 inhabitants. But now it is facing changes of a pace and magnitude far greater than anyone here, Fang or Pygmy, has yet grasped.
Only a few dozen miles from this village, convoys of lumber trucks filled with stone are bringing material to French-led crews laying the paved roads that will open up this area as never before. In the capital, Libreville, and in the headquarters of European logging companies, plans are already being laid for the forest's exploitation.
At the same time, groups from the World Wildlife Fund to the World Bank are racing to mount efforts to inventory the huge catalogue of plant and animal species that live here and to identify areas for strict conservation on Gabon's last frontier for commercial forestry.
With its sparse human population and its dense canopy still intact, international environmental experts say that what happens to this jungle in Gabon will be an important bellwether for Africa's last major belt of relatively pristine rain forest, a vast area that stretches from the continent's equatorial coast across Gabon and well into the Congo River basin deep in Zaire.
"A lot of money is being spent in places like Brazil, in areas trying to rescue forests that have already been devastated," said Kathryn Simons, an American environmentalist who is studying conservation efforts in Gabon. "In Central Africa, where relatively little has been done so far, we have a unique opportunity to save a major tropical forest before it is destroyed."
It was in this forest, too, that the Ebola virus appeared in humans last year, killing some people in Gabon before it swept into Zaire and killed 244 others. Some experts warn that opening the forest, where unidentified animals are believed to harbor the disease, could unleash more epidemics.
If northern Gabon still boasts some of Central Africa's densest remaining woodlands, in particular the Minkebe forest, both experts and residents of this area can point to signs of an endangered future. Major logging companies and sawmills have not yet reached this forest, but already to the south and east of here, small operators have begun chipping away at this habitat in search of Okoume, the most readily exploitable tree species, which is used mostly for plywood.
Wildcat gold miners, too, have been reported operating deep in the forest, where they fell trees and dig deep pits, dumping mercury and other highly toxic chemicals in the ground or in streams.
An arduous two-week hike away from Evela, along ancient footpaths traversed by thick columns of army ants and spied upon by tree leopards, live Pygmies who have never set eyes on Westerners. But already, around the fringes of the Minkebe forest, more and more Pygmies are being drawn into the life of modern Africa and its cash economy.
Throughout Gabon, wild game is considered choice dining. And in towns like this and in nearby Minvoul, Pygmies wait for city folk or Bantu agriculturists to hire their services as master hunters of the prized forest elephants.
Setting out armed with old 12-gauge shotguns and a few shells each, the hunters can spend weeks in the forest, wandering a landscape teeming with wildlife. The forest's estimated 65,000 elephants, along with Zaire's elephant population the largest in Africa, are the most prized game, but the array of potential targets is mind-boggling.
Pygmy hunters say their prizes include 30-foot boa constrictors, antelopes, gorillas, porcupines, boars and monkeys of all kinds. But if the variety is rich, the Pygmies themselves say that their search for game becomes more difficult each year as the hunting parties multiply.
"When we were young men, the hunt was done with arrows," said Omer Amaya, a 58-year-old Pygmy hunter whose settlement lies in a forest clearing at the edge of Minvoul. "We could go out for eight or nine hours and come home with a big catch. Nowadays you must walk at least three days before you can count on even seeing anything interesting."
For the hunters, the reasons for this increasing scarcity seem simple: their hunting has thinned game populations. "Wherever the barrel of the gun belches, the animals will try to avoid," said Hilarion Mikou. "After a time, if all is quiet, the animals will come back."
For environmental experts, however, the picture is more complex. "These forests are still primary forests in their structure, but already they are being exploited," said Marc Languy, a forest expert with the World Wildlife Fund. "We have noted a decrease of 80 percent in chimpanzee populations. If it is true that they can rebound, this is a process that might take 15 or 20 years."
The recent outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the town of Mayibout, another small Bantu outpost in the forest 130 miles to the southeast of here, has reminded many of another possible consequence of the forest encroachment. The outbreak killed less than 20 people in Gabon, but swept through the Zairian town of Kikwit with devastating effects last year, quickly killing 244 people.
The origins of the virus are not known, but it is presumed to have a natural host somewhere in the forest, from which it infects primates. Those who died in Gabon had recently feasted on chimpanzee meat.
Scientists at a major international conference on Ebola held in Kinshasa, Zaire, earlier this month theorized that environmental damage to previously pristine forest areas brought about the emergence of Ebola as a major health threat.
"In Gabon, gold prospectors went deep into the forest, they cut down trees in all directions, they dug up and destroyed a part of this environment" said Jean-Jacques Muyembe, a Zairian Ebola researcher. "This gave rise to the emergence of the virus." His theory is that the virus was dormant until its environment was so severely disrupted.
Pygmy hunters, meanwhile, say that in recent months they have encountered increasing numbers of dead gorillas and chimpanzees in the forest, where they have been felled by a mysterious affliction.
"You can hardly find any live gorillas anymore," said Mr. Mikou. "We've never seen this before. A big game animal that fears nothing is just dropping dead."
If conservation groups are beginning to marshal an effort to save Gabon's northern forests from the heavy logging that has taken place almost everywhere else in this country, tropical wood interests would seem to have the early upper hand.
A Dutch concern known as Wijima has already secured rights to just over one million acres of the Minkebe forest. And Gabon's President, Omar Bongo, has roped off another 542,000 acres of virgin forest for logging, just to the south of Minkebe.
"This is the last place that good supplies of wood are left in the country," said Pierre Mezui M'Eyie, a Government forest inspector based in the provincial capital of Oyem. "Right now, no one seems to know what kind of wealth there is here, but once the first commercial permits are issued, you will see a flood of applications.
"Then is only a matter of time before the Minkebe is destroyed."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Rise On Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday, bolstered by reports that suggested the economy was not growing at a fast enough pace to accelerate inflation.
One report, on leading economic indicators, showed a gain that was stronger than expected. But the market viewed the improvements as recoveries from sharp weather-related setbacks and not indicative of a trend that could keep the Federal Reserve from cutting short-term interest rates in the coming months. Bond prices were also supported by a weekly survey of retail sales that showed weakness and by a firm dollar. 
 Still, the rise in bond prices came on light volume, with many market participants reluctant to take positions ahead of the March employment report due to be released on Friday.
"In front of the employment report it would be unwise if not irresponsible for anyone to make big bets," said David Ader, managing fixed-income anlayst at Technical Data in Boston,
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 15/32, to 92 9/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.59 percent from 6.64 percent on Monday.
The Conference Board reported yesterday that the monthly index of leading indicators rose 1.3 percent in February, exceeding the market's expectations for a gain of 1.1 percent. But traders and analysts viewed the gain as a rebound from a setback in January caused by a blizzard.
"As with much of the other weather-related spikes we've seen, the leading indicators will fail to produce a clear indication of economic activity until more data is offered from this series in the coming months," said Marilyn Schaja of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, estimated that about 60 percent of the jump in the indicators reflected a weather-related recovery in the manufacturing workweek. The report, he said, "merely confirmed the market-friendly scenario of moderate growth ahead."
The Commerce Department yesterday released its revised estimate of the gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, and that also fell short of expectations. The report said the economy grew at an annual pace of five-tenths of 1 percent in the last three months of 1995, down from an earlier estimate of nine-tenths of 1 percent. Some analysts had been expecting a revision of seven-tenths of 1 percent. The Commerce Department report suggested that the economy was weaker than many had thought last year.
Weakness was also seen in the Johnson Redbook survey, released in the afternoon, which showed a decline of seven-tenths of 1 percent in retail sales last week.
Bond prices received additional support yesterday from expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon conduct a coupon pass, in which the Fed enters the market to buy certain maturities to add cash to the banking system. It is used to address seasonal shortages of reserves, and is not a signal of any change in monetary policy. Traders say the coupon pass gives dealers an opportunity to sell Treasury securities piling up in inventory to a ready buyer.
At yesterday's Treasury auctions of short-term maturities, the Treasury sold $14 billion of 15-day cash management bills at an average rate of 5.29 percent, and $11.1 billion of 22-day bills at 5.25 percent.

HEADLINE: Ross David Siragusa, 89; Founded a Major Maker of Appliances

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Ross David Siragusa, who founded the Admiral Corporation and led its growth from a small radio manufacturer to one of the country's leading makers of televisions, audio products, refrigerators and other home appliances, died on Saturday at his home in Chicago. He was 89.
Admiral, which was founded in 1934 as the Continental Radio and Television Corporation, was Mr. Siragusa's second electronics venture. The first, the Transformer Corporation of America, was founded in 1924, after Mr. Siragusa graduated from Loyola Academy High School in Chicago. The company grew quickly by selling battery chargers for radios, which in that era used "wet" batteries that needed frequent recharging. 
 By 1929, Mr. Siragusa's company was the largest seller of radio transformers in the country, and its founder, flush with success, turned down an offer to buy the company for more than $5 million. But five years later, the Transformer Corporation went out of business, a victim of the Depression.
Mr. Siragusa immediately turned to the more lucrative field of manufacturing radios. In 1934, after selling his automobile and most of his home furnishings, Mr. Siragusa put $3,400 of his own and borrowed money toward a new venture, the Continental Radio and Television Corporation, which later changed its name to Admiral.
Within two years, the company's annual sales exceeded $2 million, and by the time the United States entered World War II, revenues topped $9 million. Growth exploded with the arrival of contracts for military electronics during the war, after which Mr. Siragusa steered Admiral into another field with vast potential -- television.
In 1950, Admiral produced more than one million television sets; the following year, it made five million. Growth appeared unlimited until economic and technological changes nearly brought down the company.
In 1951, disputes over which regulatory framework would rule the market for color television, combined with a new 10 percent excise tax on television sets, left major manufacturers with huge inventories.
But by offering huge discounts on its television sets and increasing its promotion of refrigerators, electric ranges and other home appliances, Admiral survived the downturn in the television industry.
Still, other technological innovations continued to vex Mr. Siragusa.
"I also can't see the market potential for home video tape recorders except for the very wealthy," he told The New York Times in 1965.
In 1973, with Admiral's sales topping $600 million but with profits falling sharply, the company agreed to be acquired by the Rockwell International Corporation for $78 million. Rockwell later sold Admiral's domestic appliance business to Magic Chef Inc.
At the time of the sale to Rockwell, the 34 percent of Admiral owned by Mr. Siragusa and his family was worth $26.5 million. Some of the proceeds of the sale went to the Siragusa Foundation, a Chicago charitable corporation founded in 1950. Mr. Siragusa served as chairman of the group until his retirement in 1993.
Mr. Siragusa is survived by his wife, the former Martha Ellen Peace, of Chicago; three sons, Ross Jr., of Fort Payne, Ala., John, of Chicago, and Richard, of Lake Forest, Ill.; 12 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. A daughter, Mary Irene, died in 1980. Mr. Siragusa's first wife, Irene O'Brien, died in 1969.

Small Markets Shopping For Same Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
LUIS SALCEDO waited tables for 11 years, saving tips and paychecks until he could buy a modest coffee shop in Brooklyn. A few years later, he bought a grocery store in the Bronx. Then he put together $1 million through savings and high-interest loans, renovated a dilapidated Harlem storefront and opened up a supermarket with the grand name of Bravo.
Hold the applause. 
 His ascent up the food chain may be ending. He is convinced that his business will be gobbled up by predators coming into his neighborhood with unfair advantages. A few blocks east of his Fifth Avenue store, a large Pathmark is to be built. To the west, Fairway's mammoth uptown outpost attracts a socioeconomic mix ranging from aficionados of gourmet cheese to the recipients of the Government kind.
Like many owners of independent supermarkets in the area, he is irked by the city's helping to close the Pathmark deal by providing a 1 percent mortgage on the site and offering to act as an equity partner until a Hispanic community sponsor is found.
As for Fairway, Mr. Salcedo sees nothing fair about the way the 35,000-square-foot store opened late last year, apparently in violation of zoning laws that limit retail floor space to 10,000 square feet. The store's owners said it was a wholesale operation open to anyone, thereby exempt from the laws. While Fairway's owners negotiate a solution with the city, officials are preparing this month to discuss changing zoning laws to allow stores to sprawl out over 200,000 square feet.
GOVERNMENT'S embrace of these economies of scale makes Mr. Salcedo and his contemporaries feel mighty small. They say their dealings with officialdom are often limited to maddening encounters with health inspectors and code enforcers who are quick to dash off a summons for the slightest infraction.
"We want a level playing field," he said, perched in his tiny office where video monitors provide a scan of the store. "I will not put down Fairway at all as a business. The question is how someone got away with violating the law while others can't."
His complaints are typical of the 400 or so independent supermarkets scattered throughout the city, many of them in poorer communities that were abandoned by the big supermarket chains in the 1960's. The owners of these smaller supermarkets -- many of them Hispanic immigrants who chafe at the term bodega, which their businesses are not -- moved into those empty stores, shunned by bankers but often financed by food wholesalers and others who made them pay high interest on short-term loans.
"We came in aggressively and financed it privately," Mr. Salcedo said. "Now the big supermarkets see us thriving in here and they want to come back. But they need special zoning and benefits we don't get. I don't think that's American."
Especially not when he was just hit with a $50 summons because a passer-by tossed garbage onto the sidewalk near his dumpster. The law holds him responsible, he said, even if the garbage wasn't from his store.
Before that, he faced $13,000 in fines because he had failed to put price stickers on every roll of paper towels he stacked in a display. The rolls were in sealed boxes.
"Are they technically following the laws, or do they use discretion?" he said. "Their job is to give me a summons, and then you deal with the system."
Now Mr. Salcedo is getting help. Many supermarket owners banded together to confront city agencies, working out a settlement on outstanding fines that allows them to pay only a quarter of what was owed.
MORE recently, Hispanic supermarket owners and Korean greengrocers have joined forces to make sure they don't get lost in the shuffle of new zoning maps that would clear the way for big, warehouse-style stores. This ethnic alliance would not have been likely a decade ago when the two groups considered each other as competitors. Now they've petitioned the state to study the economic impact of their small businesses, which together employ some 48,000 people.
"We're building up and sharing our common concerns and problems," said Sung Soo Kim, the vice president of the Puerto Rican-Asian-Hispanic Development Corporation. "We are a social class."
Mr. Salcedo thinks that this newly united merchant class might help them pool the resources to compete with the big guys. Together, maybe they can get government to look at them as players with economic clout and more than a few votes.
"Why not offer the opportunities to the people who went in with their own dollars and risked everything?" he said. "I don't want something for nothing. I just want the same opportunity."

HEADLINE: Dogs Make Life Better For Disabled

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 2

 BODY:
Forced by multiple sclerosis to use a wheelchair, Lane Phalen struggled for four years to open and close doors, pick up things that fell on the floor or go shopping.
Now she has become one of thousands of disabled Americans getting a physical and emotional lift from dogs trained to do some of the things their masters cannot. 
 A two-year study being published on Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that "service dogs" improved the psychological, social and economic well-being of 48 disabled people who had asked for canine help.
With help from their dogs, people unable to walk because of multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy or brain or spinal cord injuries were able work more, deal more with other people and use public transportation more. In a few cases, the emotional lift the dogs provided even helped troubled marriages.
For decades, blind people have used dogs as guides. But in recent years dogs taken from shelters have helped disabled people get in and out of bathtubs or dress.
Ms. Phalen's golden retriever, named Beau, was trained by a Michigan-based organization and given to her by her husband nearly two years ago. Beau can pull her wheelchair, open and close doors with straps attached, get cans of soda out of the refrigerator and bring her a phone if there is trouble. Now Ms. Phalen believes the dog will motivate her to leave the wheelchair permanently.
"As a disabled person, I was accustomed to everybody taking care of me and the focus of activity being on me," said Ms. Phalen, a 40-year-old writer in suburban Hoffman Estates. "It's very easy to slide into, 'O.K., just take care of me.' But since I am totally responsible for his welfare, I feel needed again."
The disabled people in the study also needed far less help from family and friends once they began using service dogs, which are available free of charge from organizations supported by donations.
The study, conducted by Karen Allen of the State University of New York at Buffalo and Jim Blascovich of the University of California at Santa Barbara, found that disabled people who had a service dog for a year spent 68 percent less on hired assistants than they did before.
Dr. Allen and Dr. Blascovich said a service dog could save a disabled person more than $16,000 a year.
"That the number of unpaid assistance hours can decrease suggests that the strain on relationships between people with severe ambulatory disabilities and their loved ones will go down," Dr. Blascovich said.
Michael Sapp, chief operating officer of Paws With a Case, the organization based in Byron Center, Mich., that trained Beau, said he hoped the study would encourage insurance companies to pay for service dogs. Last year Mr. Sapp's organization trained 177 dogs and gave them to disabled people in 38 states. Most of the dogs were golden retrievers and Labradors from shelters.
Before getting Beau, Ms. Phalen felt vulnerable and alone in public and often grew tired from wheeling herself around. She credits the dog with allowing her to travel and visit bookstores.
"I want everybody who's disabled to have a dog," Ms. Phalen said. "I don't know if it's psychological, because I expected things to be better, or what, but I needed to be more active. God, he's changed my life."

HEADLINE: Republicans Are Up in Arms At Labor's Political Rebirth

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
Stunned by organized labor's intention to spend more than ever in this year's national elections, Republican campaign committees and business lobbies are crying foul and turning up the heat to blunt labor's impact.
In their pronouncements, Republican organizers, who have mocked or ignored unions in campaigns since the 1970's, are calling unions "big labor" again and ridiculing "Washington union bosses" and "Beltway labor bosses." 
 They have filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission calling the unions' campaign war chest illegal, and they are forming their own teams of campaigners in Congressional districts to take on labor's workers.
Labor's rebirth as a force in these elections comes on the heels of a vote last week by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has 13.1 million members, to set up the war chest by raising $35 million, most of it from a monthly assessment on each of the labor federation's 78 unions of 15 cents per capita.
That money, to be used to pay hundreds of full-time organizers and educate voters on issues, is a new resource to pour into the campaign. It comes on top of the more than $40 million in voluntary contributions from union members to political action committees, money that will be spread mostly among Democrats running for the Congressional seats that 73 freshman Republicans won two years ago.
For all that, the unions' spending is sure to fall far short of the money that Republican campaign committees and their allies among business associations and big business are likely to raise. "There will be no parity here," said Ellen Miller, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. She said Republicans outspent unions 7 to 1 in voter-education programs.
Labor's redoubled campaign effort coincides with a growing public awareness of bread-and-butter issues for unions: the jobs lost to downsizing and to Mexico, the sinking wages of rank-and-file workers and the climbing salaries, into the millions, of corporate executives. For the moment, at least, those issues have surpassed others that divide workers, like gun control and abortion.
The new efforts follow the election last October of a new and more bellicose president, John J. Sweeney, to lead the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
Among Republicans, the convergence of combative union leadership and the public focus on economic issues has inspired oratorical flourishes unheard since the 1930's, when unions won most of the workplace rights like the 40-hour week. Craig Veith, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that Mr. Sweeney had embarked upon "probably the biggest overt power grab in history."
Mr. Sweeney and the presidents of the federation's 78 unions have begun "an unprecedented assault against our majorities in the House and the Senate," Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee, complained in a letter to the party faithful last week.
Even though unions' membership has shrunk, from a third of the workforce in the 1950's to less than a sixth today, they are still the only significant advocates for the nation's workers. In this election year, unions got an unsolicited lift from Patrick J. Buchanan, whose campaign for the Presidential nomination has bedeviled the Republican establishment, calling attention to wages and disappearing industrial jobs and to the condition of working families.
In the 1992 and 1994 election years, unions tried to make something of downsizing and the widening gap between workers' wages and those of their employers, without much visible success at the polls. Unions opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and after it was enacted in late 1993, they promised to drive the lawmakers who supported it from office. Instead, they witnessed the landslide that won the Republicans control of both chambers of Congress.
Then along came Mr. Sweeney, president of the one-million-member Service Employees Industrial Union, one of few unions to grow significantly while others were shrinking. Last year, Mr. Sweeney led a coup against Lane Kirkland, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, and Thomas R. Donahue, the secretary-treasurer, who in their 16 years at the top of the labor federation presided over the relentless decline of union membership.
Sixty-one and balding, with sleepy eyes and a portly frame draped in Brooks Brothers suits, Mr. Sweeney is an improbable-looking firebrand. But he has packed the federation's top offices with tough-talking men and women in their 40's, and he says that when push comes to shove, he is willing to resort to civil disobedience.
Upon taking office, Mr. Sweeney made two major promises: to beef up the unions' organizing activities and to go after the new Republicans in Congress who have been voting down nearly all the important issues on labor's agenda.
Unions want to raise the $4.25 hourly minimum wage, bar employers from dismissing workers who strike, stop the $270 million reduction in Medicare spending proposed by Republicans, provide cheap health care to all workers and block business lobbyists' efforts to open closed, all-union workplaces to nonunion workers and relax workplace safety laws.
Downsizing and soaring salaries for chief executives have played into the unions' hands, the leaders say. "You've got the chief executive officer of AT&T who makes 16 gazillion dollars and lays off 40,000 workers and his stock goes up," said William W. Hamilton, political director of the teamsters union. "That sends a message that's pretty chilling."
To thwart the labor agenda, the unions' Republican and business opponents have belatedly begun gearing up to fight. The United States Chamber of Commerce is in the throes of forming a Center on the 21st Century Workplace to take on union campaigners in Congressional districts.
Two months ago, the conservative Heritage Foundation formed a Union Watch Project to arm Republicans to take on the issues that unions are exploiting. "Organized labor's renewed political activism promises to be a major factor in the 1996 elections," the foundation wrote in a document that Mr. Barbour sent Republicans last week.
The Small Business Survival Foundation, with 40,000 members, was formed here two years ago to deal mostly with tax issues but is concentrating on unions and publishes a Labor Watch newsletter. "Right now, I'd say they've gotten us on the defensive," said Karen Kerrigan, the group's president. "They've done a very good job getting outside the Beltway and delivering their message."
Strategically, the Republican groups turn their fire on "Washington union bosses" in trying to differentiate them from the rank and file. "They are two different breeds," said Cheri Jacobus, communications director for the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunity. "The bosses have high salaries, great benefits and expensive automobiles at their disposal," she said. "They are very different from the rank and file. There are Washington values and American values."
Surprised by the surge of union political activity, Republicans in Congress are looking into hearings on issues like union corruption to embarrass the labor movement. One such effort failed last month.
The House Oversight Committee called a hearing to examine the unions' campaign spending. But Mr. Sweeney and other leaders declined to appear, and the Democrats on the committee called the session an inquisition and walked out.
The federation is aglow with all the attention. "We're relevant again!" said Steve Rosenthal, its political director. "Those people have waged the worst assault on working families that we have seen in 75 years."
"They've been doing it in the dark, and we're putting a spotlight on it," Mr. Rosenthal said. "What they want to do is talk about union bosses. Well this isn't about unions. This is about working families."
What has stirred the Republicans most is that $35 million war chest. Last week, Maria Cino, executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, issued a statement titled, "Sweeney desperate to fund illegal campaign."
She wrote that the assessment amounted to a dues increase that many members do not support and that it represented a forced and illegal contribution to the political campaigns to unseat Republican lawmakers. She added that the Republican agenda, with its promise of a balanced budget, served working families best.
But unions insist that none of the money will be contributed to candidates, whom they can help legally only through their members' voluntary contributions to union political action committees. The money, they say, will be used to educate voters on issues important to unions. Still, in their leafleting and commercials, the unions will leave little doubt about whom they see as in their camp.
In one sense, $35 million is serious money. The Heritage Foundation estimates that it is seven times as much as the federation has poured into Congressional races in the past. Mr. Barbour said in a report last week to Republicans in Congress that spread over the 70 districts where the unions will concentrate their campaigning, "that is $500,000 per district from unions alone."
"The average candidates spent on House races in 1994," Mr. Barbour said, "was $409,000."
But Ms. Miller said Republicans were sure to far exceed union spending this year. "Labor has always been vastly outspent," she said.

HEADLINE: Researching the Enemy: An Old Political Tool Resurfaces in a New Election

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla. April 2

 BODY:
When Bob Dole campaigned his way through the Iowa Presidential caucuses in February, he was often shadowed by a young man carrying a compact, broadcast-quality, Hi-8 television camcorder.
The young man worked for the Democratic National Committee. His assignment was to gather footage of remarks by Mr. Dole and the other Republican Presidential candidates on behalf of Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign. Mr. Dole's aides soon picked him out -- the baby-faced cameraman stood out in the crowd of older TV crews weighted down with packs of professional equipment -- and for a while, dispatched Republican advance workers to stand in front of him, with instructions to block his filming. 
 At the Republican National Committee's headquarters in Washington this month, party aides have embarked on a similar, though less veiled, effort at what is known as opposition research. They are assembling an indexed catalogue of public statements made by Mr. Clinton during his career, which they will use themselves and issue to reporters as a bound book. They are also reviewing less-noticed aspects of Mr. Clinton's first term -- court rulings by his judicial appointees, Federal regulations issued by the agencies under his charge and potentially impolitic remarks by his Cabinet officers -- that might help to discredit the President in the fall campaign.
After a Presidential election in which the use of opposition research fell into some disrepute, the upcoming general-election campaign is shaping up as a confrontation between two candidates who have historically proved to be expert at turning their opponent's governmental record to their advantage.
Opposition research was critical to Mr. Dole's success in claiming his party's nomination this year, as it was in helping Mr. Clinton derail his Democratic opponents for the Presidential nomination in 1992. And aides to Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton are predicting a resurgence this year of a campaign tool that goes back at least to the time of Abraham Lincoln.
"There is a lot of information out there," said Ann Lewis, deputy campaign manager for Mr. Clinton. "You don't have to scramble."
In a revealing realignment of his campaign staff, Mr. Dole, who is vacationing in this Miami resort community this week, has retained one of the best-known experts in opposition research in American politics today, Don Todd, to help him against Mr. Clinton. Mr. Todd worked for George Bush in 1988, where he directed the memorably effective negative research effort that helped defeat Michael S. Dukakis.
This addition to Mr. Dole's staff comes after a primary campaign in which Mr. Dole dispatched his major opponents -- Lamar Alexander, Steve Forbes and Patrick J. Buchanan -- largely with the use of information turned up by his opposition research. Mr. Dole's campaign plumbed his opponents' records to find "votes and quotes," as one Republican researcher put it, to support ads portraying Mr. Alexander as liberal, Mr. Buchanan as extreme and Mr. Forbes as posing an economic threat to middle-class homeowners with his flat-tax proposal.
If Ross Perot runs as a third-party Presidential candidate, he has said he will refrain from attacking his opponents, and Democratic and Republican aides have not said what, if anything, they will do to deal with him.
Several factors suggest that the use of opposition research might be more free-wheeling this year than it was in 1992. Then, Mr. Bush was restrained in what he could do because of the legacy of a controversial advertisement in 1988 about the furloughed prisoner Willie Horton, as well as an effort to remain Presidential.
"Bush's reputation was such that almost anything he said about his opponents was discounted in the public mind as the desperate charge of a guy hanging by his fingernails," said David Tell, who headed Mr. Bush's 1992 opposition research effort and is now the opinions editor at the conservative magazine, The Weekly Standard.
For his part, Mr. Clinton, who aggressively used such information against his primary opponents, was more careful in a political atmosphere in which his aides concluded that he stood to benefit by the perception that Mr. Bush was guilty of unfair campaign practices.
By contrast this year, Mr. Dole's campaign has already shown little reservation about aggressively using information against its opponents, even in cases where the attacks are arguably exaggerated. In one case -- the criticism of Mr. Forbes's flat tax in New Hampshire -- Mr. Dole's aides now acknowledge that the attacks were wrong.
Mr. Dole's campaign asserted in one commercial that under the flat tax, a "typical New Hampshire household" would pay $2,000 in additional taxes. The Dole campaign quickly realized the assertion was based on an incorrect reading of an economic study. The campaign official in charge of opposition research then, Mary Anne Carter, was forced out of her job because of that, Republican officials said.
But Mr. Dole's campaign kept the advertisement rather than risk the political embarrassment of withdrawing it in the midst of a tight campaign. Partly because of the ad, Mr. Forbes came in a distant fourth in New Hampshire.
Opposition research has become stigmatized since the Republicans used it so aggressively against Mr. Dukakis in 1988, focusing on Mr. Horton, who terrorized a Maryland couple while on furlough from a Massachusetts prison, stabbing the man and raping his fiancee, as well as Mr. Dukakis's onetime opposition to proposed legislation that required students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. The fallout from that campaign left negative research in such disrepute that campaign aides are publicly reluctant to discuss them.
Mr. Todd said he saw no gain in describing his record or work in Mr. Dole's campaign. "Everyone claims to have discovered Willie Horton," Mr. Todd said. "But he's going to get out of jail some day, so I don't."
In preparing for the upcoming election, Mr. Dole's research team is not planning to focus its information-gathering efforts on Mr. Clinton's personal problems. Republicans say they have steered clear of accusations that have involved Mr. Clinton in the courts and tabloids.
"You aren't going to beat Clinton on that stuff," said Charles Black, who was the senior adviser to Mr. Bush's 1988 campaign. "We didn't last time." Similarly, Mr. Dole's aides are not at this moment planning to devote much effort to investigating the Clintons' involvement in the Whitewater real estate development. That is again a pragmatic decision, dictated by the doubts they have that they could turn up anything that special prosecutors, Congressional committees and reporters have not, and that there is no need for the Dole campaign to push the issue.

HEADLINE: Mayor Says if Yanks Must Move, West Side Would Be Best

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
With the city ready to present the New York Yankees with a report on the best place to locate the team, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that it would be easier to finance building a new stadium on Manhattan's West Side than at any other site.
The $600,000 consultant's report weighs the likelihood of four locations to keep the team from leaving New York. They are the rail yards west of Pennsylvania Station, a refurbished Yankee Stadium, and two other Bronx sites: Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay Parks. One person familiar with the report said it comes down in favor of the West Side plan, which would cost at least $800 million. 
 Mr. Giuliani has said that he remains emotionally wedded to keeping the Yankees at their current location, but at a news conference yesterday, he called the West Side proposal financially viable.
"The revenue stream from a stadium in the middle of Manhattan would be off the charts," he said. "It would be an enormous amount of money because of multiple uses and because of what it would do for baseball attendance."
While the proposal has not been publicly released, the mere prospect that the city would consider building a new stadium on the West Side drew criticism yesterday, even from the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth Messinger.
"To spend hundreds of millions of dollars to move a stadium two miles to an area that will be filled with traffic problems is not a thoughtful expenditure of money," Ms. Messinger said.
According to the person familiar with the study's findings, the report found there would be more economic value in building a ballpark on the West Side than in spending about the same amount to renovate Yankee Stadium and build new highway ramps, garages and a Harlem River bridge. It rejected sites at Van Cortlandt Park and Pelham Bay Parkway.
City and state officials were supposed to meet today with the Yankees' principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, but that meeting has been postponed until at least next week. Mr. Steinbrenner is known to favor the West Side site -- should he decide not to move the team to New Jersey.
While revenue from a stadium on the West Side might pay off any bonds issued to pay for the new ballpark, a host of other issues remain. A Manhattan stadium could require costly improvements to accommodate traffic and parking, as well as mass transit, since the nearest subway station would be blocks away. In addition, Mr. Steinbrenner would most likely want a substantial part of any added revenue from the West Side stadium.
Mr. Giuliani would not confirm any of the study's findings yesterday, saying: "We have a report on four sites and we'll deliver that report to the Yankees. The Yankees haven't been briefed on it."
David Sussman, the general counsel of the Yankees, said on Monday that he had seen the report and summarized its findings for Mr. Steinbrenner.
But Mr. Steinbrenner himself has been virtually silent on the issue.
That silence has been by design. He has bided his time, waiting to see what state and city officials will offer, associates say, trusting that Mayor Guiliani and Charles Gargano, New York State's economic development chief, will deliver a viable plan. Embracing one site over the other could upset the leverage he has acquired by orchestrating the trans-Hudson bidding for the last decade.
Meyer S. Frucher, a former state labor negotiator and an advocate of a West Side ballpark, said that when Mr. Steinbrenner addresses the West Side recommendation, "He'll have to say something about it has to be carefully analyzed and something about how it would be financed."
Nonetheless, city and state negotiators will have to convince Mr. Steinbrenner to share the revenues he would get in Manhattan in order to help pay what will surely be a mountain of debt. Since his talks in the mid-1980's about renovating Yankee Stadium, Mr. Steinbrenner has always sought higher percentages of revenues than his lease in the Bronx provides.
In considering a ballpark for the West Side, officials are enticed by the generous cash flow generated at such new ballparks as Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore and Jacobs Field in Cleveland, which have proven immensely popular in downtown sites.
But any negotiations would likely require Mr. Steinbrenner's agreement to have stadium revenues finance part of the debt. Mr. Ferrer, a critic of Mr. Steinbrenner, scoffed at the idea that Mr. Steinbrenner would part with such revenues.
"The debt would be repaid by the stadium?" he asked incredulously. "He's not even paying rent now!"
But the concept of having an owner share stadium financing is gaining currency as taxpayers increasingly resist 100 percent public financing for sports arenas.
To build a stadium in Milwaukee, the owners of the Brewers will have to contribute $90 million. A stadium to replace Candlestick Park in San Francisco will be financed privately by the Giants' owners.

HEADLINE: ECONOMY SHOWING SIGNS OF REBOUND FROM SLOW WINTER

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
Battered recently by storms and undermined for months by weak sales, the economy has been sluggish for most of the last year. But figures released today gave some tentative signs that business could improve this spring -- and that corporations' strong profits have been relatively unaffected by 1995's weakness.
The index of leading indicators, a gauge designed to spot turning points, soared 1.3 percent in February, the biggest jump in 20 years, while business inventories appear to have been drawn down enough to encourage companies to start increasing production soon. 
 "Evidence is accumulating that the economy is in the midst of a pickup," said Rosanne Cahn, an economist at CS First Boston in New York. And Kevin Flanagan, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, said that "the inventory situation should not be the drag on growth it was in 1995."
Yet analysts cautioned that it was still too early to count on growth this Presidential election year even reaching the 2 percent pace that the Commerce Department, reporting today a downward revision for the fourth quarter, finally established for 1995.
The department cut its estimate of fourth-quarter growth in the gross domestic product to a slim annual rate of five-tenths of a percent from nine-tenths of a percent. And many analysts predicted that the first quarter of 1996 might be only a little better, with estimates ranging from under 1 percent to little more than 1.5 percent.
 "An economic rebound is not yet baked in the cake," the First Union National Bank warned clients.
Analysts expressed more than the usual skepticism about the leading index and its huge advance, three-fifths of which reflected expansion of the factory workweek that dived in January because of the blizzard in the East.
But despite the doubts, many economists said that the worst might be over for now.
This combination of mild optimism and strong uncertainty have made the economy a mixed prospect as an issue in the Presidential campaign, as Clinton Administration officials search for signs of growth and Republicans deride its modest extent.
But the figures released today are likely to be reflected in another debate stirred by candidates this year -- over who is benefiting from whatever growth there is. Commerce Department figures showed that the profits of American companies grew more than twice as fast as the economy at large in 1995, jumping 11.8 percent to cap the most prosperous three-year period for corporations in about two decades.
It was the third straight year of double-digit profit gains, which reflected in part the continued layoffs at many big corporations and came despite subpar growth of the economy.
Those profits have provided the underpinning for the big surge in stock prices that were one of the factors captured by the index of leading indicators as reasons for projecting some economic quickening. The others were a slower pace of falling prices for materials particularly sensitive to the business cycle, slower deliveries from corporate suppliers, higher unfilled orders for factory durables, a larger money supply and more building permits.
The four components acting to hold the index down were less optimistic consumer expectations, more first-time claims for unemployment benefits, lower factory orders for consumer goods and a decline in contracts and orders for plant and equipment.
The Conference Board, a business research group in New York that recently took over compilation of the index from the Commerce Department, delayed until Thursday issuing companion indexes on coincident and lagging indicators. Government shutdowns this winter have delayed publication of some elements.
The main reasons that growth at the end of 1995 was even more sluggish than originally estimated were because of downward adjustments in residential fixed investment, a smaller addition to business inventories and higher imports. These factors were partly offset by an upward revision to personal spending that some analysts took as a harbinger of possibly faster growth ahead.
Consumers account for about two-thirds of gross domestic product -- half of this at retail counters and the other half in spending on such items as rent and insurance.
The department also reported that its final estimate for its price index for gross domestic purchases was raised one-tenth of a point, to a rate of 2.1 percent.
Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican who is his party's presumptive Presidential nominee, took the occasion of the G.D.P. report today to sound a theme expected to be widely heard during the campaign.
"The weakest economic growth since the last recession is disappointing but hardly surprising given President Clinton's policies of more Washington spending, more regulation and more taxes," he said.
The revised fourth-quarter growth rate meant that three of the four 1995 quarters had growth rates of under 1 percent, the other one being the 3.6 percent pace during the July-September period.
The profits figures, which were the first Government tally to be reported for the fourth quarter, were better than most analysts expected.
"Corporate profits have held up remarkably well, given that the economy slowed a lot," said Paul D. Mastroddi, an economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust. This, he added, "well explains" current stratospheric levels of the stock markets, which is often portrayed as a largely demographic phenomenon based on baby boomers reaching middle age.
But while exceeding expectations, the profit gain was just six-tenths of 1 percent for the latest quarter compared with a 9.6 percent surge in the third quarter, the Commerce Department figures showed.
In addition to fueling debate about corporate downsizing, high profits are likely to be seized upon by Democrats to bolster their contention that too little corporate prosperity these days is finding its way to ordinary workers, whose wages have lagged behind.
"Workers are getting less than their share," contended Dean Baker, an analyst for the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-oriented research group.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off Sharply Against Yen On Hint of Rate Rise in Japan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar dropped sharply against the yen yesterday after Japan's top banker suggested that the nation's rebounding economy would push up domestic interest rates, which would enhance the value of the Japanese currency.
The dollar also ended lower against the German mark and most other currencies, despite new signs of declining interest rates in Europe. In a surprise move, the Bank of Spain lowered its benchmark rate by a half a percentage point, bolstering speculation that Germany and other countries would do the same soon. 
 In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar fell to 106.91 yen from 107.57 yen on Tuesday. The dollar was quoted at 1.4824 German marks, down from 1.4827 marks. The British pound strengthened to $1.5260 from $1.5227. Traders said volumes were thin, exaggerating currency movements.
The dollar's decline against the yen came early in the trading day, after the governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasuo Matsushita, said that it was natural to assume that the rebounding Japanese economy would result in higher interest rates. The country's benchmark rate is now at a half a percent.
Although Mr. Matsushita never said rates were about to rise, his remarks were interpeted to mean that an increase may be imminent. Higher rates would increase the allure of Japanese investments and the yen needed to buy them.
"What central bankers don't realize is how much impact they can have, even when their words are obvious," said Win Thin, an international economist at HSBC Midland in New York. "The markets are jittery right now, so it was enough to get a reaction."
Others saw Mr. Matsushita's statement as an excuse to sell the dollar, which has risen substantially against the yen in recent months. They also acknowledged the central banker had not said anything new or surprising.
"Japanese rates are at half a percent now; where else are they going to go?" said Elena Shperling, a currency trader at the New York offices of Banco di Sicilia. "It's inevitable that Japanese rates will rise."
Still, she said, "this was the only thing of any excitement that happened."
Trading is expected to remain thin the rest of the week, with many financial markets in the United States and Europe closed tomorrow in observance of Good Friday.

HEADLINE: Pataki Announces $445 Million Surplus at End of Fiscal Year

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 3

 BODY:
New York State finished its fiscal year with a $445 million surplus, largely the result of lower-than-expected spending on social programs and a booming year on Wall Street, Gov. George E. Pataki said today.
The Governor said part of the surplus should go to a rainy day fund, for use when the state runs a deficit. That fund has not received a deposit since 1979. 
 The Governor said he hoped the surplus would also ease negotiations with the State Legislature over a budget for the new fiscal year.
That did not appear likely when the Legislature's top Democrat complained that Mr. Pataki had tried to keep the surplus in the $63 billion budget a secret.
Anticipating the surplus, the Governor last month proposed spending $314 million of the extra money in his budget for the fiscal year that began Monday. An additional $66 million should become part of the budget negotiations, he said.
Mr. Pataki said the remaining $65 million should be set aside in a rainy day fund.
The Governor and his budget director, Patricia Woodworth, said the investment in the rainy day fund would send a signal to Wall Street credit-rating agencies and others about the improving soundness of the state's finances.
State law requires a deposit in the rainy day fund if a surplus over a certain percentage is recorded when a fiscal year has ended, Ms. Woodworth said.
But state leaders have avoided putting money in the fund since 1979 by creating a new mechanism for setting aside income tax revenue and using the money year to year, she said.
There is $180 million in the fund now. It was tapped during state fiscal crises earlier this decade, Governor Pataki said.
The Governor said the surplus proved that his fiscal policies were working and that critics who predicted that his first budget would produce a deficit were wrong.
Speaker Sheldon Silver, the Legislature's top Democrat, said he had no position on a rainy-day-fund investment.
But he said he was angry that Mr. Pataki's staff canceled a meeting scheduled on Tuesday for aides to review the state's fiscal picture at the end of the 1995-96 budget year. Instead of consulting the Legislature on what to do with the extra money, Governor Pataki wanted to decide unilaterally where to put it, he said.
The Legislature adopted an interim budget Tuesday evening, essentially financing state services at their current level for the rest of the month as negotiations continue on the full spending plan.
Of the surplus, $270 million came in higher tax receipts than anticipated, with the balance lower spending than expected.
Taxpayer-financed spending went down by $720 million, or 2.2 percent, during the budget year. This was the largest spending decrease in five years, the Governor said.
When all expenses were counted, the state spent $63.23 billion in fiscal 1995-96, or 2.2 percent more than the previous year.

HEADLINE: Incomes and Spending Advanced in February

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
Americans' incomes rose in February as milder weather let workers put in more hours on the job -- and encouraged them to spend more freely on automobiles and other big-ticket items.
Personal income increased at an annual rate of eight-tenths of 1 percent during the month, the biggest rise in 13 months, while spending rose at a 1.1 percent pace, the largest gain in two years, the Commerce Department said today. 
 When March figures are released, "my guess is we'll see a significant slowdown," said David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. Mr. Wyss said the economy was growing at only a 2 percent to 3 percent annual pace, not as rapid as February's advances in income and spending might suggest.
Some analysts say the increase in spending may have also been helped by faster processing of individual income tax refunds. Still, high levels of household debt and rising loan delinquencies will probably put a damper on consumer spending, and the overall economy, in the months ahead. Income growth has been sluggish since the last recession in 1991.
"I just don't see the economy roaring back," said Joe Blalock, an economist at America's Community Bankers. "The risk is still on the downside; the risk is still toward recession."
That was highlighted in a separate Commerce Department report, which showed that orders placed with United States factories declined 1.4 percent in February for the second consecutive month as demand for commercial aircraft hit a lull. Outside of the volatile category of aircraft and other transportation equipment, though, orders increased two-tenths of 1 percent in February, a sign of limited strength, namely in industrial machinery, computers and primary metals.
In heavy industry, the chances of a robust turnaround seem remote. More recent figures for March, published Monday by the National Association of Purchasing Management, suggested that factory activity remained sluggish last month.
During February, the economy recovered from an Atlantic Coast blizzard and added 705,000 jobs, the largest increase in 12 1/2 years. Additionally, average weekly earnings climbed to $401.93 during the month from $392.94 in January as businesses reopened. The average workweek rebounded to 34.5 hours, from 33.7 hours in January.
As a result, private industry wages and salaries increased $34.8 billion in February after falling $10.5 billion in January, the Commerce Department said in today's report.
Retail sales, meanwhile, increased eight-tenths of a percent in February as consumers in storm-ravaged states dug out from snow drifts and returned to their daily routines.
Demand for autos and trucks was strong, and accounted for most of the increase in February spending, the Government said in today's report.
Sales of previously owned homes posted a gain as well, according to real estate industry figures.
Before today's report, analysts had anticipated an increase of eight-tenths of 1 percent in both personal income and spending for February.
The Commerce Department also said disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased seven-tenths of a percent in February, while the savings rate rose to 4.8 percent during the month.
Additionally, consumers' interest payments to businesses -- counted separately from overall spending figures -- increased by 1 percent during February.
In January, incomes rose one-tenth of 1 percent, the same as previously reported, while spending decreased a revised four-tenths of a percent, initially reported as a loss of half a percent.

HEADLINE: AT&T Net Service to Include Compuserve Access

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
AT&T Worldnet Services confirmed yesterday that it would offer its Internet customers access to the Compuserve Information Service at a discount, beginning this summer. The alliance, which was forged last month, is similar to a deal that AT&T struck with America Online on March 11.
The agreement means that AT&T will be able to offer its customers not just a computer connection to the often chaotic Internet, but also an option to tap into organized pools of information and entertainment services assembled by the world's two largest on-line services. 
 Compuserve, with more than 4.5 million subscribers, is the world's second-largest on-line service behind America Online, which has more than 5.5 million subscribers. Neither Compuserve nor America Online has said what the discounted rate for Worldnet customers would be. Both companies charge about $10 a month for basic access to their on-line services, and $2.95 an hour for extended service.
AT&T Worldnet Services said in February that it intended to offer unlimited Internet access to the phone company's 90 million long-distance customers -- at least, those who have computers and modems -- for $19.95 a month. More than 350,000 people have requested the computer software needed to gain access to the Internet through AT&T, and the phone company has not been able to keep up with demand.
For Compuserve, a unit of H & R Block Inc., the alliance with AT&T is a chance to reach millions of new subscribers. The software needed to tap into Compuserve's information service from AT&T is expected to be included with the software AT&T sends to its Internet customers.
"AT&T is a low-cost provider of network services, which are subject to economies of scale," said Mary A. Modahl, director of new media research at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "Smaller network providers aren't going to be able to compete with them. It makes sense for AOL and Compuserve to offer their services through AT&T at a discount, because for them, network operations are a substantial cost."
For AT&T Worldnet Services, the alliances with Compuserve and America Online set it apart from other Internet access competitors that can provide only an Internet dial tone. AT&T said it would eventually add other services beyond Compuserve and America Online.
Similarly, Compuserve said yesterday that it would explore alliances with other large Internet access providers. AT&T's rivals include MCI and Sprint, as well as the regional Bell companies, cable TV operators, and other telecommunications companies.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Prices Slump

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices slumped in light trading yesterday after Government data on consumer spending and manufacturers orders pointed to an economic pickup.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32, to a price of 91 30/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.62 percent, from 6.59 percent on Tuesday. 
 The market was weighed down at the opening by overnight selling of Treasury securities in Asia and Europe that came after comments by a Bank of Japan official suggested that interest rates in Japan would rise. The Bank of Japan official, Yasuo Matsushita, said in a speech to business executives that rising Japanese interest rates were natural in an economic recovery, and that Japanese interest rates needed to be in line with the real economic situation and prospects. Analysts said the remarks might have worried investors that the spread in yields between United States and Japanese debt securities would narrow and cause some Japanese investors to liquidate some of their Treasury holdings.
Bond prices sagged further after data on February personal income and spending data were released by the Commerce Department. Personal income increased at an annual rate of eigh-tenths of 1 percent, matching expectations, while spending rose 1.1 percent, exceeding expectations.
The strength seen in consumer spending was echoed by a separate report on factory orders. While orders over all were down 1.4 percent, when the volatile category of aircraft and transportation equipment was excluded, orders rose two-tenths of 1 percent. The report concerned market participants because they suggested that the Federal Reserve would have no reason to lower short-term interest rates anytime soon.
The market yesterday was also anticipating a coupon pass by the Federal Reserve Bank. Many analysts have been predicting a coupon pass ahead of the April 15 income tax deadline. The Fed did not enter the market yesterday but some market participants are anticipating that they may today.
A coupon pass occurs when the Fed comes to the market to buy certain maturities in order to add cash to the banking system. While it is not a signal of any change in monetary policy, traders say, the coupon pass presents dealers with an opportunity to sell Treasury securities to a ready buyer.
The market, still smarting from a selloff prompted by February's surprisingly strong employment report, is awaiting tomorrow's release of the employment report for March.
Still, there may not be any surprises for the market.
"I think the bond market is adjusting to a new thought process regarding interest rates," said Charles Roden, managing director Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. "I think dealers and traders are starting to factor in that long-term rates have seen their lows, and focusing on the possiblity of the yield on the long bond breaking over 7 percent." He said short-erm rates had probably seen their low points as well.
"The only thing that would change our view," Mr. Roden said, "would be a real proven downturn in the economy. Anticipation of any downturn is being dissappated. And I think that what has been bothering us all along has been the downsizing of business, and even that seems to losing its effect on the market."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Thinking the unthinkable: Raise the Federal minimum wage.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE ritual pre-election debate over the Federal minimum wage has begun, with Democrats reminding blue-collar workers where their bread is buttered and Republicans countering with tears over the tragedy of pricing inner-city youths out of the job market.
The Republicans can count on support from mainstream economists, who are trained from birth to disapprove of the use of any form of price regulation -- rent control, farm supports, protective tariffs, whatever -- to redistribute income. But this time around, those who pay attention to nuance will notice a waning sense of conviction. 
 Indeed, some very well-trained economists are thinking the unthinkable. "All means of redistributing income create distortions," explains Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard. In the best of possible worlds, he suggests "you'd probably want to use a little of each."
For liberal Democrats -- and, presumably, most Americans -- the minimum wage is a matter of common sense. People who work full time, the reasoning goes, should live on the right side of the poverty line. And by that logic, the current rate of $4.25 an hour is hardly sufficient.
For conservatives and almost everybody else who took Econ. 101 in college, raising the minimum wage represents a perilous step down the slippery slope of price regulation. Of course the working poor deserve better. But the minimum wage distorts price signals in the free market, creating inappropriate incentives to replace workers with machines, tilting production away from goods made with relatively large amounts of unskilled labor and denying entry-level jobs to the marginally employable.
Ned Gramlich, an economist at the University of Michigan, provided the icing for this free-market cake more than a decade ago. Many of the beneficiaries of the minimum wage, he found, were middle class, not poor. A substantial number were second earners in financially comfortable households or students who did not need the money to get by.
Of course politics, not economics, has always driven the policy outcome. And as the country moved to the right, the power of interest groups favoring a higher minimum -- notably organized labor -- has waned. Why, then, has President Clinton chosen to make an issue of it, pressing Republicans for an on-the-record vote?
One answer is that job insecurity has made $15-an-hour workers more sensitive to the plight of the proletariat. But there is also a growing sense among more pragmatic policy wonks that the advantages of interfering with market wages may outweigh the disadvantages.
A prime source of this revisionism is the research of David Card of Princeton University and Alan Krueger, now the chief economist at the Department of Labor. They used an increase in the New Jersey minimum wage to test the impact on employment among fast-food workers. And to their surprise, they found no effect at all.
This result produced a backlash from economists who found fault with their methods. In his own defense, though, Mr. Card notes that "there's been a presumption that the employment response to the minimum wage was large but that isn't supported by the standard evidence."
Mr. Katz more or less agrees. While he doubts that a higher Federal minimum would have no employment effect, he expects that it would be very modest. "The costs to employers are lower than people think," he said, because a higher minimum tends to reduce labor turnover and improve the morale (and hence the productivity) of low-wage workers.
And what of Mr. Gramlich's findings that many of the beneficiaries are students working to buy cars or clothes? Mr. Card does not dispute the conclusion but does point out that the minimum wage remains a potent weapon against poverty. "Half of the minimum-wage workers," he says, "provide at least half their family's income."
This fact would still be unlikely to change many minds, were it not for the deepening pessimism that a rising economic tide driven by market forces would carry all boats. The gap between the wages of skilled and unskilled workers has been widening for two decades, and there is little reason to believe the trend is abating. By the same token, budget deficits and antitax fervor make any direct assault on poverty unlikely.
Hence the political virtue of a higher minimum wage. It works like a tax, increasing the price of goods and services, "but it doesn't look like a tax," Mr. Katz said.
The good news, from the liberal perspective, is that the idea of raising the minimum wage is gaining credibility among the chattering classes. The bad news is that the change is reluctant. "We're thinking of doing something we know is wrong because we have nothing better to do," said Dan Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas.

HEADLINE: Recalling Dodgers' Flight, Mayor Makes His Pitch for New Stadium

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Recalling how New York City lost the Dodgers after a previous mayor refused to help the team build a new baseball stadium in Brooklyn, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has begun to offer the economic justification -- and with it the political one -- for building the Yankees a new home on the West Side of Manhattan.
In news conferences on Tuesday and again yesterday, Mr. Giuliani said that while he felt an emotional bond with Yankee Stadium dating to his boyhood memories of Yankee heroes, the city had to do all it could to insure that the team's owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, does not move the team to New Jersey or anywhere else. 
 To do that, the Mayor is touting a proposal to build a new stadium above the rail yards beside the Hudson River, just south of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. On Tuesday, Mr. Giuliani said that revenue from a West Side stadium would be so high it "would be off the charts." Yesterday he said the city could not afford to repeat the mistakes of the past, ignoring the desires of one of the city's most valuable assets.
"It's also my responsibility to do the best that I can to make certain the Yankees stay in New York City." Mr. Giuliani said yesterday. "And that if, in fact, they are determined to leave the Bronx, that we not lose them to New Jersey, Tampa or someplace else."
No one has come right out and said Mr. Steinbrenner's Yankees plan to abandon their nostalgia-soaked 73-year-old stadium. But in his carefully measured remarks, the Mayor has made it clearer than ever that such a move is a distinct possibility and that the city had to have what he called "a fall-back strategy," namely a new stadium in Manhattan.
The Mayor has come to this point in the city's elaborate dance with the Yankees because Mr. Steinbrenner has made his displeasure with his team's current home clear, having already rejected several proposals over the last few years to renovate or rebuild Yankee Stadium. It is a dance like those that have been wrenching other cities desperate to keep or lure professional sports franchises, from Cleveland to San Francisco.
For now, all the participants seem determined to keep their options open to insure a strong negotiating position. Mr. Steinbrenner has suggested he would move the team to New Jersey if the city and state did not meet his demands. No one, it seems, wants to be the first to say the Yankees will leave the Bronx, even as signs increasingly point to a proposal for a new stadium.
For Mr. Giuliani, the stakes are extremely high. No mayor wants to preside over the loss of a major sports team, and the Yankees carry enormous cultural, economic and psychological significance for a city that lost not only the Dodgers and the Giants in baseball, but also the Jets and the Giants in football.
The Mayor, a Republican who has vowed to restore jobs and economic vitality to the city, showed how well he understood the stakes yesterday. He reminded reporters that the Dodgers moved out of Brooklyn in 1957 after Mayor Robert F. Wagner failed to help clear the way for a new stadium at the rail yards at Atlantic and Flatbush avenues in Brooklyn.
The team's owner, Walter O'Malley, had asked the city to condemn the property, but even though an authority was created to finance a stadium to replace Ebbets Field, the plan stalled. Mr. O'Malley then moved the team to Los Angeles, although speculation endures to this day that Mr. O'Malley was determined to relocate to the West Coast all along.
"That loss for Brooklyn was catastrophic," Mr. Giuliani said. "It has recovered now from it, I hope, but it went through an awful lot of very, very difficult time as a result of that. I don't want to see that happen."
The idea, floated a couple of years ago, for a new stadium in Manhattan has gained momentum with the completion of a report by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum of Kansas City, Mo., that was commissioned last fall by the city and state and by Mr. Steinbrenner.
The consultant studied the economic viability of four possible locations for the Yankees' home, including the rail yards of Manhattan, the current stadium and two other sites in the Bronx: Van Cortlandt Park and Pelham Bay Park.
While the report has not yet been made public, an administration official and a mayoral adviser both said yesterday that it offered the strongest argument for a West Side stadium, followed by rebuilding Yankee Stadium, while rejecting the other two.
The adviser, who insisted on condition of anonymity because of the secrecy surrounding the negotiations, said the proposal for the West Side would create "the pre-eminent sports venue in the world," with a retractable dome and the sort of amenities found in other new stadiums, like Camden Yards in Baltimore and Jacobs Field in Cleveland.
Mr. Steinbrenner, who had said a decision on a new home would be made this spring, has remained silent on the proposals, but the administration official said the owner took the consultant's findings seriously. "He values their advice," the official said.
Keeping the Yankees from moving out of the city, even if they left the Bronx, would surely win the Mayor political points, at least in some parts of the city. A new stadium would generate hundreds of new construction jobs in Manhattan and provide an economic stimulus to developers on the West Side.
At the same time, there are political risks. A new stadium would cost taxpayers money, not only for the financing of a new stadium, but also for the associated street improvements, and so forth, at a time the city and state are tightening their budgetary belts. One person familiar with the report said the new stadium would cost at least $800 million.
The Mayor's remarks have already prompted an outcry from two Borough Presidents, Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx and Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, both Democrats and potential mayoral challengers, who denounced what they called a wasteful proposal.
"At a time when you have schools that are crumbling, to spend $1 billion on baseball is nothing short of obscene," Mr. Ferrer said.
Mr. Ferrer joined City Councilman Israel Ruiz Jr. yesterday on the steps of City Hall to accuse the Mayor of pandering to Mr. Steinbrenner's desire to leave the Bronx, primarily, they said, because of its large number of black and Hispanic residents.
That prompted Mr. Steinbrenner's only public comment on the issue yesterday. "All this public relations bluster by Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Ruiz has been counterproductive," he said in a written statement.

HEADLINE: CRASH IN THE BALKANS: THE POLICY;
A Role as Nation's Chief Salesman Abroad

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown was in the Balkans in his self-assigned role as the nation's salesman in chief, seeking profitable opportunities for American businesses abroad and making the case that economic power should be a cornerstone of American foreign policy.
It was a generally successful strategy that allowed Mr. Brown to portray himself as a champion of American business interests the world over, and provided him a potent defense against Republicans in Congress who sought to eliminate his department on the grounds that it cost too much and gave government too active a role in the economy. 
 But at times, the strategy also put Mr. Brown in conflict with the State Department, which sometimes took a dim view of his faith in economic power as a lever on other issues, especially in China.
His trip to Bosnia and Croatia was intended to introduce a dozen big American companies to opportunities likely to grow out of the $5 billion international plan being drawn up to repair power plants, water treatment facilities, oil and gas pipelines, buildings, roads and bridges in the Balkans.
With an eye to protecting American jobs, Mr. Brown also planned to press the Croatian Government to reconsider its decision last month to buy 18 jetliners from the European Airbus consortium, and to buy the planes instead from the Boeing Company of Seattle.
The head of Boeing's aircraft group, Ronald Woodward, was among those accompanying Mr. Brown on part of his trip, although he was not on the Boeing-built plane that crashed with Mr. Brown and 32 other people on board.
Acting as a door-opener for corporations and using American clout to their benefit became Mr. Brown's hallmark.
Within the Administration, he was the prime supporter of adopting a role long played by other big industrial nations on behalf of their companies, that of using political influence to help corporations win public contracts or the right to invest, especially in fast-growing emerging markets in Asia and Latin America.
But Mr. Brown's vision of his job went beyond helping American business. In China Mr. Brown championed the much-debated idea that "commercial engagement" would influence Beijing on human rights and nuclear proliferation, among other issues.
From South Africa to Northern Ireland and the Middle East, Mr. Brown asserted that helping American business contribute to economic reform and growth would help foster peace, social stability and democracy.
Speaking about Bosnia on Tuesday in Paris, Mr. Brown said, "Peace and stability will only be assured through economic development."
C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, a research group in Washington, said Mr. Brown had given the Commerce Department a more influential role in foreign policy than any time except perhaps during the Nixon Administration, when the United States adopted a policy of increasing its trade with the Soviet Union.
"Under the policies that Ron Brown pursued, no one felt that the economic payoff would come immediately or would keep anyone from shooting at each other this year," Mr. Bergsten said. "But it was seen as an important factor in the long run in keeping these trouble spots from festering and coming back to haunt you again and again while at the same time having a payoff for American business."
Mr. Brown's policies won him widespread support in the business community, which traditionally viewed Democratic administrations with suspicion. A few critics accused Mr. Brown of giving preference to companies that supported the Democratic Party when he put together delegations to visit foreign countries, a suggestion he denied.
The business community applauded Mr. Brown's focus on helping provide entree for American companies to fast-growing developing markets, where the competition among industrial nations and their industries is particularly intense but where permission to invest and conduct trade requires political backing as well as business acumen.
"He appreciated the need for the Federal Government to play a very aggressive role in breaking down formal and informal trade barriers abroad," said Rob Liberatore, the vice president for Washington affairs at the Chrysler Corporation, whose chief executive, Robert Eaton, has traveled with Mr. Brown to China in an attempt to establish a foothold in that market. "It's a refreshing change in the U.S. Government because everyone else in the world does it, and it makes a difference."
Business executives said Mr. Brown worked hard to put them in contact with high-level officials in foreign governments, to clear away red tape, and to impress foreign governments that the United States was putting its political influence to work on behalf of its business interests.
"This Administration, mostly driven by the initiatives of Ron Brown, has been focused on making American industry a more successful source of high-technology business to the world than in the past," said Bernard Schwartz, the chairman of the Loral Corporation, a military electronics and telecommunications company.
"I'm sure the President will continue the policy," said Mr. Schwartz, who is a big financial supporter of the Democratic Party. "But a large part of the success of the policy has been attributable to Brown, and I hope the President will be able to find a replacement who will be as forceful and effective as Brown was."

HEADLINE: U.S. Offers Data to Link Sudan to Plot

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 3

 BODY:
Pressing a divided Security Council for tough sanctions against the Sudan, the Clinton Administration presented evidence for the first time today that it said directly implicated the Sudanese Government in the attempted assassination of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt by Islamic militants.
The attack by the militants, apparently all Egyptian, took place last June 26 in Ethiopia, which says that the neighboring Sudan has been harboring three fugitive assailants. Ethiopia has demanded action from the United Nations on the matter. 
 Five other attackers were killed during or after the attack on Mr. Mubarak in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. Three were captured and are already on trial there. The Egyptian leader was not hurt in the shooting.
Today, Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States representative, who is arguing for stronger action than Egypt now seems willing to support, told Council members that Sudanese officials had known for two years that Egyptian militants based in Khartoum were plotting to kill Mr. Mubarak but did nothing to stop them.
She also said the Egyptian militants of the Islamic Group had traveled freely between the Sudan and Ethiopia during that period, using Sudanese travel documents on at least one occasion, and had shipped weapons for the operation from Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, on Sudan Airways.
"We also have just learned," another American official said after the Council session, "that one of the three suspects has recently departed Sudan, apparently with the assistance of officials, further implicating Khartoum."
The Sudan has consistently denied that it had any involvement in the attack on President Mubarak, and Sudanese officials say they do not know the whereabouts of the reputed assailants Ethiopia is seeking.
Speaking to reporters after her intelligence briefing to a closed-door council session, Ms. Albright called the Sudan a "vipers' " nest of terrorists." She said two diplomats representing the Sudan at the United Nations were directly involved in plots to bomb the organization's headquarters and to kill Mr. Mubarak in New York several years ago.
The Egyptian President has been reluctant to appear at the United Nations ever since. He missed last fall's 50th anniversary General Assembly summit meeting.
Mr. Mubarak was attacked in Addis Ababa on his way from the airport to a meeting of the Organization of African Unity. An American official said today that the Sudan's claims that its officials knew nothing about the plot were "simply not credible."
After the Security Council meeting today, Juan Somavia of Chile, the Council president for April, said members were discussing a resolution under the Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, which allows for punitive measures.
The United States had hoped for sanctions that would isolate the Sudan diplomatically -- the United States has closed its embassy in Khartoum -- and at least bar commercial flights to the country, a restriction now imposed on Libya. An arms embargo and economic sanctions would be even tougher steps, but diplomats say that these would not get Council support.
For the moment, Egypt has agreed only to diplomatic sanctions. In Cairo today, an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official said that the country was concerned that economic and military sanctions could undermine the unity of the Sudan and broader Arab world security.
Several diplomats here said that the underlying issue is a general reluctance to impose any more sanctions because of the harm they do to civilian populations and the limited success they have in changing the behavior of governments.
But the United States has some strong allies. Britain's representative on the Council, Sir John Weston, said after the meeting that the resolution now being considered was not strong enough to convey the message that the Sudan needs to hear.

Yanks Are No. 1, but Marlins' and Indians' Payrolls Soar

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The Yankees, as expected, have the largest payroll in the major leagues, slightly more than $52 million, but the Baltimore Orioles and the Atlanta Braves have higher average salaries. Furthermore, the Florida Marlins and the Cleveland Indians lead the wild swing that has occurred with the payrolls and average salaries of some clubs.
The Marlins, whose opening-day payroll rose from $23.3 million to $30 million, experienced a 54 percent leap in their average salary, from $752,000 to $1,156,903. The Indians, increasing their payroll from $35 million to $45.3 million, raised their average salary 44 percent, from $1,208,672 to $1,742,996. 
 At the other end of the salary spectrum, the Oakland Athletics and the Toronto Blue Jays have engaged in the most severe payroll slashes.
As computed by the clubs' Player Relations Committee, the average opening-day major league salary was $1,172,736. That's only 1 percent off the opening-day average for the 1994 season, $1,185,110. Salaries have fallen primarily because of the economic losses the clubs suffered as a result of the players' strike that shortened two seasons.
For the first three weeks of last season, clubs carried 28 players each. When they reduced their rosters to 25 players, dropping mostly younger, lower-paid players, the major league average salary was $1,132,751. That represented a 4.4 percent decrease from 1994, and this year's opening average is 3.5 percent higher than the 1995 figure.
The Orioles, who engaged in a hectic winter of high-priced acquisitions (Roberto Alomar, Randy Myers, David Wells), have the top average, $1,949,073, followed by the Braves' $1,843,461 and the Yankees' $1,799,633.
But the Yankees, though third in average, have the highest payroll because the calculations take into account 25-man rosters, plus players on the disabled list, which varies from team to team.
The Yankees' $52.2 million payroll, up from $46.6 million, and the Orioles' $48.7 million and the Braves' $47.9 million, dwarf the payrolls of clubs with considerably lower revenues.
Their payrolls are more than three times higher than the lowest payroll, which, like last year, belongs to Montreal. The Expos' payroll is $15.4 million and their average salary $616,420. The Kansas City Royals are next lowest at $18.5 million and $684,472.
The Athletics have slashed their payroll from $35.9 million to $19.4 million, shedding such high-salaried players as Rickey Henderson, Ruben Sierra and Dennis Eckersley. The Blue Jays' payroll plunged from $49.9 million to $28.5 million with the departure of players like Alomar, David Cone, Paul Molitor and Devon White.
Oakland's average salary has plummeted 39.7 percent, the Blue Jays' 38.5 percent. The Royals' average is down 36.3 percent and the Detroit Tigers' is off 33.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Mayor Names New Head For Agency

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani named Liliam Barrios-Paoli the new Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development yesterday, placing a trusted city administrator in charge of an agency that is trying to shed its responsibility for maintaining much of the city's low-income housing.
While Ms. Barrios-Paoli, now the Commissioner of the city's Department of Personnel, has no experience in housing, administration officials and housing advocates praised her appointment, saying the agency needed someone with her connections at City Hall. And they said that her experience in managing city agencies was also needed to steer the city out of its two-decades-long role as the landlord of last resort and to deal with dwindling Federal and state financing for housing development. 
 Officials announced late last year that the the city would no longer take over ownership and management of buildings whose owners fall behind on property taxes. The city eventually plans to turn over to new owners the nearly 5,000 homes and apartment buildings it owns and manages.
Ms. Barrios-Paoli's placement at Housing Preservation and Development also takes care of one management shift precipitated by the Mayor's announcement in January that he planned to reorganize a number of city agencies, including merging the Personnel and General Services departments. She will replace Deborah C. Wright, who was one of the administration's most-respected managers and who left the agency to run the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Corporation.
Ms. Barrios-Paoli has held a variety of management positions in city government under the administrations of Mr. Giuliani and former Mayor Edward I. Koch. In the 1980's, she was a manager in the Department of Employment, the Health and Hospitals Corporation and the Human Resources Administration. Between 1990 and 1994, she worked for two nonprofit agencies, the Literacy Volunteers of New York City and the New York City Housing Partnership, where she was vice president for education but did not deal with housing issues.
Readily admitting that she has no experience in housing issues, Ms. Barrios-Paoli said she would rely on assistance from staff members and from other administration officials whom she said she was very close to, including Paul A. Crotty, the city's Corporation Counsel and a former Commissioner of the Department Housing and Preservation Development, and Joan Malin, the Commissioner of the Department of Homeless Services.
Ms. Barrios-Paoli noted that she does, however, have a background in social services. "And I do believe that housing is probably the most important component of that," she said. "We will carry on the policies of the administration, and be compassionate, and try to house as many people as we can."
Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group that has produced more than 12,000 owner-occupied homes, said her former colleague's appointment made sense given the administration's decision to move city-owned properties into the hands of nonprofit organizations and private owners.
"In this moment in history, the management issues become the most important," she said. "The agency in many ways is the most important link between City Hall and economically distressed communities, and to get somebody who is a strong manager, who has an excellent rapport with the Mayor and also has commitment to those communities is great."

Giuliani Touts a Stadium Plan
Mayor Giuliani has begun to offer the economic justification -- and along with it the political one -- for building the Yankees a new home on the West Side of Manhattan. He is touting a proposal to build a new stadium above the rail yards beside the Hudson River. [Page A1.]
 
Police Plan Drug Offensive
The New York City Police Department is planning to throw up to 3,000 officers and weapons ranging from new computer software to hydraulic battering rams into their biggest assault ever on neighborhood drug pushers. Mayor Giuliani declared that the goal was to "come as close as we can come to crushing drug trafficking and the drug business" in the affected neighborhoods. [B1.]
 
Suicide Rule Raises Questions
The decision by a Federal appeals court striking down New York State's ban on physician-assisted suicide has raised an array of thorny questions about how to regulate the practice, and lawyers, medical ethicists and health care providers said that the State Legislature will have to fill the legal void by establishing standards and safeguards. [B1.]
 
A Roadway, Not a Highway
Anyone tempted to join the cheers for a renovated roadway on the western edge of Manhattan might want to look closer at what it is -- and is not. It is the reconstruction of a road, which will have grass and trees, a bike lane and a walkway. But the new road will not be a highway, and is unlikely to ease congestion.

HEADLINE: CRASH IN THE BALKANS: IN WASHINGTON;
Jet Crash Casts a Sudden Shadow Over Official Washington

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
At 10:30 this morning, President Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, walked into the Oval Office with the news: Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown's plane was missing in the Balkans and wreckage had been spotted. The rest was a welter of unconfirmed reports.
In that moment, a brilliant spring day turned to ashes. Minutes later, the deputy White House press secretaries, Ginny Terzano and Mary Ellen Glynn, crept into the office of their boss, Michael D. McCurry, with news service bulletins and spirited him off to the top-secret Situation Room in the basement of the West Wing. 
 By 11 A.M., Mr. Clinton was on the phone to Mr. Brown's wife, Alma, to tell her all he knew. She was home sick with the flu, not listening to radio or television, friends said, and the President's call came out of the blue.
"I want you to hear it from me first," aides said the President told her. Minutes later the President was making the rounds of the West Wing, consoling aides who were Mr. Brown's friends, and by midafternoon, he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, had arrived grim-faced at Mrs. Brown's house in Northwest Washington for a vigil.
From there, the Clintons went to the Commerce Department auditorium where the President brought hundreds of workers to their feet by repeating what he said Mrs. Brown had told him: that her husband had fought for the department and its workers, and that she hoped the President would too. Then Mr. Clinton brought a hush over the crowded room by recalling Mr. Brown's favorite passage from Scripture, Isaiah's words about how the faithful "shall mount up with wings as eagles."
"Ron Brown walked and ran and flew through life," Mr. Clinton said. "And he was a magnificent life force. And those of us who loved him will always be grateful for his friendship and his warmth."
So it went throughout the top echelons of the White House and Government, where almost everyone knew the affable Mr. Brown, one of the principal architects of the Democrats' 1992 victory.
Many had worked for him in his four-year tenure as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Mr. McCurry was his press secretary for a time; later, so was Ms. Terzano.
The deputy White House chief of staff, Harold M. Ickes, worked with Mr. Brown on the Rev. Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign in 1988, and on Mr. Clinton's in 1992. Together with Paul Tully, the political director of the Democratic National Committee who died of a heart attack at the height of the 1992 campaign, Mr. Brown was the main institutional author of Mr. Clinton's victory, and he remained the odds-on favorite to lead the President's re-election campaign until he ran afoul of investigations into his finances.
The bad news arrived even as workers were dismantling the tent in the Rose Garden where on Tuesday evening Mr. Clinton had presided over a glittering state dinner for President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of Italy. Mr. Lake was celebrating his 57th birthday, and both he and the President were aglow from five innings at opening day with the Baltimore Orioles that afternoon.
But by midmorning today, that mood had evaporated. Mr. Clinton canceled his schedule for the rest of the day, including a planned speech at the Justice Department where he was to have announced a crackdown on gang violence.
Mrs. Clinton canceled a planned appearance tonight on "Larry King Live."
As the day progressed, the West Wing was transformed by the taut, herky-jerky atmosphere of crisis, conflicting information, closed doors and tears. At the Justice Department Attorney General Janet Reno told the crowd of prosecutors gathered in the Great Hall that the President would not be coming.
"I think we should all pray at this point," Ms. Reno said, her voice trembling.
All afternoon, visitors streamed in and out of the Browns' townhouse in the Barnaby Woods neighborhood, where Mrs. Brown received them in a small room off the living room. The mourners were a cross-section of Washington's politicians and power-brokers from Senator Edward M. Kennedy to Vernon E. Jordan, the lawyer, to Mayor Marion Barry and the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor.
"Everyone was shocked," said Laura Murphy, a neighbor, longtime friend and director of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union, who shuttled to the Brown house three doors away, ferrying faxed updates from the military because Mrs. Brown did not have a fax machine.
At the Commerce Department, which has been under siege from Republican budget-cutters who want to eliminate it altogether, the scene was grim, with senior staff members trying to cope with developments that unfolded slowly on the televisions they clustered around. Because the department did not release a list of its delegation, most employees had no idea of who had been on the plane, besides Mr. Brown.
Mary Lowe Good, Undersecretary for Technology Administration, served as acting secretary, spending the day holed up in Mr. Brown's executive suite, managing the crisis. Ms. Good is the department's No. 3 official -- the post of deputy secretary is vacant -- and it was she, clearly shaken, who introduced Mr. Clinton this afternoon.
For more than an hour this morning, top Administration officials were torn by confused and conflicting reports from the scene about the status of Mr. Brown's plane. The United States Ambassador to Croatia, Peter W. Galbraith, telephoned Peter Tarnoff, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, from Dubrovnik a bit before 9 A.M. Washington time to report that Mr. Brown's plane was overdue.
Mr. Tarnoff in turn called Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who was in California, and also called Mr. Lake.
For the next hour, there was a frantic search by intelligence agencies of all possible electronic and photographic data. At one point, there was a report of a plane landing in Zagreb that might not have been a scheduled flight. Hopes rose, but they were quickly dashed.
"The plane was up, it was down -- it was awful," one White House official said.
Finally, at 10:30, there was enough solid evidence for Mr. Lake to see the President.
This afternoon, with the touch that he invariably brings to such occasions, Mr. Clinton recalled Mr. Brown in a way that reflected the way an ordinary week can dissolve into tragedy.
"When we met earlier this week, right before he left for the Balkans, he was so excited," Mr. Clinton told the Commerce employees. "Because he thought that, along with these business leaders and the other very able people from the Commerce Department on this mission, that they would be able to use the power of the American economy to help the peace take hold in the Balkans, to help people in that troubled place have the kind of decent, honorable and wonderfully ordinary lives that we Americans too often take for granted."

HEADLINE: In Ivy League, Yale Is Leader In Labor Unrest;
Old Town-Gown Hostility Confers a Dubious Honor

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
Yale always yearns to be No. 1 in the Ivy League, but a walkout by 1,100 service and maintenance workers has cemented Yale's leadership in an area it would prefer not to boast about: strikes.
When these workers began picketing in front of Woolsey Hall's Corinthian columns on March 27 , it was the start of the second strike at Yale in two months and the seventh since 1968.
Once again, the campus's calm was disrupted as strikers bellowed through megaphones, banged cowbells and shouted that the Yale bulldog was an attack dog and that Yale was out to bust the union. 
 "People are really distressed and depressed about it, and baffled, too," said Peter Brooks, chairman of Yale's humanities department. "The question everyone asks is why do there have to be so many strikes at Yale and so much unrest in labor relations?' "
The most recent strike at Columbia was a mostly painless two-day affair in 1991; Princeton's last one was in 1979 and Harvard has not had a strike since printers walked out in 1983. But at Yale, even some administrators admit their embarrassment at the record of labor trouble: a 5-day strike in 1968, a 6-week strike in 1971, a 10-week strike in 1974, a 14-week strike in 1977, another 10-week strike in 1984, and two strikes this year. And that's not to mention last fall's job action by graduate-school teaching assistants who refused to turn in grades in an unsuccessful effort to be recognized as a union.
"I don't think any university or institution has had as many strikes as Yale over the past 25 years," said Gregory Tarpinian, director of the New York-based Labor Research Association. And among private companies, only industrial giants like General Motors and Caterpillar, with dozens of factories, have had more, labor experts say.
Everyone here seems to have a theory to explain the strikes, including a deep-seated distrust between unions and the administration, aggressive labor leadership, sour town-gown relations that have taught workers to resent Yale, and an unusually effective alliance between Yale's mostly white clerical workers and its mostly minority service and maintenance employees.
On other campuses, however, there is widespread agreement that management and labor at Yale, which was first unionized in 1941 after a one-day strike, are more dug in than elsewhere.
"The union is more macho and adversarial at Yale," said a labor leader at Harvard who insisted on anonymity. One theory is that Yale's unions are more emboldened to strike because, unlike workers at other Ivy League schools, they belong to one large union, and that makes it easier to stand up to management. Bill Jaeger, director of Harvard's clerical workers' union, said that while there are labor tensions at Harvard, "Our sister union at Yale is dealing with a greater degree of hostility than we've faced."
For example, after Yale's clerical workers voted to form a union, it took the extremely bitter 10-week strike of 1984 for them to win their first contract. But Harvard's clerical workers signed their first contract in 1988 without a walkout.
"There is a vast difference between how the two schools have dealt with labor relations," said John Hoerr, who is writing a book that focuses on unionization efforts at Harvard. "Yale hired a union-busting firm that set the tone, and when you have that kind of foundation, it's hard to build a cooperative relationship. Yale had the elitist idea that management knows best and clerical workers were a bunch of giggling high school girls."
The president of Princeton's library workers' union, Robert Margolis, also drew sharp distinctions with Yale.
"Between the Yale union locals and the Yale Corporation," he said, "there's been an increasing deterioration in the basic dynamic that governs their bargaining relations. That's not the case here. At Princeton, there's an underlying confidence that we're moving in a common direction. Although we have differences over salaries and so forth, we don't feel ours are under attack, as is the case at Yale."
While the Yale strikes of decades past were mostly about wages, the current walkout has a modern theme: contracting out. Yale's demand to have the right to farm out any and all work has been rejected by Local 34 of the Federation of University Employees, representing clerical, laboratory and technical workers, and Local 35, representing dining-hall, service and maintenance employees.
After a four-week strike to protest Yale's demands, about 1,300 clerical and technical workers went back to work in early March. Now, in what union officials call a tag-team effort, the service and maintenance workers' local has begun its own walkout, shutting down the university's dining halls.
To many Yale administrators, there is one overriding explanation for the strikes: a militant union has concluded that taking to the streets is a sure-fire way to win at the bargaining table.
 
'In the Past, Turmoil Has Paid Off'
"The union has been able to survive by saying this is a horrible place to work," said Peter D. Vallone, Yale's associate vice president for administration. "The union realizes that if it disrupts and embarrasses Yale, it's to their advantage. In the past, turmoil has paid off for them, and they see no reason not to continue it."
Mr. Vallone said the union's militancy has paid off so well that its members' wages are second to none in the Ivy League, while their benefits, both sides agree, are the highest.
Union officials, however, point out that clerical wages at Harvard are 10 to 15 percent higher than at Yale, and they offer a far different explanation for the strikes. Yale, they say, is an aloof, patrician university that treats its workers with disdain. They complain that even though Yale's endowment grew by 16 percent last year to $4.5 billion, the school is seeking to mimic corporate America and squeeze its workers.
"We can't let the university dictate to us that they are in economic hard times and we have to take concessions," said Robert Proto, president of the service and maintenance workers' local. "When you hold your ground against the university, they say you're radical and militant. We say we're just defending living standards for the workers of New Haven."
An intense man of 35, Mr. Proto remembers picketing as an 11-year-old with his father, then a Yale plumber, during the 1971 strike. The union won a 30-percent wage increase over three years after persuading students and such luminaries as Cesar Chavez and A. Philip Randolph to picket alongside the workers.
One factor that has emboldened the union is that it can count on the support of New Haven residents and members of other local unions, who view Yale not just as a font of wealth amid poverty but also a giant employer with the power to set wage trends throughout the city.
Richard Levin, Yale's president, said that because Yale, unlike Harvard and Columbia, is by far the largest employer in its area, it is a convenient target. Labor leaders also know, Mr. Levin said, that New Haven's news organizations will cover every step they take because Yale is so important locally.
 
Town-Gown Rancor Unseen at Princeton
Princeton is also by far the largest employer in its hometown, but with Johnson & Johnson and the state capital nearby, it does not dominate the local economy the way Yale does. Nor does Princeton have the same town-gown, blue-collar-versus-blue-blood rancor as Yale, partly because the town of Princeton is far wealthier than New Haven.
Labor experts who have analyzed Yale's unusual history say no institution could have so many strikes unless there was a fundamental distrust between the two sides.
A prime example of such distrust is how the union views Yale's promise to guarantee the jobs and wages of all service and maintenance workers during the proposed four-year contract in exchange for the right to contract out.
The university says this is an unusually generous pledge intended to assure workers that subcontracting will not hurt them. But several union leaders see this promise as a trick to lull them into accepting widespread contracting out. They fear that at the end of four years Yale will have contracted so much work that it will lay off most employees, thereby fatally weakening the union.
"This is not a lifetime contract," said Deborah Chernoff, a union official. "It's a guarantee for just four years. People are worried that four years from now Yale will say subcontracting has worked so well they're going to subcontract all custodial work and the dining hall service."
The university insists all it wants to do is contract out bits and pieces like painting, vehicle repair and perhaps having Domino's run a pizza shop to supplement the dining hall. Mr. Vallone asserts that it does not make economic sense to use Yale's unionized workers to do all the painting the school needs, when those painters earn $17 an hour plus benefits: far more than subcontractors would pay nonunion workers.
"We're willing to trade off unprecedented job security for getting the ability to get the job done," said Mr. Vallone. "It's not about busting the union. How can you address their paranoia?"
Yale is eager to bring in Dominos Pizza or other fast-food companies to meet student demands for new dining options. But the union asserts that if Yale contracts out with companies like Domino's, those companies will provide new workers not the $11-an-hour, year-round jobs with full benefits that Yale offers, but $7-an-hour jobs with no benefits for just the 35 weeks school is in session. That, the union says, will cut annual pay from $23,000 to $10,000.
Such a strategy, union officials say, will undercut Yale's much-praised strategy to revive New Haven by, for example, helping finance mortgages for Yale employees who buy homes in the city.
"The most important thing Yale can do to help New Haven is to provide quality jobs with benefits to people living in the city," said Laura Smith, president of the clerical workers' local. "It's one thing they won't do. It is trying to replace good union jobs with poverty-wage jobs with no benefits."
President Levin disagreed. "The very idea that we would want to pauperize New Haven, it's completely contrary to everything we're doing," he said. "It's not credible on its face."

HEADLINE: Too Close for Comfort?;
Inquiry Touches Money Laundering Expert's Backer

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
Charles A. Intriago is one of the nation's most trusted chroniclers of the war on money laundering. Through his Money Laundering Alert, the 54-year-old lawyer has befriended leaders of the crackdown on financial skulduggery by drug lords and tax evaders, citing them in his newsletter, inviting them to speak at his conferences and gossiping with them on the phone.
His editorial board of advisers is a roster of former top American Government officials and bank regulators, including Jo Ann S. Barefoot, a former Deputy Comptroller of the Currency, and Robert E. Powis, a former Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary. He himself once served as special counsel on organized crime to then-Gov. Reubin O. Askew of Florida, and he prosecuted white-collar criminals as an assistant United States attorney in Miami. His expertise on money laundering has made him an oft-quoted source in newspapers. 
 But now, Mr. Intriago finds himself in an uncomfortable position for such a high-profile authority on money laundering: defending his close relationship with Orlando Castro Llanes, a banker who is now under investigation for money laundering in both the United States and his native Venezuela, and who was charged late last year by the Venezuelan authorities with bank fraud, embezzlement and conspiracy.
[Mr. Castro, his son and grandson were taken into custody on Wednesday morning by the Dade County, Fla., authorities, acting on behalf of District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan, on charges of grand larceny, according to Richard Sharpstein, a lawyer acting for Mr. Castro. He said the New York authorities were seeking his clients' extradition to New York. Mr. Morgenthau's office said only that it would make an announcement on Thursday.]
In addition, the Federal Reserve Board is investigating Mr. Castro, along with several Venezuelan banks and companies that his family formerly controlled, including Banco Progreso and Banco Republica, according to a former Customs official and other people who were questioned recently by the Fed, the District Attorney's office and foreign officials. But the Fed delayed a civil action that it had planned to announce with Mr. Morgenthau. It declined to comment.
Mr. Castro, who is in his mid-60's, was the original backer for Mr. Intriago's company, Alert International Inc. of Miami, and has been his law client for 16 years. In recent years, that has involved Mr. Intriago's defending his client against the inquiries of investigators. After American Customs agents subpoenaed and froze several of Banco Progreso's accounts at the midtown Manhattan branch of BankAmerica International for suspected money laundering in March 1991, Mr. Intriago persuaded a Federal court to halt the investigation and unfreeze the accounts.
Mr. Morgenthau's office and Customs Service investigators are looking into the circumstances under which the investigation was stopped.
By his own admission, Mr. Intriago chose not to go to the authorities in 1993 and 1994 with material that his own investigator said contained evidence strongly suggesting large-scale money laundering at Mr. Castro's Banco Progreso. But Mr. Intriago, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing, dismissed the investigator's conclusions and said the material showed no such thing.
The evidence had been gathered by Richard Lucas, a former I.R.S. agent specializing in accounting fraud and money laundering. He had been hired by Mr. Intriago to unearth information that would help Mr. Castro in the wake of the Customs Service inquiry in New York, as well as to look into a possible smear campaign against him.
As part of that investigation, Mr. Lucas documented what he considered to be suspicious transfers of as much as $3 billion to and from Progreso accounts at the New York office of Banco Atlantico, a bank based in Madrid, between 1991 and 1994. An investigator provided The New York Times with copies of Mr. Lucas's records, which he said he had obtained in Caracas.
"The Manhattan District Attorney is looking into those accounts," said Sheila M. Donovan, a senior executive at Banco Atlantico, adding, "We are cooperating."
In a letter from his own lawyer, Parker D. Thomson, Mr. Intriago justified his decision not to disclose Mr. Lucas's findings to American authorities on the grounds that they were an "attorney work product, privileged and confidential." Besides, he added, he had determined that Mr. Lucas's "conclusions are fundamentally flawed" and therefore did not amount to evidence of wrongdoing.
Mr. Intriago also said that Mr. Lucas had been accused of "appropriating" the records belonging to Mr. Castro and "selling" them to Thor L. Halvorssen, a Venezuelan businessman who was the country's antidrug czar with the rank of ambassador from 1989 to 1994. Mr. Halvorssen gave them to American investigators, according to the letter. Mr. Lucas has maintained that the records are the property of the Government of Venezuela because it has taken over the bank.
In an interview arranged by Mr. Intriago in Miami late in March, Mr. Castro, dressed in a designer blouson jacket and silk necktie, dismissed the Venezuelan charges against him and the American investigations as the fruits of a political conspiracy by his enemies. Chief among them, he said, is Mr. Halvorssen, with whom he has been feuding ever since the two men were on opposite sides of a corporate takeover battle in Venezuela five years ago.
Mr. Intriago makes no apologies for his dealings with Mr. Castro. "I would be the first to run away from any linkage to anyone who would not meet my standards of integrity," he said in an interview. He said Mr. Castro had been persecuted in Venezuela because he was born in Cuba. His enemies in the Venezuelan Government, he said. "have been trying for years to destroy this man. He's not one of them. He's like the Jew to the Nazis."
A multibillion-dollar illegal industry, money laundering disguises the proceeds of drug trafficking and other illicit enterprises by funneling them through a maze of financial conduits. As governments have enacted new laws and banking regulations to curtail the practice, launderers have become increasingly sophisticated about avoiding detection.
Mr. Intriago met Mr. Castro in 1980 after a long career in government. The Venezuelan banker soon became his client, and Mr. Intriago socialized with his family, even vacationing with his son, Orlando Castro Castro.
The friendship helped both men in their business careers. When Mr. Intriago decided to start his newsletter in 1989, Mr. Castro provided $80,000 for a 15 percent interest in the partnership, while Mr. Intriago invested about $20,000. Three years later, the partnership bought Mr. Castro's share for an undisclosed sum, according to Mr. Intriago's lawyer.
Since he started Money Laundering Alert, Mr. Intriago has built a circulation of several hundred subscribers, mostly in government and banking. The newsletter has not written about Mr. Castro.
Mr. Castro has profited from the friendship, too. Mr. Intriago, who has been a big contributor to the Democratic Party, got the help of Charles (Bud) Stack, the Florida fund raiser for the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign, to set up a White House meeting with President Clinton for Mr. Castro. Mr. Castro and his supporters in Caracas have used a photograph of that occasion, which has been reproduced in Venezuelan newspapers, to back their contention that Mr. Castro has friends in high places.
Mr. Intriago's defense of his activities as the exercise of his professional responsibilities has plenty of support in the legal community. "The government is now much more willing to believe that lawyers for the people and institutions under investigation are attempting to obstruct justice when in fact they are just trying to represent their clients in good faith," said Aaron R. Marcu, a partner at Howard Darby & Levin, a New York law firm, who specializes in white-collar defense law.
Mr. Castro's problems worsened at the end of 1994. The Venezuelan Government had to intervene to prevent the collapse of the nation's banking system. This led to its seizure of Banco Progreso in December 1994 and the departure of Mr. Castro and his family for Miami. Ten months later, in October 1995, Mr. Castro was charged in Caracas in absentia with bank fraud, embezzlement and conspiracy. A senior Venezuelan official said his Government will seek Mr. Castro's extradition from Miami.
There are further Venezuelan Government charges pending against Mr. Castro, including some relating to the possible misappropriation of more than $300 million of public money used to prop up Banco Progreso, according to Joaquim F. Chaffardet, a deputy and chief investigator for Venezuela's Solicitor General.
In this country, some of the most damning evidence against Mr. Castro originated, paradoxically, in Mr. Intriago's effort to clear him of suspicion by hiring Philip Manuel Resource Group of private investigators, for which Mr. Lucas worked.
Mr. Lucas's analysis of the records suggested money-laundering took place through Banco Progreso's extraordinarily active account at Banco Atlantico in New York. These are the main points of his report:
*The transactions lacked economic sense. Many of the banks and money changers funneling money to Banco Progreso's account at Banco Atlantico's New York office could have been done much more cheaply by other means. For example, several Venezuelan banks that used this route, including Banco Latino, the most active mover of funds, had their own offices in the United States.
*Records of the sources and destination of the funds were kept only in Caracas and were not available to American authorities.
*The volume of the transactions was out of proportion to Banco Progreso's size -- an estimated $3 billion over three years for the No. 12 bank in Venezuela.
*The bank statements are in code, with many transactions difficult to decipher.
*Ordinarily, any foreign bank doing that volume of business in the United States would open an American office. Yet Banco Progreso never attempted to do so.
*Mr. Castro was neither an officer nor a director of this bank, an apparent attempt to isolate him from its activities, even though he was generally understood to control the bank.
Venezuelan authorities say they are aware of Mr. Lucas's reports, but they did not comment on whether they are using them as evidence in their investigation.
Mr. Intriago, in his lawyer's letter, contended Mr. Lucas's analysis was faulty because it failed to take account of the flight out of the troubled Venezuelan currency into the dollar.
[Late on Wednesday, Mr. Intriago said Mr. Lucas "never argued that the matter should be taken to the authorities," and added that he himself had never before seen all the conclusions that Mr. Lucas had drawn.]
Mr. Castro and Mr. Halvorssen have sued each other in Federal court in Florida, with Mr. Castro contending that Mr. Halvorssen has defamed him, and Mr. Halvorssen saying that Mr. Castro arranged to have him incarcerated and beaten in Caracas. Mr. Halvorssen denied he is carrying out a vendetta against Mr. Castro.
For his part, Mr. Intriago has his defenders.
"I know him to be an extremely competent attorney, and he has built the best newsletter in that field," said Tom V. Cash, a managing director at the Miami office of Kroll Associates, a firm of private investigators.
G. Robert Blakey, a former Justice Department official who is on Alert's board, recalled how he and Mr. Intriago drafted Florida's anti-racketeering law, known as RICO.
As Mr. Intriago "was doing this, he got very interested in RICO, and then in money laundering," Mr. Blakey said. "I would be shocked if he was caught with his hand in the cookie jar."

HEADLINE: CRASH IN THE BALKANS: The Lives Broken Off;
Nathaniel C. Nash, 44, Reporter for The Times

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Nathaniel Cushing Nash, the Frankfurt bureau chief of The New York Times, was on board the plane that crashed in Croatia yesterday. The 44-year-old reporter has spent more than half his life at The Times.
Mr. Nash, who joined The Times as a copyboy after his graduation from Harvard in 1973, has been a bundle of gentle anomalies: a passionate student of the Bible and part-time missionary with a wicked backhand and a taste for fine wine and a talented reporter who was so accommodating and efficient in his first years on the paper that he had trouble convincing his superiors that he could handle the rough and tumble of reporting. 
 How well he succeeded became apparent yesterday when Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of The New York Times, expressed fear that Mr. Nash was the first Times reporter to die while covering a story since World War II. He hailed him as "a colleague known as much for his gentleness of spirit as for his keen journalistic abilities."
The newspaper's executive editor, Joseph Lelyveld, echoed the sentiment, describing Mr. Nash as "an unusually thoughtful and engaging man," with a striking quality:
"Nathaniel had a sweetness -- not necessarily the first word that springs to mind when describing a truly effective foreign correspondent -- that was treasured by all who knew him."
A member of a rock-ribbed New England family that has not strayed far from Boston, Mr. Nash, a Mayflower descendant on both sides of his family, is the fifth successive member of his family to bear the name Nathaniel Cushing Nash. ("Our family has trouble coming up with names," his father explained yesterday.)
The fourth generation of his family to attend the Noble and Greenough School in Dedham, Mass., Mr. Nash, who was born in Lawrence, Mass., and grew up in Hamilton, Mass., was a star athlete in high school, earning a total of nine varsity letters in basketball, tennis and soccer.
He was the fourth generation to attend Harvard, where he continued his athletic achievements until he dropped tennis and basketball after his freshman year. That, his father said yesterday, was partly because as a language major he carried an unusually heavy course load and wanted to concentrate on his studies and partly because he had joined an evangelical Christian group that took up increasing amounts of his time, including trips to New York for Bible study with the New Testament Missionary Fellowship.
It was the encouragement of a member of the religious group, McCandlish Phillips, a former Times reporter, that led Mr. Nash to pursue journalism.
After serving briefly as a copy boy, he became a clerk in the financial news department, where he later worked as a copy editor and eventually as assistant to the business and financial editor.
With the backing of his editors, Mr. Nash wangled an assignment to cover banking and finance in Washington. Within months of his arrival in the Washington bureau in 1985 he had established himself as a thorough and insightful reporter. This was apparent in his coverage of the savings and loan crisis. An article he wrote in June 1985, suggesting, among other things, that one-third of the Federally insured savings and loan associations could disappear by the end of the decade, reads today like a blueprint of exactly what did happen.
He also reported on the workings of the Federal Reserve Board, American trade policy and Congress.
Mr. Nash, who was married in 1985 to Elizabeth Rogow, a missionary he had met at a Bible study group in New York, spoke fluent Spanish and spent his vacations doing missionary work in Colombia.
Assigned to Buenos Aires in 1991, he spent the next three years covering everything from the Shining Path movement in Peru, natural disasters in Bolivia and economic development throughout the southern cone of South America.
As bureau chief in Frankfurt since July 1994, Mr. Nash specialized in business and economic news in Europe, an assignment that included coverage of efforts to create a common European economic policy, corporate mergers and employment trends.
Mr. Nash, who loves the outdoors so much that he thinks nothing of taking visiting editors on exhausting hikes, is also a fly fisherman who ties his own flies (and maintains a West Virginia cabin as a fishing base) and also raises orchids.
Mr. Nash once confided to a friend that the way to thrive at The Times was to avoid cynicism. Mr. Phillips suggested another reason Mr. Nash is held in such esteem: "When he came into a room, a gust of good will came right in with him."
Mr. Nash and his wife have a son, Nathaniel, 8, and 5-year-old twin daughters, Margarett Lucile and Lisa Deborah. His parents, Nathaniel and Caroline Nash, live in Wenham, Mass., and a sister, Deborah Molander, lives in Yarmouth, Maine.

 BODY:
A chart in Business Day yesterday with the continuation of an article about the state of the economy misstated the performance of one component of the index of leading indicators. That component -- the average workweek of production workers in manufacturing -- rose, contributing 0.77 of a percentage point to the index's overall increase; it did not fall by that amount.
The chart also misstated the reporting period for the index. It was January to February, not October to November. 
 An entry in the Business Digest referring to the article misattributed the index of leading indicators. It is compiled by the Conference Board, a business research group in New York, not by the Government.

HEADLINE: CRASH IN THE BALKANS: THE OVERVIEW;
COMMERCE SECRETARY AMONG 33 LOST IN A CROATIA PLANE CRASH

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
A military plane carrying Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and a delegation of American corporate executives slammed into a mountainside today as it approached the airport at Dubrovnik, on the Adriatic coast of Croatia. Chances that Mr. Brown had survived were "next to zero," a White House official said after more than 12 hours of rescue efforts.
Clambering over rocky, rugged terrain, working by flashlight in pelting rain, Croatian search parties found nine bodies and one survivor, described by a Dubrovnik doctor at the scene as "a woman who was bleeding profusely." She died later, Croatian officials said. 
 But there was no definitive word on the fate of Mr. Brown, a 54-year-old political insider who helped spark President Clinton's 1992 campaign. Glyn Davies, a State Department spokesman, said tonight that all 33 people aboard the plane were presumed dead, but later retracted his comment, saying they were considered missing. The Croatian television said all had perished.
Searchers at the scene and officials in Washington said they held out almost no hope that survivors would be found.
A United States military official in Germany said there was no indication the plane had been downed by hostile action.
One of those missing was Nathaniel C. Nash, 44, the Frankfurt bureau chief of The New York Times, who was accompanying Mr. Brown on a trip to Balkan nations for an article on reconstruction efforts. Commerce Department staff members were on board as well, including Charles Meissner, Assistant Secretary for International Economic Policy.
Names of the corporate executives aboard were not made public by the Government, but some companies issued statements confirming that their executives had been on board. Among them were Robert A. Whittaker chairman of Foster Wheeler Energy International of Clifton, N. J., and Robert E. Donovan, president of Asea Brown Boveri of Norwalk, Conn.
Several prominent businessmen who had planned to make the trip did not do so. One was Alfred A. Checchi, co-chairman of Northwest Airlines, who elected instead to attend a White House state dinner on Tuesday night.
A senior American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the pilot of Mr. Brown's plane had flown up a valley parallel to the one he should have followed before turning for his final approach. When he turned, he hit the mountain, the official said on the basis of reports from the scene.
President Clinton went to Mr. Brown's Washington home to comfort the Commerce Secretary's wife, Alma, and then to the Commerce Department, where he spoke feelingly of the missing Cabinet member as "a magnificent life force." Mr. Clinton said Mr. Brown, who ranged across the globe like none of his predecessors in an effort to develop markets for American business, had made the department "what it was meant to be -- an instrument for realizing the potential of every American."
Mr. Brown's fund-raising and coalition-building skills, honed in campaigns past and in years as a lobbyist, proved invaluable to Mr. Clinton four years ago, when Mr. Brown was serving as chairman of the Democratic Party.
Because Mr. Brown has been under investigation by an independent counsel for purported financial irregularities, Mr. Clinton decided months ago not to name him, as previously planned, as chairman of his re-election campaign, but Mr. Brown remained a trusted Presidential counselor.
In a tribute to Mr. Nash, who had represented The Times in Washington, South America and Europe, the newspaper's publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., called him "a colleague known as much for his gentleness of spirit as for his keen journalistic abilities."
If Mr. Nash perished in the crash, he would be the first Times reporter to be killed working on an article since World War II.
The plane, reportedly carrying 27 passengers and 6 crew members, took off at lunchtime from Tuzla in Bosnia for what should have been a routine flight. Mr. Brown had visited there with American troops attached to the NATO-led peacekeeping effort.
The plane vanished from radar screens at 2:52 P.M. local time (7:52 A.M. eastern time) as it neared Cilipi Airport, about 15 miles southeast of Dubrovnik, a medieval walled city squeezed between mountains and the sea.
According to Col. Robert Mirelson, a spokesman for the United States European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, the weather was harsh -- fog, rain and high winds from the south -- but it was well within the limits for Mr. Brown's plane, a military version of the Boeing 737 known as a T-43.
For reasons still unknown, perhaps pilot error or instrument falure, the plane came in too far north, missing the runway and striking the mountain -- actually more a large hill called Sveti Ivan or St. John. It came to rest on the hilltop.
"I can't tell you why they were where they were," said Lieut. Gen. Howell Estes, operations director for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, at a Pentagon briefing this afternoon. He said he doubted that the pilots had erred but later backed away from that statement and said he could not speculate.
Although Peter W. Galbraith, the United States Ambassador to Croatia, was at the airport awaiting Mr. Brown's arrival, both the State Department and the military had trouble all day verifying what had in fact happened. Officials were unable to supply a list of those on board, admirals and generals contradicted each other and, in some cases, issued erroneous information. For example, a senior Air Force colonel told reporters four hours after the wreckage was located well inland, near the hamlet of Velji Do, a mile or so from the airport, that the aircraft had come down in the Adriatic.
There were also conflicting reports as to whether the plane carried a cockpit voice recorder or a flight data recorder. Tonight top Pentagon officers said it did not, which will make it harder to learn exactly what went wrong. But it did carry a proximity warning system, which warns pilots when they are flying too close to the ground, the officers reported.
The plane, based at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany, was built in 1973 and had flown about 17,000 hours, Col. Virginia Pribyla of the Air Force said at the Pentagon. She said that was about a half to a third of what a comparable commercial airplane of that age would have flown. The plane had made 12,000 landings and had recently ferried Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary William J. Perry around the region.
Although the Air Force had encountered no trouble with its verison of the plane, the stubby, twin-engined civilian 737 has been the subject of intense investigation in the United States because of two still-unexplained crashes, one on Colorado Springs in 1991, the other in Pittsburgh in 1994. More than 2,800 of the highly popular short-haul planes have been delivered; they have flown more than 63 million hours with only eight fatal accidents.
When the T-43 did not land as expected, a search was begun not only on land but also in the Adriatic. NATO helicopters and airplanes from bases in Ploce, Croatia, and in Vicenza, Italy, took part, in addition to land-based American aircraft and helicopters from the destroyer Conolly in the Adriatic.
The sea search gave rise to repeated erroneous television reports in the United States that the plane had gone down in the Adriatic. Croatian policemen reached the crash site first. American helicopters were unable to land because of fog, the Pentagon said, and so special forces commandos set out on foot.
Reports by Croatian officials suggested that the plane had broken up on impact, with debris scattered in an area of ridges and ravines.
Ivo Djuricic, a 53-year-old villager, said he saw the plane fly over and then heard a crash. At the site, he said, he saw "no signs of life."
But a doctor from Dubrovnik hospital, Mladen Minovic, reported the discovery of a female survivor, who later died, Reuters reported.

 CORRECTION:
Articles yesterday about the airplane crash in Croatia referred incompletely to the death of Nathaniel C. Nash, Frankfurt bureau chief of The New York Times. While he was the first Times correspondent killed on assignment since World War II, a Washington correspondent died in 1949 en route from one. That correspondent, Bertram D. Hulen, was flying from Indonesia to the Netherlands after an inspection tour sponsored by the Dutch Government. The airplane crashed near Bombay.
The main article last Thursday about the plane crash that killed Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and 34 others in Croatia misstated the number of fatal accidents that have involved Boeing 737 aircraft. It is more than 40 worldwide, not 8. (Seven were in the United States.)

HEADLINE: CRASH IN THE BALKANS: The Lives Broken Off;
Ronald H. Brown, 54, Clinton's Commerce Secretary

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who was reported missing today in the crash of an Air Force plane near Dubrovnik, Croatia, is one of Washington's most skilled political insiders, a consummate deal maker who helped unify the Democratic Party behind Bill Clinton and then put the creation of American jobs at the center of the nation's foreign policy.
Reared in the celebrity-filled cacophony of the Hotel Theresa in Harlem, where his father worked as manager, Mr. Brown quickly learned the art of making connections and closing a deal -- first for the autographs of Joe Louis and Jackie Robinson, and eventually for the chief executives that he led to China, Southeast Asia and, in recent months, many of the world's trouble spots. 
 As smooth as his perfectly pressed suits, he exudes confidence, making sure that those he meets know that he considers himself a black leader, one who rose to prominence not only because of his connections to the civil rights movement but also because he wis "good and confident and smart" at operating in the halls of corporate America and Capitol Hill.
But it is this same reputation for tracking the scent of profit and straddling the line between public and private that has often landed him in trouble, and he has spent much of his three years as Commerce Secretary fending off investigations into his private dealings. One set of allegations was dismissed as groundless and nothing has ever been proven in other cases, but the charges alone are widely acknowledged in the White House to preclude Mr. Brown's public move to a central role in the President's re-election campaign.
Nonetheless, he played an active behind-the-scenes role until he left for Europe last weekend.
Mr. Brown learned his political ways from liberal stalwarts like Senator Edward M. Kennedy and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. In 1989, he took on the unenviable job as head of the Democratic National Committee, and in four years turned it into the centrist institution that Mr. Clinton used in his successful bid for the Presidency.
As Commerce Secretary, Mr. Brown has used his office to both break open markets and to announce that the power of private enterprise was the new incarnation of American foreign aid. He often talks as if he were America's chairman of the board, and to many business executives -- including Republicans who could hardly believe they were flying the world with the man who in 1988 managed Mr. Jackson's Presidential campaign -- he is.
"There is no question," Mr. Brown said a few months ago, "that when that plane lands on runways around the world bearing the letters 'The United States of America,' and I come down the steps with a string of C.E.O.'s behind me, it conveys the power of this nation to turn commerce into the infrastructure of democracy."
Mr. Brown was the first black to pledge a fraternity at Middlebury College in Vermont, which was overwhelmingly white at the time. He was the first black to run a major political party, and the first to become a partner in his Washington law firm, Patton, Boggs & Blow, known as one of the most skilled lobbying firms in the capital.
Yet race is never far from his mind. Over lunch in his office one day last fall, Mr. Brown reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a photograph from a Midwestern newspaper stapled to a note card bearing the stars of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The picture was of Mr. Brown; the caption identified him as Gen. Colin L. Powell.
"Ron -- They still can't tell us apart," General Powell's note read.
In person, Mr. Brown is a commanding presence, with a booming voice and quick sense of humor. Though his charm can be disarming, few who have dealt with him doubt that behind the suave veneer is one of the capital's most practiced hands at pulling the levers of power.
He surprised Democrats in 1988 by acting as peacemaker between Mr. Jackson's camp and that of the party's nominee, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, and then used that achievement to persuade many skeptics that he was neither too liberal nor too tied to Mr. Jackson to succeed at the top post at the Democratic National Committee.
"I promise you, the story of my chairmanship will not be about race, it will be about the races we win," he said.
Like Mr. Clinton, however, Mr. Brown has often been accused of trying to be too many things to too many constituencies. Some have questioned whether he is a true liberal, asserting that he is politically and racially nonideological.
Ronald Harmon Brown was born on Aug. 1, 1941 in Washington, D.C., to two graduates of Howard University, William Brown and Gloria Carter Brown. But his home was Harlem, and more specifically the Hotel Theresa on 125th Street. The hotel was across from the Apollo Theater, a mecca for black entertainers, politicians and sports stars. He traded in their autographs, and even had a picture of himself, at age 10 or 11, posing with Richard M. Nixon.
He was schooled at exclusive prep schools and when he attended public high school it was in White Plains, a racially mixed Westchester suburb. In 1958 he went to Middlebury, and when he was accepted by his fraternity, its charter was revoked. While the civil rights movement got its start, he was in the Reserve Officers Training Corps, then the Army.
After his discharge, he studied law at St. John's University in Queens, getting his degree in 1970. While a student, he worked as a welfare caseworker for the National Urban League on the Lower East Side.
"This was typical Ron Brown energy," said Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative. "He had this sense that he had to get ahead and give something back at the same time."
Mr. Brown later moved to Washington, where he began to build what was easily one of the capital's thickest Rolodexes, and moved quickly to what he considered a far less confining field: deputy head of Senator Kennedy's 1980 Presidential bid.
That campaign collapsed, but Mr. Brown was just getting started. He worked at the Democratic National Committee, but by the mid-1980's he had already turned to another task, making money, and soon became one of the city's most recognizable lawyer-lobbyists. It was the period of his life that came to haunt him.
In 1993, the F.B.I. looked into allegations that Mr. Brown had solicited a bribe from businessmen promoting trade with Vietnam. The inquiry was later dropped.
In the past year, an independent counsel has examined Mr. Brown's ties to a broadcasting executive.
Mr. Brown has always maintained that he had done nothing wrong and that his business deals had "been made to sound sinister" even though "there's nothing sinister about it."
He weathered all the allegations in part because of his roguish charm, his bridge-building abilities, and what Martin Kilson, a Harvard political science professor, called his ability to be a "transethnic politician."
That skill served him well at the 1992 Democratic Convention where he helped unify a divided party behind Mr. Clinton. And it made him a natural for a Commerce Department that was about to be turned into a major instrument of the Administration's economic plan -- refocusing American business on "emerging markets" and using the power of the Government to make sure trading partners bought American.
He has spent a good deal of time in the department's "war room," monitoring major contracts that Governments around the world were scheduled to award. The delicate part came when he tried to push American goods while delivering messages that his customers did not want to hear -- including protests over China's human rights record.
Mr. Brown has been pressing China to complete a huge order for McDonnell Douglas jets and has his usual phalanx of chief executives in tow. But he is also being accused by human rights groups of undercutting pressure on the Chinese leaders by seeking to win billions in orders.
"This was the biggest test," said Jeffrey Garten, the under secretary of commerce for international affairs until a few months ago who described Mr. Brown's meeting with Jiang Zemin, China's president.
"Before we went in to see Jiang Zemin, other Chinese told us that if we bring up the human rights issue, the meeting will be a disaster," Mr. Garten said. So Mr. Brown started by talking business. "Then there was a long pause," recalled Mr. Garten, "and Ron started by saying that human rights has a special meaning to anyone who worked in the civil rights movement and that America has a long, long way to go as well. But he made it clear that China could never achieve its major goal in the world, to become a major player on the world stage, if it was constantly being criticized around the world."
Mr. Jiang, he recalled, said, "If you put it that way, we have something to talk about."
It is too early to tell whether Mr. Brown's efforts -- what he called "commercial diplomacy" -- will generate much more than commerce. His entreaties to China resulted in airplane orders, but imprisonment of dissidents has continued. He bristles when challenged at length over the success of the strategy. Critics point out that many of the deals he has initialed on such trips have never came to fruition.
But in the past year, he has also turned his trips to a new purpose -- one not designed to profit American companies as much as to put a new face to American aid, fueled by corporate investment that focuses on infrastructure and new businesses. He traveled to Northern Ireland, to Africa, and, this week, to Croatia, where a mission that merged commerce and reconstruction ended in disaster.
Mr. Brown and his wife, Alma, have two children: Tracey, a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles, and Michael, a lawyer in Washington.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 17, 1996, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Articles on April 4 and 5 about the late Commerce Secretary, Ronald H. Brown, referred incorrectly to his membership in a fraternity at Middlebury College. Though he was the first black to be admitted to Sigma Epsilon at Middlebury, he was not the first black to be admitted to any fraternity at the Vermont school; that milestone was passed in 1948, a decade before Mr. Brown attended.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fall By 25,000 in Week

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 25,000 last week as workers affected by the strike at the General Motors Corporation returned to their jobs.
But the Labor Department said today that new applications for unemployment insurance still totaled a seasonally adjusted 408,000, much higher than the 367,000 level that many analysts had expected. 
 Claims rose to 433,000 the previous week, even steeper than the 429,000 original estimate and the largest since 523,000 claims were filed during the week that ended on July 25, 1992.
The strike had idled more than 175,000 workers -- both G.M. employees and those working for related businesses. Analysts said that with the dispute settled, claims should continue to tumble. But many contended that job growth would remain sluggish. Before the strike, claims were in the mid-300,000 range.
The four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims continued to climb, rising by 11,250, to 394,750, highest since applications totaled 397,250 during the period that ended on Oct. 10, 1992.

HEADLINE: FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW;
Life, Lust and Unemployment

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES 

 BODY:
Jenny, the heroine of the starkly realistic "Work," lives on the borderline of just about everything. In her mid-20's, she is semi-rural and semi-poor. Pale and blonde, she is married to a man but having an affair with the young, black, college-bound woman next door.
Her life is depicted in such detail that it calls to mind cinema verite rather than fiction. Jenny goes to interviews for secretarial jobs, in the kind of offices that exist in storefronts along blacktop roads. At home, she drinks beer with her lover, June, only to be interrupted mid-kiss when she hears her husband arriving home from the factory. She cooks hamburgers for dinner. 
 But the sheer accumulation of details doesn't amount to enough. Written and directed by Rachel Reichman, who has a background in still photography and documentary editing, the film fails to make the imaginative leap that would give Jenny a coherent inner life as well as a sharply observed outer one.
The theme of work -- Jenny's unemployment and cutbacks at her husband's factory -- never meshes with the theme of her desire for June. And that desire is itself inchoate. Is her sexual identity at stake, or is she simply pouring her aimlessness into a relationship that is triply forbidden, being adulterous, homosexual and interracial? The film's low-budget look suits the unglamorized treatment of the characters. But it is easier to applaud the determination that brought "Work" into being than it is to admire this sluggish film.
Also on the program is "The Red Book," Janie Geiser's beautifully mysterious, animated short. Images appear as in a graceful collage: glimpses of words are written in white vanishing ink; a woman is drawn in outline, as if she were a paper doll made of red construction paper. Everything is red, white, black or gray in this smashing little film, which has graphic flair and a surrealist edge.
The program will be shown as part of the New Directors/New Films series tonight at 9 and tomorrow at 3:30 P.M. at the Museum of Modern Art.

HEADLINE: Metallgesellschaft Reports Talks With Ex-Chief Fail

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 4

 BODY:
Metallgesellschaft A.G. said today that it had held talks on a settlement with a former chief executive who was ousted after a unit racked up $1.3 billion in trading losses.
But the company said no agreement on settling their lawsuits against each other could be reached because the executive, Heinz Schimmelbusch, refused to open his personal records or provide other information that the company requested. Lawyers for Mr. Schimmelbusch could not be reached for comment today. 
 Metallgesellschaft confirmed the settlement talks, which were reported in The International Herald Tribune today, as it disclosed earnings to shareholders. It said earnings before taxes rose 27 percent in the first four months of its fiscal year.
Mr. Schimmelbusch was ousted in December 1993 after the United States unit of the German metals and engineering giant, the MG Corporation, accumulated $1.3 billion in losses from trading in oil futures. The collapse of the company was averted by a $1.9 billion bailout by its creditor banks.
Metallgesellschaft subsequently sued Mr. Schimmelbusch and the company's former chief financial officer, Meinhard Forster, accusing them of breach of duty in connection with the trading losses. Mr. Schimmelbusch countersued the company and Deutsche Bank A.G., Metallgesellschaft's largest shareholder, contending defamation. The company settled with Mr. Forster last year.
Kajo Neukirchen, Mr. Schimmelbusch's successor as chief executive, said today that the company planned to earn 300 million marks, or $202 million, even as the German economy showed signs of weakening.
"Three hundred million marks before taxes is our profit target, which we set ourselves more than a year ago," he said at the company's annual shareholders meeting.
Profit for the first four months of the 1996 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, rose to 33 million marks ($22 million) from 26 million marks ($17 million). Sales fell 17 percent, but the company said that orders for larger projects typically came in later in the year.
Analysts said the company's profit goal was attainable even though the company earned about one-tenth of the amount in the first third of the year.
"The numbers are back-end loaded," said Peter Dupont, an analyst with UBS Ltd. "There's a significant seasonality in the sales and the profits. I've no reason to dispute their forecasts."
Metallgesellschaft earned 118 million marks ($80 million) in 1995 as the company sold unprofitable units and benefited from strong sales in its chemicals and trading divisions.
That compared with a 1994 net loss of 2.6 billion marks, after trading losses drove the company to the edge of bankruptcy.
"We're back, we've made it," Mr. Neukirchen said today.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Of Monkeys, Reason And the Creation

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY 

 BODY:
AT long last Tony Randall's National Actors Theater has a production that deserves to be a hit. It's John Tillinger's crisp, handsome, very entertaining revival of Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee's "Inherit the Wind," which opened last night at the Royale Theater with George C. Scott and Charles Durning in the seductively actable leading roles.
Not since its 1993 production of "Timon of Athens" has Mr. Randall's company seemed to be on such firm ground. This "Inherit the Wind" is big and fully inhabited, not only by its two stars and supporting players, but also by its nearly two dozen extras identified in the program as "townspeople, jurors, scientists, etc." You haven't seen so many etceteras on one stage since your last Passion Play. There's also a monkey. 
 That's not the only surprise.
The courtroom drama itself, though it's not exactly "Saint Joan," remains as pertinent and theatrically satisfying today as it must have been when it first arrived on Broadway 41 years ago. The source material is rich: one of the most colorful and briefly riveting of the trials of the century that seemed to be especially abundant in the sensation-loving 1920's. It's the so-called "monkey trial" of 1925, when John T. Scopes, a biology teacher in Dayton, Tenn., was charged with having broken the state statute barring the teaching in public schools of Darwin's theories of evolution. The prosecution summoned William Jennings Bryan, beloved orator, the Democractic Party's three-time unsuccessful Presidential nominee, an idealistic naif nearing the end of a long and illustrious career. At the suggestion of the American Civil Liberties Union, the defense was headed by Clarence Darrow, notorious for representing clients no godly man would touch: socialists, strikers and, most recently, Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, the Chicago "thrill" killers.
There was no doubt about Scopes's guilt and, considering the time and place, not much doubt about the trial's outcome. There was only the opportunity to question the constitutionality of the law. Sound dull? Not as the press played it up.
The story of the trial was given the same razzle-dazzle treatment received by Floyd Collins, the unfortunate fellow who became famous for being trapped in a Kentucky cave five months earlier. Reporters from all over the nation and abroad landed in Dayton. Believers came also. There were souvenirs to be bought and prayer meetings to attend. The Dayton economy boomed.
Here was a headline-making heavyweight bout between the rational thought of a newly rational age and old-fashioned Christian fundamentalism, which was deemed to be on its last legs, though today it's alive and well and called Creationism. The term "monkey trial" perfectly expressed the tone of the press coverage.
Yet it doesn't adequately express the tone of "Inherit the Wind," which somehow manages to avoid the condescension of a work that preaches to the converted. The playwrights assume that audiences share their Darwinism; they make much sport of attempts to defend the belief that the world was created at 9 A.M. on Oct. 23, 4004 B.C. At the same time they realize that legislation against virtually any idea, no matter how ridiculous, is as indefensible as the Tennessee statute against the teaching of evolution (which wasn't repealed until 1967).
With wit and a lot of expertise, Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Lee (who died in 1994) take the essentials of the true story and turn it into Broadway fiction. This, I assume, permits them to make a rounded theater piece that would otherwise have had historians on their backs. The Darrow character is now called Henry Drummond (Mr. Scott) and Bryan is Matthew Harrison Brady (Mr. Durning). The time of the play is identified as "not too long ago," though the costumes and set design clearly place it in the 1920's.
"Inherit the Wind" effectively reflects the principal events in the trial by turning it into a war to the death between the two powerhouse lawyers. At the beginning, Mr. Durning's Brady is all self-assured, folksy charm. Though grossly overweight, he can never resist another home-made pickle, apple pie or plateful of potato salad, presented to him by attentive housewives. It's July and the Tennessee sun is hot. As the courtroom principals strip down to their shirtsleeves and galluses, Brady watches with satisfaction as the jury is packed with his God-fearing admirers.
Mr. Scott's Drummond is laid back, patient, occasionally sarcastic. He's a stocky, barrel-chested man who shows his age, but appears to be waiting to explode. He keeps his cool even as, one after another, his expert witnesses are denied the right to testify. No scientific testimony is allowed. The defense is being steamrollered until Drummond changes his tactics. Having received permission to put on the stand a witness expert in the teachings of the Bible, he calls Brady, who accepts. The scene that follows is the play's coup de theatre.
This confrontation between two formidable, agile minds gives "Inherit the Wind" its dramatic life, but only when you have actors of the grandly theatrical heft of Mr. Durning and Mr. Scott playing the roles. "Inherit the Wind" is finally far less about the ideas themselves than about the destruction of a man of 19th-century America by someone who represents the 20th, and who may not be quite sure what that means.
Mr. Scott and Mr. Durning are individually fine and well matched in Mr. Tillinger's production, which, though big and elaborate, is so beautifully orchestrated that it never upstages the performances.
Chief among the estimable supporting players: Anthony Heald as E. K. Hornbeck, the H. L. Mencken-like journalist who is the play's wisecracking chorus (the role played by Mr. Randall in the original production); Garret Dillahunt as the biology teacher-defendant, overwhelmed by the events he initiated; Kate Forbes as the young woman who loves him, and Tom Aldredge as the local preacher who has old-time religion to burn.
The impressive physical production, designed by James Noone and lighted by Ken Billington, appears to embrace the entire teeming town, which, in turn, embraces the courtroom. The play's single intermission is treated as if it were a court recess. The characters drift back onto the stage in various attitudes of boredom, fatigue, thought and high spirits. The drama resumes, its tension unbroken.
Good work by all.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Retreat On Treasuries Before Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday as market participants awaited today's report on employment in March.
The market shrugged off a report showing a drop in February housing completions that was sharper than expected. The Commerce Department said yesterday that the number of housing units on which construction was completed fell 6.5 percent in February from January., 
 "Bonds are preparing for what traders hope will be the busiest day of the week," said Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 17/32 yesterday, to a price of 9113/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.67 percent, from 6.62 percent on Wednesday. Today, in observance of Good Friday, trading in the Treasury futures market will end at 11 A.M. and trading in the cash market will close at noon, based on recommendations from the Public Securities Association, which represents securities dealers.
Traders said that because of the shortened session, trades today will not be settled until Monday. As a result, bearish traders yesterday were able to set short positions, or sell borrowed securities, which they hope to buy back at a cheaper price, thereby making a profit. If the employment report is weaker than expected, and prices rise, the short- sellers can buy to limit losses -- but they do not have to settle until Monday. That short-selling held down prices yesterday, traders said.
Also weighing down the market yesterday was concern about selling by Japanese investors and comments by a Federal Reserve official that suggested the Fed would not lower interest rates.
Early this week, the governor of the Bank of Japan hinted that Japanese interest rates would rise. Treasury traders and analysts are concerned that if the yield between United States and Japanese debt narrows, it will cause Japanese investors to liquidate some of their Treasury holdings.
And the case for lower United States interest rates appeared to weaken after the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Cathy E. Minehan, painted a rosy forecast of economic growth "pointing us to the 2 percent range." She told an audience at Fitchburg State College in Massachusetts that the Fed must remain cautious on inflation and warned that a more accommodative stance on interest rates could backfire. Ms. Minehan is not a voting member this year of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's interest-rate-setting panel.
With a Fed official saying growth is fine, bond market participants were nervous ahead of the employment report, said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Rickel & Associates, an investment banking firm.
Still, he said he expected yields to stay in a narrow trading range. "A lack of inflationary pressure should keep a lid on bond yields, while moderate economic growth should keep the floor on yields," he said.
Mr. Burtnick noted that "while the employment data is clearly important to the market, the outlook is soured by other factors."
"Investors remain long," he said, "large speculators have made bearish bets and the technical picture supports the idea of higher rates in the near term. Even with extremely bullish data, the market will still be subject to selling on upticks."
Next week, supply will again be a factor as the Treasury sells $30.25 billion of new two- and five-year notes in addition to the regular weekly sale of $27 billion in three- and six-month bills. In when-issued trading ahead of next week's Treasury sales, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.80 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.11 percent.
In the corporate market, the Trump Atlantic City Association/ Trump Atlantic City Funding Corporation, a subsidiary of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc., plans to sell about $1.1 billion of 10-year notes next week through an underwriting group led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The issue -- which carries junk bond ratings, B1 from Moody's Investors Service and BB- from Standard & Poor's -- is expected to have a 10.75 to 11 percent interest rate, with a call provision that would allow the issuer to buy back the securities in five years.

HEADLINE: Nervous U.S. Executives in China

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
When sabers rattle, so do the nerves of foreign businessmen.
The talk of war between China and Taiwan in recent weeks scared American business executives as much as anyone, and in addition to the obvious danger that military confrontation posed, they had to consider the potential fallout from strained ties between China and the United States. China has blamed the United States for meddling in the Taiwan question. 
 The hostilities now seem to be in remission. The good news is that there has been little measurable damage to investment or trade. But the bad news is that intangibles -- mood, atmosphere, timing -- can make a difference in a place as politically sensitive as China.
General Motors, in the middle of negotiating a $1 billion deal to manufacture sedans in Shanghai, appears to be hitting some politically induced snags in the winding course it must traverse through China's bureaucracy before it can start an assembly line.
Xu Junkang, a project manager with G.M.'s partner, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, said that the project had been delayed in winning approval from the State Council, China's cabinet in Beijing,
"There has already been some delay to our original plan," Mr. Xu told Reuters. "We hope to stay on schedule, but it is up to the Government."
An executive at G.M. said recently that the problem was that because of the Taiwan issue Chinese automotive officials did not want to go to the State Council and request approval for one stage of a large American-invested project.
"It's just slowing us down some," the executive said. "We'll get it."
G.M. was selected last October as a partner for the Shanghai project, with plans to make 100,000 Buick-like sedans a year. But first it has to negotiate a joint venture contract with Shanghai Automotive and then win approval from Beijing.
Stephen Schnell, managing director of G.M.'s Shanghai office, denied that there had been any delay in G.M.'s overall schedule, and said Mr. Xu, the Chinese project manager, had spoken out of turn.
"That guy hasn't really been involved for the past six to nine months," Mr. Schnell said. "The fact is, we have not yet submitted a proposal.
"We're still doing the feasibility study. If you've ever done a Chinese feasibility study, you know that's its got more than 200 pages asking more detail than you would ever believe. But it's part of their state plan, so you have to do it."
Mr. Schnell said he had not felt any effect on G.M.'s negotiations from the strain in China-United States relations, and he said the plan was still to submit a joint venture proposal to Beijing in July.
"That is when they reject or approve it," he said. "We are certain they will approve it."
Mr. Schnell also pointed out that G.M. had recently won approval for two more car component joint ventures near Shanghai, each of them making steering gear.
"We would never say that politics would show up in something like this," he added. "We do not want to get involved in that kind of discussion at all. The Government will operate as they see fit."
Anne Stevenson-Yang, director of the United States-China Business Council in Beijing, discounted the possibility of strained bilateral relations intruding on the operations of American businesses in a significant way.
"I've never known them to make an economic decision because of political reasons," Ms. Stevenson-Yang said, referring to China's State Council.
Small businesses react differently in a political crisis than large multinationals, she said.
"They get nervous or back off deals," she said, referring to the smaller companies. "There's been some of that."
Large companies like G.M., however, have to take a longer-term view, she said.
"If you're in China because you have to be, because the market is so large and you have to position yourself against competitors, you can't afford to rip up an agreement" when a political crisis emerges, she added.

HEADLINE: Mexico Tries to Restrict Some Foreign Investments

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 4

 BODY:
After several years of throwing open its economy, Mexico has recently tried to shut some doors to American and other foreign investors, contending that national interests come before trade agreements.
The latest attempt to restrict investment came this week as Mexican legislators, backed by the nation's strongest labor unions, demanded that foreign companies be prohibited from managing new pension funds that will be established next year as part of sweeping changes in the Mexican social security system. 
 Citing the experience of Chile, where American managers control more than 70 percent of privatized pension funds, the congressmen and labor leaders charge that foreign fund managers would invest their holdings outside Mexico, depriving the country of the beneficial impact of increased savings.
Foreign fund managers could take over the business by offering higher returns and lower costs, the legislators fear.
"This is a case of nationalism," conceded Salvador Mikel, a representative of the ruling party, speaking on the floor of the Congress. "We are simply interpreting the North American Free Trade Agreement in Spanish," meaning to Mexico's advantage.
The American market managers who would be most interested in operating the pension funds think that any restrictions would backfire on the Mexican Government's aim of increasing the paltry rate of domestic savings.
"Managing assets requires confidence, skill and trust," said Luis R. Luis, director of emerging markets research at Scudder, Stevens & Clark, in Boston. "No one who can provide these things should be excluded."
Just last month, the Government decided to restrict the sale of 60 of the 61 Government-owned petrochemical plants to Mexican companies or joint ventures in which Mexicans have a majority interest.
"It was the only politically palatable way to get the process moving ahead," said a senior official, who spoke on condition he not be named. "So many political factors have gotten wrapped up in the sale that the privatizations became a paradigm for many past problems."
Santander Investment estimates that with the new ownership rules, Mexico will realize only $2 billion on the sale of its four most important petrochemical plants, less than a third of original estimates.
While restrictions against foreign investment pale against the large international presence in such important sectors of the Mexican economy as banking and manufacturing, they are important because they represent such a drastic change in government attitude.
During the presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari from 1988 to 1994 foreign capital was universally welcomed. While President Ernesto Zedillo has followed many of the economic principles of his predecessor, he has slowed the pace of change.
"It's important to remember the devaluation and the crisis it caused between the two administrations," said Jonathan Heath, an economist in Mexico City. "Now everyone in Mexico opposes what Salinas did and anything connected to him is seen as evil."
The new attitude also seems to be formed in part by a perception that the United States is reneging on parts of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect at the start of 1994. In the last few months, the United States has put restrictions on Mexican tomatoes, refused to lift prohibitions against Mexican avocados and rejected a plan to allow Mexican trucks to cross the border.
"The attitude now is that the United States is taking a much harder stand than before, so why should Mexico open up," Mr. Heath said. But, he added, "I don't think American investors have too much to worry about because it's a cycle that will end," referring to the political tensions leading up to midterm elections next year.
The restriction against foreign investment in petrochemicals is in accord with a reserve clause of the trade agreement that permits limitations on the sale of assets once reserved for the state. All oil and petrochemicals in Mexico have till now been controlled by the Government-owned monopoly Pemex.
The first planned sale of a petrochemical complex however, was begun before the restrictions were enacted. Three foreign companies and one Mexican company are submitting bids on the Cosoleacaque plant, Government officials said. A decision will be announced on April 26.
The pension fund restriction, if passed, would be on shakier ground than that for the Pemex sales. The Mexican Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, told legislators last month that the trade agreement obliged Mexico to open the pension funds to foreign capital from the United States and Canada. The agreement allows other countries to enter the market as well, but only with less than a controlling interest.
A vote on the legislation is expected before the end of the month. Once approved, the new pension system would be in place next year.

HEADLINE: Boost the Minimum Wage

 BODY:
There is a strong case for raising the minimum wage by a modest amount. Unfortunately, the issue is caught up in election-year politics, making compromise unlikely. Senate Democrats rounded up 55 members last week to force a vote on it, but they needed 60 votes so the effort failed. Few Democrats shed tears, since they could pin the defeat on the majority leader, Bob Dole.
The Democrats proposed raising the minimum wage over two years to $5.15 an hour, which would raise earnings for these workers by 90 cents an hour, or about $1,800 a year. Even at $5.15, the minimum wage would, after taking account of inflation, remain 15 percent below its average value during the 1970's. 
 Will low-paid workers lose their jobs if employers must pay higher wages? Yes, but there is widespread agreement among economic studies that the impact would be very small. A 90-cent wage hike would probably wipe out fewer than 100,000 of the approximately 14 million low-paid jobs in the economy -- less than a 1 percent loss. Indeed, 100,000 represents only about half the number of jobs the economy typically creates each month.
The benefits of a higher minimum wage would be substantial. At $4.25 an hour, minimum-wage workers cannot count on earning their way out of poverty. But at $5.15 an hour, or $10,700 a year, the goal is in reach. By combining earnings, food stamps worth about $3,000 and tax credits of $3,500, such workers can clear the poverty threshold for a family of four -- about $16,000 -- even after payroll taxes. That would be a victory for public policy.
The Republicans criticize the minimum wage as a crude antipoverty tool, and in a sense they are right. For one thing, about 40 percent of the recipients are teen-agers, some from middle-class families. A better tool, which enjoys bipartisan support, is the earned income tax credit. The tax credit directly benefits low-paid workers, either by cutting their taxes or, if they owe no tax, giving them a check from the Treasury. The credit is structured to encourage the poor to go to work without hitting their employers.
There are, however, limits to how much higher Congress can push the tax credit. Congress sets the credit for poor workers, and phases it out as wages rise. The higher the initial credit is, the faster the phaseout must become in order to limit the impact of the tax credit on the deficit. But phasing out the tax credit hits near-poor workers just like a tax hike -- discouraging them from working longer hours or taking higher-paid jobs.
The best antipoverty strategy is to mix tax credits and minimum wages. At President Clinton's urging, Congress recently raised the tax credit. The next step is to raise the minimum wage by the modest amount the Senate Democrats have proposed. The Democrats should try again. Republicans supported such policies in the past. Perhaps Senator Dole can summon the will to do so this election year.

HEADLINE: Utilities Rewrite the Rate Card;
Small Users Wary as Big Customers Win Discounts

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich.

 BODY:
Richard Wilde, along with 1.4 million other residential customers of the Consumers Power Company, is seeing his electric rates rise 8.2 percent this year.
Meanwhile, the 9,000 industrial customers of the utility, which is owned by CMS Energy and serves a large area of Michigan dotted with hundreds of plants tied to automobile and other industries, will pay 4.2 percent less for power. Indeed, for a few giants -- like General Motors, Dow Corning and Pharmacia & Upjohn -- rates have already been slashed 10 to 20 percent at many plants. 
 The rate cuts are part of a broad effort to keep jobs in Michigan -- a weapon in the economic civil wars, as states and cities nationwide battle to lure, or retain, businesses. But the formula does not sit well with residential customers, even though their increased burden -- about $42 a year on an average bill -- is slight.
"If they make rates cheaper for business, more businesses will come here," Mr. Wilde, who retired from the Eaton Corporation in 1983, acknowledged. "But it's not fair to the consumer."
Consumer rates and industrial discounts are not directly tied to each other. Still, such inequities have become common in states with costly power -- and may be an inevitable byproduct of the utility deregulation movement sweeping the country. That deregulation is expected to offer most users the option to bypass the local utility and buy power from competing producers.
 Here is how it works now: A company asks its local utility for lower rates, threatening to take its business elsewhere unless it gets them. It's not an empty threat, for many of the biggest businesses can either build their own generating plants or persuade a local government to form a municipal system, which can buy power at bulk rates. And as more states lower the barriers to competition among utilities, finding lower-priced energy should become even easier.
Companies may be bluffing, of course, but utilities, with huge investments in generating plants and the delivery systems built when they held ironclad monopolies on their home turf, usually decide not to risk finding out.
As a result, they often cut rates for specific companies or whole industries. Regulators have generally held that the utilities cannot make up those losses by raising prices for consumers and small businesses. But consumer groups fear that eventually those discounts for the biggest customers will have to be made up by rate increases for the smallest.
For big customers, the incentive is clear. Large G.M. complexes have electric bills of as much as $25 million a year, while bills at smaller plants run about $5 million. In Michigan, G.M. and the others were paying 4.7 to 5 cents a kilowatt-hour; with the discounts, that has dropped to 4.2 to 4.5 cents.
 Michigan is a prime example of the changes rippling through the utility business, trends also evident in states like California, New York, Wisconsin and Massachusetts.
For at least five years, industrial rates have fallen faster than those for consumers. But only in the last year or two have these deep discounts for corporations started appearing as a feature of the industry's rate cards.
In the long run, some say, open competition will mean lower rates for all, by allowing everyone to choose their electricity provider. "Everyone will benefit," said Doug Rothwell, director of the Michigan Jobs Commission, a state agency set up to find ways to retain and attract businesses.
But, he acknowledged, business customers would get the advantages earlier because they have more options to drive down costs.
Mr. Rothwell also agreed with the argument raised by utilities and some industrial customers: that rate increases for small customers now merely balance out the rates industrial clients previously paid that subsidized lower residential rates.
Eventually, consumers may be able to exert enough political pressure to get their rates down. For now, though, groups representing customers like Mr. Wilde, who lives with his wife in Portage, Mich., a suburb of Kalamazoo in the southwestern part of the state, are often left watching from the sidelines, able to offer only feeble opposition.
They have found it difficult to argue against the need to keep business happy to retain and create new jobs. With many jobs lost to corporate downsizing in recent years, job creation is a high priority in state legislatures. Here in Michigan, Gov. John Engler, a Republican, has made the state's economic growth a priority since he was elected in 1990.
Efforts have begun in Congress to draft legislation aimed at making the transition to a more competitive electric industry more equitable, but so far the issue has remained primarily one for the states to handle.
In New York State, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation has given discounts, mostly in the last two years, to dozens of large industrial customers, like Lockheed Martin, the aerospace giant, and Church & Dwight, the maker of household goods. In the face of such deals, the state's Public Service Commission has held hearings on how to allow all customers more choices and may make an initial decision in May on how to proceed.
The hearings have already shown, though, that legislators, regulators, industries, consumer groups and the utilities themselves all differ on whether to allow customers to buy power directly from outsiders and at what pace competition should be phased in.
In California, the Public Service Commission has ordered that by 1998 some industrial customers be allowed to bypass local utilities. And in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Utilities has ordered utilities to draft plans that would allow all customers to buy power directly from other suppliers.
In these states and elsewhere, corporations have been able to club governors and legislators with the argument that they cannot build new factories or maintain existing ones if rates are not reduced to match those of states with low-cost power. In Massachusetts, for example, the Raytheon Corporation threatened to consider moving plants to other states because of high utility rates; state officials responded by pressing utilities to come up with plans to give customers more choice.
"It's hard to fight back," said David Schaltz, a lawyer who represents the Residential Ratepayers Consortium, an association of consumer and elderly groups in Michigan. "All business has to say is that they can't be competitive. If they use that magic word they get the discounts. We can say, 'We can't afford it,' but that doesn't carry the same weight as saying, 'We can't compete.' "
The danger, according to Mr. Schaltz and other consumer advocates, is that as industrial and commercial customers get lower rates, the revenue base of utilities like Consumers Power and Detroit Edison will shrink.
And later, they fear, utilities may be forced to seek even more sizable increases from consumers, despite assurances now that they will try to absorb the revenue losses by cutting costs.
In addition, giving some corporations deep cuts has opened a Pandora's box, leading other industrial customers to clamor for similar breaks -- and putting still more pressure on the rates of residential and small business customers.
Those companies are "pounding the table for them right now," said John W. Clark, senior vice president for communications for CMS Energy, the parent company of Consumers Power.
William T. McCormick Jr., chairman and chief executive of CMS, believes that with large companies in pursuit of ways to cut costs, there is little the utility can do but accommodate them.
Had discounts not been granted to major customers, he said in an interview in the corporate offices in Dearborn, the refusal could have led to the loss of supplying power to many plants. Each company granted a discount, he said, was in a position to build its own highly efficient gas-fired power plant.
In granting the discounts, Mr. McCormick said, the utility signed the companies to long-term contracts "to back them in so they couldn't go anywhere else."
G.M., Dow Corning, and Upjohn agreed to contracts ranging from five to 10 years, guaranteeing that even if Michigan opens its utilities to competition soon, they will still have to buy electricity from Consumers Power.
If the utility had allowed the plants to find other electricity sources, the revenue loss could have reached $200 million to $300 million, David W. Joos, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Consumers Power, said.
And "if you just allow them to leave your system," he said, "people will end up paying more."
By offering the discounts, the utility will lose about $65 million a year in revenue, an amount it hopes to absorb through further cost cutting, without further rate increases.
"I don't expect to be going soon for a rate increase" in addition to this year's, Mr. McCormick added. "Not on my watch."
The pressure that Consumers Power faces from industrial customers is now often felt by many utilities in other states.
Mr. Joos recalled that a portent came in 1994 when the Menasha Corporation, a paper company in Neenah, Wis., decided to build its own gas-fired plant that generated both steam and electricity to run its paper mill in Otsego, Mich.
Consumers Power offered the plant an attractive rate to keep its 15 megawatts on its system, but Menasha's management decided that its own plant, to be completed in January at a cost of $28 million, would be more efficient and bring down its cost of power even more.
Thus, when G.M. contracted with the Indeck Power Equipment Company, an independent power producer in Wheeling, Ill., to build an electricity-generation plant for its Saginaw division, Mr. Joos and other Consumers Power executives felt they had to offer lower rates.
G.M. officials did not respond to a request for an interview concerning the lower Consumers Power rates.
 Apart from the pressure of competition, large companies make well-financed lobbying efforts to help get their way, and their message has fallen on sympathetic ears.
A study done for Michigan last year by the consulting firm PHH Fantus, which helps companies select business sites, found that electric rates were as much as 30 percent higher in three Michigan cities than in some other competing states.
During Governor Engler's tenure, though, a number of taxes on business have been cut or eliminated. The Jobs Commission was set up to spearhead a drive to bring in new businesses and retain existing industries.
The Governor has also asked the Michigan Public Service Commission to create a way for industrial and commercial customers to bypass local utilities and buy power from other sources by the year 2001.
Under the Governor's proposal, new or expanding business would be able to make such choices by the beginning of next year, providing an incentive for industries to expand or move plants to Michigan.
Residential customers would not be able to have the same rights under the Governor's proposal.
Mr. Wilde complained that groups like the American Association of Retired Persons, in which he has been active, do not have the same influence with utilities and states as industry groups like the Association of Business Advocating Tariff Equity, or Abate, which represents 30 of the state's largest industrial companies.
Robert A. W. Strong, a lawyer representing Abate, said the group viewed the special contracts as interim measures, needed only until Michigan put in a system under which all customers would have a choice in buying power. For now, though, "it will be a very powerful economic tool in retaining jobs and attracting new ones," he said.
With other states moving to reduce electric rates, Mr. Rothwell, the Michigan official, said that the state could not delay. "Just cutting taxes is not enough," he said. "You have to deal with the total cost of doing business in the state, and electricity costs play a role."

HEADLINE: Moving Bits, Bytes and Books To the Library of the Future;
A New Branch Offers Data in Old Forms and New

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
It was, perhaps, the ultimate illustration of style over substance. Just beyond the glitter of the Seventh on Sixth fashion shows in Bryant Park last week, a more mundane operation was trudging ahead, but one likely to affect New York for far longer.
As designers and their fast-aging models displayed the pricey wares that will be out of date by next fall, movers were trucking 1.2 million books dealing with business, economics, chemistry, physics and mathematics, plus microfilm and microfiche -- 31 miles of material, if you stacked it up side by side -- from the central research edifice of the New York Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42d Street to their new home, the Science, Industry and Business Library, at Madison Avenue and 34th Street. There, ostensibly, it will never be beyond the reach of everyday citizens, nor will it go out of style. 
 "This is a supreme moment for us," said Paul LeClerc, the New York Public Library president. Not only, he said, is the new science library a prototype for 21st century research, but also with the space created by the reshuffled collection, "we can now bring back the collections we have stored in the library annex on West 43d Street and create the single most important collection of publicly accessible humanities and social science documents under one roof on the continent, if not anywhere."
The 42d Street library is to be renovated over the next six years. But in less than a month, on May 2, the new Science, Industry and Business Library (known by the acronym SIBL and intended primarily for small businesses) will open on two floors of the old B. Altman department store. New York will then be home to a user-friendly, interactive research institution that may well be unmatched in the access to information it gives to the public.
Among its features are seating for 500, with each seat wired for laptop computer hookups; 100 outfitted work stations, with access to electronic databases and on-line services, and a training center at which library users will be instructed in the rudiments of electronic research.
"It's not just our collections we're moving," said John V. Ganly, the assistant director of SIBL. "When you move in all this technology, you're moving in other libraries as well. You're moving in the world."
Even in its current state of untidy incompleteness, the new library, designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, seems to have little in common with the old one. The familiar feel of wood and leather and brass lamps gives way to the spanking new efficiency of the cyber-age.
But for all the technology extant, one cannot beam the books from one location to another. Since Jan. 29, workers have been yanking the stuff off the shelves by hand, putting it on wheeled carts, ferrying it half a mile through midtown traffic and then unloading it, volume by volume, onto new shelves.
"There is so much hype about electronic resources that if you allow yourself not to think about the future carefully, it's easy to believe it will be one without books," said William D. Walker, who is Andrew D. Mellon director of New York Public's five research libraries. "We're making an enormous investment in new space to hold future print collections. The book is an invention that will be difficult to bump by any technology."
Five tiers of stacks have been built in the new building's core, withpublic areas surrounding them. Books will be visible through the windows, as will a counter reminiscent of a circulation desk.
But from inside, even the smell of the place, like the newest of new cars, emanates "future." The electronic signage, the computer screens cropping up on desk tops everywhere like crocuses in a techno-garden, and the electrically operated movable stacks (not open to the public, though the first floor of SIBL will include a circulating library of 40,000 volumes taken from the mid-Manhattan branch at Fifth Avenue and 41st Street), all make a visitor accustomed to musty stacks, long oaken tables and Victorian reading lamps feel as though he is on the starship Enterprise.
SIBL is a prototype, Mr. Walker said, "because it combines comprehensive electronic resources with our magnificent collection of print resources."
It is that combination -- electronic information and hard copy (also known as original documents), the past and the future -- that library officials emphasize. In the library of the 21st century, there is still a prominent place for the book.
With pride, library officials list the CD-ROM and on-line services that work-station users will be able to tap into: the addresses and sales information for 10 million American companies; complete census data, and patent descriptions from the last two decades, to name three of dozens. But there is also the Parsons collection of rare books and manuscripts on transportation and engineering.
In the Parsons collection, one finds not just texts dealing with the construction of canals and railroads and the lives of engineers, but captivating oddities, like the 50-volume Walter Weichsel transfer collection, a series of scrapbooks put together by an obscure but compulsive traveler, consisting of public transportation tickets from around the world and photographs of where they took him.
It took nearly two years to prepare the collection for the move. Under the supervision of Louis Mintz, who had been in charge of the research library stacks for more than three decades before he retired two years ago -- "I think I've touched every book in there," he said of the 12 million volumes at 42d Street -- librarians went through all of it. They had to figure out what to take and what to leave, how much space to leave in the new library for growth of both text and periodical collections (there is about seven years' worth left, Mr. Mintz said), and then draw detailed maps to tell the movers what goes where.
During an interview in the new stacks, after he showed off the Weichsel transfers, Mr. Mintz was asked if he was surprised at the variety the library had collected.
"Yeah," he said, "but you never know what people are going to save."
He said he knew a man who "has a thing for umbrellas."
"I thought he was kidding until he showed me a picture of himself surrounded by his umbrellas," he said. "He has 7,000 umbrellas in his house."
Mr. Mintz took from the shelf the first book that was moved and settled in its new home, a 1916 scientific paper in French called "La Science des Civilises et la Science Allemande," by a scientist identified on the title page only as Dr. Achalme. The second book moved was easier to figure out: Volume 1 of "The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science" (1960) by Isaac Asimov.
The movers themselves, Clancy-Cullen Storage Company of the Bronx, which has specialized in library moving for 15 years, have had a 30- to 40-man crew on the job for 10 weeks. To get the books to their new techno-home, it still takes old-fashioned muscle.
"It's just manpower and trucks and carts," said Gene Clancy, who owns the company and is overseeing the move with his daughter Rosemary. "There's no way to do it en masse."
He said: "Librarians, they're different people from you and me." He spoke affectionately. Their love for their artifacts, their books, has rubbed off on him, he said, though as an Irishman who keeps quotations from Yeats written in a notepad he carries, he may have been predisposed to such an infection.
"You treat a collection of books differently than you treat a collection of files," he said. "It's like taking care of a baby."
Ms. Clancy, younger and perhaps more pragmatic, walked with her father through the old stacks of the research library, now with vast rows of empty shelves creating an eerie, vacant matrix. Having been on the dusty site daily since the end of January, she seemed satisfied.
"It's really nice to walk through and see it all empty," she said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Little Changed as Traders Brace for New Employment Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed yesterday as currency traders braced for today's release of United States employment data for March, and for thin holiday trading.
Although the market consensus was that March data would match an expected downward revision in the February numbers, some market participants were unsure enough that they sold dollars to be prepared. 
 Trading was light yesterday because of Passover and ahead of Good Friday, when most European and United States financial markets will be closed. Most European markets and Hong Kong's markets will also be closed on Monday.
"We are dead in the water until the March employment data comes out, and then we might be the tree-falling-in-the-woods syndrome with no one to hear it," said Randolph L. Donney, director of capital markets research at Pegasus Econometric Group.
With few participants in today's market, any surprise in the employment numbers could have an exaggerated effect on the market, Mr. Donney said. "That's why people are coming in at all. They don't want to miss it."
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar edged up to 107.01 yen from 106.91 yen on Wednesday. The dollar was quoted at 1.4800 German marks, down from 1.4824 marks. The British pound strengthened to $1.5313 from $1.5260.
The dollar found some strength against the yen after Japan's top central banker yesterday clarified remarks he made Wednesday that caused the dollar to drop sharply.
The comments by the governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasuo Matsushita, had been taken by some as a signal that interest rates would rise. But Mr. Matsushita said yesterday that the bank was sticking with its strategy for recovery, which has been characterized by low interest rates.
"What Matsushita said the previous day was absolutely nothing new," said Lisa Finstrom, a senior currency analyst at Smith Barney. Yet traders were so panicky "the market moved on that," she said.
"It tells me that people are nervous about the state of the Japanese economy," she added.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Emerging markets have begun a comeback from a poor 1995.

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis 

 BODY:
THE world's emerging stock markets performed a sharp turnaround in the first quarter of this year, while developed stock markets rose at a modest pace when compared with last year.
In emerging markets from Poland and Turkey to China and Malaysia, stock markets did an about-face. According to the Morgan Stanley Capital International index, emerging markets rose 5.8 percent in dollar terms in the first quarter compared with declines in three of the four quarters last year. For all of 1995, emerging markets were off by 6.9 percent in dollar terms. 
 The rebound in emerging markets appears to indicate that investors have shrugged off last year's Mexican crisis, which knocked emerging markets worldwide into a tailspin.
"It sometimes looks as if confidence in emerging markets has built back up to the point where money is flowing not to cautious countries like Chile and South Africa but to high-risk ones like Venezuela and Turkey," said Kathleen Stephansen, an economist with the New York investment house of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Including the United States, the world's developed markets climbed 3.7 percent from January through March in dollar terms. While that was a respectable performace, it was less than any quarter of 1995, when the world index finished up 18.7 percent on the year.
Over all, the Morgan Stanley index shows that markets in 32 industrial and emerging economies rose in the first quarter while slipping in only 13.
As measured in dollars and without dividends being reinvested, Morgan Stanley cites Poland and Turkey as the quarter's best performers among emerging markets, with respective advances of 32.6 percent and 34.4 percent. Both, though, endured mild corrections in late March.
Other strong performers in Morgan Stanley's index included China, which includes Hong Kong; Malaysia; Venezuela; Portugal; Indonesia; Greece, and India, all of which reported first-quarter gains from 10 percent to 14 percent.
A separate index of stock markets in developing countries prepared by the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private investment arm, records even higher first-quarter gains, from 41 percent to 49 percent, in Hungary, Poland and Turkey, and rises of between 12 and 15 percent for Mexico, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Czech Republic and Zimbabwe.
The Morgan Stanley index and the International Finance one cover much the same emerging markets, but the two indexes sometimes turn in different results because they pick different stocks and ascribe different weightings to them. But for the first quarter, both indexes showed an overall rise of 5.6 percent for emerging markets.
Chile was the most disappointing emerging market, with a first-quarter fall of more than 8 percent on both indexes. Israel had the biggest fall among emerging markets in March, with a decline of 8.4 percent, as a wave of bombings raised fears for the future of the Middle East peace process; the Tel Aviv stock exchange fell 5.9 percent for the quarter as a whole.
Other emerging markets showing first-quarter declines included South Korea and Taiwan, both affected by political tensions with China, as well as South Africa, Jordan, Argentina, Colombia, Thailand and Pakistan.
Industrial world stock markets turned in solid, if more modest performances. The index of 22 developed countries showed Europe up 3.2 percent while the Far East ended 1.7 percent higher. The first-quarter performance in the Far East has already outstripped 1995, when that index rose just 1.3 percent. But the rise in Europe in the last three months fell short of the 5.6 percent rise in the period a year earlier.
Among industrialized countries, Morgan Stanley's star first-quarter performers are Sweden and France, with respective rises of 9.2 percent and 8 percent, reflecting lower short-term interest rates in both countries and commitments to bringing their public finances under control.
Switzerland had the industrialized world's best performance during March when stock prices rose 8.7 percent following the proposed merger between the pharmaceutical and chemical giants Ciba-Geigy and Sandox, giving the market a 6.5 percent rise for the quarter as a whole.

HEADLINE: Dow Retreats to 5,682.88 In Listless Trading Session

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
In a listless session that ended a holiday-shortened trading week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.86 points from Wednesday's record, to 5,682.88, a close that left it with a surge of 1.7 percent, or 95.74 points, for the week.
The market will be closed today in observance of Good Friday. 
 Traders focused on yesterday's initial public offering of Lucent Technologies, a spinoff of AT&T that climbed 3 5/8 from its offering price, to 30 5/8. With more than $3 billion worth of stock sold to the public, Lucent was not only the largest I.P.O. in Wall Street history, but also the most active initial offering, as more than 42 million shares changed hands on the first trading day. But elsewhere in the market volume was sluggish.
"It was a quiet day before the release of the employment numbers," said John Hammerschmidt, a partner of Turner Investment Partners in Philadelphia. "And they are numbers that none of us will be around to see."
Nevertheless, the Labor Department is scheduled to issue the employment and unemployment statistics for March. Last month, the release of a strong employment report caused stock prices to plunge; traders feared the Federal Reserve would not lower interest rates if the economy was too robust.
In the broader market yesterday, the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index eased 0.02 point, to 655.86. And the Nasdaq composite index rose 2.36 points, to 1,118.21.
Declines edged advances on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,201 to 1,066. Turnover slipped to 383.4 million shares, from 386.9 million shares on Wednesday.
Bond prices were also lower yesterday, with traders repositioning in advance of today's employment data. The price drop sent the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond up to 6.67 percent, from 6.62 percent Wednesday.
The Big Board, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq all observed a minute of silence at noon in memory of Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who died on Wednesday in a plane crash in Croatia, along with a delegation of American corporate executives.
Oil service stocks were the standouts yesterday, gaining in line with the increasing demand for oilfield equipment. BJ Services increased 4 1/8, to 37 3/8; Reading and Bates rose 1 3/4, to 22; Diamond Offshore Drilling added 3 5/8, to 49, and Falcon Drilling advanced 115/16 , to 25 1/2.
Airline issues gained, pushing the Dow Jones transportation average up 21.72 points, to 2,206.68. America West closed at 23 1/8, up 1; Delta Air Lines closed at 81 1/2, up 2 7/8, and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, closed at 92 3/8, up 2 1/2.
Some financial stocks retreated in keeping with rising bond yields. Wells Fargo dropped 2 1/8, to 259 1/8; J. P. Morgan declined 1 7/8, to 83 1/8, and BankAmerica fell 1 1/2, to 78 3/4.
Telephone companies also turned downward. Pacific Telesis closed at 33 1/4, off 5/8, and Bell South closed at 37 1/8, off 1.
General Nutrition
declined 1 1/2, to 21 1/4, a day after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock. Nautica fell 2 1/4, to 43 1/2, a day after it was downgraded by Montgomery Securities. And FTP Software sank 2 3/8, to 9 1/2, after saying that it would report a first-quarter loss.
However, Netscape, which held a meeting with analysts yesterday, advanced 2 3/8, to 45 5/8. Amerada Hess, which announced Wednesday the proposed sale of its Canadian unit, increased 2, to 57 3/4. And Amdahl, which said that it would buy Trecom Business Systems, rose 1 5/8, to 10 7/8.

HEADLINE: Exchanges Staying Put: First Coffee, Now Cotton

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
In the climax of months of negotiation and an intense rivalry with New Jersey, New York City officials announced yesterday that the Cotton Exchange had agreed to remain in New York.
In so doing, the Cotton Exchange joined the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in spurning the blandishments of New Jersey and accepting a package of incentives intended to keep both exchanges in New York City for the next 30 years. 
 "The vote by the Cotton Exchange to remain in the city is a tremendous vote of confidence in the city as the financial capital of the world," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said.
"We're ecstatic," said Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which was the agency responsible for the city's negotiations.
Mr. Millard said the $98 million in incentives that kept both exchanges and their 5,500 jobs from moving across the Hudson River to Jersey City would be returned to the city in less than a year through economic impact -- "tax revenues, the multiplier effect of dollars spent by people shopping at the corner deli, getting their dry cleaning done, paying their taxes."
He added, "In essence, we are forgoing 10 months of these kinds of tax revenues in order to keep them in perpetuity."
He also said that the $98 million in incentives was not a cash package, but instead represented reductions in rent, reductions in sales taxes when the exchanges built on new sites and reductions in real property taxes.
Stephen Place, chairman of the New York Cotton Exchange, declined to comment last night on the agreement, saying that the matter would be dealt with in a press release to be issued by the Cotton and Coffee Exchanges on Monday.
Last October, by offering one of the most lucrative packages of subsidies ever provided in the city, officials persuaded the board of the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchanges to cancel plans to move to Jersey City and instead to build a new trading center in New York City.
Officials described that decision as a critical victory in the economic development war with New Jersey, which had offered a valuable set of incentives to lure both the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange and the Cotton Exchange to the other side of the Hudson. The relocation plans of the two exchanges had been linked, and when the Coffee Exchange accepted New York's package, the Cotton Exchange agreed to reconsider a decision to move to Jersey City.
The exchanges represent 17 percent of the commodity trading volume in New York City and are planning to replace their current home at the World Trade Center with a new trading center in TriBeCa, on a site bounded by Murray, Warren, Greenwich and West Streets.
John S. Dyson, the departing Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, who had been involved in the negotiations for months, said that between October and yesterday, the city had not enriched its offer to the Cotton Exchange.
"Every once in a while," he said, "being a businessman, I know you have to stand pat and raise the ante. The advantages of New York as a world capital tipped the balance, even though New Jersey was quite desperately trying to get something, anything, to cross the river."

HEADLINE: Day of Barbs and Smirks in a Whitewater Trial

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., April 4

 BODY:
Beginning their cross-examination of the prosecution's star witness in the Whitewater-related loan fraud trial here, defense lawyers today drew forth admissions that the witness concocted other self-enrichment schemes like those involved in the charges, well before and after the association he said he had had with the defendants.
The fourth day of testimony for the witness, David Hale, was one in which earlier civility and courtliness fell away as Mr. Hale, defense lawyers and prosecutors directed barbs at one other. 
 At one point a defense lawyer, smirking at the jurors, congratulated Mr. Hale on how "slick" he was. At another, Mr. Hale smiled at the jury as he said he was sorry he had "upset" one of his questioners.
"I remember you when you used to be on the other side," said Sam Heuer, the defense lawyer for James B. McDougal, referring with barely concealed venom to the time in the 1970's when Mr. Hale was a prosecutor and, later, a municipal judge in Little Rock.
Mr. Hale, 54, who was president of a Federally subsidized small-business lending company, has pleaded guilty to loan fraud and been sentenced to prison. Prosecutors describe him as a co-conspirator with the defendants in the current trial, Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas, Mr. McDougal and Mr. McDougal's former wife, Susan. All of them were once close associates of President Clinton.
The three are charged with 21 counts of loan fraud and conspiracy; the case brought by the special Whitewater prosecutor, Kenneth W. Starr, charges that they used the money from Mr. McDougal's Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association and Mr. Hale's Capital Management Services, to shore up sinking real estate deals and support expensive life styles in 1986 and 1987.
Mr. Hale was asked today about more than a dozen loans that his company made to businesses headed, on paper at least, by his bookkeeper, his secretary, the wife of a young associate in his law firm and other business associates. In reality, he testified, the businesses were all created and controlled by him.
The loans, cited in questioning by Mr. Heuer and dating as far back as 1980, totaled more than $1.6 million. Mr. Hale conceded that the loans violated the Federal prohibition against small business investment company operators like himself personally benefitting from the money they lend. In some cases, Mr. Hale testified, he laundered portions of the money he lent to one of the companies he controlled by moving it through several other dummy corporations he had created, only to return it to the lending company as additional money he was investing in it.
In this way, he told the jury of nine women and three men, he could "leverage" even more in Federal contributions to his small business lending operation from the Small Business Administration. Under the Federal regulations for such lending companies, they could receive $3 in Federal money to lend out for every $1 in private money that was put into it.
After describing one of these schemes from a series of 1988 loans and transactions to which Mr. Hale has admitted but was never charged under his plea agreement, Mr. Heuer pointedly asked if his client, Mr. McDougal, had any involvement in the scheme.
"No," Mr. Hale said, adding quickly, "this was a wash through of funds, not like the Madison Guaranty loans."
Mr. Heuer grew angry and congratulated Mr. Hale for "dropping these hints" in the middle of his testimony.
Earlier in the day, W. Ray Jahn, the lead prosecutor, completed his questioning of Mr. Hale without attempting to elicit more testimony touching on whether Mr. Clinton knew about the fraudulent loans or was involved in the scheme. Mr. Hale testified Tuesday that he had had a meeting with Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton in 1986, at which the loans were discussed. Mr. Hale had earlier told prosecutors that during a chance encounter on the state Capitol steps, Mr. Clinton pressured him to complete the loan, an assertion that Mr. Clinton has adamantly denied. But that potentially more damaging charge, indicating a greater involvement by Mr. Clinton in an illegal transaction, will apparently not be allowed in court. A defense lawyer later suggested that the judge saw the conversation as irrelevant to the charges against Mr. McDougal and Mr. Tucker.
As Mr. Hale was completing his direct examination, he told of the time in 1987 that he was with Mr. Tucker as he was writing out a check to the Internal Revenue Service for "more than a million dollars."
"He said, 'This is what your small business investment company has done for me,' " Mr. Hale recalled in testimony, saying that Mr. Tucker, who was then in private business had prospered by having the use of the loan money that was supposed to go to minority and economically and socially disadvantaged small businesses. "He was very pleased."
But then in 1991 as Federal bank regulators and the F.B.I. were closing in on the activities of Madison and his company, Mr. Hale was scared and was lying to investigators.

HEADLINE: Study Recommends The Yankees Move To a West Side Site

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
A consulting firm's recommendation that the Yankees move from the Bronx to the West Side of Manhattan was based on the conclusion that a new ball park along the Hudson River would produce a significant increase in attendance, higher prices for luxury seats and an enhanced image for New York City.
The report, jointly commissioned by the city, the state and the Yankees, studied four options, including renovating the current Yankee Stadium, but came down solidly in favor of a West Side stadium with a retractable domed roof that could be used for baseball, football, concerts and conventions. The cost for such a stadium would be $1.06 billion, it said. 
 Although he has insisted that he wants the team to remain in the South Bronx, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has pitched the West Side site as the most attractive lure to keep the Yankees from relocating to New Jersey, and the best way to avoid a repetition of the Dodgers' move from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1958.
The Yankees' lease in the Bronx expires in 2002, and the team's principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, has made it clear that he is dissatisfied with the team's 73-year-old home in the South Bronx, complaining about security, parking, traffic and sanitation.
The West Side recommendation is not a surprise and matches the desires of several parties. Since 1993, when Gov. Mario M. Cuomo first proposed it, the site between 30th and 33d streets and 10th and 11th avenues has been deemed by the state and city as the prime option to the team's staying in the Bronx stadium.
The report, by the consulting team assembled by the architectural firm of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum of Kansas City, Mo., provides an economic argument to bolster that selection. The consultants concluded that a dual-sport stadium on the West Side would produce almost $200 million in annual revenues, compared with $96 million for the existing Yankee Stadium site, and even less for two other sites in the Bronx, Pelham Bay Park and Van Cortlandt Park, both of which were deemed unsuitable. .
Part of the increased revenues would come from higher ticket sales, the study said. It said that in a West Side park, Yankee attendance would grow by 50 percent, to more than 40,000 per game. A renovated or rebuilt stadium in the South Bronx would produce a 30 percent increase, the report said.
The report said a 50,000-seat baseball-only park "would provide a strong image" for the "relocated franchise." A two-sport stadium seating 70,000 "would provide an unparalleled location," and assumes that a football team play there. The Jets' lease at Giants Stadium runs through 2008.
The $600,000 report also considered whether the playing field should be grass or artificial turf. While it made no recommendation of either, it suggested that an artificial surface would allow for more flexible scheduling of conventions and other events and thus produce significantly more revenue.
The new stadium would be owned by New York State and New York City and financed through bonds. Mayor Giuliani said this week that the West Side proposal would be easier to finance than any other site, because "the revenue stream from a stadium in the middle of Manhattan would be off the charts."
Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr. Steinbrenner, who ultimately must decide whether to stay in the Bronx, move to Manhattan or move to New Jersey, declined to comment last night. "The report speaks for itself and we'll leave it at that," he said.
Two of the biggest obstacles faced by the city and state in building at the West Side are traffic and parking. The site is next to Route 9A, where congestion is heavy and expected to escalate as reconstruction of the scaled-down Westway project takes place into the next century. Road construction around the proposed stadium site is expected to start in 1999.
But the consultants said that the massive traffic jams predicted by opponents of the West Side site can be avoided through improved traffic circulation, coordinating events with the Javits Center and Madison Square Garden and direct ramp connections from the Lincoln Tunnel.
The consultants' report provoked immediate criticism yesterday from some politicians who advocate keeping the Yankees in their current stadium. But it was also greeted by cheers from some business people near the site of the West Side rail yards, a neighborhood where decades of decline have driven residents and merchants away.
"When you pay the kind of money the city paid to get the conclusion they wanted, it should not come as a shock to anyone that they are recommending the West Side of Manhattan," said Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, who disputed the report's findings that such a stadium would not create huge traffic jams in the neighborhood.
"The conclusion is utter fantasy," he said. "You would be creating the biggest traffic jam in the Western Hemisphere."
He also charged that the estimate of the cost of building on the rail yards was too low. "They are laying the groundwork for a raid on the city treasury," he said.
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, also disputed findings in an executive summary of the consultants' report, which were read to her by a reporter.
"The summary of findings seems suspect. It is not clear to me what transportation opportunities there are on the West Side rail yard. It is clear to anyone who visits the Javits Convention Center now that there is no easy transit access to the neighborhood."
Some business people along Ninth Avenue, near the West Side rail yards, were all but ecstatic over the consultants' findings.
A new stadium "would be the greatest thing that could ever happen to the West Side," said James Dell'Orto, owner of Manganaro Hero Boy, a restaurant that has operated on Ninth Avenue between 37th and 38th streets for 70 years. "God bless the Mayor, God bless Pataki and God bless Steinbrenner."
Financing for the study came equally from the state, city and team, all of whom have an interest in finding the most lucrative way to keep the Yankees from crossing the Hudson. In selecting Hellmuth, Obata, one of the country's top sports architects, for the study, the city and state aligned with a firm that would be qualified to design a new stadium.
The study, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, explicitly says that if the state and city want to issue bonds to build a stadium, it would be just as expensive at any of the other sites that were examined.
According to Hellmuth, Obata, renovating Yankee Stadium would cost $770.5 million. A completely new stadium there, which could be built next to the existing one, would cost $944.8 million. A baseball stadium in Pelham Bay Park would cost $910.2 million; a baseball-football stadium, $1.2 billion. A baseball stadium in Van Cortlandt Park would cost $1.09 billion; a two-sport facility, $1.4 billion.
The Pelham Bay and Van Cortlandt sites were rejected for their negligible transportation and mass transit systems, limited economic impact and environmental problems that could lead to litigation, the report found.
Although critics have raised significant questions about traffic and access, the report takes an optimistic view. The study says the existing nexus of subway and railroad connections "are extensive and afford this site a major advantage for all size events" and "would reduce expected traffic loads on the street network." However, none of the train connections discharge passengers closer than Eighth Avenue.
Limited parking has been a problem at the Javits Center, but the study proposes building garages with 3,000 spaces. It cites game-time availability of 5,000 to 8,000 existing spaces within a 15-minute walk.
A huge shift in how fans travel to games is predicted. Currently, 85 percent of Yankee fans now arrive in the Bronx by car, 15 percent by mass transit.
To get to the West Side, the study assumes that 45 percent to 65 percent of fans to arrive by mass transit, 25 percent by automobile and 10 percent by taxi.
The Yankees are apparently hoping that a West Side stadium will develop new fans, among them tourists in Manhattan and people who do not now go to Yankee games. Currently, about 60 percent of Yankee fans travel from New Jersey, Connecticut, Westchester and upstate, mostly by car.
About 32 percent come from Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island. But only 6 percent come from Manhattan.
The study argues that Manhattan would provide a stunning financial boost to the Yankees. Not only does it predict that a riverfront stadium would spur greater spending on tickets, concessions and parking, it also finds that the West Side option would do the following:
*Generate much more interest in renting high-priced luxury suites. The study predicts that in a baseball-only stadium, 120 luxury suites could be sold for $125,000 each; for a bigger, dual-sport stadium, it says 220 suites could be sold for $175,000 each. Yankee Stadium, which now has 19 suites, would accommodate only 65 suites if renovated or rebuilt.
*Produce greater sales of expensive seats. The study reckons that a West Side stadium could sell 8,000 seats at about $3,000 apiece. In Yankee Stadium, a maximum of 6,000 expensive seats are predicted.
*Make possible the sale of personal seat licenses, one-time fees that entitle buyers of season tickets the right to buy the same seat for a set period of time. The study predicts that 5,000 personal seat licenses could sell for $5,000 each for baseball fans, 15,000 at the same price for football fans. Potentially, a dual-sport stadium could raise $100 million toward construction by selling personal seat licenses.
*Let a company pay more to put its name on the stadium. The study says a company would pay $1.5 million a year for naming rights at a baseball facility, $2.5 million at a two-sport stadium, twice what the other sites could charge.
Although the study greatly favors the West Side, is does not rule out Yankee Stadium. The report discusses renovating it by widening it by 40 feet, building a three-story Hall of Fame and retail-entertainment complex and erecting a Metro-North railroad station.
The plan would also require huge renovations to the Major Deegan Expressway and Harlem River Drive; rehabilitation of the subway stations, addition of a second bridge across the Harlem River and garages with 2,000 new parking spaces.
The study also considered building a new stadium north of 161st Street in Macombs Dam Park and the razing of the old stadium to build three garages. But ultimately it decided that neither plan would come close to producing the money a West Side park would.
"The stadium's current economic impact on the community is limited," the study says, "and the impact of a new or renovated facility is not estimated to result in the development of measurable new commercial establishments."

HEADLINE: CRASH IN THE BALKANS: THE OVERVIEW;
Bad Equipment Tied to Crash, Perry Suggests

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
Defense Secretary William J. Perry suggested today that malfunctioning instruments may have caused the crash of an Air Force jet that took the life of Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and at least 32 others in Croatia on Wednesday.
Returning from a trip to Egypt, Mr. Perry told reporters on his plane, "It was a classic sort of accident that good instrumentation should be able to prevent." 
 He did not specify whether he was referring to instruments on the ground or in the plane. Mr. Brown's plane, a military version of the Boeing 737, smashed into a mountain near Dubrovnik, the storied port on the Adriatic Sea.
More than 36 hours after the crash, it was still not clear how many passengers were aboard, though it was evident there were no survivors. After rescue teams searched all Wednesday night and all day today, hampered by fog and rain, Miomir Zuzul, the Croatian Ambassador to the United States, said they had discovered 33 bodies. The Pentagon used the same figure.
But the plane's manifest, issued by the State Department, listed 35 people: Mr. Brown and 11 Commerce Department aides, including Charles F. Meissner, Assistant Secretary for International Trade, whose wife, Doris, heads the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and William Morton, Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Economic Development; Lee F. Jackson, an American working at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; James M. Lewek, a Central Intelligence Agency analyst; a photographer and an interpreter from the American Embassy in Zagreb; 12 business executives, 6 crew members and Nathaniel C. Nash, Frankfurt bureau chief of The New York Times.
Unable to fully explain the discrepancy, Glyn Davies, a State Department spokesman, said at an afternoon briefing: "We've made every effort with regards to this list to confirm its accuracy, and there are no indications that anyone listed on this manifest was not on the plane that crashed."
Mr. Davies added tonight: "The condition of the remains is such that it's difficult to say with certainty that there are 33 or 35 bodies there."
The cause of the crash was no clearer today than on Wednesday, but a few more details emerged. It was established, for example, that Cilipi Airport, southeast of Dubrovnik, had no instrument landing system -- the sophisticated aid to bad-weather navigation that major airports use. It was a casualty of the 1991 war. But the airport has a less advanced system, a VHF Omnidirectional Radio beacon, or VOR, that should have sufficed.
"People in Dubrovnik say that it was the worst storm they have seen in a decade," said Peter Galbraith, the United States Ambassador to Croatia. "The plane was not where it should have been. It seems to have flown up not along the coast but along a valley one ridge over."
Lieut. Gen. Howell Estes, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that many aircraft had landed at Cilipi without difficulty, including several during the foul weather on Wednesday, both before and after the accident.
No one disputed that the plane was almost two miles off course.
Mr. Brown's body was identified by Gen. Michael Canavan, commander of a special team supervising the recovery, the White House said. Fourteen bodies were carried down from Mt. Saint John, where the plane crashed, to a temporary morgue set up at the Dubrovnik airport, before work was halted for the night.
In Washington, John O'Sullivan, deputy to Daniel S. Pearson, a former judge, who as independent counsel had been heading an investigation into Mr. Brown's financial affairs, announced that the inquiry had been closed. He said a decision would be made soon whether to hand off investigations of Mr. Brown's son, Michael, and some of his business associates to another agency.
President Clinton, still stunned by the loss, attended a brief prayer service for Mr. Brown this morning at St. John's Church, across Lafayette Square from the White House. Along with scores of other Administration officials, the President took part in a responsive reading from Isaiah Chapter 40, verses 28 to 31, which included a passage much loved by the late Commerce Secretary:
"They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; and they shall walk and not faint."
Noting that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King had been killed in Memphis 28 years ago today, the President declared that like the slain civil rights leader, "Our colleagues in the Commerce Department and the other Federal agencies, United States military and the business leaders who died outside Dubrovnik were answering a very important challenge of this time."
Mr. Clinton spent much of the afternoon on the telephone in an effort to reach the families of all the Americans who died in the crash. Late this afternoon the White House said the President had spoken with relatives of all the Government employees who died and was moving on to the crew and the businessmen.
No funeral plans for Mr. Brown were announced. The family planned to meet today to discuss arrangements, and it appeared probable that the service would be next week.
Inevitably, Washington being Washington, speculation sprang up about a successor to Mr. Brown. The name most mentioned was that of Thomas F. McLarty, the former White House Chief of Staff, a close friend of the President's from Arkansas and an experienced, widely traveled former energy executive.
Although Prime Minister Zlatko Matesa of Croatia said that a voice recorder had been recovered from the tail of the plane, senior American military officers here and in Europe said the plane carried no such equipment. Nor, they insisted, did it carry a "black box" of the type that records technical data on commercial planes. The T-43 plane involved was delivered two decades ago as a training plane for navigators, and when it was converted to carry what the Air Force calls "distinguished visitors," no voice or data recorders were added, according to Maj. Laura Feldman, a spokeswoman for the Air Force.
All the VIP aircraft that operate from Andrews Air Force Base just outside Washington, including Air Force One, carry such recorders, but the plane that crashed was stationed at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.
Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, ranking minorty member of the military procurement subcommittee of the National Security Committee, said the Air Force had probably skipped the recorders as "a cost saver."
The absence of the recorders will complicate investigation of the tragedy. But some data will be available, including recordings of conversations between the plane and the control tower at Cilipi, which gave no hint of trouble, and recordings made on board an Awacs radar plane that was in the area.
Mr. Brown, 54, was leading a delegation of corporate executives who were exploring investment in the Balkans in the aftermath of the war in Bosnia. Mr. Lewek, 44, the C.I.A. analyst, was a member of the agency's Balkan Task Force. He was on the trip to provide Mr. Brown with detailed information on the possibilities of economic reconstruction in the region.
From 1990 to 1995, Mr. Lewek ran the staff that produces the President's Daily Brief, a very highly classified news digest that the agency distributes to a tiny handful of senior national political and military leaders.

Defect Found in Water Mains
 
A huge water main break in Astoria, Queens, last winter was caused by defective pipe, officials said. Tests show that large sections of the 9,000-foot-long pipe are of equally poor quality, and will have to be replaced or repaired. [Page A1.]
 
Report Favors New Stadium
 
A consultant's recommendation that the Yankees move from the Bronx to Manhattan's West Side was based on the conclusion that a new ball park along the Hudson River would produce a significant increase in attendance, higher prices for luxury seats and an enhanced image for New York City. [A1.]
 
Conflict Seen in Agency Bid
 
When a Queens social-services organization was trying to gain a multimillion-dollar contract with the city, it sent Albert J. Farina, a veteran official with the Department of Employment, to the city agency that was evaluating competing bids. Mr. Farina had been offered a job by the Queens agency, and six months later, Mr. Farina took a $75,000-a-year position with it. Mr. Farina's role appears to have violated city conflict-of-interest rules. [B1.]
 
New Home for Books and Bytes
 
More than one million books -- dealing with business, economics, chemistry, physics and mathematics -- have been moved from the New York Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42d Street to their new home, the Science, Industry and Business Library, at Madison Avenue and 34th Street. The new library, to open on May 2, will be an interactive research institution that may well be unmatched in the access to information it gives to the public. [B1.]
 
A Deputy Mayor Resigns
 
Further consolidating his inner circle of trusted aides in top jobs, Mayor Giuliani said that John S. Dyson would step down as Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, and would be replaced by Fran Reiter, a close political confidante. [B1.]
 
Is Mass Transit Slipping?
 
New York's subway and bus system strikes many riders as fraying at the edges once more after years of an inspired comeback. The Transit Authority insists it isn't so, but hours of random subway riding have bolstered a nagging sense that there has been a pronounced, and worrisome, slippage since services were cut and the fare was raised to $1.50. NYC by Clyde Haberman. [B1.]
 
Abuse Seen in Baby's Death
 
The New York City Medical Examiner said that violent shaking had caused fatal brain injuries to a 5-month-old Queens baby, Mariah Scoon, whose parents fought to keep her on a ventilator after she had been declared brain-dead. The parents have denied that they abused the baby, and their lawyer said that the death of the baby was due to medical problems. [B3.]
 
Cotton Exchange Won't Move
 
New York City officials announced that the Cotton Exchange had agreed to remain in New York. In so doing, the Cotton Exchange joined the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in spurning the blandishments of New Jersey and accepting a package of incentives intended to keep both exchanges in New York City for the next 30 years. [B6.]
 
Court Rules on Notification
 
New York's highest court said that the state could not release the names on a registry of suspected child abusers to adoption and foster-care agencies without conducting a thorough inquiry into the accusations against those listed. The ruling was not expected to affect the way the state runs the 23-year-old registry; changes in the system were made in response to a 1994 decision by a Federal appeals court. [B5.]
 
Remembering a Son of Harlem
 
Ron Brown, the Secretary of Commerce, who died in a plane crash in Croatia, grew up in an apartment atop the Hotel Theresa in Harlem. He may have made his mark in Washington, but his old friends say his heart never left Harlem. [A13.]
 
Police officers shot and wounded suspected robbers in separate incidents in Queens and on Staten Island, officials said. [B5.]
 
CONNECTICUT
 
Deficiencies Found at A-Plant
 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has found design deficiencies at the Millstone 3 nuclear power plant in Connecticut. The Commission said the problems were so serious that it had asked the plant's owner, Northeast Utilities, to provide it with information to determine whether the plant's license "should be suspended, modified or revoked."

Newark Plans Sports Complex
 
City officials in Newark plan to build a 6,000-seat stadium downtown in an effort to revive minor league baseball there, where the Newark Bears drew crowds to Ruppert Stadium in the 1930's and 40's. The ball park will be part of a $20 million complex that will include a soccer stadium. [B4.]

HEADLINE: Yet Another Shift in Mayor's Circle: Deputy Mayor for Finance Leaves

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Further consolidating his inner circle of trusted aides in top jobs, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that John S. Dyson would step down as Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development and would be replaced by Fran Reiter, a political confidante.
The changes follow by one week Mr. Giuliani's decision to place another loyal ally, Howard Safir, in the Police Commissioner's job, which was part of a flurry of other top-level shifts in the upper ranks of the administration. 
 As Deputy Mayor for economic development, Mr. Dyson negotiated deals to keep businesses in the city and also served as the Mayor's primary voice on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. But Mr. Dyson was also sometimes considered a liability to the Mayor. His acerbic wit and bluntness got him into trouble on more than one occasion, forcing Mr. Giuliani to distance himself from comments made by the Deputy Mayor that were considered to be insensitive.
Ms. Reiter, in her role as Deputy Mayor for Planning and Community Relations, has developed a reputation as a tough negotiator who nonetheless was able to build consensus in the city's notoriously combative constituencies. And since her days as the Mayor's deputy campaign manager, she has been considered one of the Mayor's most loyal appointees.
While the Mayor portrayed the series of resignations and new appointments as a fact of political life in any government, the recent changes reflect an unusual amount of turnover for an administration whose top tier has otherwise remained remarkably stable in the Mayor's 27 months in office.
With his choices, Mr. Giuliani appears to have brought some of his most trusted appointees into his inner circle of advisers. Mr. Dyson, a Democrat, and the departing Police Commissioner, William J. Bratton, came into the Mayor's administration as relative outsiders and proved to be lightning rods for attention, and now both have been replaced with appointees much closer to the Mayor as he prepares for an expected re-election bid next year.
"My view of change in an institution is that it's a good thing," Mr. Giuliani said. "Change always means that things get revitalized. People take a fresh look at things."
Mr. Dyson, whose departure had been rumored for months, said he wanted to return to overseeing his family's considerable business holdings, including the Millbrook Vineyards winery in Dutchess County and an investment company founded by his father. Because he is independently wealthy, Mr. Dyson accepted only $1 a year for his services.
The Mayor said Mr. Dyson will remain an unpaid adviser on a number of major projects, including negotiations over a new Yankee Stadium. He will also keep his position as one of the Mayor's four appointees on the M.T.A., where he has vigorously argued against transit fare increases.
Both the Mayor and Mr. Dyson made light of the Deputy Mayor's outspoken nature during yesterday's news conference. While explaining that Mr. Dyson would keep his office in City Hall, the Mayor said, "You'll still have John to kick around, if you want, and the good thing about John is, he'll be here to kick you back."
But Mr. Dyson's outspokenness was not always something the Mayor could smile about. Just months after Mr. Giuliani took office, Mr. Dyson fell under the spotlight with a memorandum on welfare reform that was roundly criticized as racially insensitive. Referring to an article in The New York Daily News that had referred to the Mayor and First Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers as "two white men with no City Hall experience who must hold an increasingly diverse immigrant city together," Mr. Dyson wrote in his note to the Mayor, "Do not worry, two white guys have been running this city of immigrants for over 200 years."
Mr. Dyson also attracted unwanted attention when, in a dispute with the New York City Comptroller over whether to rehire a company owned by a black woman to sell the city's bonds, he said, "The Comptroller ought to know the difference between a bid and a watermelon." Mr. Dyson later apologized for the comment, saying he had not intended it to be offensive.
Yesterday, he was more introspective about his sometimes combative style. "I think it's important for people trying to do the things that I'm trying to do to be willing to break eggs to make an omelet," he said. "There's a lot of theory around to never do anything risky, but I don't think that's a role for somebody like myself who's trying to make bold changes."
Ruth W. Messinger, Borough President of Manhattan, said Mr. Dyson was not always considered effective in his economic development work. "He was not seen as an ally by many people in the business community," she said.
Ms. Reiter, on the other hand, "has been responsive to many community concerns and interests," added Ms. Messinger, a frequent critic of the Mayor. "And this will pose a totally new challenge to her."
Raymond B. Harding, leader of the state's Liberal Party and one of the Mayor's closest political allies, heartily praised the promotion of Ms. Reiter, who also is a former chairwoman of the state's Liberal Party.
"She has a trait which is of high value in that she's a closer," he said. "She puts a deal together and all parties are happy, and that's an ability that is highly prized in government."
Ms. Reiter, for her part, seemed undaunted by the prospect of filling Mr. Dyson's shoes.
"I have a pretty well deserved reputation for being outspoken on my own," she said. "In fact, one of the reasons John and I have worked so well together is that while we both have pretty strong personalities, we have had a very common vision of what the Mayor wanted for the city and what we had to do to get there."
Hank Morris, a Democratic political consultant, said Ms. Reiter's promotion was a clear sign that the Mayor has chosen to surround himself with loyal people.
"There's no doubt they are circling the wagons here," he said. "And the circle is getting smaller and smaller all the time."

HEADLINE: CRASH IN THE BALKANS: THE ISSUES;
Plane Crash in Croatia Silenced A Big Player in Capital Debates

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
When Ronald H. Brown died on a hillside near Dubrovnik, Croatia, on Wednesday, he was in the thick of three battles here that touched the divergent roles he played in Washington.
The first was a continuing struggle within the Administration -- sometimes still heated three years after it began -- over the degree to which the nation's commercial interests should drive its foreign policy agenda. 
 As Commerce Secretary, Mr. Brown often argued fiercely for what he called "commercial diplomacy," the use of America's clout abroad to create jobs at home, a stark counterpoint to the "high diplomacy" of the cold war. But there was always resistance, and many wonder whether, without Mr. Brown's high-profile circuiting of the globe, that approach will prove a permanent legacy of the Clinton Administration, or whether it could slowly dissolve.
His second battle was to save the Commerce Department from a Republican-dominated Congress that viewed it as a ripe target for disassembly or outright abolition. With his trademark passion, Mr. Brown called this "unilateral disarmament" in the face of Japanese and European competition, and was winning the argument. But without him, many in the Administration said today, the issue is bound to arise again.
And the third battle centered on Mr. Brown's true passion in life: politics. His death deprives the Clinton Administration of its most visible black Cabinet member and its bridge to black voters, even though some prominent blacks were concerned that Mr. Brown was a bit too much of an insider, too interested in compromise. Mr. Brown was just beginning to try again to work the magic that he performed as chairman of the Democratic National Committee: to energize both the left wing of the party, which has often been disillusioned by the Clinton Administration, and the conservative, largely white middle class that has its own, very different reservations.
"You just don't find people who have feet planted so firmly in different camps the way Ron did, and who can bridge such yawning chasms," said Mickey Kantor, who worked side-by-side with Mr. Brown managing the 1992 campaign, and then again negotiating the intricacies of a new world of international trade as the United States trade representative. "There are some things in this world you just can't replace."
In the weeks before his death, Mr. Brown was playing down his behind-the-scenes role in preparations for the coming campaign, in part because the financial dealings that were under investigation effectively precluded him from any formal role in the campaign. But it was hardly a secret that he had begun showing up at the small weekly meetings at the White House of the President's closest political advisers.
"I'm really not a political strategist these days," the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee said a few weeks ago, with the broad smile he used to suggest that he didn't believe a word of what he just uttered, and didn't expect anyone else to, either.
"This is a man who had the campaign in his blood," Carl R. Wagner, a Washington consultant and one of Mr. Brown's closest confidants, said today. "And just as he knew that the problem in 1992 was how to focus entirely on the economy, this year he knew that the question was how to energize a re-election campaign and how to get people out of the stands. That's what he was worrying about."
But for Mr. Brown, the campaign and his job at the Commerce Department merged into one. And that was particularly evident in the symbolism of his 15 trips abroad with corporate executives, many of whom would never think of voting for a Democrat for President.
For Mr. Brown, the trade mission was the message, and the message was that the United States would no longer divorce its relationships around the world from the creation of jobs for Americans.
"We are the bridge between domestic and foreign policy," he said of the Commerce Department in December. "And what that means is that commercial interests are now on an equal par with security in the world of foreign policy."
But it was never quite that simple, as Mr. Brown acknowledged in his more candid moments. While Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin all uttered similar sentiments when the discussion was abstract, their institutions often fought back when the issue boiled down to hard cases.
China is a prime example. Mr. Brown would readily acknowledge that the United States had far broader interests than simply selling airplanes or telephone systems.
But often he argued for toning down or delaying criticism of Beijing that might be likely to result in nothing but retaliation against American business interests.
In the mid-levels of the State Department and the Pentagon, Mr. Brown's position was frequently characterized as mercantilist and some feared it would undercut America's moral authority around the world. Mr. Brown and his defenders portrayed themselves as realists.
"There are a thousand issues that can arise in a post-cold-war world -- human rights, the environment, corruption, overseas military bases -- that if they are handled wrong will create great handicaps for the American economy," said Jeffrey Garten, his under secretary for nearly three years. "And I think that if the result of his death is that the scales tip back to the way it was when the Clinton Administration came into office, that would be a setback."
Both Mr. Kantor and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the National Economic Council, said today that would not happen. "There are larger forces at work here and the reality is that no nation can back away from making these kinds of concerns as important as 'high diplomacy,' " Ms. Tyson said. "But I'm sure it won't be a smooth path in that direction, and I don't know of anyone who can articulate the need for this kind of change in public the way Ron could."
Congress discovered that power of articulation this fall, as the Republicans heated up their campaign to slice the Commerce Department to shreds, spreading its vital functions all over the Government and eliminating anything that was left. Mr. Brown, colleagues recall, did not at first consider their threat to be serious. He later decided he was wrong, and began a full-force campaign, enlisting corporate executives he knew from his travels to press their Republican friends to back off.
"There wasn't much support for his position," one colleague recalled today. "So he created the ground swell himself."
Surprised at the reach of Mr. Brown's Rolodex and the success of his gentle arm-twisting, the Republicans backed off. But without him in charge, they have another chance as the 1997 budget is debated.
Meanwhile, even the White House was a bit stunned today by the outpouring of condolences from foreign leaders. Many of them had been on the receiving end of that mix of smooth charm and stiff persuasion Mr. Brown used to close deals for American goods.
"They had seen American diplomats before," one of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers said today. "They had seen canny politicians, and African-Americans with power. They had seen businessmen with order books in their hands. But they had never seen all of that in one package."

HEADLINE: Gene Tests: What You Know Can Hurt You

BYLINE: By Barbara Koenig; Barbara Koenig, a senior researcher at the Stanford University Center for Biomedical Ethics, co-directs the program in genomics, ethics and society.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
Last year, it was discovered that 1 percent of Ashkenazi Jewish women, those of Central or Eastern European ancestry, carry a mutated form of a gene that might predispose them to breast and ovarian cancer.
After this discovery, a surgeon who operates on women with breast cancer told me that a day rarely passes when a patient does not ask about "the gene test." 
 Even with this demand, however, almost all leading scientists and two major commercial testing laboratories agreed informally not to offer the test for the mutation to the general public because widespread testing would do more harm than good.
That consensus was broken recently by Dr. Joseph D. Schulman, director of the Genetics and I.V.F. Institute in Fairfax, Va. The doctor, who advertised the service on the World Wide Web, says it will give women access to valuable information. But in genetic testing, what you know won't necessarily help you -- indeed, it might even hurt you.
As Alice Wexler points out in "Mapping Fate," her book about genetically determined Huntington's Disease, Americans' strong bias for information leads them to believe in genetic testing. Doing something, anything, to counter illness is considered the brave and correct approach.
But testing for the 185delAG mutation does not help most women. A positive test does not mean you will get cancer, and a negative test does not mean that you won't.
Most scientists agree that the mutation occurs in families in which many members have suffered from breast and ovarian cancer. But leaping to the conclusion that a mutation inevitably leads to cancer, especially for women without a family history, reflects a naive genetic determinism and ignores the possible effects of the environment and other genes on one's health.
But let's assume that a woman from a high-risk family tests positive. What then? There is no guaranteed way to prevent cancer or detect it early. Some desperate women do resort to drastic measures such as surgically removing their breasts.
Paradoxically, this isn't the recommended treatment for many women already diagnosed with cancer. For a decade, more doctors have recommended and more women, especially those with small tumors, have chosen instead to have lumpectomies.
Knowing your genetic makeup can also create profound emotional and financial problems. For example, a spouse might use this information in a custody dispute. Or a woman might decide not to have children, for fear of passing on the gene. But if she decides to adopt, will she be approved by an agency? And should a 9-year-old girl be tested for the mutation?
The test brings up other thorny questions that may be better left unexplored. For instance, with current technology, a woman could test a fetus for the gene and then abort it. In his ad, Dr. Schulman suggests that his Genetics and I.V.F. Institute may be able to screen embryos for the gene mutation.
There are also real economic repercussions. Women could face discrimination from employers and health insurers. And most physicians have little experience with ordering and interpreting genetic tests that determine a woman's cancer risk (and in guiding families through the turmoil generated by the results.)
Until basic research on the clinical significance of the 185delAG mutation is complete, there is no justification for widespread screening. Unfortunately, nothing prevents laboratories from offering genetic tests, nor are there any regulations to insure the quality of the tests.
In March, a Federal task force on testing suggested possible regulatory strategies, from requiring Food and Drug Administration approval for new tests to strengthening the laws that govern labs.
Either approach would slow down the premature commercialization of testing. Strict regulation may be unpopular among those who believe that women have a right to this information. But extreme caution should be the order of the day.

HEADLINE: Dollar Up in Thin Trading After Report of Rise in Jobs

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose in thin trading yesterday after a report showing strong job growth in the United States convinced currency traders that the Federal Reserve would not cut interest rates anytime soon.
The Labor Department said that the economy added 140,000 nonfarm jobs last month, more than twice what many analysts had expected. It also lowered its estimate of February job growth by a smaller margin than many analysts had anticipated, to 624,000 jobs from 705,000. 
 "Now the Fed won't ease, and it may hike rates," said Karl Halligan, strategic currency trader at CIC Bank in New York. "I think the dollar can go a lot higher."
The prospect of steady or higher rates helps the dollar by making United States deposits more attractive. That is especially true at a time when many analysts think European rates are headed lower.
But trading was very light yesterday, exaggerating price movements. Most European markets were closed for Good Friday and banks in the United States deployed only skeletal trading staffs. European markets will also be closed on Monday.
In shortened New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 107.68 Japanese yen, up from 107.01 yen on Thursday. The dollar edged up to 1.4835 German marks, from 1.4800 marks. The British pound fell to $1.5290 from $1.5313.
A sharp drop in United States bond prices kept the dollar from rising further, traders said. Lower bond prices weigh on the dollar because foreign investors selling American assets frequently convert the proceeds into other currencies.
While the Federal Reserve is now seen as maintaining a steady interest-rate stance, the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, is likely to reduce rates this quarter to bolster growth, analysts said. The German economy contracted in the fourth quarter and probably shrank in the first quarter as well.
To be sure, any rally by the dollar may be hampered if foreign investors dump American bonds, and if weakness among bonds spreads to the stock market, which was closed yesterday.
"My feeling is stocks will get hit hard, which will probably hurt the dollar early next week," said Stephen Jury, chief currency trader at Union Bank of Switzerland.
Still, many traders do not expect the dollar to escape its recent narrow ranges in the next two weeks. For the last month, the dollar has traded between 1.4660 marks and 1.4922 marks and 104.94 yen and 108.00 yen.

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Rose Sharply In February

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
Americans' installment debt grew in February at the fastest pace in eight months as each of the major categories of consumer credit posted sharp gains.
The Federal Reserve said today that consumer installment credit shot up 13.9 percent at an annual rate, the steepest since rising 14.4 percent last June. The $12 billion increase was the biggest since a $12.8 billion advance last May. 
 The increase pushed up total consumer debt to $1.048 trillion, 14 percent higher than in February 1995. Many analysts had expected debt to grow just $10 billion, down from $10.9 billion in January, when credit rose at a 12.7 percent rate.
Consumer credit includes all household debt not secured by real estate.
Analysts contend that consumers eventually will have to rein in their borrowing as debt levels climb and income growth remains relatively slack. In fact, there already have been reports of growing delinquency rates in several areas.
This generates concerns about the pace of consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
Spending grew just 1.2 percent during the final three months of 1995, down from gains of 2.8 percent in the third quarter and 3.4 percent in the second quarter.
But in February, revolving credit, which includes credit cards, jumped $6.4 billion, the biggest advance since $7.4 billion last May. The 19 percent annualized gain was the steepest since 20.5 percent in June. The increase pushed total revolving debt to $407.2 billion.
Automobile loans rose by $3 billion, a 10.3 percent annualized gain, and pushed motor vehicle debt to $359.3 billion.
The credit category that includes loans for mobile homes, education, boats, trailers and vacations increased $2.6 billion. The 11.3 percent rate of advance lifted this debt category to $281.2 billion.

HEADLINE: Vietnam Will Regret Courting Tobacco

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your April 2 front-page article on efforts by Senator Jesse Helms to make sure North Carolina tobacco gains opportunities in Southeast Asia:
Ambassador Le Van Bang of Vietnam would do well to keep Senator Helms and the tobacco industry at arm's length. Last fall I spent five months in Vietnam conducting surveys about cigarette smoking. We found that 73 percent of the men and 4 percent of the women there smoke. 
 Although Vietnam bans the import of foreign cigarettes, in 1994 it granted licenses to overseas tobacco companies to produce their brands in Vietnam, including Philip Morris's Marlboro and R. J. Reynolds's Camel. We found that 22 percent of Vietnamese cigarette smokers now smoke foreign brands and an additional 16 percent said they would smoke foreign brands if they could afford them.
The record from other Asian countries shows that smoking rates rise steeply soon after foreign tobacco corporations enter their domestic markets, as the domestic cigarette producers mimic the aggressive marketing tactics of the foreign corporations.
With current smoking rates, the Vietnamese can expect about 10 percent of the population to die early from tobacco-related diseases.
Mr. Bang may see some short-term economic and political advantages to welcoming the tobacco merchants. But he should realize that these merchants are desperate to maintain their profits by replacing smokers in the United States who have quit or died.

HEADLINE: Bonds Tumble, Sending Interest Rates to 7-Month High

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices tumbled yesterday, driving interest rates to a seven-month high, as the bond market was caught off guard for the second consecutive month by an employment report showing surprising strength.
In a shortened trading session, bond prices fell after the Labor Department reported that 140,000 jobs were added to the nation's payrolls in March -- more than double what many economists had predicted. 
 While the data pointed to faster growth in the economy, with little pickup in inflation, the figures also crushed any remaining hopes in the bond market that the Federal Reserve would lower short-term interest rates this spring.
Indeed, many traders and analysts are now debating whether the central bank will raise interest rates for the first time since Feb. 1, 1995.
"The market is now beginning to build in the concept that the next Fed move could be a tightening, irrespective of the timing of the next Fed move," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management in New York.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 1 27/32 of a percentage point, to 89 18/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.82 percent, from 6.67 percent on Thursday, as well as a week earlier. The yield on the 30-year bond is used as a benchmark for mortgages and other consumer interest rates. It is at its highest since Aug. 23, 1995, when it was 6.91 percent.
For investors, the drop in prices cost them about $18.43 for every $1,000 invested in 30-year bonds.
Still, the selloff came in trading that ended early, at noon, with many market participants away because of Good Friday or Passover. About $40 billion in Treasury securities were traded yesterday, according to Govpx, a bond pricing service, down sharply from $80.2 billion on Thursday, when trading was lackluster.
"It is important to note that volume was thin today and that price movements could have been exaggerated," said Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM MoneyWatch in New York, a market research and analysis firm.
"While aggressive players like hedge funds were in, those that stabilize the market were not, like the mutuals, banks and other investors who buy, hold and sell to arrange portfolios," he said. "These investment people are basically out today because of the holiday."
Carroll J. Delaney, director of Stires, O'Donnell & Company, said that with many market participants gone for a long holiday weekend and with European markets closed on Monday, "it may well be the middle of next week before the true impact of today's figures can be adequately assessed."
The employment report yesterday essentially confirmed to many in the market that the huge surge in payrolls in February was not a fluke. The report followed other recent data, including reports on industrial production and consumer spending, that have indicated a pickup. Bond yields have jumped a number of times in the last month on concerns that the economy is growing faster than believed earlier in the year.
"However you look, the trend is up in terms of payroll growth," said Ray Worseck, chief economist and manager at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "And that leads people to conclude that the Fed will not ease anytime soon."
Mr. Palash of MCM MoneyWatch said, "What I think the market is focusing on today is that the first-quarter payroll average gain was 206,00, which is above the 142,000 fourth-quarter average."
But he added that it was "not surprising that the first-quarter average exceeded the fourth-quarter average because of special factors like weather-related and seasonal-adjustment problems."
The 5.6 percent unemployment rate showed that underlying growth was 2 to 2.5 percent, he said. "So this kind of growth should not be inflationary," Mr. Palash added.
He said the market's sharp reaction to the employment report was influenced in part by concerns over supply and worries about coming inflation reports. Next week, the Treasury will auction new two-year and five-year notes, and the Government will report on producer prices and consumer prices for March.
In when-issued trading, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.06 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.40 percent, both about a quarter of a percentage point higher than the previous day.
"The bottom line is that Fed policy is on hold and the bond market has to contend with decent growth going into the spring," Mr. Palash said. "Right now the market will have to wait until next week's inflation reports to determine its next level of pricing."

HEADLINE: New Pressures on Airline Crash-Liability Accord

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
The Warsaw Convention governing the liability of an airline when passengers die in a plane crash is crumbling as airlines try to raise the accord's $75,000 limit on damages.
But prospects for a new agreement are uncertain, because the United States Department of Transportation is demanding that the accord provide that damage suits involving Americans be heard in the United States. Some foreign airlines reject that demand. 
 This is the third effort to raise the $75,000 limit, which was set in 1966 and all parties agree is now far too low. Efforts in 1977 and 1988 would have raised the limit several-fold and were eagerly supported by American officials, but the United States did not approve them. Trial lawyers said the higher limits were still too low, and aircraft manufacturers feared high limits would encourage suits against them.
"The amount of time it's taking to do something rational is simply astonishing," said Jeffrey N. Shane, an aviation lawyer who was Assistant Secretary of Transportation for policy and international affairs from 1989 to 1993.
The Warsaw Convention, initiated in 1929 among 29 countries and joined by the United States in 1934, also governs who may sue and where, and details cargo rules. All nations with commercial airlines have signed on, but the airlines agree that the document needs to be updated.
Because of the low liability limit, many airlines are voluntarily paying more, either to spare themselves a lengthy trial at which families will try to show negligence -- which allows higher damages -- or for general good will, or because they do not think the limits will hold up in court.
American Airlines, for example, has told families of the people who died when one of its planes crashed in Colombia in December that it would negotiate as if the limit did not exist; it is doing the same for the 16 passengers on international trips who were on the American Eagle commuter flight that crashed in Roselawn, Ind., in October 1994.
"The message American is sending is, 'We'll do what's fair, because we know a jury will do what's fairer,' " said Barry Lambert Harris, who was an acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the Bush Administration.
But the airlines would like a realistic limit and uniform system. Representatives of airlines from around the world met this week in Montreal to try to work out the details of a system with no limits. United States airlines have received an antitrust exemption to negotiate an agreement, which would be subject to Government approval.
The airlines and American officials envision fairly simple negotiations with families over "economic damages," the amount that the victim was likely to have earned over the remaining years of his or her life, given normal life expectancy. The sticking point now is which court would resolve disputes if negotiations failed.
Under the current agreement, survivors can bring suit in the country the plane was flying to, the home country of the airline, a country where the airline has its major operation or the country where the contract for transportation was written.
The United States wants a "fifth jurisdiction" for Americans: the United States. Since domestic carriers are based here, they can already be sued here; adding the "fifth jurisdiction" would generally affect overseas carriers.
Hans Ephraimson-Abt, whose 23-year-old daughter, Alice, died in the crash of Korean Air Lines flight 007 13 years ago, and whose case is still in court in New York, said that 147 of the 269 passengers on that flight had had their cases settled for $75,000; among them were a few Americans who could not get access to an American court. Other cases are still pending in Japan or the Philippines. The plane, shot down by the Soviet Union when it strayed into Soviet airspace, was en route to Tokyo.
Mr. Ephraimson-Abt, the chairman of the American Association for Families of KAL 007 Victims, said some Americans on the flight had not bought their tickets in this country and had to sue in South Korea, but the Korean courts had thrown the cases out, a ruling both he and prosecutors in Seoul attribute to corruption.
Mr. Ephraimson-Abt said that without the $75,000 limit, all the cases would have been settled years ago. Instead, he and other relatives of plane crash victims say, cases can drag on so long that victims' small children are beyond college age before any damage awards are made.
Differing economic standards and points of view are also problems, he said. Many people in third world countries "think all Americans are millionaires," and are not sympathetic to them, he added.
Consequently, some foreign carriers are balking at submitting to the jurisdiction of American courts. But not all foreign carriers are hiding behind the $75,000 shield. In 1992, the Japanese airlines voluntarily renounced the $75,000 limit on international flights, and 12 international airlines, meeting in Kuala Lumpur in November, agreed in principle to waive all limits.
"It doesn't wash well anywhere," said George N. Tompkins, an American lawyer who represents Japan Air Lines and other foreign carriers.
But Mr. Tomkins said some foreign carriers would object to any agreement that subjects them to American courts, with traditional American levels of compensation.
On the other hand, Anne H. McNamara, the head lawyer at American Airlines, said, "We are not availing ourselves of the limit because it is so unfair." Still, if the airline is unable to reach a settlement in a damage case and it ends up in court, American may invoke that limit, she said. However, most airlines are buying insurance against such suits, and the insurance companies generally assume that the $75,000 limit will be ignored by American juries.
She added that juries in American courts "like to do rough justice," and will declare an airline negligent if that is what it takes to get around the limit and award higher damages.
But insisting that foreign airlines submit to an American court will be difficult, said Mr. Shane, the former Under Secretary of Transportation, for it would mean making airline tickets different legally from all other kinds of purchases; if those result in litigation, he said, the suit is in the place where the transaction occurred.

HEADLINE: A Landmark In Detroit May Be Sold

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 5

 BODY:
The owners of Detroit's landmark Renaissance Center are nearing a sale of the giant office, retail and hotel complex, people involved in the negotiations said today.
Gerald Hines and his son, Jeffrey, both Houston real estate investors, are among the handful of potential buyers in talks with investment bankers and lawyers for the center's owners -- four insurance companies and several dozen corporate and individual investors, the people said. 
 J. Joyce Cusmano, a spokeswoman for the Renaissance Center's management, said, "Right now, Renaissance Center Venture does not have a binding purchase and sale agreement, but they are continuing to discuss the sale in earnest with interested parties." She declined to elaborate and said she did not know the names of the potential buyers.
Eric B. Larson, project manager in Detroit for the Hines Interests Limited Partnership, confirmed that his company was bidding on the Renaissance Center. "I do believe a transaction will occur in the near future," Mr. Larson said.
The Hineses have stakes in a number of commercial buildings around the country. They developed the Houston Galleria, among other properties. Here in Detroit, in 1991, the Hineses and five Japanese equity partners built One Detroit Center, a $250 million office building that houses Comerica Bank.
The identity of other potential buyers for the Renaissance Center could not be learned. Any deal would probably be for the entire complex, which consists of five glass towers ranging in height from 39 to 73 floors.
The complex's owners, which include the Ford Motor Company, announced in October 1994 that they were considering a sale or refinancing. The building cost $350 million to build in the 1970's. By last summer, the asking price was $125 million. But with the downtown Detroit real estate market still weak, industry experts are skeptical that it will fetch much more than $80 million or $90 million.
While the Renaissance Center's price has fallen sharply, the sale could signal more than bottom fishing because the troubled property has been on the block for so long. Its sale could mean that the commercial real estate market in Detroit -- a city known for empty skyscrapers with beautiful architecture -- is improving. The once-dismal residential real estate market has picked up in recent years.
The complex, on the riverfront, is often seen on postcards of Detroit and dominates the city's skyline. When the center opened in 1977, Detroit hoped it would spark renewal in a city that had suffered in the decade since the 1967 riots.
Its very name reflects the hopes for urban renewal that city leaders and the complex's developers attached to it from the beginning. But the center has received mixed reviews: some say it has drawn tenants from other downtown office buildings while others contend that it has improved the downtown business climate and reduced the number of companies moving to the suburbs.
The central 73-story tower of the complex houses the Westin Hotel, which has more than 1,400 rooms and is topped by a revolving restaurant. Four 39-floor office towers surround it. Together, they have more than 2.2 million square feet of space. All are connected by several maze-like floors near the ground that house shops and restaurants. Even longtime Detroiters still routinely get lost in the complex.
The property's ownership, like its layout, is complicated, and that has hindered its sale in the past. The Renaissance Center was the pet project of Henry Ford 2d. Then the chairman of Ford Motor, he and 48 other companies and individuals invested in it. Five financial institutions -- the Ford Motor Credit Company, the Aetna Life Insurance Company, the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company and the Travelers Insurance Company -- held the complex's original $200 million mortgage.
In October 1983 the ownership was revamped to its current mix. The five first-mortgage holders now hold a 53 percent stake, while the other 49 investors own 47 percent of the complex. East Dil, a real estate investment bank based in Manhattan, is representing the owners in the current negotiations. The managing partner, Wayne L. Maggin, referred requests for comment to Ms. Cusmano.
Ford was closed today and representatives could not be reached for comment. Officials at Aetna and Hancock, the lead mortgage-holders, did not return calls seeking comment. Two nearby, smaller towers are not part of the sale. They were developed by Ford and Rockefeller Center Inc., and were sold to ANR Ren-Cen Inc. in 1984.

HEADLINE: For First Time, Giuliani Picks Black Deputy Mayor

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed Rudy Washington as his Deputy Mayor for Community Relations yesterday, placing a black man for the first time in the highest level of his administration.
Mr. Washington, an entrepreneur from Queens and a trusted aide during Mr. Giuliani's campaign, was the city's Commissioner of the Department of Business Services, responsible for encouraging the growth of small and medium-sized companies. 
 He will assume some of the duties of Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, who was named on Thursday as the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, replacing John S. Dyson, who resigned. The Mayor said that Ms. Reiter would retain her current authority over planning issues, while Mr. Washington would retain his oversight of small-business issues.
In making the appointment, Mr. Giuliani noted Mr. Washington's work regulating the Fulton Fish Market and in helping to move illegal vendors from 125th Street and other crowded streets into city-owned markets.
Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that Mr. Washington would add diversity to City Hall, but he adamantly rejected the notion that he had promoted Mr. Washington merely to answer criticism for having only white faces among his inner circle of advisers.
"I haven't appointed a black Deputy Mayor," Mr. Giuliani said. "I've appointed Rudy Washington a Deputy Mayor. That's the way I appoint people."
"I believe it's also additionally very good for the city that we have representation of the different communities of the city at the highest level of city government," the Mayor said.
"But," he added, speaking of the appointment, "the principal reason is this man's talent."
Many of the city's black leaders applauded Mr. Washington's promotion and said they hoped that he would now be in a better position to push for the needs of black residents. Some said that while Mr. Washington had proved himself to be an able administrator, he was also noteworthy for his willingness to execute mayoral policies that had not always been popular among blacks, like the dismantling of programs intended to steer city contracts to minority-owned companies.
But some criticized Mr. Giuliani for his track record on minority issues and said that simply appointing a black deputy mayor would not be enough to win the support of blacks.
"Rudy Washington has demonstrated loyalty to the Mayor and he deserves to be elevated," said C. Virginia Fields, a City Councilwoman who represents Harlem. "Maybe now he'll be in position to do even more. But the Mayor has to go beyond just this appointment, because he has sorely neglected the African-American community since he took office."
But Ms. Fields also questioned how much independence Mr. Washington has shown. She noted that plans to move illegal vendors from 125th Street had been developed under the previous administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins.
"It was a ready-made situation," Ms. Fields said. "While we are appreciative that Rudy Washington supported the move, I have not seen evidence of things that have been carried forward that were not already in place."
Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, was critical of yesterday's announcement.
"It's suspicious because it's so late into Mr. Giuliani's administration," he said. "It smacks of tokenism and window dressing." Mr. Meyers said he would have preferred to see a black person appointed to a position with more authority and said he considered community relations "a soft job."
Mr. Washington said that the Giuliani administration had often been criticized for its dealings with minorities, but had not received much credit for its successes.
Pointing to the Mayor's decision to eliminate a practice established under former Mayor Dinkins in which city agencies had a goal of awarding 20 percent of their contracts to companies owned by women or minorities, Mr. Washington said, "All of the stories about how minorities weren't going to get work, how it was going to be a devastating situation, I'm proud to say that every year since I've been here, that program has grown." He said his department was able to increase contracts to female- and minority-owned companies.
Dennis M. Walcott, president of the New York Urban League, said while dealing with that issue, Mr. Washington showed that he was willing to carry out the Mayor's program even though it was extremely unpopular with many minority residents in the city.
"He has been able to sit down and quietly negotiate without being a magnet for heat," he said. "That takes either special skill or a conscious effort to do that. Either way, he has definitely shown responsiveness in carrying out the Mayor's viewpoint."

HEADLINE: Three Mid-Atlantic States Show A Jump in Jobless Rate to 6.8%

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Although the national unemployment rate crept up only slightly in March, the rate for New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania moved sharply higher, according to a Federal report issued yesterday. The regional rate jumped to 6.8 percent from the 6 percent level of both February and January.
The jump reflected a regional economy that was too weak to accommodate a burst of job seekers, according to the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of people employed in the three states did rise, by 225,000, to 17.1 million. But the number of job seekers rose much more. 
 Since the unemployment figure measures the number of people actively looking for work and unable to find it, the increase may provide evidence of optimism that has drawn out more job seekers.
"It probably just means that more people were in the market for jobs," said John L. Weiting, the New York regional director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He added that the surge in job seekers might have reflected the less oppressive weather in March after the blizzards and cold of January and February.
Still, Mr. Weiting said, "in many cases, job applicants found that the market was not strong enough."
The release of regional data is a part of the revisions in the reporting procedure that were made in January; separate data for New York City and State and New Jersey are no longer provided on the day that the national employment data are reported. Instead, the Government lumps together New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which are among the large industrial states that it used to track individually.
The change resulted partly from Federal budget cuts, which reduced the size of a survey conducted by the Census Bureau. That survey is now too small to be statistically reliable on the city and state level.
Unemployment figures for New York City and the states of New York and New Jersey are still provided, drawn from a larger survey, but they now come out three weeks after the national report.
The most recent figures for the city and the states are for February. Unemployment then was 8.1 percent in New York City, 6 percent in New York State, 6.4 percent in New Jersey and 5.1 percent in Connecticut.

The stadium that a consultant has recommended building for the Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan would likely be the most expensive in the nation's history, but Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that it could be built at little or no cost to the city's taxpayers.
Experts in sports financing and some city officials, however, expressed skepticism yesterday that any new stadium could be built in New York City without taxpayer money, noting that most of the stadiums built in recent years have required some public financing. 
 Although the details of financing a new stadium remain sketchy, the Mayor and his aides say the city and state could issue bonds for it and pay them off by tapping revenues from ticket sales, luxury boxes, advertising and even the exclusive rights to sell beer.
In doing so, however, the city and state could come into direct conflict with the Yankees' owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, who clearly hopes to use those same revenues to increase his own income from the team.
In fact, it is Mr. Steinbrenner's dissatisfaction with the money-making potential of Yankee Stadium that is driving his effort to seek a new home.
At a news conference yesterday in City Hall, where the future of the Yankees was once again a dominant topic, Mr. Giuliani said the promise of a vast new market of fans now unwilling to make the trip to the South Bronx made the proposal for a multi-use stadium on the West Side of Manhattan the most enticing alternative to Yankee Stadium. That was so, he said, even though it was the most expensive of four proposals the consultant considered, coming with a price tag of more than $1 billion.
"Purely from a financial analysis point of view," the Mayor said, "the place where the city could build a new stadium at virtually no cost to the taxpayer or very little cost to the taxpayer would be in Manhattan. Because the value of property in Manhattan is so great, you can finance it at very little cost. There might even be ways to finance it at no cost or a profit."
Such a method of financing has been used by other cities in recent years in the desperate race to keep or lure sports franchises, but sports experts said that in many of those cases public money -- either from taxes or lotteries -- helped build the stadiums. And they pointed out that the cost of those stadiums was about a quarter to a third of the price that the consultants estimated for a new Yankee Stadium.
"A stadium normally cannot be supported by direct revenues from the stadium itself," said Anita B. Morrison, vice president of Hammer, Siler, George Associates, a consulting firm in Silver Spring, Md., that worked on plans for a new Tiger Stadium in Detroit.
The study of possible sites for a new Yankee Stadium -- conducted by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum of Kansas City, Mo., and financed jointly by the city, the state and Mr. Steinbrenner -- did not directly address the question of paying for them.
But officials in New York and Albany have proceeded on the assumption that the city and state would issue bonds -- probably through a public authority -- to cover the staggering costs. The bonds would be paid off with money from a dedicated stream of revenues.
The question of where exactly those revenues would come from will be the most intense subject of negotiations between Mr. Steinbrenner, the city and the state. Like most baseball owners, Mr. Steinbrenner would like to keep as large a share as possible of those revenues for himself.
"The selection of the site is by far the easiest part of the conversation with the Yankees," said John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development.
For that reason, the Mayor's office and the Yankees declined yesterday to discuss exactly how revenues from a new stadium might be divided. David W. Sussman, the general counsel for the Yankees, said it was premature to discuss possible financing schemes since none had been presented to the team.
In the consultant's study and in the remarks by the Mayor and other officials, however, it was clear that a new stadium could produce lucrative sources of revenues from features that have become standard in new stadiums, like luxury boxes, licenses for special seats and even the rights to the name of the stadium. In San Francisco, for example, Pacific Bell recently promised to pay $50 million to put its name on a new stadium for the Giants.
Asked yesterday if he would allow a company to pay for the right to change the hallowed name of Yankee Stadium, the Mayor replied with a laugh. "It depends on the amount of money," he said.
Mr. Dyson said other possible sources of revenue could come from a surcharge on tickets or even a dedicated tax. But he added: "Increasing taxes is not the first, second, third or fourth resort. Taxes might be the last resort."
By emphasizing the potential sources of revenue, the Mayor and his aides seemed to be trying to head off criticism that the city and state can ill afford a huge expense for a stadium at a time when Mr. Giuliani's budget director recently ordered a 25 percent cut in capital spending.
Some elected officials -- including Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, and Fernando Ferrer, her counterpart in the Bronx -- have already rained doubt on the Mayor's claims. They say that improvements around a new stadium were unlikely to be covered by revenues from tickets and concessions alone and would almost certainly fall on taxpayers.
The study by Hellmuth, Obata estimated the cost of renovating Yankee Stadium at $770 million and rebuilding a new stadium next to the current site at $944 million. The cost of a new West Side stadium next to the Hudson River between 30th and 33d Streets would cost $847 million if used for baseball alone, while one suited for baseball and football would cost $1.06 billion. The firm rejected stadiums at two other sites in the Bronx, in Van Cortlandt Park and Pelham Bay Park, that would have cost even more.
By contrast, other new stadiums have been built for far less, including Jacobs Field in Cleveland for $215 million and Coors Field in Denver for $214 million. The most expensive stadium thus far -- Skydome in Toronto, which has a retractable roof and other amenities envisioned for a new Yankee Stadium -- cost about $500 million.
Marc S. Ganis, the president of Sportscorp Limited, a stadium development consultant in Chicago, said that when he heard of the proposed costs for a new home for the Yankees he "thought somebody added a zero by mistake."
"The notion of spending a billion dollars for a baseball stadium is even by today's standards outrageous," said Mr. Ganis, whose company was involved in the relocation of the Rams from Los Angeles to the new TWA Dome in St. Louis last year.
But the Mayor said, "When you look at these numbers, the amounts don't mean as much as the ability to finance it and therefore not have to cost the taxpapers any money, or a minimum amount of money."

 BODY:

Payrolls Rose in March; Hopes Dashed for Rate Cut
Employers added a hefty 140,000 new jobs to their payrolls in March, providing solid evidence that the economy is in better shape than it appeared a couple of months ago. The jobless rate was little changed, edging up one-tenth of a point, to 5.6 percent. 
 The jobs gain meant that the huge jump of more than 600,000 jobs that occurred in February was not a fluke, economists said, and apparently dashed hopes that the Federal Reserve would relax monetary policy any time soon. Some analysts even suggested that the Fed might move to tighten credit later in the year if the economy continued to advance at a brisk pace. That, in turn, raised fears that the stock market, which was closed for Good Friday, could slump next week. [Page 1.]
 
The jobless rate for the region encompassing New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania moved sharply higher, to 6.8 percent. [36.]
 
Installment Debt Jumps
Americans' installment debt grew in February at the fastest pace in eight months as each of the major categories of consumer credit rose. The Federal Reserve said consumer installment credit shot up 13.9 percent at an annual rate, and increased by $12 billion in the month. [36.]
 
Bloch Is Ordered to Return Money
A Federal judge ordered Irwin H. "Sonny" Bloch, the former financial talk show host, his wife, Hilda, and six of his companies to return $3.9 million collected from listeners they persuaded to invest in three radio stations in Florida and Connecticut. The judge has not decided whether to impose any fines against Mr. Bloch, who is accused of defrauding investors in the three stations. [37.]
 
NBC Wins Ruling on Crib Report
NBC does not have to turn over unused videotaped interviews from a "Dateline" report that questioned the safety of a combination cradle and baby swing, a Federal appeals court ruled in Manhattan. The decision quashed a subpoena and overturned a $5,000-a-day fine against NBC. The videotapes were sought by Graco Children's Products, the maker of the cribs, but the ruling has no practical effect on Graco, which has since settled the cases brought against it. [37.]
 
Law Rattles Investors in Cuba
The latest weapon in the battle between Cuba and the U.S. is the Helms-Burton Act, which tightens the 34-year-old embargo against Cuba by trying to restrict non-American foreign investment here. It is having an effect on ventures like Etecsa, owned by the Cuban Government and a Mexican company. Company officials say that the uncertainty raised by the new law makes it far more difficult for them to raise $300 million they need to go forward. [3.]
 
Cow Disease Isolates Britain
Britain's mad cow problems at first brought forth a show of solidarity with its European Union partners, but it now appears that Britain feels isolated as never before. The British see the European reaction as bossy interference, and are especially put out at the idea that the European Union can stop Britain from exporting beef and many products with beef extract to third countries having nothing to do with Europe. [5.]
 
Fraud Ring Got Personal Data
A ring of individuals got personal data from Social Security employees and was able to commit credit-card fraud, running up huge bills at merchants including J & R Music World and Bergdorf Goodman. Several employees of the Social Security Administration passed information on more than 11,000 people to the fraud ring, according to prosecutors. A case worker in New York has been charged with fraud. [6.]
 
Jobs Report Lifts the Dollar
The dollar rose in thin trading after a report showing strong job growth convinced currency traders that the Federal Reserve would not cut interest rates anytime soon. "Now the Fed won't ease, and it may hike rates," said Karl Halligan, a trader in New York. "I think the dollar can go a lot higher." The dollar climbed to 107.68 yen, from 107.01 yen, and to 1.4835 marks, from 1.4800 marks. [38.]

HEADLINE: Asian Immigrants Help New York Thrive

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Queens Old-Timers Uneasy as Asian Influence Grows" (March 31): I don't understand why Councilwoman Julia Harrison finds the growing Asian population in Flushing, Queens, so "discombobulating, very upsetting." Her beliefs that the many Asians coming to the United States have entered illegally and are ungrateful, affluent profiteers looking to exploit this country are unfounded.
According to 1994 Immigration and Naturalization Service figures, the 10 largest illegal immigrant groups in New York State did not even include Asians. 
 According to a 1994 report by the Asian Pacific Public Policy Institute, more than 30 percent of Southeast Asian households in the United States depend on welfare for their survival, giving them the highest rate of welfare dependency of any racial or ethnic group. In Manhattan's Chinatown, the 1990 unemployment rate was 6 percent, but nearly 25 percent of all families were living in poverty and working in jobs with low pay and no health insurance.
According to the Korean American Small Business Service Center in Flushing, only half of all Korean-owned businesses break even.
Unable to attain financial stability in the United States, thousands of Asians have returned to their native countries, contrary to Ms. Harrison's claim of an Asian invasion. But those immigrants choosing to remain in the United States have actively participated in their communities.

HEADLINE: New U.S. Curbs Sound Alarm for Cuba Investors

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
Bolted to the front of the old phone company headquarters in this city's crumbling center is a bronze plaque commemorating Resolution No. 1 of Cuba's revolutionary Government: the nationalization of the telephone system on Aug. 6, 1960.
But so much of the old tower's ornate trim is flaking off and coming down that the sidewalk in front of the building had to be closed. 
 Both the plaque and the plummeting plasterwork put this relic of Havana's past squarely in the cross hairs of the latest weapon in the ideological battle between Cuba and the United States -- the Helms-Burton Act. The law tightens the 34-year-old embargo against Cuba by trying to restrict non-American foreign investment here.
Inside the 10-story phone company building are offices of Etecsa, a joint venture of the Cuban Government and a Mexican company called Grupo Domos, which bought 49 percent of the decrepit national system in 1994 for $750 million. It is by far the biggest foreign investment in Cuba since the Communist Government of Fidel Castro began courting investors.
While company officials say they have no intention of pulling out, they admit that the uncertainty raised by the new law makes it far more difficult for them to raise the $300 million they still need to go forward with their project, which is considered essential for Cuba's development.
 
Cuba Coming to See Law's Chilling Effect
Shaking confidence in Cuba is exactly what the law's drafters were after. The Cuban Government initially derided the law as powerless but later conceded the chilling effect it would have on foreign investment, while using it as provocation for a crackdown on economic reforms and political dissent.
The Helms-Burton Act was written and passed after intense pressure from anti-Castro Cubans in Miami who hoped to undermine the Castro Government. But many of the most vocal supporters of the bill also operate businesses. They want to weaken rival businesses, raise the cost of investing in Cuba and scare off non-American investors so that they can rush in after Mr. Castro falls and pick up the spoils.
No foreign project has been canceled yet, but international investors are nervously waiting to see how the United States will enforce the law, which takes effect Aug. 1, or whether President Clinton will use his authority to suspend its implementation until after the November elections.
"We're still doing our evaluations," said Arturo Lopez, manager of the Havana Investment Fund, which had raised almost $35 million before the law was passed. "This law is going make an investment here a little more difficult perhaps, but it will not stop it."
Cuban officials say they have attracted $2 billion in foreign investments, although Western diplomats here estimate the true figure to be half that. Whatever the real figure, all investments has been thrown into question by the Helms-Burton Act, which was signed by President Clinton just weeks after Cuban pilots shot down two unarmed planes flown by anti-Castro Cuban-Americans on Feb. 24, killing four men.
Many business executives here note that the law could hinder the kind of transition to a market economy that Washington seems to want. Since Cubans were given the right to own dollars and foreign companies were allowed to invest in Cuban businesses, dollars have been buying everything in Havana, from extra food to a working telephone line.
The 33 exchange at the start of most business telephone numbers here is now known as the money exchange because it means the holder pays the bill in dollars, and calls almost always get through. Not far from a sign in Havana proclaiming "Socialism or Death" is an outdoor billboard for Adidas shoes.
Basically, the Helms-Burton Act gives American citizens the right to sue Domos and other foreign companies in a United States Federal court for profiting from property that was illegally confiscated during the Cuban Revolution.
Javier Garza Calderon, president of Domos, said in an interview in Mexico that he does not believe that the law applies to his company because he simply rents space in the old phone company building. It is now owned by the Government but used to belong to the American company ITT and the Cuban Telephone Company, which it ran, until the revolution. ITT has a $130 million claim outstanding for all the property it lost in Cuba.
Domos is rapidly renovating alternate space -- in a building that never belonged to Americans -- just in case. But the new law so broadly interprets deriving benefit from confiscated property -- it uses the term "trafficking" -- that Mr. Garza Calderon concedes that Domos could have trouble because some equipment, telephone lines and even the heavy black rotary dial phones still in use in some Cuban households once belonged to ITT.
"They could be considered to be deriving benefit if a call from Miami to some woman in Camaguey Province was made on the same old telephone her grandmother had," said a Western diplomat in Cuba. "No matter what their lawyers say, can they be sure that a Federal court somewhere in the United States will feel the same way?"
Cuban-American leaders in Miami have already installed Domos into what they call their "Hall of Shame."
"Here you have a foreign company buying at cut-rate prices property owned by American citizens, intending to share profits with Fidel Castro and then laughing all the way to the bank," said Jorge Mas Canosa, head of the powerful Cuban American National Foundation.
But Mr. Mas Canosa may have had more than politics in mind. His Florida-based telecommunications company, Mastec, has been expanding aggressively in Latin America, and the entrance of the Mexicans represents increased competition.
 
Signs of Concern From Many Corners
Domos faces other potential problems. Under the law, Mr. Garza Calderon and his family could be denied visas to enter the United States, where his children now study.
Canon, Bayer, Benetton and dozens of other corporations that occupy space in confiscated Havana mansions also could face similar restrictions if former property owners have since become American citizens.
The Canadian Government has been among the most vocal opponents of the new law, asserting that it violates the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Latinvest Securities reports that stock in the Canadian mining company Sherritt International, which operates a nickel mine in Cuba, dropped 24 percent after the two planes were downed.
At first the Cuban Government minimized the effect of the law. Officials declared outright that there were no American properties in Cuba, and called the law "Helms's dream," after its sponsor, Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican from North Carolina.
But as investors expressed their concerns, the Government was forced to reconsider. Roberto de Armas, an economist in the Foreign Ministry, now concedes that the flow of capital will probably slow until the United States makes clear how it plans to enforce the law. But he said the Government's policies will not change.
"The biggest blow to the Americans and their law will be when we give the figures for economic growth at the end of the year and they see that growth continues, albeit with problems in some sectors," Mr. de Armas said. The expected growth rate for 1996 is between 4 and 5 percent, depending on the sugar harvest, now under way.
The stakes are high for Mexico, which has taken a lead in Cuban investments. It was during a state visit by Carlos Salinas de Gortari, then the President, in June 1994 that the Domos deal was announced. A project to rebuild the Cienfuegos refinery was also announced then but it was suspended last September.
An investment like Grupo Domos's was considered an important first step in strengthening both the Mexican and Cuban economies.
 
Company Scrambles To Save Its Venture
It turned out that the anchor of Cuba's economy that Domos bought was a rusting and battered one. For instance, Domos found that when the air conditioning in critical switching centers failed, workers had simply opened the windows, letting in dust and salt air that corroded contacts. Only 18 percent of the long distance calls made to Cuba were completed.
Because Grupo Domos lacked operating experience, it sold 25 percent of its stake to the Italian phone company Stet last April for $291 million.
Domos wanted an American partner. Since 1992, a change in American law allowed long distance companies like AT&T and MCI to provide direct service to Cuba. They are doing so well that on Feb. 26, two days after the planes were shot down, a record 43,000 calls were registered between the United States and Cuba.
The signing of the Helms-Burton Act squelched any deal with an American company. The law specifically prohibits debt-for-equity swaps and bans any American company from investing in the domestic phone network in Cuba.
Since Domos has already earmarked $180 million for direct investment in Cuba, it has little choice but to remain. The uncertainty caused by the Helms-Burton Act makes it virtually impossible for Domos to finance the $300 million it still owes the Cuban Government. But it now seems that the Mexican Government, which strongly opposes the new law, will find a way to help Domos, and Cuba, save face. Although it once turned down Domos, the Mexican Government's export bank, Bancomext, is expected to come up with a loan for most of the $300 million.
Mr. Garza Calderon said the Cuban-Americans in Miami who pressured President Clinton to sign the law are confused. He would like to invite Mr. Mas Canosa, with whom he does not see eye-to-eye either economically or politically, to Monterrey to discuss the improvements already made in Cuba: higher salaries for workers, new switching stations, better service and more lines.
"It is ridiculous that Mr. Mas Canosa opposes all those benefits for those Cubans living in Miami and those in Cuba as well," he said. "He's just taking the negative point of view."

HEADLINE: U.S. Cash Keeps Children of Poor From Leaving Special Education

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
In the last four years, New York City's Board of Education and the Human Resources Administration have aggressively steered thousands of poor students classified with learning difficulties or emotional problems off municipal welfare and onto Federal disability payments, saving the city and state $5.2 million.
But now, children's advocates and educational experts say the effort to cut costs takes special education's defects and makes them worse, encouraging families and officials to keep children in dead-end special-education programs --when many would do better in regular classrooms -- just because they are poor. 
 The incentive for both the city and the families is financial: families get far more per child -- up to $470 a month -- from the Federal disability program, Supplemental Security Income, than from municipal welfare, worth about $80 a month.
The Board of Education's official policy is to move as many special-education students as possible into regular classrooms, where they are thought to have a better chance to graduate and get jobs.
School officials say the system is a dumping ground for students whom teachers find bothersome, with disproportionate numbers of black and Hispanic boys classified as learning disabled, which includes attention deficit disorders and reading difficulties, or emotionally disturbed. They would like to see special education reserved for the roughly 10 percent of those now in special education who are seriously disabled or physically handicapped.
But some social workers, parents and children's advocacy groups argue that the Federal benefit pulls policy in the opposite direction: ever since a 1990 Supreme Court ruling made it easier for children with mild disabilities to qualify for S.S.I., special education has played a role in qualifying children for the program. Even as New York school officials say they want to shrink special-education enrollment, S.S.I. provides a new incentive to maintain the status quo.
"It raises a whole host of questions about establishing a systemic conflict about what's best for a child and what's best for the purse strings of the schools," said Galen Kirkland, executive director of Advocates for Children, a nonprofit organization. "There's no doubt it's good for some kids. But the history of dysfunction in public education in the city of New York -- if it teaches us anything, it teaches us to be extremely skeptical and rigorous in our questioning of programs predicated on financing streams that could retard the educational development of children."
Roy Laird, a social worker at St. Marks Place Institute for Mental Health, a Manhattan clinic that treats disabled students, said he worried that parents would be caught in an impossible bind. "If the child overcomes the disability, the family loses the income," he said.
But city and school officials contend that the city is simply making parents of disabled children aware of their entitlements -- and that the city's fiscal crisis dictates this measure, part of a larger push to trim local welfare costs by shifting eligible people to disability or other Federal programs. Under the city-school effort, more than 11,000 children in special education have gone from local welfare to Supplemental Security Income. Local welfare in New York City, primarily Aid to Families with Dependent Children, is paid half by the Federal Government and one-quarter each by the city and state.
"It is a way of saving local money in these lean times and making the Federal Government responsible for assuming some of the costs on its own," said Steve Allinger, the lobbyist for the New York City Board of Education in Albany. "We've been extremely aggressive. We're doing a mitzvah, a good deed."
"The city saves money on the public assistance grant, and the client benefits from a more generous S.S.I. program," he continued. "It's nuts for us not to claim S.S.I. for kids in special education. For too long, New York City has played the role of sucker vis-a-vis Washington."
Michael Casserly, a spokesman for the Council of Great City Schools, a Washington group that represents the nation's 50 largest school systems, said he was unaware that any other school system in the country was involved in such a joint city-school effort to shift costs to the Federal Government. He said the New York City school system's unusual financial dependence on the city might put it in a better position to carry out such an initiative. Most school systems operate independently of city governments.
The effort to sign up special-education children for Supplemental Security Income was not an issue until the 1990 Supreme Court ruling. Before then, S.S.I. covered only those with crippling physical conditions, chronic illness or profound retardation. But as a result of the ruling, the program can cover any poor child whose impairment substantially reduces his ability to function at a level that is "age appropriate" -- a category that includes attention deficit disorder, emotional disturbance and behavioral problems.
In New York City, an independent panel recommended in December that tens of thousands of special-education students, now isolated in separate classrooms, should be returned to regular classrooms, where they would receive extra help. Most students in the city's special-education system are not deaf, blind or classified with any other readily defined disability. Instead, 70 percent are labeled "learning disabled" or "emotional handicapped," classifications that many academics say are vague and loosely applied.
The special-education system, which has more than 130,000 students, is driven by a financial incentive that rewards the city for each additional child it places in special education. Once there, students are almost never "decertified" and allowed to return to regular education. Most never finish high school.
Enrollment in special education makes it far easier to get the documents needed to qualify a child for Supplemental Security Income, though it does not guarantee eligibility, say officials with the Social Security Administration.
In New York City, more than 11,000 children have been signed up for the disability benefit since 1992, about 2 percent of the children on welfare in the city and about 8 percent of the children in special education. To promote the Federal program, coordinators have been stationed at special-education offices in all 32 school districts. They go to schools, visit homes and walk parents through the application forms.
Some experts are wary that mildly disabled children being shifted into the program might never reach their potential. "It could lead them to be dependent for the rest of their lives," said Pamela Loprest, an economist with the Urban Institute in Washington, a bipartisan research center concerned with domestic social policy.
A Brooklyn parent, Blossom Richards, who had been fighting to get her son, Shawn, out of exclusively special-education classes, decided to battle the system when a caseworker told them to fill out some forms for Supplemental Security Income two years ago. Her son, then a senior at South Shore High School in Canarsie, was classified as emotionally disturbed.
"He told me that Shawn would be getting S.S.I. for the rest of his life," said Ms. Richards, a hotel housekeeper. "I told him that Shawn is not handicapped, that Shawn can work, but the guy said that doesn't matter. He could sit at home and get money and it would be increasing instead of decreasing."
She said she later told the staff worker that they were not interested. "The caseworker said I was making a fool out of myself," she recalled. "But if I take something like that, it means I am telling them that I have a handicapped child."
Nationwide, the number of children in the Federal disability program tripled in the five years after the 1990 Supreme Court ruling, to about 900,000 from 300,000, most of them classified with some form of mental impairment.
In recent years, the childhood disability program has received intense scrutiny in Congress and school circles. Reports have surfaced across the country about "crazy checks" and "dummy dollars," cash going to children who have been coached to fake mental impairments by misbehaving or doing poorly in school.
There is now bipartisan agreement in Congress that eligibility requirements need to be tightened, but how much remains a matter of impassioned debate.
Childhood benefits are one aspect of the larger Supplemental Security Income program, which was created by Congress in 1972 to defray expenses for poor adults too old, ill or disabled to work. The tax-free cash payment, which is supposed to help families struggling to raise handicapped children, by law replaces the much smaller welfare grant if a child is accepted.
School and city officials say they search for candidates for Supplemental Security Income in the city's special-education system because children there are already classified as handicapped and a large percentage of them are on public assistance.
For Selma Askin, whose son suffers from sickle-cell disease, the push to qualify some special education students seems unfair. Her 11-year-old son, Kariym, qualified for the Federal benefit only after a four-year fight that went to an administrative judge because despite his frequent hospitalizations, his illness did not seem severe enough.
"There are some people who don't need it," said Ms. Askin, a single mother of three children in Long Island City, Queens. "They drag their kids in there and say they have a psychological problem, and all the kids need is love. It makes it bad for other children."

HEADLINE: GROWTH OF JOBS STRONG IN MARCH, CONTINUING TREND

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
Employers added a hefty number of new jobs to their payrolls in March, the Labor Department said today, providing solid evidence that the economy is in better shape than it appeared just a couple months ago.
The gain of 140,000 jobs last month meant that the huge jump of more than 600,000 jobs reported in February was not a fluke, economists said. The revival, coming after a final quarter in 1995 when the economy was essentially flat, apparently dashed hopes that the Federal Reserve would relax monetary policy again any time soon. Indeed, some analysts suggested that the Federal Reserve might even move to tighten credit later in the year if the economy advanced at a brisker pace. 
 "Make no mistake, if the rate of job growth we have seen so far in 1996 were to persist, the Fed would move quickly to pre-empt any acceleration in wage and price pressures," economists at Bankers Trust advised clients.
The bond market, which constantly worries that stronger growth might bring higher inflation, was unsettled by the latest job figures. With trading curtailed by the Good Friday holiday, prices of fixed-income securities dropped sharply as interest rates on the Treasury's 30-year bond jumped to 6.82 percent from 6.67 percent on Thursday. [Page 35.]
Stock markets in the United States were closed today. But there were some fears that when the stock market reopens on Monday, Wall Street might be in for at the least a mild echo of last month's one-day swoon. The report last month that payrolls had swelled in February caused a fall in the Dow Jones industrial average of 171 points. The stock market, however, has since regained the lost ground and climbed to new peaks.
In its report on jobs, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate was little changed, edging up one-tenth of a point, to 5.6 percent, well within the narrow range below 6 percent of the last year and a half. The slight jump in the jobless rate reflected a sudden surge in the labor force, prompted perhaps by greater optimism that jobs could be found.
The Clinton Administration fastened on the latest Labor Department figures to boast of revived economic fortunes and continued low inflation.
"Our economy has weathered the slow patch of late last year and shaken off any lingering effects of the Government shutdowns and the January blizzards," Joseph E. Stiglitz, the President's chief economic adviser, said in a statement. "These numbers, combined with other recent evidence, indicate that the economy is poised to move ahead at a sustainable pace."
Job growth averaged 206,000 a month for the first quarter of 1996. That is at the high end of economic performance over the last five years, though down from an average of 226,000 in the corresponding period a year earlier. For all of 1995, monthly job growth averaged 144,000.
The job gains of the last two months, however, were unevenly distributed and came despite another decline in the number of factory jobs that was only partly the result of a strike against General Motors. Geographical disparities, in fact, seem to have become unusually wide.
The unemployment rate in the Middle Atlantic states of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania jumped to 6.8 percent from 6 percent last month even as the rate for New England stood at 5 percent or barely above for the fourth consecutive month. Joblessness in the Midwest region edged down to a record low of 4.3 percent.
The March payroll expansion of 140,000 was relatively modest but it was still about twice what many had expected. Moreover, specialists noted, the February jump was revised downward by relatively little, to 624,000 from an initial estimate of 705,000, and January's decline is now less than previously thought -- 146,000 instead of 188,000.
At the same time, the department's survey of households, which until recently has been registering less job growth than the payroll figures, posted a thumping 488,000 gain last month on top of a 437,000 gain in February.
All in all, commented Donald E. Maude, economist for Scotia Capital Markets in New York, "it now seems clear that the upward shift in employment growth during the first quarter is not a mere aberration."
He predicted that the Federal Reserve's January cut in short-term interest rates, the third since it began trimming last July, would be the final one in the current cycle and that "the next move should be upward."
But not everybody was convinced.
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, a banking company in Minneapolis, disagreed with forecasts that the Federal Reserve would increase short-term interest rates during the second half of 1996. "Given moderate economic growth, we don't expect that will happen," Mr. Sohn said. "We expect another cut or two in interest rates later this year."
And some analysts said that the Federal Reserve was likely to do little but pat itself on the back for steering the economy through the turbulence.
"This is an economy that is behaving in a way that central bankers dream about," Robert Dederick, chief economic consultant at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, told The Associated Press. "The soft landing is going to be followed by a soft takeoff."
Payroll increases last month were mainly in health, recreation, engineering, computer and other private services that have accounted for 87 percent of all job growth during the five years since the end of the last recession in March 1991.
Temporary-help workers, a group that has expanded sporadically over the year, fell by 8,000 last month. Some analysts said this could reflect newly confident employers' willingness to hire permanent workers.
Manufacturing lost 62,000 jobs, about 35,000 of these auto workers who were off payrolls for the entire survey period. Ultimately, 177,000 workers were idled by strike-related shutdowns at General Motors, plus tens of thousands more at suppliers, but most worked at least part of the survey week and were thus considered employed. Now that the strike is over, the industry is beginning to pick up the pace of production.
Department stores and automobile dealers posted job gains but employment at restaurants and bars fell by 33,000 and construction jobs dipped slightly after the big February rise.
The length of the workweek, which was significantly affected by the G.M. strike, fell 12 minutes at factories and 6 minutes for the private sector as a whole, today's report also showed. Factory overtime dropped 18 minutes.

HEADLINE: New Leaders in Poland Gaze Intently Westward

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW, April 5

 BODY:
To mark his first 100 days in office, President Aleksander Kwasniewski recently invited reporters to the living room of his private quarters, held a news conference standing before a handsome wall tapestry and then handed around flutes of champagne.
The media-friendly Mr. Kwasniewski was showing that he and his fortysomething colleagues at the top of the Polish Government are different from the other Communist retreads now ruling in Central Europe. 
 Mr. Kwasniewski, 41; Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, 46, and Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati, 49, appear to have shed their Communist heritage so well that their opponents call them yuppies.
"Kwasniewski makes the impression of a young, open-minded person, likable -- a Polish yuppie," said Janusz Onyszkiewicz, who was on the other side of the ideological barriers to Mr. Kwasniewski in the 1980's and is in the parliamentary opposition to the President's party. "They say they have become social democrats, and I think they have."
Unlike Ion Iliescu, the 65-year-old President of Romania, and Gyula Horn, the 61-year-old Prime Minister of Hungary, both of whom received university degrees in the Soviet Union, Poland's new leaders say they barely believed in Communism.
In the 1970's and 80's, they chose the United States for study or vacations. And now, to stress their drive for Poland to become part of Western European institutions, they picked Bonn, Paris and Brussels over Moscow as their first ports of call after coming to power.
Since becoming President in December and after the resignation of Jozef Oleksy, Mr. Kwasniewski acquired Mr. Cimoszewicz as Prime Minister and chose Mr. Rosati as Foreign Minister.
All three are known in Poland as the "Boys From Ordynacka," a reference to the Warsaw street where the Communist Party's Association of Polish Students had its headquarters. Most Polish university students belonged to the association, including Roman Catholic student activists.
It was a grouping, according to the magazine Polityka, of those "who did not believe in socialism but did not believe in its collapse either."
In the 1970's under the Communist Prime Minister, Edward Gierek, the students saw hope that socialism could work: more goods were in the stores and visas and scholarships were available for travel to the West.
Mr. Kwasniewski, who studied economics, followed a common route for those days. He earned money as an unregistered worker in Sweden to pay for a trip to America for the bicentennial celebrations. In the early 1980's, Mr. Cimoszewicz, a law graduate from Warsaw University, won a Fulbright scholarship to Columbia University, where he studied for five years. And Mr. Rosati, a graduate of the Warsaw School of Economics, won a Fulbright and attended Princeton University in 1987.
Thus when Richard C. Holbrooke, the former Assistant Secretary of State, visited Poland in February, Mr. Kwasniewski was able to regale him with stories about traveling through more than 30 states, including some in the South, as a driver delivering cars.
Mr. Cimoszewicz, according to some of his colleagues, could be considered so modern that on his return from the United States, he dropped out of politics and for four years retreated to the family pig farm in eastern Poland.
He turned it into a model operation -- of the capitalist kind. "My in-laws thought we were insane and that we degraded ourselves socially," he said recently. "But we were tremendously successful financially."
Now that they are in power, the "boys" from the Communist students' club are getting mixed reviews on economic policy. Poland's growth rate of 7 percent was the strongest in Europe last year, and Mr. Cimoszewicz talked tough this week about bailing out the beleaguered Gdansk shipyard. "The days when a Government department runs an industry are over," he said, indicating that the Government was seeking a foreign buyer.
The three men acknowledge that they are not automatically accepted in the West as the social democrats they say they are. With the Alliance of the Democratic Left, the party that Mr. Kwasniewski built on the ashes of the old Communist Party, controlling the presidency, Parliament and the prime ministership, the three men must allay fears of a one-party country.
"The various centers of power -- the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Government and the President -- all see eye to eye," Mr. Rosati said. "But it's very clear that making the current political arrangement credible in the eyes of those abroad is still an open question. I'm under the impression that we're constantly being tested by the West."
For all his Western demeanor, Mr. Kwasniewski does not seem able to kick speech habits learned as a junior minister in the Communist Government of the 1980's. An analysis of his statements in the first 100 days by Rzeczpospolita, the national daily, revealed old-style syntax like "competent organs are to decide about sanctions against the guilty prescribed by law."
Mr. Kwasniewski meant: the law should prevail.

Disability Policies Questioned
In the last four years, New York City's Board of Education and the Human Resources Administration have aggressively steered thousands of poor students classified with learning difficulties or emotional problems off municipal welfare and onto Federal disability payments, saving the city and state $5.2 million. But now, children's advocates and educational experts say the effort to cut costs takes special education's defects and makes them worse, encouraging families and officials to keep children in dead-end special education programs. [Page 1.]
 
Paying for a New Stadium
A new home for the New York Yankees, whether a renovated stadium in the Bronx or a new one on the West Side of Manhattan, could prove to be the most expensive stadium in the country's history. But Mayor Giuliani said it could be built at little or no cost to the city's taxpayers. [25.]

It's Spring Break in the City
Janice Tysman had never ridden on a subway until the other day, and there she was on an uptown C train dancing between the steel poles and singing. It was springtime, and this was part of a weeklong immersion in the wonders of the Big McIntosh for 21 students from Grand Haven, Mich. Like scores of other groups this time of year, they scraped together enough money to come to New York for spring break. [25.]
 
New Deputy Mayor Appointed
Mayor Giuliani appointed Rudy Washington as his Deputy Mayor for Community Relations, for the first time placing an African-American in the highest level of his administration. [26.]
 
Ruling Halts Home-Care Cuts
A Federal judge has ruled that New York City has arbitrarily cut home care for thousands of elderly and disabled people without providing medical or other explicit reasons for doing so. [27.]
 
A Historian on Uniforms
For the last four years, an expert on military and civilian uniforms has made a business, run from his cluttered apartment in the Flatiron district of Manhattan, out of digging up and dispensing historical tidbits, many of which are documented only in visual records, to costumers and designers in the entertainment industry. [27.]
 
Telephones Out in Brooklyn
Two big telephone cables were knocked out in Brooklyn, disrupting communications among a half-dozen police precincts and making the world a lot smaller for thousands of borough residents. [27.]
 
Credit Card Fraud Revealed
In what computer experts say may be one of the biggest breaches of security of personal data held by the Government, several people passed information on more than 11,000 people to a credit-card fraud ring, according to Federal prosecutors in New York. [A6.]

Unemployment Up in 3 States
Although the national unemployment rate crept up only slightly in March, the rate for New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania moved sharply higher, according to a Federal report. The regional rate jumped to 6.8 percent from the 6 percent level of both February and January. [36.]

HEADLINE: The Tax-Reform Obsession

BYLINE: By Paul R. Krugman; Paul R. Krugman is a professor of economics at Stanford University. His last article for the Magazine, "Stay on Their Backs," was in February.

 BODY:
STEVE FORBES'S PRESIDENTIAL CAM-paign may have crashed and burned, but tax reform lives on, and on, and on. Should President Clinton lose in November, a flat tax will become a top priority in Congress. Even if he should win, Republicans will spend the next four years blaming the tax system for all our economic failings. Either way, we will continue to hear a lot about taxes, which raises a question.
Why are Republicans so obsessed with tax reform? Why don't they promise instead to eliminate traffic jams? 
 This is not a silly question. The case for doing something about traffic is based on impeccable free-market economics, every bit as solid as the argument for reforming our tax system. Tax reform, however, is an iffy business -- the flat-tax plans peddled this year by Forbes and others would probably do more harm than good.
By contrast, traffic reform is a $40 billion sure thing. But traffic congestion, along with a number of similar issues like pollution management and water rights, goes unmentioned in current political discussion. And when such issues do come up, conservative politicians are often on the wrong side, which tells you something important about the blinkered vision of many people who fancy themselves champions of free markets.
Serious tax-reform advocates point out that the current system has two main flaws that harm economic efficiency. First, some people pay a "marginal" tax rate as high as 40 percent -- that is, of every extra dollar they earn, 40 cents goes to the Government. This surely discourages people from working as hard as they might. Second, because the Government taxes interest and profits, the system discourages people from saving for the future. So theorists have devised alternative tax systems that might lead to greater work effort and higher savings, and might therefore expand the American economy.
But how big would these gains be? A lot of savings are already tax exempt, because of special tax breaks for retirement accounts. And we can't do away with taxes altogether: like it or not, we still need to pay for the government services we want. This limits the scope for reducing marginal rates. For example: a realistic flat tax, one that would raise as much money as the current income tax, would still have to involve a marginal rate of well over 20 percent. That's lower than the 40 percent rate some people now pay, but most people don't pay that rate anyway. And even that 20-something rate is possible only if we eliminate the tax deduction for interest on home mortgages -- which means that while the economy might gain from the new tax, millions of middle-class families would lose.
The fact is that serious tax analysts believe that the net benefits from even a complete overhaul of the tax system would be modest -- almost surely less than a 1 percent increase in the nation's income, or about $60 billion a year -- and that while most people might gain, many would lose. In practice, the prospect of middle-class outrage means that schemes like the flat tax are usually sold with the promise of unrealistically low tax rates. And while a realistic flat tax might help the economy a bit, a Forbes-style proposal, with its promise to provide large tax cuts for the rich without any increases for the middle class, would create a huge budget deficit, thereby doing the economy far more harm than good.
Now let's talk about traffic. Traffic congestion is not a minor annoyance. Last year Americans lost more than eight billion hours to traffic delays, at a total cost of more than $80 billion -- mainly in the form of wasted time, but also through extra consumption of gasoline, wear and tear on autos and so on.
But aren't traffic jams just a fact of life? No. In large part they are the result of a system that, like the tax system, encourages people to make economically inefficient decisions.
CONSIDER, FOR EXAMPLE, MY OWN antisocial actions a few weeks ago. A colleague and I were going to a meeting in San Francisco, 30 miles away. At the cost of some minor inconvenience we could have traveled together. But we didn't, and by taking my own car I added marginally to the already world-class traffic congestion on Highway 101.
I probably didn't delay any individual's morning commute by more than a fraction of a second, but that tiny delay was imposed on each of thousands of cars crawling along the freeway behind me. It's a good bet that the total delay that other people suffered for the sake of my slight convenience was more than an hour.
There ought to have been a way to make a deal: I wouldn't clog the freeway, and other drivers would compensate me for the inconvenience of car pooling. Since the cost I imposed on other people by driving during rush hour was much greater than the benefit I derived, such a deal could have made everyone happier. Of course, it is impractical to make such a deal directly, but we can try to reproduce its results.
The classic economist's prescription for dealing with traffic is for the government to impose "congestion fees," tolls for using roads during periods of overcrowding. With modern technology, such tolls could even be collected without tollbooths: an electronic sensor could pick up the signal from a tiny gizmo on your dashboard, or a low-powered laser could read a bar code on your windshield. The fees could then be rebated to the public. Realistic estimates suggest that such fees could cut the cost of traffic congestion considerably, and leave the great majority of people better off. Most of those deterred from rush-hour driving would be more than compensated for their inconvenience through the rebate scheme. Those who continued to drive would be compensated for the extra tolls with a much faster trip to work.
I know what some conservatives are thinking -- this is just another government intrusion into daily life. But think of it another way: what we have here is a problem of inadequately defined property rights. Space on Highway 101 during rush hour is a scarce resource, just like waterfront real estate. Unfortunately, nobody holds clear title to that resource, and so it is overused.
So why don't we try to establish a properly functioning free market in road space? Suppose we issue registered drivers in a metropolitan area a specified number of "rush hour points," which they are free to sell at their discretion, and require anyone who drives during rush hour to present (electronically) the appropriate number of points. Let us also create a market in these points. Some people will continue to drive every day; they will need to purchase extra points. Others will find new ways of getting to work and will sell their points for whatever the, ahem, traffic will bear. How market-oriented can you get? And such a scheme, like congestion fees, would make most people better off, either because they get extra money by selling their points or because the cost of buying points is more than offset by a quicker commute.
The reason that creating a market in road space and imposing congestion fees would produce similar results is, of course, that -- as any bright Econ 1 student can tell you -- they are essentially equivalent. Either way, what you are doing is creating a market incentive for people like me to take into account the costs we impose on others by driving during rush hour.
The benefits of such a scheme would not be small change. Traffic experts tell us that a sensible system of congestion fees could easily cut the annual cost of highway delays by $30 billion or $40 billion. These savings are offset to a degree by the inconvenience to those who are deterred from driving. But the net benefits could be $15 billion a year or more. Tacking on fees for heavy trucks that damage highways and for air travel to overcrowded airports yields a middle-of-the-road estimate (and what other kind of estimate would you want?) that traffic reform could enrich the American public by $40 billion to $50 billion every year.
There are other places where properly defined property rights could yield a big payoff. Water is a very scarce resource in the American West. Under the current system, thirsty cities are rationed even while desert farmers feed irrigated alfalfa to their cattle. Why not create a free market in water rights? Another example is the airwaves, which used to carry only radio and television but are increasingly in demand to allow wireless communication among people and computers. Broadcast rights could be traded in a free market but -- despite the recent auction of a limited slice of the spectrum -- mostly aren't, with the result that a bandwidth that could be carrying vital business data is carrying infomercials instead.
So why isn't there a major conservative politician out there campaigning on a platform of extending free-market principles, of creating property rights where they should exist but don't? Such a politician could promise to raise national income by $60 billion, $80 billion, even $100 billion a year -- and could do so honestly, without the slippery arithmetic that underlies the promises we hear about tax reform.
To be fair, many conservative economists have advocated the kind of reforms I have described. (So have many liberal economists.) But for the most part they have been ignored.
The reason, I believe, is that the political appeal of economic conservatism really has very little to do with the virtues of free markets. Instead, it is about the promise of something for nothing -- a rejection of the idea that taxes must be collected, that scarce resources must be conserved. The reason the electorate likes tax- reform schemes is that they always end up being tax-cutting schemes, based on the premise that the voters pay taxes but someone else gets the benefits -- even though anyone who looks at where the money actually goes quickly realizes that Pogo was right: we have met the enemy, and he is us.
As a result, not only do prominent conservatives rarely support proposals to extend the range of the market, but also they often actively oppose them. For example, the supply-side guru George Gilder has vociferously campaigned against plans to auction off a limited slice of the airwaves. Instead, incredibly, he advocates anarchy -- let anyone broadcast on whatever frequency. This is crazy. What it reflects, one suspects, is a basic unwillingness to accept the idea that there are any scarce resources, any limits that must be respected.
So the next time you encounter a conservative who likes to talk about the virtues of the free market, ask him what he thinks about creating a market in rights to drive in rush-hour traffic, or to use Western water. If he demurs, then he doesn't really believe in free markets -- he believes in free lunches.

HEADLINE: WORD & IMAGE;
Long Live the Monarchy!

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
THE NEW YORK TIMES HAS EXISTED FOR 145 years, but it is preparing to celebrate a centenary. The first of three commemorative Times Magazines this year will appear next week, to be followed by four major museum exhibitions, a centennial Book Review, a major Times donation to education and a royal feast for staff and friends. Royal indeed, because it's a monarchy we're toasting -- the 100th year of control of this notable enterprise by a single family descended from Adolph S. Ochs.
It was 100 years ago this spring that the 37-year-old Ochs set out to repeat in New York his success in Chattanooga at reviving a moribund newspaper named The Times. Though burdened with debt from failed real-estate ventures, he quickly proved the soundness of his strategy: to publish copious and impartial news for "thoughtful, pure-minded people" while commanding the authority to reinvest his profits in journalistic ventures of long-term value. 
 By August 1896, he had control of The New-York Times and promptly rekindled the spirit of its staff. In September, he created a magazine to illustrate the news; in October, a book review with the news of ideas. In November, he listed the arrival of out-of-town buyers, heralding a yearlong expansion of business coverage. Within four years, he hugely multiplied The Times's circulation, doubled its advertising and earned his contractual reward of a majority of the company's voting stock.
"Now I am monarch of all I survey," Ochs told his family, and so, too, have been his heirs. They have followed his teachings and hoarded their regal authority through wars and depressions and technological revolutions, in lean years and fat, despite divorces and heart attacks, estate taxes and stock vacillations. They are among the last of a vanishing breed, publishers who make money to support their journalism at a time when most publishers practice journalism to make more money.
FAMILY-OWNED NEWSPAPERS WERE ONCE THE norm in America. But the laws of man and nature gradually took their toll, taxing away estates and diluting gene pools. Three-fourths of the nation's 1,550 papers are now owned remotely, by chains, and large chains are swallowing smaller ones. To diversify their sources of income, even some family papers like The New York Times and the Grahams' Washington Post have themselves acquired newspaper subsidiaries, and papers alert to a gradual loss of family control, like the Taylors' Boston Globe and the Danielses' News and Observer in Raleigh, have sold themselves to the most attractive bidders.
Family ownership, of course, is no guarantee of distinguished newspapering. And The Wall Street Journal is daily proof that corporate ownership need not be the enemy of quality. But most chain owners decree no journalistic mission or political line for their wards. They demand only a relentless growth on the bottom line. And since the benefits of automated printing have now been largely realized, many publishers look to maximize profit by saving on the costs of paper and staff, which means stinting on the volume and quality of the news.
Recent increases in the cost of newsprint have been widely used to justify layoffs of reporters and editors, cuts in newsroom budgets and even the closing of newspapers. The Times Mirror Company, for example, not only decreed serious reductions at such venerable papers as The Los Angeles Times, The Hartford Courant and The Baltimore Sun. It altogether abandoned the enterprising New York Newsday, whose prospects were hardly worse than The Times's when Adolph Ochs arrived. But as intended, the heirs of the founding Chandler family and their managers doubled their stocks' value in just a few months.
Add the demand for higher stock prices to the lures of stock options, and you get the pressures that now drive most newspaper corporations. Some chains have pooled resources to improve their news gathering, but many more have consolidated to cut expenses, thereby reducing the number of observers who stand watch over public affairs.
In a chorus of despair, even editors at unchained papers report that they are under pressure to put concern for Wall Street ahead of their responsibility to Main Street. They say they are being judged not by how well they spend the company's money but by how much money they manage not to spend. Hiring freezes and attrition schemes proliferate, as if any cub reporter could easily replace an experienced correspondent and as if computers and faxes could shorten the time it takes to pursue a hidden truth. Newsrooms are being subjected to the scrutiny of efficiency experts, who define talent as a cost instead of an asset and some of whom declare that they can find economies in inherently inefficient creative labors like investigating, interviewing and writing.
Given this history, I strongly favor a newspaper monarchy over every form of stockholder democracy. The Ochs clan are no spendthrifts. And as significant holders of Times stock, they are hardly indifferent to its market value. But imbued with the royal blood, they instinctively weigh the interests of today against the obligations to tomorrow. Their self-esteem is wrapped in newsprint; the paper's character becomes their own.
The Times's current chairman, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, has prudently disciplined all his operations with budgets, financial plans and business managers. But when Iraqi troops mobilize, Berlin walls topple and Oklahoma buildings explode, no one hesitates to deploy platoons of reporters, photographers and editors and to clear the pages for their accounts. Disfavor awaits only those who fail to harvest the news in The Times's customary, inherited manner.
Faced with limited press capacity in World War I, Adolph Ochs rejected more than 60 columns of advertising a day to accommodate vital news. As Elmer Davis recorded from his perch on the editorial board, the publisher felt "compelled" to make that choice. Similarly, in World War II, with newsprint rationed, Ochs's son-in-law and successor, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, annually printed three million more lines of news than his competitors, watching them grow rich on the ads he relinquished. Since The Times has outlived its rivals, it is easy now to celebrate these decisions as both noble and shrewd. Why, then, have not more publishers followed that pattern? Why do so many sacrifice news coverage to pay for paper?
The answer is that only a few publishers have inherited both the values and the authority to override the clamor of stock market analysts and prophets. Only a few are still able to balance their obligations to readers against their obligations to shareholders. And only a very few live to preserve the legacy of their ancestors for the enlightenment of their posterity. Long live those monarchies!

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Dr. Terrell Ward Bynum;
The Internet: In Need of a Value System

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
TERRELL WARD BYNUM is a professor of philosophy and director of the Research Center on Computing and Society at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven. Since 1978, Dr. Bynum, has been conducting research in computer ethics. He was a chairman of Ethicomp 95, an international symposium at De Montford University in Leicester, England, and is one of the organizers of a new computer ethics consortium that has brought together scientists from all over the world.
Working with a laptop at home -- a MacIntosh Powerbook with a 1.7 gigabyte hard drive and video capabilities -- and several desktops at his office, Dr. Bynum and his colleagues are trying to develop a set of ethical rules to guide people through the information age. 
 Dr. Bynum was interviewed recently on the Southern campus. Following are some excerpts from that conversation.
Q. Are there any extreme examples of unethical use of computers?
A. Well, right after Elvis Presley's death, computers were used to dial up people who had purchased tickets to Presley's concerts, and they were sold mementoes.
Personally, I think it's outrageous that companies are collecting data on the Internet and selling it.
At a local supermarket someone asked me if I wanted to fill out a form for a free electronic coupon card. Every time you check out they run this card through a slot, and after you've purchased a certain number of cans of tuna fish, you get 30 cents off, automatically.
Everyone thinks it's great -- you don't have to clip a coupon, you don't even have to think about it. But the company is collecting information and that information can be used to learn all sorts of things about you -- what's your age, your economic bracket, do you have health problems? Do you have pets or children? I think that's a horrendous invasion.
Q. Has the information industry attempted to address computer ethics?
A. Yes. In the late 1960's, Don Parker was shocked to discover programmers were being indicted for embezzling money through computers. As a member of the Association for Computing Machinery, the largest professional organization in the world for computing, he wrote the first code of computer ethics. It was revised in the late 1970's, and in the late 1980's.
The International Federation of Information Processors has also tried to put together a code of ethics, but they discovered they couldn't come to agreement, at least not yet.
Q. Have laws kept pace with the growth of technology?
A. There isn't any way to keep pace. The most recent law passed in this country on telecommunications made a mistake by trying to restrict pornographic materials.
Any attempt to regulate morality generally fails, especially in a country with the First Amendment. And it doesn't work anyway; the Internet is so easy to get through and around.
It's a very interesting problem for countries like China and Iran, which want the benefits of the Internet but don't want their people to get information off it.
Q. What about controlling particularly heinous points of view?
A. For the moment at least, the ideas keep canceling each other out. It's like a huge town square, where everyone can come and say whatever they want. The citizen can then pick and choose what he wants to believe. That's why I think trying to censor our Nazis and others is the wrong way to go. What we need to do is counter bigotry with education.
Q. So what kind of law is going to prevail on the Internet?
A. If you try to build your ethical principles on any particular constitution, or a particular religion, it's not going to work. One of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, John Barlow, has said that in cyberspace, the American Constitution is a local ordinance. It's one country out of 100, 150 on the Internet, and whose law prevails? Nobody's. For the first time in history we're challenged to develop ethical and social principles that are genuinely global.
Q. Is that possible?
A. Well, we don't know, but if there is no set of behavioral guidelines, there's going to be chaos, and a great resource will be lost.
The major ethical theories of today have been traced to the evolution of printing, which suddenly made it possible for people all over Europe to read and decide for themselves, as well as the Industrial Revolution, which enabled people to travel.
Now there's a theory that the Internet will be the birthplace of the next major wave of ethical thinking.
Q. Has there ever been a cultural or social revolution to rival what is happening with computers?
A. I don't think so. Information technology is the most powerful and the most flexible technology ever invented; powerful technology always has a major social impact.
Probably the only thing that comes close to rival it would be farming, which gave people the ability to stay in one place and build communities and write books and have a place to keep them and so forth. That totally changed the world.
Q. What's kind of issues are you trying to work out, as a philosopher?
A. Take the concept of ownership. When computer software came along, we had to decide who owned software, and what kind of ownership you get -- there are copyrights, and patents, and so forth. And what do you own? Do you own just what you originally wrote? Do you own any translation of that? Do you own the algorithm behind it?
Q. Why do so many of your writings focus on privacy issues?
A. If you surf the World Wide Web, your name and address are known to the owners of the Web pages that you view. If you get onto Yahoo, for example, because you're interested in buying an automobile or in gay rights, Yahoo records that you were there, and what pages you were interested in, and how long you stayed on each page. They take that information and sell it to companies that figure out your interests and try to sell you goods and services. We're giving away our privacy.
Q. Do people realize how much they are disclosing about themselves?
A. No, they don't. If people did, probably they wouldn't search with the kind of abandon that they have now. Even if someone doesn't have AIDS, they might be interested in the subject, and search dozens of pages. Someone is going to suspect they have AIDS, and when they try to get insurance or look for a job, it might come back to haunt them.
Q. Are we creating a society where there are two classes of people -- those with access to information, and those without?
A. That is one of the major ethical considerations in computing, the haves and have-nots. And the gap is getting wider and wider, more and more quickly.
It seems to me it's the ethical responsibility of the government of every industrialized nation to see to it that all their own citizens have access to information, and in their foreign policy to see the have-not nations of the world get access.
Q. Is there a way to guarantee equal access to information?
A. Not one way, but lots of ways. For example, the government could do what it did with the phone companies years ago -- give a monopoly in a particular region, but only if the service is made cheaper, so that anyone can afford it.
In public libraries, it used to be that even the poorest person could go in and read the newspaper, become self-educated, and so forth. So another policy would be to see to it that as the public library system moves into cyberspace, access for the poor remains in place.
Q. So information technology should become a regulated utility with universal service?
A. You can make a case that in the long run, wiring up everyone makes sense. We're either going to pay to wire them up and educate them, or we're going to pay to put them in jail.
Decreasing the gap between the haves and have-nots is much wiser. I'm not saying do that out of the goodness of your heart, do it out of concern for your own pocketbook, out of concern for your safety and the safety of your children.
Q. Are we going to obtain access to so much information that we can no longer assimilate it?
A. That's inevitable. What we need to do is develop new tools to handle information overload. These days I can find 500 pieces of E-mail in my box in the morning. There isn't any way I could read that much and still do my job. So I began to develop new information processing skills.
Q. A recent divorce case cited E-mail messages from a married woman to someone she had never met. Should E-mail be a sign of infidelity?
A. Certainly it is a sign of infidelity, if you're actively flirting with someone, and sharing fantasies with them. It's a symptom there's something wrong.
But all of this went on with love letters before. They were used to blackmail people, and they certainly led to divorces and so forth.
The issue is, it will become even easier to engage in even more fantasies. There is now apparatus that you can attach to your body that can be controlled from a distance, so you can stimulate a partner a long distance away, so you can not only talk about your fantasies, you can act them out in some physical sense.
Eventually there will be virtual reality where you can put on a data suit and reach out and touch someone, and they will feel your touch. Five or 10 years from now, you will be able to have very real physical encounters with someone thousands of miles away.
Q. Is it time to back off from technology?
A. Even if it was, there's no way to back off. The economic and social advantages are too great. You're not going to stop it, but you've got to realize what the issues are and come up with policies to deal with them, and your policies cannot be too repressive or restrictive.

Beyond the Cosmetics in Varicose Veins

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
IT is estimated that as many as 80 million people in the United States have varicose veins, 90 percent of whom are women. To many, these twisted, discolored veins are just a cosmetic problem or something that causes a little discomfort. But all varicose veins have the potential for serious complications and, therefore, should be examined by experts, said Dr. Hesmat Majlessi, a vascular surgeon who heads the Rye Vein Care Center in Rye.
Dr. Majlessi is a member of the American Phlebology Society of America and adapted his techniques of treating varicose veins from Dr. George Fegan of England, a pioneer in the field. He is skeptical of common methods of treating varicose veins because, he said, they do not usually cure the problem but just treat the symptoms. 
 Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Dr. Majlessi, who is affiliated with United Hospital Medical Center in Port Chester:
Q. What are varicose veins and why are they more than a cosmetic problem?
A. Varicose veins are normal veins that have become much more dilated and tortured and twisted. They become very unsightly at the beginning. Then they develop their complications. This starts as swelling in the legs and then progresses into phlebitis, which is formation of clots in the legs, which a few hundred thousand patients a year develop. There are other complications as well, which can be disabling and can cause about $2 billion annual health care costs to the U.S. economy. Another result is a change in the color of the skin, which is called dermatitis. This can be of great concern cosmetically. But it is not only cosmetics; it can cause life-threatening complications.
Q. Is it only in legs, or can one get varicose veins in other parts of the body?
A. You could have them in other places, but I would say over 99 percent of them are in the leg because of gravity due to standing.
Q. If a person sees a little bit of a protrusion from a vein, is that necessarily a varicose vein?
A. Not necessarily. I see a lot of young girls who come with protruding veins, and they are young and very active, and they are thin and have a light-colored skin. So the normal vein protrudes because of their daily strenuous activities. I tell them that they should not be treated at all. It's only a cosmetic thing.
Q. What does a true varicose vein look like in contrast?
A. When the patient stands up, especially, you can see the veins, which are more protruding than usual. If you touch them, they are very tender due to the increased pressure in the veins from a leak in the leg. They are tortured, which means they are not straight; they are twisted.
Q. What causes this leaking?
A. The important and crucial part that has to be known and found during diagnosis and treatment is the source of the varicose vein, which I call a leak. Scientifically, they are called reflux valves. They are connections between the small veins in the leg and the big veins inside, which carry a small valve inside. There are typically 200 to 300 of these in the leg and the thigh. Any time any of these valves does not do its job properly, blood flows backward, meaning from the inside to the out, from the big veins to the small veins. This gradually makes them larger and twisted. Any time that varicose veins are treated, whether by surgery -- which is called stripping -- or by my method, the leak or leaks have to be identified and controlled. And that's what the drawback of stripping is. It does not find and control the leaks.
Q. What is stripping?
A. The patient goes to a hospital under a major anesthesia usually; many cuts are made in the leg, between 10 to 40 or 50, and the veins are taken out. This includes a very important vein called the saphenous vein, a long vein from the groin down to the ankle on the inside. This vein is taken out traditionally, but this is a major drawback to stripping. This vein has to be preserved for possible future bypass surgeries in the leg and in the heart. In most cases, this vein can be preserved without actually touching it.
Q. Is stripping a cure?
A. Not at all. The chance of recurrence is actually great. I see about 300 to 400 patients a year who have had one or more strippings. They have a recurrence of varicose veins in the same leg. Obviously, these are not the old veins, because those were taken out. It's because the leak in the valve has not been found in the leg or the thigh or the back of the knee. And the varicose vein has been taken out by stripping, but the leak opens up some other vein, because there are tens of thousands of veins in the leg.
A treatment that is done by dermatologists is called sclerotherapy. This is good for the spider-size veins -- it basically closes them -- but not for the large varicose veins. It makes sense that when you get a treatment that you cure the condition. You don't want the patient to come back to your office with the same problem. In order to accomplish that, the doctor should have the expertise to not only treat the large varicose veins but to find the source -- and close the source -- as well. Sclerotherapy is, in my opinion, an out-dated method that should no longer be done.
Q. What is your procedure for treating varicose veins?
A. What I do is called comprehensive compression sclerotherapy, which involves identifying all the veins and perforated vessels. The technique combines the injection of a special sclerosing solution with prolonged compression of the vein. The solution irritates the inner wall of the blood vessel, causing healthy scar tissue to develop. The scar tissue seals off the vessel from further blood flow, and the vein structurally dissolves. Whether the vein is small, medium or large, it can be treated and the recurrence rate should be far, far less because I find the source of the leak. That is why a consultation takes an hour and half. I can put my fingers over a couple of the leaks, and all the veins disappear.
Q. Why are women more likely to get varicose veins than men?
A. About 90 percent of the cases are in women, and these are mainly due to two factors: heredity and pregnancy. If your mom, grandma, sisters, aunts had varicose veins, it increases the chance that you will have varicose veins. Pregnancy causes pressure in the pelvic vein, and a lot of patients develop varicose veins during pregnancy. But in the majority of such cases they go away after delivery. So it should not be treated at the time of pregnancy.
Q. Is obesity a factor?
A. Yes, any factor that increases pressure in the veins. Standing, weight lifting, these can theoretically increase pressure in the veins, and if there is a leak they can speed up formation of varicose veins.
Q. Is it always important for people to seek treatment for what is apparently a varicose vein? Or if cosmetics are of no concern, can it be ignored?
A. At certain stages it is really cosmetic in nature, although it can have a tremendous impact on a patient's life style. Young people, especially, who have them do not wear shorts, do not go swimming. It affects how they feel about themselves. But this is purely cosmetic. But if they leave it alone -- and there is no exception to this -- it will progress, unfortunately. It will leak gradually and enlarge and then the aching will start and the night cramps will start and then the phlebitis and clots, which sometimes, although rarely, could be serious. Then, patients have changes in the skin, and there is bleeding. There are complications. The patient has to make the decision to wait until that point or to prevent it. I always leave that up to the patient.

Ethnic Influences Fuel a Takeoff In Houston Dining

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER; BRYAN MILLER, a former restaurant critic for The Times, writes about food.

 BODY:
HOUSTON is identified by two industries, one undergound (oil), the other high above (space). They fuel the economy -- and civic pride -- in America's fourth largest city, yet something else is happening, this time at street level: a flourishing multi-ethnic restaurant scene.
Texas cuisine, Tex-Mex, American, French, Italian, Vietnamese and Chinese all can be found in this highway-laced metropolis of 600 square miles. Just five years ago Houston's business scene was flatter than the Texas panhandle, and the restaurant industry was stagnant. But as the city diversified its economic base, restaurateurs were able to hitch a ride on the national recovery. 
 Today the Houston food world is crackling, although the city has a way to go before it can be called a dining destination. Luxury restaurants are scarce (partly a reflection of the city's casual style of living) and some of the second-tier establishments suffer from overambition and lack of focus. Visitors can find some of the most authentic regional fare in vest-pocket cafes like Berryhill in the River Oaks section and at the cafeteria-style Goode Company Texas Bar-B-Q in the Westpark neighborhood.
Like many other American cities, Houston has gone steak crazy, with some of the top-rated including Brenner's Steakhouse, Lynn's Steakhouse, Kelly's del Frisco, Ruth's Chris and Taste of Texas, to name a few. Mexican influences are pervasive no matter what the cuisine, so one should be vigilant for jalapenos.
Houston restaurants offer giant portions at moderate prices -- and Houstonians would accept nothing less. Micro-brewed beers are well represented at most establishments, and wine lists, for the most part, look toward California.
The price ranges listed for the restaurants below are for a three-course dinner for two, including a glass of wine and 8.5 percent tax (but no tip).
 
Cafe Annie
When restaurant buffs talk about Houston, this name always comes up -- with good reason.
The handsome mahogany-paneled Cafe Annie is the creation of Robert Del Grande (the chef), his wife, Mimi, and their partners, Lonnie and Candice Schiller. Entering its 17th year (six at this location), Cafe Annie's refined tone and sharp service support Mr. Del Grande's intellectual approach to Southwestern cooking.
He once described his food as styled after chuck-wagon cooking, which is like calling the Astrodome a covered playground. Mr. Del Grande, a former biochemist and a self-taught cook, creates dishes with striated flavors that romp across the palate.
Exceptional dishes on the voluminous menu are the crabmeat tostada tinged with Tabasco and served with avocado relish and a tomato salsa; a moist and tasty enchilada of rabbit atop a pool of bracing red chili mole; and lovely mussel soup flavored with a cilantro-serrano cream.
Outstanding main courses include the grilled quail with white beans and fennel, and pan-seared red snapper garnished with crabmeat and accompanied by a wild-mushroom tapenade.
One of Mr. Del Grande's signature dishes is worth trying, too: a black-angus filet rubbed with coffee grounds that give it a sharp, earthy edge.
Cafe Annie has a good selection of wines by the glass; the bottle list is well selected and fairly priced. Two bargains are, in white, a slightly tart 1994 Sancerre (Domaine Des Corbillieres, $26), and in red, a full-bodied 1993 Zaca Mesa syrah ($24).
For dessert, try the chocolate-cappuccino meringue encasing a rich chocolate mousse core or the smooth cream-cheese flan.
Dinner for two at Cafe Annie ranges from $80 to $100.
 
Rio Ranch Steakhouse
The Del Grandes and their partners in Cafe Annie, the Schillers, opened this steakhouse, a more casual restaurant with a Texas ranch-house style, in January 1993. The airy, rustic dining room is adjacent to the Westchase Hilton.
Mr. Del Grande has described his goal as serving home-style regional dishes. First-time visitors will feel at home in this terrific place -- that is, if their mothers routinely whipped up dishes like quail rubbed with ancho chilis, homemade venison sausage and applewood-smoked turkey salad.
The full-time chef at Rio Ranch is San Hemwattakit, a 10-year veteran of Cafe Annie. His bold and well-calibrated sauces are a delight, whether in the shrimp with an earthy salsa of roasted tomatoes, onions, garlic, pepper and avocado, or the mesquite-grilled chicken served in a little cast-iron skillet with guacamole and a side of soft tortillas. If you have never tried that Southwestern classic, chicken-fried steak (or have only had a greasy, leaden version), the rendition here will be an epiphany. It is lightly coated in a buttermilk batter, golden and almost puffed, and served with mashed potatoes and creamy black-pepper gravy. Rio Ranch's California-style wine list is well matched to the food, and priced well.
Dinner at Rio Ranch Steakhouse runs between $60 and $85 for two.
 
Tony's
Tony Vallone is the self-styled host of Houston, a man on hand-kissing terms with the city's social elite, who for a quarter-century has cosseted princes and presidents, magnates and movie stars. His newly refurbished dining room, which reopened last September, is a startling chamber of red with an undulating mahogany wall near the bar. The room looks as if the architect started out to created a retro supper club, then reversed direction in mid-project to make it more contemporary. (Mr. Vallone also owns three more-casual spots in Houston: Anthony's, La Griglia and Grotto).
Mr. Vallone darts around the room greeting his guests; his staff is equally vigilant and friendly. Typical of Tony's classic French-Italian fare is the signature lobster souffle, which has lots of lobster flavor but is thick and too heavy. An herby artichoke torte suffered from a floury, undercooked crust. Try something lighter, like the half-moon pasta with asparagus and leek stuffing in a shrimp sauce.
Main courses to watch for include a flavor-packed osso buco and snapper topped with crabmeat over sauteed spinach. The wine list is big on Bordeaux, especially older vintages, and California cabernet sauvignon. Prices vary but are generally reasonable. Dinner for two: $80 to $110.
 
Goode Company Texas Bar-B-Q
For authentic Texas barbecue that you can eat on long picnic tables outside, accompanied by twangy country-western CD's, try Goode Company Texas Bar-B-Q on 5109 Kirby Drive (with a second branch at 8911 Katy Freeway).
The tiny cabin, redolent of mesquite smoke, has about a dozen cramped tables, farm tools on the walls as well as historic photos and beer signs.
Customers line up cafeteria style and choose from barbecued brisket (the best), smoked turkey, ham, pork ribs, barbecued duck and much more. Sides include cole slaw, zesty red rice, jalapeno pinto beans and baked beans. The brisket is lean, delicately smoked and wonderfully moist. Smoked turkey is extraordinarily moist, too. Pork ribs are meaty and tender with a dark, smoked crust.
You can eat like a ranch hand, including a beer and good pecan pie, for less than $15 a person.
 
Berryhill Hot Tamales And Baja Fish Tacos
This is another tiny spot worth seeking out. About the size of a gas station office, Berryhill, at 2639 Revere Street, is a clean and cheerful cafe done in a Mexican folkloric theme. Somehow it seats about 30, plus a dozen tables outside.
Berryhill is locally renowned for its catfish taco, a perfectly fried fillet garnished with shredded red cabbage, cilantro and a dab of tartar-like yogurt-based sauce. For $2.75 you can't beat it. The chicken version is equally savory. Try some well-seasoned black beans and the fluffy rice. The menu includes enchiladas (chicken and corn) and quesadillas (salmon with green beans, chicken with cheese). Beer and a small selection of wines are served.
Two can have a sizable meal at Berryhill, including a beverage, for less than $25.
 
Americas
 One of the more eccentric-looking and lively restaurants in Houston is on Post Oak Boulevard. Owned by Michael Cordua, who is also the chef, the restaurant is dedicated to indigenous food of the Americas, including potatoes, tomatoes, corn, peanuts, rabbit and chocolate. Thankfully, the food at Americas is not limited to just that.
The dining rooms are meant to evoke the mystical lands of South America. Snaking wood panels on the ceiling are modeled after rope bridges of the South American jungle; the ground-level tapas bar is built of mesquite. Stalactite chandeliers add an eerie touch.
I had time only for a tapas tour, but judging from those alone, a visit would be worthwhile. That is, if you don't mind the din on busy nights.
Grilled shrimp with a sweetish pimento sauce was refreshing; so were the various empanaditas, the golden pastry pockets filled with assorted meats. Among the main courses to watch for are pan-roasted Gulf snapper encrusted with fresh corn kernels, grilled lamb tenderloin served with arepas (Peruvian flat bread) and a mint salsa, and salmon fillet encrusted with crushed plantains and served over black beans.
Mr. Cordua also has two South American steakhouses in Houston, called Churrascos. Americas offers a selection of South American wines, as well as California and Australian labels. Ranging in price from $24 and up, the South American wines offer good value. Dinner for two at Americas runs from $45 to $60.
 
La Reserve
For luxury dining, this restaurant, in the Omni Hotel, is one of the favorites in the city. The dining room is comfortable, if institutional-looking, and service is formal and vigilant. The chef, Tim Keating, has a no-holds-barred approach that sometimes is more cloying than captivating -- a tower of lobster and foie gras was one example. A Dungeness crab cake with shiitake mushrooms and truffle essence was moist but oddly bland. Lamb shank is a meaty and rich entree, although it did not need the merguez sausage and gummy risotto. Stick with simple entrees. The wine list is extensive and well-chosen, especially among California labels, but it is priced on the high side. Desserts are lovely, especially the tangerine parfait with citrus compote.
Dinner for two at La Reserve runs from about $100 to $125.

HEADLINE: Broadway's Producers: A Struggling, Changing, Breed

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
THE PRODUCER ROBERT WHITEHEAD, at 80 one of the grand old men of Broadway, was approached recently by his 23-year-old son, Charlie, with a proposal that both flattered and confounded him.
"Charlie said to me, 'Dad, I feel I want to get into what you've done,' " recalled Mr. Whitehead, whose work over the last 50 years has ranged from the original productions of "A Member of the Wedding" and "A Man for All Seasons" to the current hit "Master Class." 
 Mr. Whitehead did not know what to say to his son. Could he in good conscience encourage the young man to become a Broadway producer? The business has changed drastically since he entered it in 1947, when Broadway was a fertile field for new plays and their impresarios. Now, the field seems hard and unyielding. The current season's crop of original dramas and musicals, once an annual bounty in the dozens, is thin. Revivals and long-running mega-musicals predominate.
"So I said to him," the father recounted, " 'I don't know how you do it, Charlie. I don't know how you make a life of it anymore.' "
Mr. Whitehead was not only imparting personal wisdom; he was defining a reality. What he considers producing, the Broadway tradition of taking an original play or musical and shepherding it from the written page to the Broadway stage, has all but ceased to be a career. Indeed, that fact has inspired a mantra repeated by some of the most respected artists in the theater: "There are no real Broadway producers anymore."
Gone are the days when producers were as much Broadway luminaries as the actors and composers they hired, when showmen like David Merrick, Kermit Bloomgarten and Billy Rose had the stature and business savvy to singlehandedly bring new plays to the theater district. Gone, too, is the era when producers could afford to mount new works each year and thus acquire the skills to shape scripts and the time to learn from their mistakes.
Where have all the producers gone? Some have fled to Off Broadway, where costs are lower. Others have pulled up stakes and headed for Hollywood. Those who remain, including a few from the old school of producing, are mostly occasional presences on Broadway; others are specialists in musical spectacles or wealthy investors. The only ones who produce from year to year are members of the new Broadway power group: nonprofit institutions like Lincoln Center Theater and the Roundabout Theater Company.
An up-to-the-minute snapshot of the Broadway Producers Class of '96 is a portrait of transience. Although a few of the faces would make it into a class picture any season, most would not. The producers pictured here (each one representing a show on Broadway) are a varied lot and, along with the many partners in their productions, so numerous that it would take an entire photo album to include them all.
They come from the worlds of theater and finance, from rock-and-roll, movies, academia and even the circus. Some, like the Theater Guild, producers of the film-to-stage musical "State Fair," are vestiges of the old days; the organization has not produced on Broadway since 1976. Others, like Allan S. Gordon, Jeffrey Seller and Kevin McCollum, the producers of the musical "Rent," are making their Broadway debuts.
Producing commercially, year in and year out, "is a craft that has fewer and fewer representatives," said Barry Weissler, who with his wife, Fran, produces on Broadway, primarily revivals. "It's becoming more and more difficult to find hands-on producers, the Robert Whiteheads of the world."
The impediments to producing are a reflection of the theater's harsh realities. The long-running musicals now tie up the best musical houses for years, if not decades, and the audience for the traditional Broadway play is drying up. But money is the biggest obstacle. At a time when the bargain-basement price for mounting a Broadway play is $750,000, when the cost of musicals can exceed $10 million, the complex job of bringing a production to Broadway has become more a matter of economics than taste, a game of deep pockets rather than long commitments.
These days, in fact, raising money is such an overwhelming part of producing that it has skewed the notion of who a producer is. A Broadway show no longer has one or two producer names above the title but a dozen. Producers do not come to Broadway with resumes. They come with stock portfolios.
"Everybody has different reasons for being here," said Michael David, a partner in Dodger Productions, which has produced a string of well-received musical revivals, including "Guys and Dolls" and "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying." That "we have a team that enables us to do it at all" is what matters, he said.
Take the revival of "The King and I," in which Mr. David is involved. When the original production opened on Broadway in 1951, the only producers were Rodgers and Hammerstein themselves. The cost of the show was $360,000. The 1996 production opening on Thursday -- same book, same music -- costs $5.5 million. And the list of producers reads like the result of a Wall Street merger: "Dodger Productions, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, James M. Nederlander, Perseus Productions with John Frost and the Adelaide Festival Center, in association with the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization . . ."
"It has become a money business rather than a creative business," observed James B. Freydberg, a longtime producer who is mounting one of the season's most expensive musicals, the $10 million "Big," opening later this month. "People are producing in groups of 10 or 11, and the problem in many cases is, there is nobody in charge; it's a very impersonal relationship to the show. There's no such thing as a personal relationship with 11 producers."
GERALD SCHOENFELD, chairman of the Shubert Organization, Broadway's biggest landlord, says producing today is "a business primarily of itinerants," where the players shift constantly.
At first glance, this might seem like a sign of vitality. But the reality, many in the theater say, is that an essential aspect has been lost in the breakup of the traditional producing fraternity: stability and the sense of belonging that leads producers to invest not only in the next potential mega-hit but in the creative people vital to the future of theater in America.
George C. Wolfe, the producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival, who directed both the musical "Jelly's Last Jam" and the drama "Angels in America" on Broadway, believes that the commercial theater no longer has the infrastructure to find and nurture original work consistently.
On Tuesday, Mr. Wolfe's musical, "Bring in da Noise, Bring in da Funk," a downtown hit he created from scratch last fall with Savion Glover and a group of other tap, rap and blues artists, begins performances at the Ambassador Theater on Broadway. Mr. Wolfe said that without the financial cushion provided by his own nonprofit theater, the show could not have been created.
"If I had gone into the commercial arena and said, 'O.K., I have this idea for a show and I want to work with Savion and we don't have a clue -- can you give me the money?,' it never would have happened," Mr. Wolfe said.
The problem is no secret on Broadway. Elizabeth I. McCann, who made her reputation in the 1970's by moving prestigious London productions to New York, said financing is a major problem. "I believe the difficulty in raising money has become so horrific," she said, "that -- forget commercial -- even if you look at the not-for-profit theater, half the plays are being produced someplace else before Broadway.
"Who in God's name is finding the baby in the bullrushes?" she asked.
CONSIDER THE CURRENT SEASON. Of the 33 plays and musicals that will have opened by May 1, the official end of the 1995-96 season, only six are, in essence, original works that were produced specifically for Broadway: "Chronicle of a Death Foretold," "Sacrilege," "Master Class," "Moon Over Buffalo," "Victor/Victoria" and "Big," and the latter two are based on hit movies.
The rest are either revivals (18 in all), one-person shows like Jackie Mason's "Love Thy Neighbor," or original plays and musicals created in nonprofit, regional or London theaters (like "Rent," "Getting Away With Murder" and "Racing Demon") that subsequently received productions on Broadway.
This is not what Broadway was supposed to become. "When you talked about the New York theater, you talked about the 12 or 15 plays that were on Broadway," Mr. Whitehead said. "Maybe there were three musicals, but when people came to see the theater, what they meant was the plays.
"And a producer," he continued, "seemed to me to be someone who had a point of view about what he produced, and his plays had a connection, one with the other, because it all had something to do with his taste."
Aside from a handful of today's biggest producers, like Cameron Mackintosh, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Company and Dodger Productions, there are few who are independent, with the vision or clout to put shows on again and again.
Into the producing vacuum on Broadway has rushed the organization. More and more it is institutions, whether corporate or nonprofit, that raise the capital to put on shows, many of which are lavish, highly commercial musicals or remakes of old plays. The past on Broadway belongs to the likes of the 84-year-old Mr. Merrick (who, despite the effects of a stroke, is back this year as a super-investor in the musical "State Fair"), but tomorrow belongs to Disney and other large companies. Disney has one of the most expensive musicals on Broadway, "Beauty and the Beast," and is restoring a Times Square theater in which to stage others.
Playmaking, a craft that producers like Mr. Whitehead once dominated, is now a Broadway business centered on staging revivals: call it playremaking.
"I think there's a very strong undercurrent of turning Broadway into a theme park," said John Hart, a producer of "How to Succeed." "Nickelodeon can come in and do 'Beavis and Butt-head: The Musical.' Ted Turner can come in and do 'Gone With the Wind: The Musical.' It's the only thing that makes sense, unless you find another way to really make this work, the way that a Broadway show should work, and everybody can make money doing it."
Before you can make money, though, you have to raise it. And in truth, many of the people listed as producers of Broadway shows are not producers at all. They are investors who have been granted producing credits as concessions to vanity.
"The backers are the producers today," insisted Alexander H. Cohen, who has been producing Broadway plays for more than 50 years. "Whether it is someone in the fish business or in the theatrical business, if they've got the $250,000, their name goes up there."
Increasingly, too, the theater owners, seeking productions to fill the 32 commercial houses of Broadway, are being compelled to invest in and even produce shows. The Shubert Organization produced "Cats" and has loaned money to the Shakespeare Festival to move "The Tempest" and "Bring in da Noise" to Broadway; Jujamcyn Theaters is a producer of five current Broadway productions and the Nederlander Organization is a producer of two others.
That the landlords must help finance the productions is a function, according to some producers, of the changes the theater owners foisted on the producers in the 1970's. At one time, theater owners shared the weekly costs of running a show with producers. Now, producers say, little is shared, and the additional burdens have pushed some producers out of the business. "I have to pay for the light bulbs," complained one frustrated producer. "I have to pay for new doilies around the ushers' necks."
SO WHAT OF BROADWAY'S FUTURE? Does the decline of the visionary showman mean the death of Broadway?
Already, the street is seeking ways to reinvent itself. Companies like Walt Disney Theatrical Productions and Livent, a Toronto-based concern headed by Garth Drabinsky ("Kiss of the Spider Woman" and "Show Boat"), are operating like musical production studios, commissioning composers and lyricists to write new stage musicals to fill theaters they plan to operate on 42d Street.
Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, not only invests frequently in the productions his theaters house but supports the younger generation of producers. For example, he provides office space to producers like Elizabeth Williams ("Moon Over Buffalo") and Margo Lion ("Jelly's Last Jam"), both of whom are developing projects for Broadway.
Broadway is also looking at itself for answers. A commercial theater institute sponsored by the Theater Development Fund trains young producers each year through weekly seminars. And a team of analysts from Bain and Company, a Boston management consulting firm, has been hired by the city and a broad coalition of Broadway landlords, unions and producers to study the way Broadway operates. Its mandate is to come up with proposals for a theater trust fund, envisioned as a means of helping producers finance new musicals and plays.
Producers these days need all the help they can get to stay in the game that many of them say they still love.
"It's a very complex business, and it requires an astute understanding of so many disciplines," Mr. Drabinsky said. "But opening a new theater is exhilarating. And opening a new show is even more so."

HIGH AND TIGHT
The Rise and Fall of Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry.
By Bob Klapisch.
Illustrated. 236 pp. New York:
Villard Books. $22.
THE challenge in writing an expos is that you have to have something to expose. In "High and Tight," Bob Klapisch, who used to cover the Mets for The Daily News, promises to tell all about Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden. Too bad it's all been told already. 
 Sports Illustrated revealed in February 1995 that the Mets clubhouse was once rife with cocaine and amphetamine abuse. The commissioner's office has informed us that Gooden and Strawberry drank and used drugs. Mr. Klapisch, unfortunately, doesn't have much to add. We find out that Strawberry contemplated suicide not once but twice; we learn that Gooden took Prozac after his stay in the Betty Ford Center. But "Ball Four" this ain't.
Instead of revealing new debauch-eries, Mr. Klapisch spins a tale of addiction and redemption that was supposed to dovetail with the duo's triumphant return to New York, older, wiser and now wearing pin stripes. Describing Strawberry hitting a home run for the Yankees, Mr. Klapisch lays it on thick: "Moments such as these made it possible to see Strawberry's career as a miniature tragedy. So much talent, so much of it traded away for a cheap high. . . . But he at least was willing to understand that 'the last few years of my career can be dedicated towards finishing strong.' "
Couple that with a clean and sober Gooden racking up strikeouts, and you have Mickey and Whitey for the 90's -- except that the Yankees released Strawberry last fall, and Gooden has hardly looked like the Doc of old. Not the stuff of which movies of the week are made.
Once you get past the not-so-revelatory revelations and the morality play sans happy ending, "High and Tight" does have its moments. The portrait Mr. Klapisch draws is of two men at odds with their reputations. Strawberry reveals a soft side -- he finds a hotel room for a street couple (only to have the man attack him) and puts unemployed siblings on his payroll (although he can hardly pay his own bills). Outside the clubhouse, Gooden displays a hard streak. When Mr. Klapisch shows up unannounced at Gooden's home in Tampa, Fla., the pitcher seems ready to sic his bodyguards on the reporter. "That street-tough side of Gooden, even the way his Mercedes was appointed, with oversized chrome rims, suggested aggression," Mr. Klapisch writes.
In fact, the book's two strongest moments concern threats of violence. Facing a possible prison sentence on a tax-evasion charge, Strawberry debates killing himself. "I never did anything to hurt anyone, except myself," he laments, only half-fibbing. After his arrest on charges of resisting arrest and battery of a police officer in 1987, Gooden gets in a car with some friends who have a .38-caliber pistol and a mission: to attack the first police officer who harasses them.
But by staying so close to the who, what, when and where of this story, Mr. Klapisch largely misses the why. He gives a nod to Freud, citing Strawberry's absent father and Gooden's demanding dad. But mostly Mr. Klapisch tells this as a story of two easily swayed individuals in a clubhouse that was out of control, and leaves it at that.
"In a sense, the two were easy prey," he writes. "These were two players who never had to rely on hard work to succeed and never grasped how fleeting physical skill can be." That's an explanation that will play on sports talk radio, but the reality is more complex. Why was the future Dr. K able to resist a cocaine dealer at the age of 17 in Tampa and not two years later as a Met? Why was the next Ted Williams able to negotiate the streets of South-Central Los Angeles, but not the Mets clubhouse?
In addition, Mr. Klapisch, who skewered Mets management in "The Worst Team Money Could Buy," his 1993 book written with John Harper, is strangely reluctant to take the team to task for its handling of its overhyped prodigies. If the '86 Mets really were the kind of speed-popping, coke-snorting, beer-guzzling thugs that Mr. Klapisch recalls almost sentimentally, then the general manager, Frank Cashen, should have done something, 108-victory season or not.
FINALLY, Mr. Klapisch glosses over one crucial fact. While you can argue that drugs and drinking ruined Strawberry's life, and Gooden's too, it is not accurate to say that their vices killed their careers. Gooden hasn't had a winning season since 1991 not because he snorted coke, but because of a torn rotator cuff that can be traced back to throwing too many innings when he was a teen-ager. Similarly, it was ruptured disks in Strawberry's back, not tax evasion, that put his career in jeopardy.
But while weakness of the will makes better copy than failure of the flesh, the reason we're still interested is that it's impossible to look at Gooden or Strawberry and not wonder about what might have been. Unfortunately, "High and Tight" raises a lot more questions than it answers.

Why the N.F.L. Chose to Keep Playing in Manhattan

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IT seemed but a typical staged event -- until one realized what was left unsaid.
Paul Tagliabue, the National Football League's commissioner, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, beamed as they announced the N.F.L.'s decision to keep its headquarters in New York City. The Mayor talked about New York as a "business, sports and tourist Mecca," Mr. Tagliabue thanked the Mayor for his "personal support" and the economic development office for its "professional guidance." All told, not stop-the-presses news -- and indeed, both the N.F.L. and the city have expressed disappointment at how little coverage that March 6 meeting received. 
 But, in fact, the meeting was unusual, not in what transpired but in what did not. There was no talk of tax breaks, no promises of new jobs, no mention of the fact that last fall the city did offer a tiny incentive, worth no more than $1 million over 15 years, and that the N.F.L. turned it down.
"It would have taken weeks to work it out, and we just wanted to get our real estate deal done," said John Buzzeo, the N.F.L.'s director of administration. Someone else familiar with the negotiations offered another reason, albeit only upon promise of anonymity: "The N.F.L. did not want to appear to be taking money from its fans and giving it to wealthy football team owners."
In a sense, the N.F.L.'s decision to remain in New York conflicts with what many consider to be two hard-and-fast real estate rules: One, that New York cannot hold onto any prestige tenant without sweetening the pot, and two, that companies move where their owners or chief executives live.
Mr. Tagliabue's roots are in Washington, and Neil Austrian, the league's president, lives in Connecticut. And the N.F.L. is an association of 30 football teams and their owners, any one of whom would have loved the league to come to his or her hometown -- and some of whom own office buildings.
The N.F.L., which has been at 410 Park Avenue, near 54th Street, since 1968, took everyone's preferences into account. Yet in the end, it is moving just one ZIP code away, to 280 Park Avenue, near 48th Street. And that decision can serve as a heartening tale to anyone worried that any organization looking to contain costs will quickly scurry away from New York.
"Sure, moving the N.F.L. out of New York would save money," said Carmen A. Policy, president of the San Francisco 49ers. "But there is a presence, an energy, a stature and dimension, that New York adds to the N.F.L. that cannot be duplicated anywhere else."
That was even more true 36 years ago, when Pete Rozelle first moved the league here from Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. E-mail and video conferences had not been invented, so the best way to promote football was to be in the home of the networks and major newspapers and magazines.
Football's popularity, and the league's growth, have certainly soared since then. In 1960 the N.F.L. comprised 13 teams; today it has 30. The league has 17 separate departments, handling such diverse operations as scheduling games and licensing products. And it has formed a World League with the Fox Network that already has signed up teams in Barcelona, Edinburgh, London, Amsterdam, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt.
The staff has burgeoned. In 1960, when the N.F.L. moved to a tiny office in Rockefeller Center, it had seven people. When it moved to part of one floor at 410 Park eight years later, it had 17. Today it has 360 employees, scattered across nearly 12 floors.
"We just grabbed whatever space came open, taking 5,000 square feet here, 8,000 square feet there," Mr. Buzzeo recalled. "Organizationally, it just wasn't any good."
So, about three years ago, with its lease a year from expiration, the N.F.L. started looking for a building where it could consolidate on five floors, tops. Almost immediately, the team owners started putting in their dibs.
"We heard, 'If you come to Dallas you could get space for $11 a foot,' or, 'If you come to Chicago you'll be central to the whole country,' " Mr. Buzzeo recalled.
The timing could not have been worse. The league was in the midst of contract talks with the players, it was negotiating new television contracts, and it was struggling to superimpose checks and balances on its hodgepodge of autonomous divisions.
"We just weren't prepared to do an indepth study of where we should be," Mr. Buzzeo said.
MEANWHILE, New York was exerting a visceral push-pull effect on everyone involved. Mr. Buzzeo remembers countless employees begging the league to stay put. Indeed, with 55 percent of its employees living in New York City -- and 42 percent of those right in Manhattan -- no one's heart was really in leaving New York.
Yet, with New York rents so much higher than anywhere else, no one was ready to commit the league to staying. The N.F.L. came close to taking space at 1325 Avenue of the Americas, on 54th Street, but backed out at the last minute. Instead, it took yet another half a floor at 410 Park, and extended its lease for two years.
A little over a year ago, the N.F.L. again started looking for a new home. But this time, it did it methodically.
It made cursory passes at cities that were plane rides away, but no one could find a truly compelling reason to leave the New York area. The league thought about expanding a studio building it already owned in Cherry Hill, N.J., but ruled that out as too inconvenient for everyone. It quickly ruled out Long Island and the rest of New Jersey, too, because they entailed horrendous commutes for many N.F.L. employees.
Westchester and Stamford, Conn., remained in the running. They were easy to get to, and they had a lot of good, reasonably priced space looking for tenants.
Still, everyone's emotional pendulum kept swinging back to New York.
"Costs simply did not drive the deals as much as the N.F.L.'s overall sense of where the people they interact with are, and where their employees want to be," said Franklin Speyer, a Cushman & Wakefield senior director who was the N.F.L.'s broker.
Nor did the individual team owners fight hard to get the N.F.L. onto their turfs -- particularly since Mr. Tagliabue had begun rotating the locations of many of the league's meetings, rather than forcing everyone to come to N.F.L. headquarters every time they had to talk.
"They had a great deal in an I.B.M. building a block from my summer house, yet I voted that they stay in Manhattan," said Preston Robert Tisch, an owner of the Giants.
"Even those of us that have to fly from the West Coast felt it was better to stay in New York," Mr. Policy said. "Pete Rozelle's original reasoning still applies."
Still, the New York rent costs stuck in the N.F.L.'s organizational craw, particularly since the N.F.L. had decided early on that its image called for an upscale building.
Thus, the idea of asking the city for incentives got born. "We knew we just had 360 jobs, but we also knew we were an important, high-profile tenant," Mr. Buzzeo said.
City officials say the N.F.L. never really pressed the point, though. "They weren't screaming that they have one foot out the door," said Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "If we had believed that the N.F.L. was serious about leaving, we probably would have put something on the table."
By the time the city made its offer, the N.F.L. was already close to signing a 16-year lease for 205,000 square feet -- 85,000 square feet more than it has now -- on four and a half contiguous floors at 280 Park. And, it was loath to stymie the dealmaking process while it haggled with the city and coped with the inevitable paperwork and legalese that accompanies city incentives.
"Sometimes, just getting something done is worth more than the money on the table," Mr. Millard said.
The incentives would never have made up for the costs the league is about to entail, anyway. Annual rents at 280 Park generally average in the low $40's per square foot, and the league is expected to pay somewhere around $125 million in rent over its 16 years. That's a lot more than Dallas, or even White Plains, would have cost.
"But moving would have been penny wise and pound foolish," Mr. Buzzeo said.
In preparation for its move, slated for next March, the N.F.L. checked whether its reporting hierarchy needed any fine tuning, and studied which departments should be adjacent to each other. It will put the treasury and accounting functions of the different divisions next to each other so that one accounts payable department can serve them all. It is installing video conferencing centers, so that neither Commissioner Tagliabue nor the owners need get on a plane every time a few of them want to meet. And it has rejiggered lines of authority between NFL Enterprises, which handles the league's pay-per-view, satellite transmissions and other modern-day methods to air football games, and NFL Properties, which handles product licensing.
"This operation is really pulling together," Mr. Tisch said. "We are getting set to run a big, big business."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Prospect Lefferts Gardens;
Racial Harmony and Rich Architecture

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
A STORY of racial harmony set against some of the finest residential architecture in Brooklyn resounds from the wide, parking-friendly streets of Prospect Lefferts Gardens.
Situated near the southeast corner of Prospect Park in the Flatbush section, the racially mixed, predominantly middle-class, richly West Indian neighborhood holds at its core a 600-home historic district, designated by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1979 and restricted by deed covenants to single-family-home owners. 
 People who live there say the historic district, where long-time residency has been common, promotes a stability welding the district and surrounding streets into a seamless whole that defeats the black-white racial divide common elsewhere.
They also say people get along. "There isn't that friction here," said Lenore Briggs, the owner and director of the Lefferts Gardens Montessori School on Rogers Avenue, where 50 children aged 2 1/2 to 6 attend classes.
The housing bargains, real estate agents declare, are remarkable. "There is a wonderful relationship between price and value," said Paul John Skrobela, associate broker at the William B. May Company. He said two- or three-story houses in the district generally ranged from $200,000 to $300,000.
"People who are looking in Park Slope can get just as nice a house here for a lot less," said Mary Kay Gallagher, an independent broker from Prospect Park South. "And I mean a lot less."
For all that, the area is surprisingly unheralded. "It's sort of a little secret," said Harriet A. Robinson, an associate broker at Century 21 Joseph T. King Realty in Park Slope.
In contrast to thematic, nearly all-Tudor Forest Hills Gardens in Queens, another architecturally notable area, houses in and around the Prospect Lefferts Gardens historic district range freely, if with restraint, through revival styles popular from the 1890's to the 1920's, when most were built.
Most are modest versions of style-setting, opulent homes built for the rich before and during this period on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
Brick, brownstone and Indiana limestone exteriors in Romanesque revival, Colonial Revival, neo-Georgian, neo-Tudor and neo-Federal style share single blocks. Uninterrupted stretches of the district's signature limestone rowhouses, with their rounded bays, give way on some streets to free-standing homes, some quite large. Everywhere, cartouches, foliate panels, classical moldings and other detailing enliven the eclectic mood.
The Grace Reformed Church on Lincoln Road and Bedford Avenue is typical of the high architectural standards and diversity of styles within, and to a degree beyond, the historic district. Built in 1893, the church is a small, neo-Italian Renaissance-style brick building with terra-cotta trim, stained-glass windows by Tiffany, a cruciform design and corner towers.
B UILT for the professional middle class in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when farms in the old town of Flatbush sprouted a final crop of houses, the area now called Prospect Lefferts Gardens grew apace with the coming of new rail links to Brooklyn and Manhattan.
The Brooklyn, Flatbush & Coney Island Railroad, originally designed for seasonal excursions, was by the turn of the century an electrified commuter line serving Flatbush.
The opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883 and proximity to Prospect Park, built in the 1860's to rival Central Park, had already set the stage for development.
In 1893, James Lefferts, a descendant of the Dutch family that settled here in 1660 when the area was part of the Dutch settlement of Midwout, divided his estate into 600 building lots. To assure only high quality, single-family homes would be built in the area, to be called Lefferts Manor, deeds carried restrictive covenants.
T HE covenants halted the march of two-family houses at the borders and barred commercial development, which explains the absence of stores. Prospect Lefferts Gardens shopping areas are along Nostrand Avenue and Flatbush Avenue.
The covenants also withstood legal challenge and resulted, a century later, in a housing stock in generally good repair that was unaltered by interior subdivisions even during the depths of the Great Depression.
Two-family houses are the norm outside the district, where prices are lower. Owners frequently live in one unit and rent the other. Rentals in two-family houses or in the area's liberal sprinkling of five- and six-story apartment houses range from $700 to $900 for two bedrooms.
Patio Gardens, a twin-tower, 460-apartment rent-stabilized building on Flatbush Avenue, was donated by the former owner, Donald J. Trump, three years ago to the National Kidney Foundation of New York and New Jersey. Two-bedroom apartments rent from $750 to about $900 a month.
The community draws its name from Prospect Park, the Lefferts family and the nearby Brooklyn Botanic Garden.
Mr. Skrobela, who has lived in the Lefferts Manor section of the historic district for 13 years, described the community as economically and ethnically diverse, and -- as from its beginnings -- mostly middle class. "You may have a Transit Authority worker living on the same block as the head of a college math department," he said.
"It's a very integrated community racially and attracts people for whom that's important," said Barbara L. Solomon, who moved into the historic district from the Upper West Side 15 years ago with her husband, Eliot, the current president of the Lefferts Manor Association.
"Some people say they don't understand this place where black lawyers, doctors and real estate agents live next to white ones," she said. "It seems to be terribly unique, and I'm not quite sure why."
Blacks moved in in large numbers during the late 50's and 60's, sometimes encountering hate fences -- high corrugated plastic barriers erected by whites in that era. But the white flight that occurred in other areas did not happen there, and eventually the hate fences fell. Today, Asian and Hispanic residents add to the mix.
The neighborhood was heaven for Brooklyn Dodger fans when the din from nearby Ebbets Field filled the air.
There was pandemonium in 1955 when the Dodgers won their first World Series at Yankee Stadium. "We all ran out of our houses screaming," said Ms. Gallagher, the realtor, who used to live on Maple Street.
In some ways, life here is no more perfect than in many other inner-city areas. People know distant popping sounds in the night may not be firecrackers. And at the Honey Bee Farm fruit and fish store on Flatbush Avenue, a burly fruit-watcher employed by the Asian owners draws the line at chasing young crackheads. "An orange is not worth a knife in the heart," he said.
But for the untimid, there is much consolation: Eye-pleasing architecture, ample curbside parking, proximity to Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Brooklyn Museum, good subway links to Manhattan and a self-contained neighborhood where people know each other.
"You have friends who are friends with your other friends," said Jennifer Plassman, a volunteer at the 28-student Maple Street School preschool for children 2 to 5, a parent cooperative on Nostrand Avenue.
P ROSPECT LEFFERTS GARDENS is in School District 17, an academically troubled district whose schools have generally ranked low in reading and math scores. The district was taken over by the central Board of Education in 1994.
At P.S. 92 on Parkside Avenue, where the principal, Robert Evans, responded with "no comment" to a request for information, 1,233 children attend prekindergarten through 8th grade. Scores in math and reading are below city-wide averages, but the district's Superintendent, Barbara Bryd-Bennett, said they had been improving for the last five years.
Three city high schools -- Prospect Heights, Erasmus Hall and George Wood Wingate -- are near Prospect Lefferts Gardens. All are below city averages in mathematics and verbal scores on the Scholastic Assessment Test.
Some residents send their children to nearby private schools. The Berkeley-Carroll School in Park Slope, with 693 students in pre-kindergarten through grade 12, offers academic rigor and a summer day camp for children aged 3 to 8. It was designated a blue-ribbon school by the Federal Department of Education, the only private or public school in Brooklyn to win the accolade for general excellence.
Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights, also from pre-kindergarten through grade 12, prepares its 830 students for top-rank colleges, as do Berkeley-Carroll and another institution, St. Ann's School, both competitive-admission schools for gifted children.

This year will be no exception the 26th annual tour, a self-guided event with an itinerary of at least 10 homes, is set for Sunday, June 2, from noon to 5 P.M. Guides will be on hand at each address. Tickets cost $15 at curbside or $10 in advance from the Lefferts Manor Association at 135 Midwood Street, Brooklyn, 11225. Further information is available by calling the association at (718) 284-6210. "We want people to know about our neighborhood," said Robert A. Marvin, a tour organizer. "It's still relatively unknown." Mr. Marvin said he and his wife, Elaine, had purchased their limestone-and-brick rowhouse with its Renaissance revival exterior with Romanesque touches after taking the tour in 1974. "I'm sure if we hadn't gone on that tour we wouldn't be living here now," Mr. Marvin said. He added that they were only the third owners since the house was built in 1899.

HEADLINE: In Hartford, the River Is Beckoning Once Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
ALONG Interstate 91 in Hartford, concrete columns are rising out of the mud, forming the pillars that will support a 1.25-acre landscaped plaza that will allow people to walk from downtown, over the highway, to the edge of the Connecticut River.
Off East River Drive, on the other bank, bulldozers and backhoes are smoothing over gray silt and red clay, putting the finishing touches on the land around a new 350-seat amphitheater that looks out over the water and is scheduled to open June 19. 
 Those are the most visible signs yet of years of effort by Riverfront Recapture, the organization dedicated to improving public access to the Connecticut River in Hartford and East Hartford. The group has raised or lobbied for more than $220 million of clean water projects and recreational amenities, although until now most of the major work has only been on the drawing board.
Joseph R. Marfuggi, executive director of Riverfront Recapture, said professional planners agree that any waterfront revitalization takes a 20-year commitment; his group celebrates its 15th anniversary this week.
"We're really ready now," Mr. Marfuggi said. "We're poised to take advantage of all the work that's been done and use it as the centerpiece of a major economic development project."
The group offers programs that teach city children how to fish and build boats. It sponsors riverbank concerts, jogging and biking outings, and two triathalons. It offers a program modeled after Outward Bound where young people are challenged physically and emotionally on obstacle courses.
"It's such a new world for them, so many of them are not even aware there's a river on the other side of the highway," said Craig Mergins, programs and operations manager for Riverfront Recapture. "Some of these programs are keeping them out of trouble, and the thing is, a lot of them probably don't even realize that."
The organization's efforts have also brought it national attention. Last year it brought the first major bass fishing tournament in New England to the river. This year it will bring in a water skiing competition, next year a National Rowing Association convention, and the year after that a meeting of the American Fisheries Society.
"For a long time, there was a lot of skepticism and pessimism," Mr. Marfuggi said. "We would take our models to fishing and boat shows, and people would say, 'It'll never happen in Hartford.' But as more of it becomes available and people are seeing things like the Bassmaster Tournament come in, we're getting a lot more believers."
Henry G. Thorpe, vice president and general manager of Deep River Navigation Inc., which operates the steam-powered riverboat Lady Fenwick for day and dinner cruises in the summer, said interest in the river is clearly picking up. "When we started in 1986, Riverfront Recapture was just getting underway, and we lost money -- but we knew we were going to lose money," Mr. Thorpe said. "We ran a trip every hour, and a ticket was $3, but it was just to get large amounts of people down there."
Last summer, for the first time, the Lady Fenwick offered dinner cruises with jazz bands on Friday nights, he said.
"It sold out every single Friday night, 75 people on board every trip," Mr. Thorpe said. "For years, we were happy to have 10." This year, the dinner cruises will be offered Thursday nights as well.
He said people are surprised to find the river water is clean, and just a few miles from Hartford its banks are lined with trees, and animals are often seen coming down for a drink. "You wouldn't know you're within 100 miles of a city," Mr. Thorpe said.
Now Riverfront Recapture has teamed up with the Capitol Region Partnership to develop an organization that will manage, maintain and improve on the foundation it has laid.
"It doesn't take long for something like this to deteriorate if you're not protecting it," Mr. Marfuggi said. "But if you do protect it, you can leverage it many times, and the benefits are going to spill out across the whole region."
A committee of business and political leaders has been meeting since late last year to develop a strategy for raising an operating budget estimated to range from $3.5 million to $5 million a year starting in 1997, and to support improvements like a campground in East Hartford, a freshwater aquarium, a fishing hall of fame and a Hartford exposition center.
"Now that this thing is on the cusp of becoming reality, we need to ask ourselves -- what is the best organizational structure for the future?" asked R. Nelson Griebel, president of the Bank of Boston Connecticut, and chairman of the committee.
"If we can lay out a plan that is clear and makes sense, we'll get the funding for it," said Mr. Griebel. "This whole program makes sense to me, as a businessman, because it's going to give the whole region a healthier economy."
An oil painting of Hartford from 150 years ago shows tall ships and steamboats lining the 26 wharfs along the riverfront, a time when the river was "the front door of the city," the center of commerce.
But river traffic declined, and the 1936 and '38 hurricanes flooded the downtown so badly a 38-foot concrete dike was build to control the flooding. Then Interstate 91 was built between the dike and the downtown, all but eliminating access.
"The rivers were polluted, dirty and smelly, so people didn't use them for recreation," Mr. Marfuggi said. "Commercial uses had died for the most part when railroads replaced river shipping. And so when people looked for a place to put a highway or anything else no one wanted in their backyard, they put it near a river. No one cared."
Until April 9, 1981, when Riverfront Recapture was formed to be an advocate for reopening access to the Connecticut.
"People are rediscovering rivers and waterfronts all over the country," Mr. Marfuggi said -- in Baltimore and Boston and Portsmouth. In Cleveland -- the butt of many bad jokes after the Cuyahoga River caught fire in the 1970's -- a cleanup has prompted a riverside redevelopment known as The Flats that attracts 7.5 million visitors a year.
And Hartford will be next, supporters contend.
"The whole package is coming together -- the clean water, the clean parks and the new amenities, all at the same time," Mr. Marfuggi said. "It's only as limited as your imagination, and we're telling people, 'Think big.' "
One of the group's first projects was to reclaim the 62-acre, 100-year-old Riverside Park, designed by the sons of Frederick Law Olmsted, but then cut off from the rest of the city and left to deteriorate.
The group lobbied the Federal and state highway departments and economic development agencies for $33.6 million for projects like Charter Oak landing, the Interstate 91 platform, and the East Hartford amphitheater. At the same time, the Metropolitan District Commission has poured $83 million into river cleanup, and plans $90 million more.
Riverfront Recapture has a campaign underway to raise another $14.3 million for construction of riverside walkways north to Windsor and south to Wethersfield.
And fund raising is just one of the challenges, Mr. Marfuggi said. Being in a flood plain, "We have to design everything to spend part of the year underwater," he said. The boathouse, for instance, has louvers in the side that can be opened. The amphitheater is on concrete, so it will not be washed away. Everything is built with rot-resistant pressure-treated lumber.
And, working in a flood plain means dealing with a host of Federal and state environmental agencies.
"You can't imagine the permits we require just to plant a tree," Mr. Marfuggi said. "You have to show what the impact is going to be downstream, and how it's going to add to the cumulative impact of the project."
He said another problem has been convincing people that the Connecticut River could be a major asset to Hartford. Because people have been cut off from the river for so long, many do not realize how much conditions have improved since the 1960's, when it was often characterized as an open sewer.
"When we said we were working to bring the bass tournament in, the first question everyone asked was, where are you going to get the fish?" Mr. Marfuggi said. "But we didn't have to stock a single fish."
In fact, anglers say, there are strong populations of large- and small-mouth bass, muskellunge, catfish, carp and other species filling the river.
And the professional angers' spouses and children -- who were used to being stuck out in the boondocks -- found themselves instead in an urban setting where they could go shopping, to theaters and restaurants.
Despite the impediments to reopening the waterfront, ideas often build on one another. When plans were announced to build a Science Center on the east bank of the river, the group suggested it also build a floating dock for water taxies. That got the group thinking: Why not a permanent research vessel that could take the next generation of scientists out onto the water for exploration?
"It is a very ambitious project," Mr. Marfuggi said. "But we're doing it incrementally. Each year there's a little more of the river for people to see and use, and we're developing a variety of programs, from passive to very active recreation."
Mr. Marfuggi contends the improvements will spark a cycle: people will visit or move to the city for concerts and water sports and recreation, which will bring in businesses that want to serve those people, which will bring even more people.
A triathalon last summer, in which contestants swam almost a mile of the river, brought in 1,100 competitors from 31 states and six countries. None of them came alone, Mr. Marfuggi said -- they all brought spouses and children and friends.
"The hotels were jammed, the restaurants were jammed," he said. "These are the kind of events that can really revitalize the economy. And they bring in national television coverage, and that kind of exposure brings the city even more business."
Thomas W. Miner, executive director of the Connecticut River Watershed Council, said it's impressive that Riverfront Recapture has tried to build as wide a constituency as possible for getting and keeping the river clean.
"There's been a very purposeful effort to bring the whole community to the river," Mr. Miner said. "The boating and music and other programs show a real appreciation of Hartford's need, as well as the economic development opportunity the river presents."
He says his concern is that the committee exploring how to keep the effort going counts no representatives of environmental groups among its members.
But given the record of Riverfront Recapture, he said, his organization is not worried that environmentalists will be ignored. "We continue to use Riverfront Recapture as an example to other communities up the river, particularly Springfield, of what can be done when a community really sets its mind to it."

HEADLINE: Facing Cutbacks, Professors Seek Raise

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
WHILE the future of state-supported higher education waits under the ax in New York, Purchase College faculty members here are grappling with a more immediate issue.
The 114 full-time teachers and 184 part-time teachers, who are among the lowest paid in the state university's 12 four-year colleges, say it is next to impossible to raise a family and live on their salaries in or near Westchester County. Despite what they acknowledge to be bad timing because of budget cutbacks, the teachers are asking for raises across the board to redress what they call a 25-year-old problem. 
 "There has been historical inertia at Purchase," said Leonard Stokes, a professor in the visual arts division and the presiding officer of the faculty. "Salaries started low and never changed. Many of us feel trapped in this situation, myself included."
Many regard the Purchase faculty as one of the college's best kept secrets, calling teachers in both the College of Letters and Science and the School of the Arts a highly accomplished and dedicated group. The teachers, too, say they thrive on the school's diverse and enthusiastic student body and the freedom to follow their own principles in teaching.
But according to a recent report, prepared by Mr. Stokes, called "The Brick Ceiling," the average faculty salaries at Purchase in the 1994-95 year were tied for seventh place among the 12 four-year colleges, while salaries for full professors were tied for ninth place. The rankings showed some improvement over a similar study done in 1990 when Purchase salaries were at the bottom of the list.
Purchase salaries, which range from an average of $36,400 for assistant professors to an average of $55,900 for full professors, are especially low in light of the high cost of living in and around Westchester, Mr. Stokes said. The report shows that the faculty's average salary of $45,100 in 1994 lagged behind the average Westchester County family income of $58,900 in 1989. By contrast, the average faculty salary at SUNY Plattsburgh was $14,000 higher than family incomes in that college's surrounding county, Clinton.
The discrepancies are even worse, said Dr. Peter F. Bell, an associate professor of economics, when real wages are adjusted for inflation. "All the employees who were at SUNY Purchase during the 1970's, because of low or stagnant wage increases and very high rates of inflation, suffered conservatively a 50 percent drop of real income or purchasing power," said Dr. Bell, who joined the faculty in 1972.
Mr. Stokes, who has been at Purchase since 1973 and has been a full professor since 1993, recently received a raise and now makes $50,000 a year. Like many of his colleagues, Mr. Stokes, who lives with his wife and two high-school-age sons in Pleasantville, rarely travels on vacations with his family. The family hardly ever eats out together, he said, and restaurant meals just for him and his wife are rare events. Mr. Stokes said his wife, a former teacher, decided to stay home and raise their children.
"I can speak for the entire faculty," he said. "I am trying to refocus interest in this issue."
Librarians at Purchase are also underpaid compared with their colleagues elsewhere. According to a survey conducted by the librarians themselves, they are paid the least of librarians at five comparable two-year and four-year schools in and around Westchester. While the average salary for Purchase librarians -- excluding the library director -- last year was $34,700, their peers at Westchester Community College, for example, were paid an average of $58,100.
Westchester Community College, one of 30 community colleges in the university system, also pays its faculty members an average of $14,000 more than Purchase teachers receive. The faculty at Westchester Community College has its own union, which negotiates with the county.
Fenghua Wang-Schaefer, one of the newest librarians at Purchase, said she loves Westchester and the college but has had to move three times in the last seven months to find living quarters she can afford. Ms. Wang-Schaefer, whose husband is in China, now makes a half-hour drive to Purchase from Purdys. "Compared to my colleagues, that's close," she said.
Both the Purchase faculty and the librarians hold an impressive number of credentials. Nearly all the professors in the College of Letters and Science have doctoral degrees and among them have published 51 books in the last 10 years, said Dr. Alfred Hunt, dean of Letters and Science. Four of the five librarians hold two master's degrees, while many teachers in the School of the Arts are prominent in their fields. The 19 full-time and part-time faculty members in the division of visual arts, for example, have among them garnered 8 Guggenheim Fellowships, 10 National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships, 3 Fulbright Fellowships and a long list of other awards.
Carry Kyzivat, the local president of United University Professions, the statewide union representing all faculty members and professional employees in the system, said that the union sets minimum salary requirements. Beyond that, she said, it was up to the discretion of the campus administration to set salary levels. Ms. Kyzivat, who works as library acquisitions coordinator at Purchase, said it was an awkward time to lobby for higher salaries because of the "strong possibility that positions will be cut and faculties and employees will be retrenched."
Currently, the union is negotiating with the state university system's central administration to obtain a new contract for all faculty members and other professionals. They have been without a contract since last June.
Bill Lacy, president of Purchase College, said it was important to rectify the salary issue. "It may seem to people an inopportune moment, given the dark cloud hanging over SUNY right now and budget cuts always on the horizon," he said. "But this problem has plagued this particular college since its beginning, and I intend to address that."
He said he would work with Richard Staneski, the college's vice president for finance, and Dr. Gary Waller, the new vice president for academic affairs, not only to allot more money for salaries but also to balance discrepancies on the campus. Compounding campus resentment is the fact that teachers in the College of Letters and Science are paid on average $1,180 more than their peers in the School of the Arts. Women are also paid less than men of comparable rank; in the most glaring discrepancy, female full professors of the arts are paid nearly $7,000 less than male full professors of letters and science.
Dr. Waller said Purchase had "never had a collegewide plan for adequate salaries," and that "previous administrations really didn't pay attention to this as a collegewide problem."
He added, "My initial reaction when I got here six months ago was how incredibly low the salaries were in comparison with comparable places."
Mr. Staneski said improvements could be made "without regard to the bleak budget environment" by strategies like salvaging money from faculty vacancies and starting a salary pool.
Dr. Bell described morale among the faculty as "awful, terrible" and said many teachers had taken second jobs to make ends meet. He said the faculty's workload had increased as its purchasing power had dropped; in addition to their course work, Purchase teachers set educational policy by serving on college committees, conduct searches for new faculty members and administer their own programs with a dwindling support staff.
Despite feeling underappreciated, faculty members said their strong hand in college matters helped to offset their complaints. "The faculty do have control over the curriculum and can generate programs they have respect for," Dr. Bell said.

HEADLINE: VOICES: VIEWPOINT;
In City Services, Privatize and Beware

BYLINE: By MOSHE ADLER; Moshe Adler is a professor of economics at the Rutgers University Graduate School of Management.

 BODY:
IT is no surprise that a $43 million contract let by the City of New York to a private organization to enforce the city's welfare rules -- signed last summer and canceled last month -- ran into trouble amid suspicions of cozy dealing. This has been the pattern of privatization efforts stretching back through the 19th century. Privatization has, in fact, been the norm, not the exception, through much of that time in this country -- and equally common has been the need for the government to take over these services after failure by private providers.
The current advocates of privatization contend that these early failures actually teach us a way to make "outsourcing" work. What is new in the current efforts, according to Professor E. S. Savas of Baruch College, a consultant to governments here and internationally, "is introducing competition into the delivery of public services." The fastest privatizer in the country, Mayor Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis, has argued that the past failure of privatization was due to monopolization. 
 There is only one problem with these ideas: measures to make outsourcing competitive already litter the history of private-sector provision of public services and all have failed. If there is a lesson, it is that the incentives for a public servant who hires a contractor are inherently different from the incentives for a private entrepreneur who hires a contractor. The entrepreneur is interested in performance and nothing else. The public servant may trade performance for a personal gain. In the end, governments have proved to be the most efficient when their services are produced by public employees rather than private contractors.
One of the most compelling examples of the failure of such privatization is street cleaning in 19th century New York. With the cost of equipment low, the number of potential competitors large and the contractors' work visible to all, what could be simpler than choosing a contractor through competitive bidding and dismissing him if he failed to perform? But when Mayor Philip Hone wanted to replace a street-cleaning contractor and stop payments in 1826, the City Council, after "mature reflection," resolved that, notwithstanding the company's failure to do its job, "it was best to compromise the matter."
The same occurred in 1842 when, in response to Mayor Robert Morris's attempt to penalize another street-cleaning contractor, the City Council removed the penalties from the law. And in the 1860's, a contractor was allowed to continue his contract for an additional two and a half years even though he had failed to clean the streets on half of the days for which he had contracted, used city piers to store garbage and dumped huge quantities of manure in city parks.
The problem, of course, was that councilmen relied on contractors for political contributions and, occasionally, for bribes. It is hardly surprising that they were reluctant to conclude that privatization could not work. Instead, they offered panaceas -- always some competitive measure or another -- to mollify their critics.
IN the 19th century, such measures included requirements that contractors post bonds and that their contracts have a maximum of three years. In 1825, the city was divided into several cleaning districts to encourage competition, and the lines were redrawn in 1842. (Panaceas are often rediscovered.)
Yet the streets continued to be filthy. In 1860, the City Inspector concluded that the contract system "has in every instance proved a failure." But private contractors would continue to perform public services for 20 or more years.
Privatization did not fail only in New York. The head of the Chicago Board of Health declared in 1892 that "there are few if any redeeming qualities" attached to the "vicious" contract system.
In the same year, Mayor Hazen Pingree of Detroit researched the process and concluded that "most of our troubles can be traced to the temptations which are offered to city officials when franchises are sought by wealthy corporations, or contracts are to be let for public works."
At the end of the 19th century, the situation in New York City had so deteriorated that business leaders entered politics to "clean house." Over a three-month period in 1874, Mayor William F. Havemeyer, of the sugar-refining business, vetoed 250 bills, including bills for street improvements, Board of Education contracts and appropriations intended for public charities. But the consensus of the Mayor's contemporaries was that his vetoes crippled the city. The reform movement turned to public ownership of public services.
Across the country, franchisees and contractors fought reform efforts tooth and nail. They fought in the courts. They appealed to the public's sense of patriotism. St. Louis newspapers even argued in 1900 that the public exposure of corruption in private contracts would create a bad name for the city and would be bad for business. Another tactic was diversion: Mayors who were in favor of public ownership were portrayed as soft on crime.
But journalistic and academic studies showed that prices in cities that owned their utilities were universally lower and that the quality of these services was universally higher than in cities served by franchises. Although public ownership involved patronage, this was not sufficient to offset its benefits. City after city adopted public systems to provide public services.
In New York City, citizens' groups lobbied successfully for a separate street-cleaning department with its own staff, headed by a commissioner appointed by the Mayor. The operation, established in 1881, continues to this day.
In 1996, few people would argue that public services cannot be improved. But we may find again that today's solutions may create tomorrow's crises. As more governments weigh privatizing their jails, as New York City looks to contract out parking-meter management (again!), as municipalities everywhere grasp for ways to privatize to cut their budgets -- the experience of the past is worth considering.

HEADLINE: Preserving the Legacy Of Modernist Design

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
HOLLY GOLIGHTLY looked wistfully on the face of Manhattan as she prepared to depart for Rio. "Years from now, years and years, I'll be back," she declared. "Me and my nine Brazilian brats. I'll bring them back, all right. Because they must see this."
"This" in the 1961 movie "Breakfast at Tiffany's" was not Central Park or the Brooklyn Bridge or Rockfeller Center. It was the steel-and-glass corporate canyon of postwar Park Avenue. 
 Those International Style skyscrapers -- Lever House, the Seagram Building, the Union Carbide Building -- epitomized New York at the peak of its economic might and worldwide prowess. In their cool sophistication, they were an ideal complement to Audrey Hepburn, who played Holly, and a fitting backdrop for her valedictory stroll.
Not everyone felt kindly toward this crop of architecture, to be sure. The building boom of the 50's and 60's had replaced so much of the city's historic fabric that it spurred a popular preservation movement, culminating in the landmarks law of 1965. But even those who said "glass box" with a sneer would have thought the Park Avenue towers would always be part of the skyline.
How surprising, then, that their day of reckoning may already be at hand, along with branch banks and airline terminals and cultural institutions of the same vintage. And how paradoxical that many are now old enough -- 30 years or more -- to qualify for landmark status.
That raises critical issues with which owners, architects and urban historians are only beginning to wrestle. Which postwar buildings merit preservation? Can they be economically and usefully maintained in anything resembling their original forms? Or are they destined for rehabilitations that leave them substantially altered or totally unrecognizable?
The list of buildings in question starts with an official landmark: Lever House, 390 Park Avenue, between 53d and 54th Streets. This tower, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, may need an entirely new exterior after 44 years.
At 43d Street, significant interior alterations are being made to the former Fifth Avenue branch of the Manufacturers Trust Company, also designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Dubbed the "Glass House" when it opened in 1954, it is under consideration for landmark status.
And a tremendous amount of reconstruction is required at Eero Saarinen's 34-year-old Trans World Airline Terminal A at John F. Kennedy International Airport, another landmark, which cannot efficiently serve jumbo jetliners.
At worst, such buildings are hopelessly out of date. At best, they are challenging and expensive to maintain. (The owners of the Seagram Building pay roughly double the operating costs to conserve its deceptively simple luster.) Constructed with systems that are growing obsolete, to serve a corporate culture that no longer exists, they tend to be extravagant in their consumption of energy and their use of space, something few owners can tolerate.
W HILE some were recognized as classics on the day they opened, most have long since slipped out of fashion. Because they are so spare and clean in design, their esthetic qualities can be radically transformed by the simplest change in materials -- tinted glass, for instance, instead of clear.
Few are candidates for demolition, possibly excepting smaller structures like Two Columbus Circle, the former Gallery of Modern Art, which was commissioned by Huntington Hartford and designed by Edward Durell Stone.
Instead, owners are more likely to recreate the buildings. For instance, the former ITT Corporation World Headquarters at 320 Park Avenue, between 50th and 51st Streets, has been transformed over the last two years from a plain-vanilla corporate glass box designed by Emery Roth & Sons into a pyramid-peaked post-modern ziggurat by Swanke Hayden Connell Architects. It is now the headquarters of the Mutual of America Life Insurance Company.
No one much mourned the disappearance of the Emery Roth design as a single work. But Robert A. M. Stern, the architect and architectural historian, is quite troubled by the compromise to Park Avenue as an urban ensemble.
"Individually, they're not great buildings," he said, "but collectively, they're incomparable. We all lambasted the loss of the Beaux-Arts Park Avenue. But there is no collection of metal-and-glass corporate modernism like it anywhere else in the world. And now we're going to tear it all apart again."
Eight years ago, at a preservation symposium in the New York Public Library, Mr. Stern argued that landmark status ought to be given to buildings like "Black Rock," the CBS Building at 51 West 52d Street; the stainless-steel-clad former Socony-Mobil Building, 150 East 42d Street and the Ford Foundation, 321 East 42d Street.
Almost as devil's advocate, he went so far as to say that the Pan Am Building, 200 Park Avenue, might merit landmark consideration as "a telling lesson of how not to build a city."
"The monuments of postwar modernism have now been subjected to the passage of time and have achieved a place within the very continuum of history they so determinedly sought to destroy," Mr. Stern said in 1988.
Since then, he has become a de facto leader in the modernist preservation movement. He has written its manifesto and 1,374-page guide book, "New York 1960: Architecture and Urbanism Between the Second World War and the Bicentennial" (Monacelli Press, 1995), with Thomas Mellins and David Fishman.
A ND his sense of urgency is growing, Mr. Stern said in an interview last month. "These buildings were conceived to last the life of a mortgage or a refinancing," he said. "They were designed to fall apart. And they are falling apart -- just as they are becoming eligible for landmark designation."
They need not be torn down to be lost. "The detailing is very precise," Mr. Stern said, "and they were built with single-pane glazing in a period when energy costs were not a major consideration. When you thicken mullions -- or, worse yet, tint the windows -- you change the impression of the building."
Mr. Stern conceded the incongruity of his championing postwar design, since his own work draws so heavily on more classical styles. "We've got to struggle to get above taste," he said. "It's just about when a building is 30 years old that a new generation comes along to discover it. Landmarking is not to select what's pretty, it's to select what's significant."
Jennifer Raab, the chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said she discerned "a growing interest in postwar, modern architecture." She noted that the commission last year designated the former Pepsi-Cola Building, 500 Park Avenue, at 59th Street. It was designed by Gordon Bunshaft and Natalie de Blois of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and completed in 1960.
T HE Municipal Art Society has formed a "postwar-architecture working group," said Ned Kaufman, the associate director of issues, and will hold meetings this spring with a new group known by the unwieldy acronym of Docomomo -- Documentation and Conservation of the Monuments of the Modern Movement.
Mr. Kaufman allowed that this was something of a sea change for the society's members, who long battled the very forces behind the buildings they are interested in saving.
"Preservation being what it is," he said, "we now have to look at some of the work of that period as a legacy."
That is only where the challenges begin.
"We're going to have to deal with functional obsolescence," said Theodore H. M. Prudon, an associate professor of historic preservation at Columbia University, partner in Swanke Hayden Connell and member of Docomomo.
That means finding new tenants for corporate headquarters that have been emptied, new uses for branch banks that have been superseded by automated teller machines and new layouts for airline terminals that have been pushed well beyond their capacity.
It also means re-examining attitudes about conserving structural details. "In traditional preservation there is an inherent significance in the original materials, both as artifacts and often as pieces of craftsmanship," Mr. Prudon said. "I have a hard time bringing up the same respect for a precast concrete panel."
Ultimately, glass is the premier material of this era. And that raises another complication: What goes on within a building can have an enormous effect on the look of its facade.
"The problem with the preservation of modern architecture is that there's no difference between the inside and the outside," Mr. Prudon said.
David M. Childs, a partner in Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, noted that structural problems could arise in early curtain walls, built of many separate elements rather than in modular units.
"Stainless steel is great but the glue that held things together is wearing out," he said. "There are tremendous heat and freezing cycles on the sides of the buildings. The trouble is, once water gets in, it expands and corrodes."
Although he was not referring specifically to Lever House, that landmark is known to have problems. Designed by Bunshaft and completed in 1952, the 21-story building is essentially two perpendicular slabs, clad in stainless steel and blue-green glass panels, with horizontal window ribbons.
Last year, Unilever, the household-products company that still occupies the building, proposed a new curtain wall, saying the original had been "untested and experimental." The company said 40 to 50 percent of the glass had already been replaced and that there was extensive corrosion in the underlying structural steel due to leaks from bad joints and deteriorating drains.
The plan called for building the new wall around the existing skin and then demolishing the old curtain wall from within. That proposal raised more than a few eyebrows and Unilever withdrew its application to the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
Today, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill is working on the project, although Mr. Childs said the firm had not yet made any recommendations. And a lawyer for Unilever, Gordon J. Davis, said the company would have no comment -- not about future plans, the withdrawn application or even existing conditions.
B UT two notable neighbors of Lever House give a glimpse at how complicated it can be to maintain a building whose allure rests on its simplicity.
"Vigilance, diligence and consistency are the keys," said Philip R. DiGennaro, managing director of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, owners of the Seagram Building, 375 Park Avenue, between 52d and 53d Streets, which was completed in 1958 to designs by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson.
To insure a uniform exterior appearance, tenants are given no choice in ceiling treatments at the building's perimeter. The first 15 feet from the window must consist of a row of solid panels, beyond which comes a row of luminous panels, all on a uniform grid. (The Alleghany Corporation, which moved in earlier this year, had to give up the idea of hanging brass chandeliers.) The only window coverings allowed are Venetian blinds, whose blades are fixed at a 45-degree angle. The mechanisms permit three positions: completely closed, half-drawn or fully open.
The bronze-sheathed exterior is oiled by hand once a year, with a lemon-based oil, by workers on window-washing scaffolds. The process takes two and a half months, said Mike Angeliadis, the property manager.
The terrazzo floors in the elevator lobbies are polished every month by cloth and every few years by stone. The travertine walls in public areas are cleaned five times a year and get a poultice treatment annually. Marble benches on the plaza are washed weekly and honed, polished and covered in sealant as needed. Faucets, spigots and door handles are custom made.
All told, such extraordinary measures roughly double the operating cost, to about $15 a square foot, Mr. DiGennaro said. But the rents are also higher than in other Park Avenue buildings, around $50 a square foot, said Douglas P. Lawrence, senior real estate manager for the association, and the building is 84 percent occupied.
Five blocks south, at 270 Park Avenue, is the world headquarters of the Chase Manhattan Corporation. This 52-story tower, with its black and silver curtain wall, was completed in 1960 as headquarters of the Union Carbide Corporation, to designs by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.
The building underwent a $75 million renovation in 1983 to become headquarters of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. After a 1991 merger, it served as headquarters of Chemical Bank, which it remained until Monday, when the Chase-Chemical merger took effect.
When it was built, the corporate world operated on a 9-to-5 schedule. Buildingwide systems would be turned on and shut off accordingly. "Today, we're into 24-hour buildings," said William F. Treanor, a bank vice president. "You have to go out for new ways of bringing in heating and cooling so the staff can function at 10 o'clock at night."
Union Carbide set aside only 5,000 of the building's 1.5 million square feet for a data-processing center. At the time of remodeling, the assumption was that one employee in four would have an automated work station. Today, there is a computer at almost every desk. "The electrical consumption is a continuing challenge," Mr. Treanor said.
All told, however, Mr. Treanor said much of the original infrastructure "has carried that building through today," a tribute in part to the fact that an owner-occupant lavished more money on its headquarters than a developer would have sunk into a speculative tower.
"Many aspects of the International Style are still looked for by tenants: large amounts of glass, flexible systems," Mr. Childs said. "They might want more span to the core and more room for mechanical systems, but the buildings are reasonably up to date."
THE former Union Carbide tower is one of three modernist milestones in the real estate portfolio of the new Chase bank. The others are One Chase Manhattan Plaza in lower Manhattan and the "Glass House," which is best known for the audacious touch of displaying a Mosler safe door, designed by Henry Dreyfuss, in plain view behind plate glass on Fifth Avenue. Above the safe, the second floor seemed to float in space, since it was set back from the exterior curtain wall.
A major alteration of the interior is nearing completion. Along 43d Street, more than 3,500 square feet of retail space has been created. "We're looking to maximize our revenue stream," said Barbara A. Voda, a bank vice president. On Fifth Avenue, an A.T.M. center has been built, with a partition separating it from the safe. A ceiling has been extended from the slab of the second floor to the exterior wall, closing up the space beneath. And the openness of the main floor has been diminished somewhat by new office partitions.
Since the building is under consideration for landmark status, Ms. Voda said the bank consulted closely with the staff of the landmarks commission. And Ms. Raab concurred, saying the bank had been "extremely cooperative in working with us to maintain the architectural integrity of the building."
Alterations are on the horizon at the arching, gull-winged T.W.A. terminal at Kennedy International Airport. "The first phase is mostly cosmetic and comfort level," said Marvin B. Mitzner of Davidoff & Malito, a lawyer for the airline. But major reconstruction will follow.
Because jumbo jets are too big to fit at adjoining gates, planes have to park on the field, forcing passengers to use buses, Mr. Mitzner said. "There's no question that it's an obsolete terminal," he said. "The objective is to find a happy medium between destroying architectural features and allowing the terminal to become useless."
I T is unclear what use can be made of Two Columbus Circle, a white marble box with perforated edges, a loggia at top and an arcade at the bottom. Last October, Forrest R. Taylor, the chief of staff for Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson, said the city was preparing a request for proposals to develop the site, which it owns.
Preservationists like Mr. Stern worry that the 10-story building will be torn down. But Mr. Taylor will not discuss the redevelopment project now. He will not even say whether the request for proposals had been completed.
There is one minor modernist monument that is virtually assured of demolition. Unknown to and unseen by most New Yorkers -- even though thousands pass underneath it every day -- is a two-story penthouse suite that I. M. Pei and William Lescaze designed for the real estate giant William Zeckendorf in 1952.
Largely concealed by parapets, the penthouse crowns the long-vacant Knapp Building, 383 Madison Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets. This block-square property, a prime candidate for redevelopment, has been at the center of a fierce struggle for control among Bear, Stearns & Company, the al-Babtain family of Saudi Arabia and the British developer Howard Ronson.
The authors of "New York 1960" described the Zeckendorf penthouse as "the era's most extraordinary offices." The chief feature is a circular dining room with floor-to-ceiling windows and a cylindrical elevator shaft. Here, with a wide-screen perspective on mid-Manhattan, the legendary developer held court, offering guests three-course lunches and fine wines.
Zeckendorf's own office was on the floor below this turret, in a teak-lined drum 25 feet in diameter. One of his grandsons, William Lie Zeckendorf, recalls that the inner sanctum seemed to him as a child as if it must have been 60 feet wide.
"It's amazing how many people I run into almost daily who have never forgotten that office," the younger Mr. Zeckendorf said last week. "But I'm told by people who've been up there that it's been so altered over the years that it bears no resemblance to what it used to be."
From the outside, it does indeed look forlorn, a reminder that it takes little in the way of neglect to transform modernist cynosures into nondescript shells. Mr. Kaufman put it succinctly: "They don't make good ruins."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Wild Ride Fails to Sway Many Market Forecasters

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
IF early March seems like a long time ago to investors, no wonder: Ever since the Dow Jones industrial average took a 171-point plunge a month ago tomorrow, it has pumped itself up faster than did certain Presidential candidates in the early primaries. Not only did the Dow recoup much of its dip in a single day -- March 11 -- but as of the market's close on Thursday it had completely erased the drop and then some.
Sure, there have been tense moments in between, with 50-point swings in a day now more of a rule than the exception. Still, while some bears saw the March 8 fall as the start of a correction, perhaps of 10 percent or more, the market has risen about 4 percent in the last month. On top of the market rise before the dip, that puts the Dow up more than 11 percent for 1996. 
 What do the experts say now? With a month's hindsight, has the one-day drop and the subsequent rise swayed them or changed their views?
For the editors at Standard & Poor's Outlook newsletter, the March drop looms less large than it did at first. In a newsletter that was published the week after the event, they emphasized that they expected the bull market to continue -- but at the same time warned readers that a decline of 10 percent should not come as a surprise.
Lately, though, the newsletter has retained its bullishness but dropped its cautionary stance. "At this point in the market, you're better in than out," said Joseph Tigue, the managing editor.
Similarly, at PDI Strategies in Short Hills, N.J., Mark Stumpp, the chief investment officer, was unfazed by the market drop and remains bullish.
"Just because we had a major rally in 1995 doesn't mean we're automatically going to have a correction this year," he said. Two factors, he added, greatly lessen the likelihood of a serious correction. First, he said, unlike the situation before the market crash in 1987, when interest rates and the stock market rose to giddy heights together, the fundamentals of the economy today, while weak, are still sound. And, Mr. Stumpp said, investors are taking a longer-term perspective toward the market.
Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Van Kampen/American Capital, said he believed -- both before and after the March drop -- that good earnings were behind today's market. And he said he was as bullish on that score as he was before.
"There might be selective earnings disappointments in sectors such as computers and software," he said, "but overall earnings will probably come out a little bit better than expected."
He said he was holding to his prediction -- made just after the March dip -- that the market had seen as much of a correction as it would for the rest of 1996.
Gail M. Dudack, United States chief investment strategist at UBS Securities in New York, said she was also sticking to her guns. But she is bearish. Right after the March 8 fall, she said, she believed the Dow could drop to 5,000 or even lower; today, she said, "I haven't changed my view." What makes her pessimistic is what makes Mr. Froelich optimistic -- earnings.
"Earnings are not growing as fast as some people think," she said. The earnings in the fourth quarter of 1995 "were way below what people expected them to be," she added, and so she sees the estimates for this year and next as likely to be too high.
"In this kind of environment, with expectations so high, a 10 percent correction is a normal situation," she said. "The market is likely to hit 5,000 before it hits 6,000."
Morgan Stanley's chief domestic investment strategist, Byron R. Wien, is staying the course with his pre-drop prediction that the market will decline in 1996. Last Monday, he advised investors that the "U.S. equity market could become a more nervous place" later this year "when and if interest rates move above 7 percent, and the zeal of the baby boomers for sure-thing mutual funds subsides."
But before then, Mr. Wien, who anticipated the recent rise in economic activity, is willing to allow the Dow one more jump. "I still think it could rally close to 6,000," he said.
While the March drop and the subsequent rise have not greatly altered the views of the experts, it has had some impact. Sparked by a jobs report that some faulted as skewed, the dip added fuel to skepticism about both the soundness of economic numbers and the market's reaction to them.
Many analysts cite a "crisis of the month" mentality in the market, whether it involves the recent Government shutdowns or the General Motors strike.
But other analysts perceive jumbled numbers as well as market jitters. "I don't think the credibility of these numbers is what you would have seen a year ago," Mr. Froehlich said of recent statistics. "We haven't had a good, clear month for collecting information for an entire year."
Mr. Stumpp said money managers were "truly puzzled" by the seemingly incongruous economic data. Last week alone, the numbers pointed to weak manufacturing and construction spending even as the index of leading economic indicators shot up 1.3 percent -- the biggest jump in 20 years.

HEADLINE: Radio New Jersey: Is Everyone Listening?

BYLINE: By DAVID CORCORAN 

 BODY:
TURNPIKE traffic, 10:30 in the morning. There's a car fire at Exit 18, and rubberneckers are backing up in the southbound lanes. The radio pops and snorts, and then, as the signal comes into focus, it begins to snarl.
"Ray in Chester, you're on New Jersey 101.5." Topic A this morning on 101.5 FM in Trenton, the state's top-rated talk station, is the recent killing of a Monmouth County schoolteacher; the suspect is a 17-year-old who was caught driving her car the next day. 
 "I think this little dirtbag just hit the jackpot," Ray tells Dennis Malloy, the station's host from 10 to noon. "Whereas before he probably had no chance to amount to anything in life, afraid of his own shadow, he's now got the opportunity to get a college education, watch cable TV all night in an air-conditioned cell, have conjugal visits, get married to some loser woman with an infatuation for prisoners . . . He'll never see the death penalty, and if I had the chance I'd do it myself!"
"All right, Ray, thank you. I think you're 100 percent right."
Not all radio in New Jersey is anywhere near this angry and raw. But much of it is just as vital. From one end of the dial (WBGO at 88.3 FM, the region's premier jazz station) to the other (WJDM at 1660, a pioneer of the newly expanded AM band), broadcasters blanket the state with a hugely varied quilt of sound, some of it professional and polished, some of it automated and bland, some of it quirky and specialized, some of it folksy or silly or just plain weird.
Radio in New Jersey is a $150 million business, with more than 80 stations from Cape May to Newton. They exist in the shadows of the nation's largest and fourth-largest radio markets, New York and Philadelphia, and for the most part they get along by carving out a niche -- not just a particular format, like talk or gospel or rock, but a particular audience, like Haitians or fundamentalist Christians or Bergen County adults over 45.
"The F.C.C. in its great wisdom allowed all these little stations to drop in wherever they'd fit on the dial, without any regard for economics," said Art Camiolo, president of Allur Communications, which owns three stations in Atlantic and Cape May Counties. "You have to have a niche if you're going to be successful, and smaller stations just can't survive all by themselves."
That struggle for survival has forced many stations to consolidate with bigger companies or frantically switch formats. One of the largest, WPAT-FM (93.1) in Paterson, was recently sold to the Spanish Broadcasting System, which already owns one of New York's top-rated Hispanic stations, for $83.5 million, and its studios were moved to New York. (The state's largest station by far, WHTZ-FM or "Z-100" in Secaucus, is for all practical purposes a New York rock station.)
And more consolidation is on the way, since the recent overhaul of Federal communications law has all but eliminated restrictions on the number of stations a company can own.
But in struggling, some broadcasters have managed to push the limits of the medium, pioneering new formats or finding creative ways to stay on the air.
There is Gerry Turro, founder and president of WJUX (103.1 FM) in Dumont, who dreamed as a teen-ager of starting an FM station in Bergen County and managed to cobble one together out of records and equipment salvaged from a Manhattan station's garbage bins -- and a network of transmitters so convoluted and Rube Goldbergian that the F.C.C. may disallow it.
There are WNWK (105.9 FM) and WNJR (1430 AM), both in Newark, "multicultural" stations that make their money by leasing air time to producers from a mosaic of immigrant groups. "Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Jewish, Polish, Chinese both Mandarin and Cantonese, Haitian, Vietnamese," said Maury Warshauer, general manager of WNJR. "If you have any ethnic hang-ups, this is not the place to work."
There are mom-and-pop broadcasters, like WKMB (1070 AM) in Stirling, Morris County, which became the metropolitan area's only country music station this winter when WYNY in New York abruptly changed formats. (The little station's switchboard lit up with delighted phone calls.)
And there are noncommercial stations, probably the most inventive of all, often hanging on by their fingernails at a time of dwindling government support and competing demands on individual and corporate supporters.
Consider WBGO, the jazz station in Newark, whose on-air appeals for money are so frequent and desperate that a musician once suggested its call letters should be WBEG. Or WFDU at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck (89.1 FM), whose traditional American format -- blues, bluegrass and folk -- has inspired a fanatical following but which has to leave the air at 3:45 P.M. every weekday because it shares a transmitter with another college station.
When you ask radio people what draws them to the medium, they invariably talk about the magical way it acts on a listener's imagination.
Carl Kraus, general manager of WFDU, grew up in Haddonfield, listening to distant AM stations like WBZ in Boston, falling asleep to "the incandescence of the filaments in the radio." Years later, he still speaks of radio's "inexplicable mystery, its theater of the mind." (He can be forgiven a rhetorical flight or two: his station is the only one that still broadcasts from the fabled 425-foot tower in Alpine from which the inventor Edwin Howard Armstrong launched FM as a broadcast medium in the 30's.) What follow are the stories of several stations that are keeping that mystery aglow.
 
TALK
The 800-Pound Gorilla
It seems to be a point of pride at WKXW-FM, universally known as New Jersey 101.5, that it was not Gov. Jim Florio's tax increase that made the station what it is today. Still, it may well be 101.5 that made Mr. Florio what he is today: a former Governor.
Press Broadcasting Company, which also owns The Asbury Park Press, bought WKXW in July 1989, a few months before Mr. Florio's election. With the help of Walter Sabo, a New York radio guru who served as the company's consultant, the station's successful but bland "adult contemporary" format was retooled to emphasize New Jersey: New Jersey talk, New Jersey traffic, New Jersey weather.
"Walter's genius was in putting together a New Jersey format and calling it New Jersey," John Dziuba, the station's general manager, recalled recently. "When people asked, 'What is your format?' the answer was simply 'New Jersey.' "
A full-time meteorologist was hired, to give the weather in Teterboro and Plainsboro and Scotch Plains. The station began giving traffic reports every 10 minutes, pointedly ignoring tie-ups on the West Side Highway and the Schuylkill Expressway. On-air hosts were told to talk about New Jersey and encourage listeners to do the same. Ratings began to climb before Mr. Florio took office.
But it was the new Governor's $2.8 billion tax increase, in spring 1990, that made the station explode into the public consciousness. "Until then we were talking about not very serious things," said Jim Gearhart, the morning host, a burly, bearded veteran of New York talk radio whose pear-shaped tones make him sound like Reverend Jim, radio preacher. "Best pizza, worst potholes and the like. But then people started calling in about the tax increase, and it started building. It was wild."
The flames of the tax rebellion were fanned by the New Jersey 101.5 hosts, who were anything but reasoned and neutral. The afternoon drive-time hosts encouraged tax protesters to start a movement, Hands Across New Jersey, which in turn staged one of the largest, fiercest rallies the State House has ever seen. Not everyone remembers the station's role fondly.
"Reasonable people couldn't call in and talk reasonably," said Jon Shure, Mr. Florio's press secretary at the time, who was repeatedly branded a liar on the station. "They didn't really respect their audience; they just wanted to arouse and inflame it."
Political life in the state is calmer these days, and without an unpopular governor to beat up, New Jersey 101.5 often has to fall back on what Andrew Santoro, general manager of the more earnest WCTC in New Brunswick, tartly calls "fluff talk -- why do guys pick their noses when they drive on the highway, that kind of thing." One recent week, a midday host tried to auction off his pants to the highest bidder, and the afternoon hosts staged a "duh" hour, asking callers, "What's the dumbest thing you've ever done?"
Still, when a particularly brutal killing shakes the state, New Jersey 101.5 is there, a sounding board for New Jersey outrage. "Sometimes when I hear things on the air, I kind of cringe and wish I could take them back," said Mr. Dziuba, the station manager. "But these are things that have to be said. We can't just focus on what's right with New Jersey. Talking about what's right doesn't give anyone a reason to listen. This is a way to vent."
And while WKXW's ratings have slipped somewhat, at least in its core area around Trenton, it is still widely admired in the industry for its boldness and success. "They managed to carve out a New Jersey market and set themselves apart from the heavy hitters in New York and Philadelphia," said James Duncan Jr., a radio analyst in Indiana. "It's an exceptional property."
 
NOSTALGIA
Big-Band Wars
In the Wizard of Oz world of radio, where all images exist in your head and things are seldom what they seem, WJUX in Dumont ("Jukebox Radio") is some kind of champion.
For one thing, its transmitter, the site that actually broadcasts its signal, is 60 miles away, in Monticello, N.Y. In crowded Bergen County, only one transmitter, WFDU's in Alpine, is licensed to originate FM signals; to get around that restriction, WJUX relies on a series of translators, tiny transmitters that are meant to beam signals from large stations to areas that would otherwise lack FM service.
It sends its signal through phone lines to Monticello, where the transmitter sends it through the air to a translator in Rockland County, which in turn sends it to a translator on a high-rise apartment building in Fort Lee. That translator is only 34 watts (most FM stations are 1,000 or more), but it manages to cover most of Bergen County and some of Manhattan and the Bronx.
The format is something of an accident, too. The founder and president, Gerry Turro, a veteran engineer who has spent more than half his 41 years at radio stations around the metropolitan area, heard that WNEW was moving its studios and discarding its records and equipment. "They said, You have three days to get whatever we left behind," Mr. Turro said. "I loaded a console, furniture, a record library, 300 boxes of stuff in my Subaru station wagon."
The records happened to be heavily big-band era, music of the 1930's, 40's and 50's. As it turned out, that fit neatly into the demographics of Bergen, which has a large population of affluent adults who grew up listening to those songs in their Chevies, Ramblers and DeSotos.
"We built this radio station out of the garbage!" Mr. Turro said. "And now we're No. 1 on the weekends in Bergen County! It's pretty gosh-darn amazing."
At WVNJ, Mr. Turro's closest rival, they are not amused. The station (1160 AM in Teaneck) recently changed its format to big band, hired several announcers from the heyday of big-band radio in New York, and announced plans to double its signal strength, to 20,000 watts. It has complained to the F.C.C. that WJUX's transmitter arrangement violates the rules on where a signal may originate.
"You're not supposed to send programming through a translator," said Ron Lustberg, WVNJ's general manager. "We're the ones who are licensed out of Bergen County." The F.C.C. is expected to rule on the complaint shortly.
Talk of the dispute momentarily darkens Mr. Turro's disposition. "WVNJ cloned us," he said. "No one listens to them anyway. Don't blame us for your failure. Look in the mirror."
 
WHATEVER
Never a Dull Moment
At any given time on WFMU, you might hear post-industrial rock from a band like Combustible Edison or Voodoo Queens or Beatnik Termites, bachelor-pad music from the early 1960's, five minutes of hog calls, a discourse on baseball's changing strike zone, Connie Francis singing "Stupid Cupid," a rabbi discussing whether milk made from rice can be kosher, or "Meet Me in St. Louie, Louie," played on a 1906 Victrola.
If it is hard to lump all this under a single format, or even a dozen, it is no easier to explain how WFMU has managed to survive for nearly half a century -- let alone flourish, having been named best radio station in the United States in four successive critics' polls by Rolling Stone magazine from 1991 to 1994.
Founded as the student station at Upsala College in East Orange, it was infiltrated and eventually taken over in the late 60's by what Ken Freedman, the 37-year-old station manager, calls a band of "artists, hippies, weirdos and musicians." They installed the free-form ethos that still governs the station, and it has prevailed through years of battles with the college, creditors, rival noncommercial stations and even the elements -- the transmitter was once torn in two by an ice storm.
"We just keep bouncing from one horrible crisis to another," Mr. Freedman said. "It's really quite ridiculous. We've survived two or three situations that would have killed another station."
The worst crisis came last year, when Upsala filed for bankruptcy and then swiftly closed its doors, auctioning off the entire 40-acre campus. WFMU had already become independent by buying its license from the college in 1994, but the bankruptcy created a host of new problems. "We couldn't even imagine it," Mr. Freedman said. "We couldn't get our mail delivered. Our donations were going to a college that didn't exist. The electricity was messed up because we were still tied into the college's infrastructure."
The station is still housed in the one building on campus that isn't boarded up -- a fading Greek Revival mansion that would look quite splendid if the setting weren't so eerie. But that too is in jeopardy, because the bankruptcy trustees want to sell it.
To raise money for operations and living quarters -- preferably elsewhere, Mr. Freedman says -- the station just completed a two-week fund-raising marathon that took in $367,000, enough to insure its survival for at least a while. (The annual budget is $600,000, and the station also raises money with a mail-order catalogue and a record fair.) "We're too used to this to truly panic," Mr. Freedman said.
By now, it seems clear that WFMU's devoted corps of volunteers and listeners will find a way to keep the station alive. It is hardly a typical New Jersey radio station, but its pluck and grittiness might be a typical New Jersey story, inspiring even to those who wouldn't know the Voodoo Queens from the Lennon Sisters. "New Jersey's an underdog state," said Chris Tsakis, the operations manager at WFMU. "We're an underdog radio station."

HEADLINE: THE GREAT OUTDOORS;
Nobody's Happy When Autumn's Leaves Are Picked Up in the Spring . . .

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: PARAMUS

 BODY:
The trees may not have even begun to bud yet, but foliage enthusiasts should have no trouble finding their fill of leaves this April: they're blanketing the front lawn and lying in heaps in the gutter.
They're last year's leaves, of course. Between a late leaf drop (because of a warm summer) and the snows that began to fall in late November, many homeowners never were able to finish raking their yards. As a result, towns across the state are spending the tail ends of their 1996 public works budgets on an unappointed and unwelcome round of leaf collection. Consider it one last cruel gift from a cruel winter. 
 "We've been in leaf season going on seven months now," said Brian Koenig, Public Works Director in Paramus, sighing as he watched one of his employees kick a soggy brown pile into the path of the slowly advancing maw of a vacuum truck Tuesday morning. "Every time it stopped snowing we'd be picking up leaves, and look at what we still have here."
Normally, Mr. Koenig and his men would be spending the month of April readying their snowplows for summer storage and unclogging storm drains. But since March 18 -- shortly after the last major snowfall -- all hands have been dispatched to the leaf trucks and the loaders, setting off chain reactions of inconvenience.
The leaves, sodden with spring rains, keep jamming up the vacuums. To make collection even more difficult, several major winter windstorms have littered lawns with sticks and branches, which Paramus residents have not hesitated to add to the piles despite pleas from the town to bundle them separately.
Mr. Koenig is trying to be understanding.
"People feel like they got cheated last fall on leaf pickup," he said, noting that many piles that were swept into the street were pushed back onto the curb by snowplows. "In the spring, people are supposed to put their leaves into bags and barrels for Wednesday pickup, but we got so many complaints that we decided to add more days. But we're going through town one more time and then everybody's just going to have to bag it."
In the end, Mr. Koenig said, the town may not get to patch as many roads as it would like to this summer, which could have unpleasant ramifications next winter.
"It's just a mess," he said. "That's all I can say."
Schedules have been thrown off everywhere.
In neighboring Glen Rock, the public works director, Roy Nordstrand, said that spring maintenance on baseball fields and athletic tracks has been sacrificed in the name of leaf pickup.
In Scotch Plains, the public works director, Walter DiNizo, said that in addition to the leaves, his crews are having to repair damage done by their own snowplows during the winter.
"Sometimes when you can't see the edge of the road for the snow, the plow will make a close turn around the corner and nick off a piece of lawn," he said. "Some of our plows loosened up chunks of Belgian block. And we're finding a lot of asphalt debris. There's just a bag of tricks out there."
In Paramus, Mr. Koenig said that his operating budget for the year that began Jan. 1 is nearly exhausted already.
"We've had so much overtime the guys don't want anymore," he said.
Spirits did not seem high Tuesday morning. The vacuum truck creeped and stopped, creeped and stopped. One crew member, Kevin Revicki, reached into the plucker and pulled out a small log.
"Look at this," he said shouted over the din of the machine, pointing to a pile of debris -- including a pair of old shorts -- that he had cleared from the vacuum. "People will throw anything out."
A little farther up the street, Rudy Heydt, an unemployed ironworker, came out of his house to say hello to the workers. Mr. Koenig warned him about the sticks in his leaf pile. Mr. Heydt said that he had a bad back and that his wife had been doing the raking. Mr. Koenig said he understood.
"Just think," he said on the way back to his car. "In six months we get to start all over again."

HEADLINE: Out-of-State Students And What They Add

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your story on the eight state colleges and Montclair State University contained a phrase that might be misinterpreted by some readers. 
 While it is true that students who are not residents of New Jersey pay higher tuition than those who live within the state, that is not the reason universities are pleased to have them enroll. Montclair State is happy to have out-of-state and international students attending because they bring another dimension to our campus, broaden the educational experience of our students, and provide a different perspective on many topics. For those reasons, geographic diversity is a goal of most universities and colleges.
As a public university, our primary goal is to provide an excellent education for New Jersey residents. Most out-of-state and international students come here because they have heard of our reputation for offering a fine education at an affordable price, and they contribute to New Jersey's economy during their stay with us.

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB;
The Language Barrier as Mount Everest

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Remember that old song, the one that said little things mean a lot? How true that is, especially in foreign travel. Just when business people hope to be on their best behavior, a word here or a gesture there can turn them into boors or laughingstocks. Read on.
On his first day of work in Hong Kong, Mike McKeown of Mineola, L.I., politely informed his plant manager that there was no need to brave the traffic to drive him back to his hotel. "I'll take the subway," Mr. McKeown said. "I grew up in New York City and have been riding the subway since I was a teen-ager." The plant manager looked at him strangely but let him go. 
 "As I exited the building, I saw a blue sign with a figure walking, and it said 'subway,' " Mr. McKeown recalled. As he proceeded in the indicated direction, he soon saw railroad tracks. "This was too easy," he remembered thinking.
"I walked into an underground walkway beneath the train tracks, and on the other side I saw the same blue sign with 'subway' on it," he continued. There was no train, though, and Mr. McKeown soon figured out his mistake. "I realized that the English version of subway was not the New York City version," he said.
"I took a cab home that night."
Shelley H. Brauner of Manhattan spent the second half of 1995 working at a major advertising agency in London.
"Besides the obvious, to go over there and do a great job, I was also anxious to fit in socially," she said. "So I was very pleased to be invited to a party one Friday evening, at a club in Soho, to celebrate a co-worker's birthday. Still unfamiliar with the streets of London, even with my trusty 'A to Z Guide' in hand, I jumped when I overheard a colleague mention he had his car and would be driving to the party.
"I ran over to him and asked, 'Could I get a ride with you?' As he turned bright red and his eyes popped out of his head, he said, 'Lucky for you I know what you meant.'
"Unbeknownst to me, I had actually requested a sexual encounter with him and not a lift to the party."
While visiting South Korea on a business trip a few years ago, Charles Stahley of North Wales, Pa., was in an elevator in a new office building when his partner pointed out a technical error: there was neither a light nor a numeral for the fourth floor.
"The Koreans in the elevator loudly responded: 'You Americans. What happened to your 13th floor? Why is 13 bad for you -- like 4 is to us?' " Mr. Stahley wrote. "The elevator became silent and my partner red-faced."
"In the United States, we are accustomed to making a certain hand gesture to express the thought 'well done,' " wrote William G. Voorhes of Stuart, Fla. "This is accomplished by bringing the tips of the thumb and forefinger together to form a circle while the other three fingers remain extended."
Several years ago, while in Rio de Janeiro for three months on a consulting project, Mr. Voorhes ate lunch daily in an executive dining room where the woman in charge graciously asked whether he had any special requests. Yes, he did: some hot sauce to pep up the black beans and rice.
"The next day she mixed up some sauce and asked me to try it," Mr. Voorhes recalled. "It was excellent, and I raised my right hand to give her the 'well done' sign. Just before bringing thumb and forefinger together, I saw a look of shock beginning to form on her face. Fortunately, I was able instead to ease into the 'A-O.K.' hand signal, widely used in Brazil, in which the fist is clenched while the thumb is extended vertically. Her face relaxed into a broad smile."
Later Mr. Voorhes learned that, in Brazil, his "well done" gesture refers not to what was tops but to people's bottoms. Indeed, when the movie "Top Gun" played there, Tom Cruise was, so to speak, the butt of the joke. People laughed uproariously each time he flashed the "well done" sign.
When Sandford Borins, the chairman of the division of management and economics on the Scarborough, Ontario, campus of the University of Toronto, was taken out to lunch in Tokyo by some Japanese business people, they made a point of asking him what he wanted.
"Thinking I would show them how much at home I was with their culture, I ordered tempura," he wrote. "They all proceeded to order tempura. Something didn't feel right.
"The next time -- there was a next time, but with a different group of Japanese business people -- they asked me what I wanted. The penny dropped. I ordered steak; they all ordered steak. All were very happy -- and, of course, the company paid."
"I am afraid you have been caught unawares yourself," wrote Nancy Morgenstern of Glendale, Ariz., referring to the name of this column. "About a year and a half ago, a companion who is a professional in the field and I attended Cordon Bleu in London for classes. I attended demonstrations, while she actually had hands-on experience in their kitchens. One session involved chocolate, and I, of course, went up to help grade the creations. In the course of our sampling, I remarked that there was a chocolate factory near us where you could eat all the chocolates you wanted 'on the job.' "
When the laughter subsided, Mrs. Morgenstern, somewhat bemused, asked what the joke was.
"I was informed," she said, "that the only ones 'on the job' in England were prostitutes."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Selling When the Tune Changes

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
WHILE investors hang onto their mutual fund shares for many reasons -- benign neglect is a common one -- most fund purchases are not lifelong commitments.
But determining when a fund has outlived its usefulness in a portfolio is no small task. While poor performance is one obvious sign, there may be other clues, like a manager who suddenly shifts gears, or a change in market conditions. 
 Harold Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla., says he is usually patient with managers. Once he researches a fund and buys it, he will stick with it through two years of bad times if performance seems likely to improve. But he dumps funds immediately when managers change their stripes, say by adding big foreign positions or by switching from a growth to a value approach in stock selection.
Sometimes Mr. Evensky drops a fund simply because he believes he can do better in another type of investment, given global economic conditions. Such is the case with Pimco Foreign Bond, which Mr. Evensky is swapping for Warburg Pincus International Equity because he foresees a brighter future overseas for equities than for bonds. He expects the foreign economies that have been lagging behind the United States economy to catch up over the next three to five years, boding well for foreign stocks.
For the second quarter, Mr. Evensky and two other investment advisers are changing managers in the hypothetical retirement portfolios they created for The New York Times in the summer of 1993. The two remaining advisers remain content with their selections for now.
Jack Brill, a San Diego investment adviser who specializes in "socially responsible" investing, is dropping three of his eight funds. A fund that takes the socially responsible mantle aims to steer clear of things like tobacco stocks and companies that it deems to have poor records on environmental concerns or human rights issues. High-minded as such investing attempts seem, many funds in this category have been among the worst performers in recent quarters.
Performance is also leading Eric Kobren, editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter in Wellesley, Mass., to make a change. He is getting rid of the Fidelity fund that was the biggest drag on his portfolio in the last quarter.
 The contest is being tracked quarterly, although that is much too short a time to evaluate the portfolios, which were intended to grow for 20 years. During that time, the ups and downs in various types of assets should work themselves out.
ALL the portfolios made money in the first quarter, but four lagged behind the 5.3 percent gain for the Vanguard S.& P. 500, a benchmark equity fund. The exception was the no-load portfolio designed by Sheldon Jacobs of Irvington, N.Y. He was up 6.5 percent, helped by a surge in Mutual Discovery, which is a fifth of the portfolio.
Perhaps because of that strong showing, Mr. Jacobs decided not to make changes this time around. "I think the next two to three quarters will be winners or, if there's a correction, it will be less than 7 percent," he said. "The market isn't overvalued, and there's plenty of cash around."
Mr. Jacobs leads the group so far with a gain of 55 percent, from $50,000 to $77,228, since the contest began. On average, the portfolios have gained 41 percent, about 15 percentage points behind the overall market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500.
The portfolio performance, tracked by Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J., excludes taxes, because many people invest retirement money in tax-deferred accounts. Transaction costs and sales charges are also excluded.
 Like Mr. Jacobs, John Rekenthaler, editor of the Morningstar Investor, is not dropping or adding any funds to his portfolio. Each quarter, he rebalances, meaning that he adjusts the weighting of each fund to his original goal. In the near term, the odds slightly favor blue-chip stocks, Mr. Rekenthaler said. But small companies and international companies -- which his portfolio favors -- have more growth potential over the long term, he said.
Mr. Brill's portfolio has been the laggard over the long term and for the latest quarter, along with the category of socially responsible funds in which he specializes. Now he is making a major overhaul.
Calvert Strategic Growth falls off his list because it missed out on the entire bull market of 1995, Mr. Brill said, forcing him to re-evaluate, and ultimately reject, the technical analysis and market timing approach used by the fund.
Similarly, Parnassus has underperformed its aggressive-growth group since the start of 1995, a result of several stock choices. Mr. Brill said the fund's manager told him that he was repositioning the portfolio. For that reason, Mr. Brill is going to get out, at least until the changeover is completed.
He is also removing MMA Praxis Growth, although not because of the fund manager's decisions. Given the other changes, Praxis had "too much overlap with other funds in the portfolio," he said, citing its big blue-chip holdings. Upon rethinking, he also decided that the fund was too conservative.
Mr. Brill likes Citizens Emerging Growth, which is invested heavily in emerging technology and health care companies, because "it is appropriate for a retirement portfolio to have a small percentage of its assets invested aggressively."
Taking fourth place for the last quarter was Mr. Kobren, whose all-Fidelity portfolio rose just 2.9 percent. His return was weighed down by Fidelity Export, which has struggled because of several stock picks, Mr. Kobren said. "No one hits consistent home runs," he said, "but the manager has had a couple of incidents that call into question his investment decisions."
So Export is being replaced by Fidelity Growth Company, which will improve the overall quality of the portfolio, he said. The new fund also fits better with his economic forecasts. It "should fare well in the kind of moderate growth environment that we see ahead," he said.
As for Fidelity Value, which recently got a new manager, Mr. Kobren recommends patience. The new manager, Richard Fentin, ran the fund in the past and is now the team leader of the growth and income group at Fidelity. Mr. Kobren said he was convinced that Mr. Fentin would be a terrific fit.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
Mixing Religion and Capitalism, Sometimes Uneasily

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
IT'S the season of Easter and Passover, of Holy Scripture and Haggadahs -- an apt time to look at some recent books that try to combine religious teachings and business tenets.
I say "recent," because books that mix Judeo-Christian concepts and commerce pop up regularly in America. 
 And why not? After all, the Talmud is bursting with issues of business ethics (many of them, of course, agrarian: how best to share the wool of jointly raised sheep, for example). And The New Testament highlights the views of Jesus on charity, labor's fruits and the difficulty of a rich man's reaching Paradise.
Add to this that the United States is among the most religious of the industrialized countries.
Americans have also long been influenced, regardless of their faiths, by a powerful Protestant work ethic. Benjamin Franklin was the first American to market a book about piety and success, says the business historian Peter Baida in his book, "Poor Richard's Legacy: American Business Values From Ben Franklin to Donald Trump." Franklin's 1757 book, "The Way of Wealth," was a compilation of proverbs from editions of Poor Richard's Almanack. Franklin published the book as a "speech" by a fictional old man. It was hugely popular.
About 130 years later, Americans were snapping up copies of "In His Steps," by Charles Sheldon. In this novel, the hero walks out on a successful business to live as Jesus did. True to the Protestant ethic, his highly moral action brings him even greater material wealth. The book, says Michael Zuckerman, a professor of American history at the University of Pennsylvania, is "a rip-roaring critique of business in the age of the robber barons and of the Gilded Age."
By the early 20th century, we see quite a different approach in "The Man Nobody Knows," by Bruce Barton, which casts Jesus as a brilliant adman for God's cause. The author, who later was a founder of the innovative BBDO advertising agency, spun out this idea at a time when Americans were infatuated with business and the stock market.
Now, pulling on that strand in a slightly different direction, come the latest books: "The Management Methods of Jesus" by Bob Briner (Thomas Nelson Inc., $14.99) and "Jesus C.E.O.," by Laurie Beth Jones (Hyperion, $16.95).
The idea of Jesus in the executive suite strains the imagination, even in the 1990's, when the metaphors out there in management land are already pretty attenuated. These days, executives are being urged to buy books on the "management" wisdom of basketball coaches, medieval despots and Winnie the Pooh.
The Briner and Jones books -- if we can judge them by their covers for a minute -- try to keep Jesus from being seen as just another name on that list. Both works are hymnal-sized, both use the words "ancient wisdom" in their subtitles and both are jacketed in purple, a color closely associated with religious garb in Western Christian traditions.
But neither can quite overcome the banality of comparing a much-worshipped religious figure with the guy in the corner office.
In "The Management Methods of Jesus," Mr. Briner, a television sports producer and freelance writer, does urge his readers to emulate Jesus by getting their companies to serve -- in this case, customers and employees. But too often, he views Jesus through the lens of management, instead of the other way around.
A result is that he winds up trivializing, to put it mildly, the religious lore he means to revere.
A chapter titled "Watch Your Timing" describes how Jesus planned his entrance into Jerusalem during Passover, when Jews from every nation came into the city. It concludes, in part: "New products should be introduced at the most opportune time. Where appropriate, tie them into significant anniversaries and public holidays."
Similarly, "Eat With the Troops" cites nothing less than the Last Supper to remind readers that "meals with those who work with and for you should be a part of your schedule."
With "Jesus C.E.O.," the myopia problem starts with the title. The author bases her premise on the fact that Jesus "trained 12 human beings" to "accomplish the tasks he trained them to do."
But the book has a bit more substance than the Briner work. The examples from the business world are more developed, so, as lessons, they have beginnings, middles and ends. Still, while the book takes the time to talk about setting noble goals and living up to Jesus's equality standards, it, too, can be jaw-droppingly mundane.
In one example, titled, "He Was Keenly Aware of His Resources," the author alludes to the Gospel's account of Jesus' feeding of 5,000 people with five loaves of bread and two fishes. The "resources" lesson for readers? Update those Rolodexes.
This brings us to a brief mention of another new book, "God Wants You to Be Rich," by Paul Zane Pilzer (Simon & Schuster, $23). Brief because, despite its title, it is much more about economics than theology. The author, who was the co-author of "Other People's Money: The Inside Story of the S.& L. Mess," sets out to prove that technology creates unlimited physical resources and that "an increase in wealth for an individual almost always represents an even larger increase in wealth for society at large."
So why mention God in the title? Perhaps because the author does touch on his religious beliefs from time to time. Or perhaps because, as Professor Zuckerman points out: "There are a lot more people in America who believe in religion than believe in business."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: REGO PARK;
After 2 Stores Open, Business Strolls Back to Queens Blvd.

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
When Alexander's department store closed its doors in 1992, it took with it much of the surrounding foot traffic along Queens Boulevard and left a big void in Rego Park. Without its overflow of shoppers, many long-time merchants followed suit and closed their doors. Those who clung on said sales dropped by 20 percent. Their hopes were all but dashed when Caldor declared bankruptcy in the fall and withdrew its plan to open in the Alexander's building.
"The empty store was an eyesore," said Jay Parker, president of the Rego Park Forest Hills Community Development Corporation. "Longtime stores were closing left and right. We had 55 members before Alexander's closed. When we reopened six months ago, there were only three original members left." 
 But in the last three weeks, since the opening of two national retailers, Sears and Marshalls, the discount chain, businesses owners are once again optimistic about their future.
"It has been great," said Wendy Pan, a manager at Baskin-Robbins ice cream store across the street. Ms. Pan said that in the three weeks that Sears had been open, business had almost returned to the levels when Alexander's attracted store-packing foot traffic.
Eric Robinson, the spokesman for the Queens Chamber of Commerce, said Marshalls and Sears were expected to create about 700 full- and part-time jobs. But he said the stores' economic impact went beyond the immediate neighborhood.
"Destination stores like Sears and Marshalls can attract other businesses as well," Mr. Robinson said. "It gives confidence to other companies thinking of opening up in the borough."
Apparently what's good for the area is also good for Sears and Marshalls. Alan Koch, store manager for Sears, said the store's opening last month was the most successful opening day in Sears' history.
"Our customer base is about 3 million shoppers within the five-mile radius," Mr. Koch said. "The demographics -- middle-class working families -- are exactly what we are looking for."
Sears occupies 200,000 square feet in the cellar and part of the first floor of the former Alexander's site. Marshalls, with 80,000 square feet, shares part of the first floor with Sears. The second floor, with 120,000 square feet, remains empty.
On the opening day of Marshalls last weekend, customers jostled and pushed their way through piles of discounted dresses and pants. Two customers, Kim White and Elise Jones, said they previously had to drive about two hours to Long Island to shop at Marshalls. JANE H. LII

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
ITT Gets Gussied Up For a Fling In Casinos

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

 BODY:
Few companies have reflected prevailing Wall Street fashions as consistently as the ITT Corporation. So get ready for the corporate equivalent of bare midriffs and ankle tattoos as ITT spends heavily again to remake itself in the image of the market's latest thing, a gambling-and-leisure behemoth.
Not so long ago, investors were put off by the garish temptations of Las Vegas, but America's sudden embrace of casinos has that other casino, Wall Street, delighted. And so ITT is in negotiations to bulk up with the acquisition of Bally's, a deal that could cost nearly $3 billion. The deal is given 50-50 odds by some people close to the talks, but even if it does not come off, ITT, which already owns the Sheraton hotels, is planning a major expansion in Las Vegas that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 "It is patently obvious to us that we have to invest in the best brand name in Las Vegas," said Robert A. Bowman, the company's president. He would not comment on the Bally's reports, but, he added, referring to ITT's Caesars World gambling unit, "The company has not been adequately invested in in the past."
It has been a long strange trip getting here. Telecommunications? As some gray hairs can recall, that was how the company got its start, when international telephone calls dazzled investors. Conglomerates? When they became the rage, ITT stood out at buying and selling companies like so many trading cards. It collected everything from Wonder Bread to Avis car rental to lawn seed and insurance.
When ITT's chairman, Rand V. Araskog, was criticized for paying himself millions while the stock lagged behind, he caught the next wave and "de-conglomeratized" -- last year, he broke up the blob into four companies, and remained at the helm of the one that seemed fairest to Wall Street, the hotel and gambling company.
The stock has soared and ITT has made a spate of acquisitions -- among them last year's purchase of Caesars World and a half interest in Madison Square Garden, which includes the Knicks and the Rangers. And, of course, Mr. Araskog is getting richer. Last year, he received compensation of slightly less than $11 million for leaving behind the company he had helped build and fashioning a new one.
Analysts are fairly unanimous in their view that ITT overpaid for some of its assets, but they tend to be positive about where it stands and its prospects in an industry growing more and more central to the national economy: leisure and entertainment.
"Leaving aside the issue of whether the old ITT overpaid for the assets, they now have a collection of businesses that will enjoy strong and sustained growth," said Mark Manson, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities. "The growth prospects in the leisure industry are greater than they've ever been."
Indeed, Las Vegas is growing at a spectacular pace. In the next few years, about 16,000 new hotel rooms will be constructed, many of them attached to casinos built around entertainment themes ranging from "Star Trek" to, believe it or not, the streets of Manhattan.
Wall Street is not the least bit daunted by such competition, or the thought that vacationers may grow as tired of the strip's neon attractions as they once did of lava lamps.
"Las Vegas is the No. 1 destination in the world, and it is going to remain so," Mr. Bowman said. "We are going to invest to get our fair share of that market."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Nothing Seems to Stop the Flow at Stock Funds

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
DESPITE piling one gain upon another in 1995, managers of mutual funds that invest primarily in American stocks did something in the first quarter of this year that they were unable to do most of last year: outperform the market average.
Mutual funds that specialize in domestic equities rose 5.6 percent on average in the first quarter, according to Morningstar, the Chicago fund trackers. That beat the 5.3 percent total return, including reinvested dividends, of the Standard & Poor's 500 index, the benchmark for most equity fund managers, and marked the fifth consecutive quarter of gains. 
 International funds, helped by a resurgence in emerging markets, gained the same as their domestic counterparts.
But shareholders of bond funds, whose returns last year rivaled those of stock funds, suffered one of the worst markets in two years. The average taxable bond fund fell 0.58 percent in the first quarter, while municipal bond funds lost an average of 1.56 percent.
Even the winning equity performances mask a growing divergence among fund returns, differences that, if they continue to grow, could mean an increasingly rough ride for investors.
Consider that the equity fund numbers pale in comparison to what might have been. While the S.& P. 500 rose more than 5 percent, big stocks gained at a much faster pace. The Dow Jones industrial average recorded a total return of 9.9 percent, nearly double the broader market average.
Much of the first quarter's gains were apparently fueled by the deluge of cash into mutual funds. Domestic equity funds collected more money in the first two months than they had in any previous three-month stretch.
With demand for stocks soaring and many American companies continuing to repurchase their shares, fund managers are looking well beyond the biggest stocks for shares to buy. The lists of best performers over the latest quarter and year are littered with funds that invest heavily in small initial public offerings, and are remarkably devoid of the biggest and most widely held funds, which have been attracting most of the new cash from 401(k) retirement plans.
"I don't know why there aren't more larger-cap names in there," said James McCall, manager of the PBHG Large Cap Growth fund, lamenting the lack of similar funds on the lists of the quarter's top performers. "The money flows into mutual funds are very strong, and managers have to put money to work quickly. Often the only way they can do that is to buy big names. And foreign dollars flowing into the market also like large-cap companies."
But funds that focus on the biggest stocks have performed moderately at best so far this year. Some, like the Fidelity Magellan fund, the country's biggest, looked downright dismal. The Magellan fund rose 1.7 percent, placing it near the bottom in its category.
The divergence between the funds receiving the most money and those performing the best might eventually breed unrest among American investors. What history shows, however, is that investors rarely pull back from mutual funds before the market turns.
"Even in 1987, money started flowing out only after stock prices fell," said Melissa R. Brown, director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities. "When you get big surges of money flowing into the market, that's when the market seems to peak."
None of those cautions, however, seem to dim the ardor of the fund managers who lead the list of winning stock funds in the latest quarter. Randall E. Haase, co-manager of the Alliance Capital Quasar fund, the best-performing diversified stock fund in the latest quarter, said the recent outperformance of large-cap stocks gives him hope that the smaller stocks he prefers will move back into the spotlight.
The Quasar fund reaped much of its 18.75 percent first-quarter gain from what Mr. Haase called contrarian bets on two sectors that had been badly beaten down in recent years: natural gas drilling contractors and airlines.
Looking ahead, selected stocks in similarly out-of-favor industries, like retailing and, more recently, solid-waste disposal, could be further contributors to the Quasar fund's success, Mr. Haase said. Those winning ways date back beyond the most recent quarter. The fund has gained 64.6 percent over the last year, better than all but three other diversified stock funds tracked by Morningstar.
"We try to keep away from companies that have big valuations and that are 'story' stocks," he said. "We don't buy microbreweries, we don't buy 'concept' restaurants, we don't buy satellites and wireless cable companies. As a result, we've been able to keep away from many bombs and disasters."
Which is not to say that the fund, which outperformed its next closest competitor by more than three percentage points, avoids initial public offerings. A big winner has been Diamond Offshore Drilling, which went public in October at $24 and has since doubled. But even there, Mr. Haase said, the Quasar fund bought the offering "at a time when drilling stocks were out of favor, and the deal was not in demand."
The Dreyfus Premier Strategic Growth fund similarly benefited from some less-recognized initial public offerings. "Most people think of the overnight effect when they think of I.P.O.'s," said Michael Schonberg, manager of the fund, referring to the practice of "flipping" the highly coveted shares of a hot offering by selling when they soar in the first day of trading. By contrast, Mr. Schonberg said, "we have tried to focus on those that have very strong long-term stories."
Mr. Schonberg said that the fund's size, about $55 million, allows it to get a bigger performance benefit from I.P.O. shares than larger funds might. Shares of Fuisz Technologies, a drug-delivery researcher that went public in December at $12, more than tripled in the next three months. That has made the stock the Strategic Growth fund's biggest holding, at 6 percent of assets.
Other recent I.P.O.'s whose price gains contributed to the fund's first-quarter returns include Ultrafem, a developer of feminine hygiene products that went public in February at $10 a share and subsequently traded as high as $16, and Pharmaceutical Product Development, which sold shares to the public in January at $18 each and now trades at more than twice that level.
David Nicholas, manager of the Nicholas Limited Edition fund, another top performer in the most recent quarter, said that his fund tended not to buy I.P.O.'s and stayed far away from technology stocks. The latter aversion helped the fund immensely, as technology-heavy funds, last year's biggest gainers, were the biggest losers in the first quarter.
But the Nicholas fund did ride the coattails of some relatively recent public offerings. While the fund's biggest holding, International Speedway, has been in the portfolio for five years, its shares were pulled along last quarter in the excitement over Penske Motorsports, a new public offering, and Speedway Motorsports, which made an additional public offering. Both auto racing stocks have posted big gains this year.
While the lists of best-performing stocks and funds in the first quarter contain few household names, one prominent manager did surface: Ron Baron of the Baron Asset fund.
That fund's 14.8 percent gain, as well as the 11.8 percent increase achieved by the Baron Growth and Income fund, came in part from a heavy investment in companies that provide temporary workers for corporations and medical care concerns. In a period when corporations are reluctant to increase their payrolls even as the economy expands, the temporary-help business appears to have secured a permanent place among growth industries.
A similar permanence seems to have settled over equity mutual funds, which have not suffered a quarterly loss of more than 5 percent for more than five years. The gains have come, in part, from growing amounts of cash flowing into mutual funds.
But those trends are far from immutable. "Of course, it's better to have the strong mutual fund cash flow than not to have it," said Ms. Brown, the Prudential analyst. But in 1986, 1987 and in 1990, she noted, fund flows slowed down or turned negative only after the market did. "Some people believe that the money flowing in means stocks can only go up," she said. "I don't buy that."

The Empire State Building is known throughout the world. Don Dongpil Kim is not. But if all goes according to Mr. Kim's plan, he will be known in certain circles as Mr. Empire State Building. And the landmark tower he is marketing will have fewer "office for rent" signs.
Mr. Kim, 56, and his assistant, Christopher Lee, both Korean-born, are trying to persuade Korean and Korean-American businesses to move into the Empire State Building, which has had an unusually high vacancy rate in the last year -- up to 20 percent, or nearly double the 11 percent for other midtown office buildings, according to a real-estate brokerage firm. Part of that was attributable to the departure of a major tenant, Visiting Nurse Services of New York, which occupied an entire 60,000-square-foot floor. 
 Mr. Kim, who was born in Seoul and attended its university before singing with the Boston Pops and becoming a real estate salesman in Manhattan, recently returned from his first business trip to Korea, where he met with three dozen prospective tenants. "They were attorneys, accountants, exporters and professors," he said. "Everybody knew the Empire State Building."
He and Mr. Lee also advertise the building in Korea's newspapers and on cable television programs throughout the nation. And Mr. Lee is directing their pitch to more than 2,000 computer-selected lawyers, accountants and import-export businesses.
The men stress that the building, completed in 1931, is made up of offices that are smaller than the suites characteristic of newer towers. The design, they say, is well-suited to the small businesses favored by Koreans and Korean-Americans.
The Empire State Building's managing agent, Helmsley-Spear, is also banking on the strength of the Korean economy, which has been doubling in size nearly every 10 years since the Korean War, and the loosening of investment restrictions.
Until last year, Korean businesses could not deposit money abroad. Now they can deposit as much as $100 million, according to Euidong Chung, a consular official at the South Korean consulate in New York. Korean businesses can also invest up to $100 million in foreign real estate and other ventures, up from $50 million.
The area around the Empire State Building, especially between 24th and 39th Streets, has more than 400 Korean and Korean-American businesses.
"Thirty-second Street looks especially like Koreatown because so many people are in the jewelry, garment, watch, hat and wig businesses," said Jin Hyoung Seo, a leather importer and the president of the New York Society of Korean Businessmen. "The Empire State Building will look good to Koreans."
So far, Mr. Kim and Mr. Lee have leased only 3,100 square feet on the ground floor, to a school that trains Korean beauticians. "It will take some time to establish a network here and in Korea," Mr. Kim says. "But if all goes well, we may be able to lease 7,500 to 10,000 square feet a month."
Others, though, are skeptical. "Korea is a nice marketing theme," said Josh N. Kuriloff, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield, a real-estate services firm, "but I don't think the market is as deep as they think it is." ANTHONY RAMIREZ

Less Cash, Large Losses: Apple's Dwindling Dollars

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
WILL Apple Computer run out of cash soon? David Dreman, the chairman of Dreman Value Advisors in Jersey City, thinks so. "The company can't continue on as it has for another 60 or 90 days," he said. "The cash drain will cause a crisis. Or force an enormous scaling back or the sale of the company."
Many are more optimistic than Mr. Dreman. But while much of the talk about Apple these days focuses on how it could restore consumer confidence and reacquire its former glory, the nation's No. 3 computer maker may be facing a more mundane and immediate problem: an empty wallet. 
 For nervous Apple shareholders and bargain-hunting investors, the stakes may be great. Shares of Apple, which were as high as $35 earlier this year, closed Thursday at $24.125. If the product and leadership problems that propelled this drop turn into a cash crunch, the stock may fall further.
And there are many worries on that front: shrinking sales and cash reserves soaring costs and payment troubles.
Hobbled by an industry slowdown as well as its own troubles, Apple expects revenues for the quarter ended March 29 to fall below the $2.6 billion of the corresponding period last year. The company will not release its quarterly results until April 17, but Eric R. Lewis, an analyst for the International Data Corporation, estimated that the company would take in $2.5 billion, or even less, this quarter.
Apple's bank account is getting thinner, too. From $1.5 billion in cash just 15 months ago, Apple had just $1.1 billion on hand in December, and it may have even less now. "It used to have an unbelievable amount of cash," said Todd Bakar, an analyst for Hambrecht & Quist. If it becomes cash-strapped, Apple may sorely miss those flusher days as it seeks more revenue in a tough market. "It was a competitive advantage" to have a lot of cash, Mr. Bakar said.
Moreover, Apple said last month that it expected a record $700 million loss after taxes for the quarter just ended. Of course, the loss means smaller tax payments, and more than half of the charge involves inventory write-downs that do not cost the company cash out of pocket. But the balance of the $700 million, split equally between layoffs and other revamping charges and operating losses, do deplete cash.
Compounding these problems, in late March Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgraded to junk-bond status Apple's $304 million in long-term debt.
"The downgrading of public debt isn't going to help them with getting new low-cost money," noted Pieter Hartsook, publisher of the Hartsook Letter, a computer industry newsletter in Alameda, Calif.
Even more pressing for Apple is $400 million in bank debt owed by its subsidiaries in Japan and the Netherlands. A $187 million note, due in March, has not been paid, and a $203 million i.o.u. falls due this month.
These problems have put cash flow uppermost in the minds of some Apple analysts. "If they continue to bleed," said Scott Stagg, of the Delaware Bay Company, "there could be a liquidity problem."
But Apple is not sitting still. For one, it is renegotiating its debts, including the past-due $187 million note and the other foreign-subsidiary debt. "We are extremely encouraged about our ability to renegotiate," an Apple spokeswoman, Lynne Keast, said.
Even if lenders agree to extend the loans, the terms are likely to be more onerous, Mr. Lewis said. "The bigger problem," he added, "will be restrictions on credit itself, which could reduce Apple's flexibility."
To conserve cash, the company has also suspended its dividend -- saving $60 million a year -- and asks its suppliers to allow stretched-out payments. The latter strategy was begun by Michael Spindler, who was dismissed as chairman in February.
And Apple's new chairman, Gilbert F. Amelio, hopes to bolster sales with a policy opposite the price-cutting approach that got Mr. Spindler ousted and got Apple into cash-flow trouble. Mr. Amelio plans to develop machines so reliable that customers will be willing to pay premium prices for them.
For the last two months, however, Apple has also been selling products at very low prices to cut inventory and raise cash, said Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest. And the company is proceeding with layoffs and other revampings that will ultimately lower its expenses, even if the moves result in one-time charges.
Will Apple's efforts save it from a cash crunch? Some analysts agree with Mr. Dreman, but others feel that it is too early to answer. "I can't extrapolate from previous quarters," said Martha Toll Reed, of Standard & Poor's. "I find it hard to judge until I find their cash position this quarter."
David Wu, an analyst with the Chicago Corporation, is more firm in his opinion. He compares Apple's troubles to those of Dell Computer, which was able to reverse a few money-losing quarters in 1993 by liquidating discounted inventory. "Very fast, Apple will be cash-flow-positive," he predicted.
And Apple has other options, Mr. Brown believes. "If it's a sticky cash squeeze, they'll have to borrow," he said. "It's not insurmountable." The company also is asset-rich, and can raise cash by selling off some of those assets -- as it did just last week when it agreed to sell a laptop and circuit-board factory to SCI Systems Inc.
Given all these options, "It looks like they have a cash-management issue," Mr. Lewis said. "It doesn't look to me like they're running out of money."
But some are more worried. Craig Fit, an analyst for Moody's, cautioned that Apple might not be moving swiftly enough to align costs with revenues. "This company is in a stress scenario, rapidly changing," he said. If Apple's revenue assumptions fall short, "one can have less confidence that one restructuring charge is enough."

A Little Off the Top and the Bottom Helps Mid-Cap Stocks

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
CALL it this year's squeeze play. The winning streak that large companies have bragged about for the last two years is causing many portfolio managers to scour smaller stocks for better values. At the same time, managers of small-stock funds who are being flooded with fresh cash have been reaching up to larger stocks.
Basking in this attention from above and below are the stocks squarely in the middle, known as mid-caps. Stocks like Olsten and Charles Schwab have jumped since January, and the Standard & Poor's 400 Midcap Index has risen 6.53 percent this year, slightly outperforming the large-cap S.& P. 500. 
 Analysts said the squeeze pushing more money into mid-caps will probably continue all year and help drive up their prices, but it could end abruptly. If investors become nervous about the economy -- and the market -- they will seek the stability of larger stocks.
Although the mid-caps are not as cheap as the smallest stocks, several portfolio managers said they remain a good buy. Claudia E. Mott, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York, said mid-caps are trading at the same price-earnings ratio as large stocks, about 15 times the per-share earnings forecasted for this year, despite their superior growth prospects. This year, mid-caps are expected to achieve earnings growth of 17 percent, compared with 13 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500.
Mid-caps have also proved to be good investments over the long haul, noted Brian W. H. Berghuis, who manages the T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Growth Fund in Baltimore. Their returns are less than half of a percentage point below those of small stocks, gaining an average of 11 percent a year since 1926, but with much less risk. Unlike small companies, which are usually fledgling outfits that may depend on a single product or service, mid-caps are typically established businesses.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes a mid-cap, but portfolio managers tend to describe them as having market capitalizations of $1 billion to $5 billion.
Among the managers buying them is Patrick S. Adams, who runs the Founders Blue Chip and Balanced funds in Denver. He has been finding large-company stocks like Merck or Coca-Cola too expensive for his taste. "I think the mid-cap sector looks much more appealing," he said.
Mr. Adams points to the Foster Wheeler Corporation, an engineering and construction company. Capitalizing on the building boom in Asia and other emerging markets, the company earned $28.5 million on sales of $3.1 billion last year. The stock is selling at 18 times its estimated 1996 earnings, the same commanded by General Electric, which is in similar businesses. But Foster Wheeler is expected to grow faster. Wall Street projects earnings growth of 15 percent annually over the next five years, compared with 12 percent for G.E., according to Zacks Investment Research.
John W. Ballen, the manager of the small-cap MFS Emerging Growth Fund, likes mid-caps, but for a different reason. "A lot of new money in the market has gone into mid-caps rather than small-caps because it's easier to put that money to use," he said. Because funds generally have limits on how much of one company they can own, fund managers can invest big sums in larger companies more easily than in smaller companies. It is also easier for a manager to invest $50 million in one or two larger stocks than in five smaller ones.
While Mr. Ballen thinks the stocks of smaller companies are cheaper, he has bought some mid-caps that offer strong earnings growth. Office Depot is a fast-growing chain of office products superstores that has been selling supplies to the growing legions of small businesses. The company is reporting double-digit gains in sales and earnings, and made $132 million on sales of $5.3 billion last year. The stock is selling at 18 times forecasted earnings, although the company is expected to increase its profits by more than 25 percent annually over the next five years.
Gary Pilgrim, the manager of the small-cap PBHG Growth Fund in Wayne, Pa., likes the Cognex Corporation, which has a market capitalization of $1 billion. The company makes machine vision systems that industrial companies use to spot product defects.
Though the company originally sold its systems mostly to semiconductor manufacturers (and the stock was beaten down recently along with semiconductor stocks), it now sells to other businesses, including pharmaceutical and consumer electronic companies. "They seem to have a very dominant position," Mr. Pilgrim said.
Mr. Berghuis of T. Rowe Price is less interested in snagging highflying stocks than catching what he describes as "plodders," companies that may not generate a lot of excitement but that have plenty of cash flow that they use to make smart acquisitions. One such outfit is Quorum Health Group, a hospital management chain that has been buying two or three hospitals a year. Quorum, which earned $60 million in the last 12 months on sales of nearly $1 billion, is trading at only 19 times forecasted earnings. Profits are expected to grow 19 percent a year.
FOR managers who concentrate on buying the least expensive stocks, there are plenty of opportunities in mid-caps, according to Robert D'Alelio, a portfolio manager who looks for cheap small-company stocks for Putnam Investments in Boston. Unlike large-company stocks that become bargains when investors flee after some disappointment, smaller equities tend to suffer more from Wall Street's neglect than its wrath, he said. "There is an element of inefficiency here," he said.
Among the midsize companies that Mr. D'Alelio thinks are being ignored is Universal Foods, a Milwaukee company that went public 15 years ago. With $800 million in revenue, the company specializes in making colors and flavors for the big food companies. The stock is selling at 16 times this year's forecasted earnings. It is inexpensive because Wall Street has been slow to recognize the company's shift from frozen french fries to a more profitable enterprise.

Major 'Head-Rearranging' Caps Board 3's Fractious Year

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
While less bloody than the purging of the Romanovs, a long expected shake-up at Community Board 3 was announced last week as the elected officials who control appointments to the tempestuous board dropped a half-dozen members.
Among those who were removed was the chairman, Albert Fabozzi, who was hit in the face with a cake last fall during a meeting of the notoriously unruly and faction-ridden board, perhaps the city's most fractious. Neither Councilman Antonio Pagan nor Borough President Ruth W. Messinger chose to reappoint Mr. Fabozzi to a third term. Council members recommend names for half the board's 50 slots; the borough president has the final say on all appointments. 
 Mr. Fabozzi, who was elected chairman after his predecessor was dumped by Ms. Messinger last May, said he believed that his stubborn independence over issues like a local needle exchange prompted his removal. Mr. Pagan supported the program; Mr. Fabozzi was against it.
Mr. Pagan said he chose not to reappoint Mr. Fabozzi in an effort to rein in the board, which represents the heterogeneous and troubled Lower East Side. While the neighborhood is wracked by AIDS and drug addiction, housing is its most divisive issue, specifically how to develop nearly 500 city-owned sites.
Another Pagan appointee, Robert A. Strong, said he believed that he was dropped from the board because of his comments about the Councilman's leadership in a recent article in Crain's New York Business magazine. "I put my foot in my mouth by criticizing Antonio," said Mr. Strong, who headed the board's economic development committee.
Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed dropped three sitting members, including the secretary, Adam Silvera, and a 24-year board veteran, Richard Ropiak. "C.B. 3 needs monumental head-rearranging," Ms. Freed explained. "I'm interested in people who are logical, nonpolitical and understand the need to compromise."
Several board insiders, however, maintain that like Mr. Pagan, Ms. Freed dropped members who did not vote to her liking. Ms. Freed agrees that she was angry at Mr. Ropiak for not supporting a proposed men's shelter on the Bowery.
Most members believe that when the dust settles, they will be left with the same querulous monster. "The political divisions on this board are just too great," a member, Lisa Ramaci, said."I think we'll always be the fractious brat board of Manhattan." ANDREW JACOBS

TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 
One Giant Buys Another
In the logic of the Republican Congress, fewer competitors result in more competition, so long as the giants are well muscled. Chalk up another victory, then, for competition: SBC Communications, the former Southwestern Bell, said it would acquire Pacific Telesis for $17 billion, creating the nation's second-largest phone company after AT&T. More than 30 million customers from Texas to the West Coast will be served by the new company, as well as 80 million potential customers in a nationwide cellular market. The deal assures that what had been two adjacent regional phone companies will not make inroads on each other's home base.
 
INSURANCE
 
Aetna to Buy U.S. Healthcare
In a sign of just how big a challenge managed care represents to established medical insurance plans, Aetna Life and Casualty agreed to pay $8.8 billion for U.S. Healthcare, which is known for its tough cost controls on doctors and hospitals. The resulting company will provide various types of health insurance to 1 in 12 Americans.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Accelerating Again
For the second month in a row, the Labor Department reported that more jobs were created than had been anticipated, and that increase came despite the 17-day strike at General Motors. The new jobs, though far fewer than those created in February, sent the bond market stumbling. Last month's report hammered bonds and then brought a 171-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average; this month's impact was more muted, with the stock markets closed for Good Friday. In another sign that the economy might be picking up steam, the index of leading indicators soared 1.3 percent in February, the biggest increase in years.
 
THE AUTO INDUSTRY
 
As Talks Near, Hard Line by Union Leaders
Factoring in the Big Three auto makers' $30 billion in cash reserves and their determination to cut costs, the United Automobile Workers union made clear that concessions and compromise are not what it has in mind as it prepares for summer negotiations on new national contracts. The president of the U.A.W., Stephen Yokich, and other union officials said they would press for more hiring to reduce unwanted overtime and try to curb the auto makers' ability to turn to nonunion suppliers for parts.
 
COMPUTERS
 
Hold That Line!
Under its new chief executive, Gilbert F. Amelio, Apple Computer may be planning to step aside from the personal computer industry's price wars and to try to rebuild its cachet and regain the attendant higher prices it has historically commanded, internal company documents suggest. Because of its higher research and development costs, Apple is ill situated to compete head on with the makers of Windows PC's.
 
AGE DISCRIMINATION
 
High Court Broadens a Law
Workers who are replaced by younger people -- even if the replacement workers are older than 40 -- may be entitled to sue their employers, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously, even though the Federal law specifies that such complaints have merit only if the replacement workers are younger than 40.
 
WATCHDOGS
 
A Corporate Voice At Investors' Group
Members of the Council of Institutional Investors, a leader in the shareholder rights movement, elected as co-chairman Martin A. Coyle, executive vice president and general counsel of TRW Inc. Union members of the council had opposed having one of the top three posts filled by a corporate representative.
 
TRADE BARRIERS
 
Mexico Closes Some Doors
After months of opening its economy to outsiders, Mexican legislators, backed by labor unions, have demanded that foreign companies be prohibited from managing pension funds that will be created next year as part of broad changes in Mexico's social security system. The Mexicans fear that outsiders would be inclined to invest the pension money outside of Mexico.
 
ROLLOUTS
 
Giant Step at AT&T
In the biggest initial stock offering in history, AT&T spun off its equipment subsidiary, which includes Bell Laboratories, under the name Lucent. Shares were offered at $27 each and closed the first day of trading up 13 percent. The initial offering raised about $3 billion, which will be used to pay debt; AT&T will spin off the balance of the shares to its shareholders by year-end.
 
CLASS ACTIONS
 
Judge Blocks Settlement by Drug Makers
A Federal district judge threw out an agreement by 15 drug makers to pay $409 million to settle a class action that contends they conspired to fix prices charged to pharmacies. The retailers contend that drug makers offered such steep discounts to hospitals and health maintenance organizations that retail pharmacies could not compete. Federal District Judge Charles P. Kocoras in Chicago ruled that the retailers had presented enough evidence to warrant a trial on the complaint.

GRAPHIC: Photos: PASSAGES -- 'With Wings Like Eagles' -- With handshakes, smiles, charm and a good deal of political muscle, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown waged a war on two fronts, against the Republican movement in Congress to disband the Commerce Department, and against his counterparts elsewhere in the Federal Government who did not see their mission as the creation and preservation of American jobs through its foreign relations. To some critics of this view, Mr. Brown was a mere mercantilist, putting trade policy above all else. But the Secretary, as President Clinton said on Wednesday, was a main of great faith, recalling Mr. Brown's favorite passage from Scripture, Isaiah 40: "They who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint." How that faith will resonate through Government policy remains to be seen: lost with Mr. Brown in the plane crash in Croatia last week were an Assistant Secretary, a deputy assistant secretary and at least seven other members of the Commerce staff. No successor to Mr Brown has been named. (Agence France-Presse): MARKETING -- Image Transplant for Pepsi -- Seeking a unified image for its cola overseas, Pepsi-Cola switched to an all-blue can outside the United States and, in a $500 million marketing blitz, brought in celebrities, mounted billboard campaigns -- including a sign in London's Piccadilly Circus -- and had a Concorde jetliner painted its colors. Aviation experts noted that the Concorde could reach its normal supersonic cruising speed only with its white coat, needed to disperse the heat generated at high speeds. (Associated Press)

HEADLINE: Dangerous Abstractions

BYLINE: By John Allen Paulo; Jogn Allen Paulo, a professor of mathematics at Temple University, is the author of "A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper."

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
At first glance, a Ph. D. in mathematics, the subject often called the handmaiden of science and engineering, seems an odd credential for a Luddite. Yet Theodore J. Kaczynski, the suspected Unabomber, received such a degree from the University of Michigan in 1962. What are we to make of this?
Certainly Mr. Kaczynski's arrest (coming, coincidentally, just before Mathematics Awareness Week) does not enhance the public image of mathematicians. Indeed, it furthers some of the worst stereotypes. Believe it or not, most of my colleagues are humorous, not asocial loners. The only time most use the phrase "blow up" is when they consider division by zero. Still, is Mr. Kaczynski's background as anomalous as it appears? 
 Several aspects of mathematics suggest that it isn't. The subject and its subdisciplines are axiomatic -- that is, they are based on a few fundamental assumptions from which all else follows logically. Thus, mathematicians often view themselves as "radical" thinkers in the literal sense of the word: They get to the root of the matter.
In a similar sense, the Unabomber's manifesto, which shows a mathematician's meticulous attention to detail, has the feel of an extended proof based on a few presuppositions about what constitutes the good life -- personal control, self-reliance, minimal environmental impact. From these elements he attempts to derive a radical alternative theory of society -- a non-Euclidean approach, if you will, to our social problems.
Another obvious characteristic of mathematics is its abstractness; and the subdiscipline in which Mr. Kaczynski got his degree, complex analysis, is abstract in the extreme. (In fact, complex analysis has little to do with the common meanings of either word. Analysis is the branch of mathematics that grew out of calculus, and complex refers to complex numbers, a generalization of our number system that accommodates so-called imaginary numbers.)
The ability to think abstractly is a precious one too often absent from public debate. (England's panic over mad cow disease is fueled by its citizens' failure to calmly consider the slim chances of contracting the disease.) Nevertheless, abstract thinking has been associated with various pathologies, and it is easy to see how one trained in such reasoning and in thrall to an ideal could come to justify murderous acts as a nebulous "good."
Mathematics is also beautiful, but its esthetic -- minimalist, austere -- can blind one to the messiness and contingencies of real life. To use mathematical principles to devise a grand socio-economic theory, one must simplify. In doing so, mathematicians can forget that their mathematical or economic model is not the real world.
Reality, like the perfectly ordinary woman of Virginia Woolf's essay "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown," is infinitely complex and impossible to capture completely in a model. Thus, it is hardly surprising that, for all the Government's high-tech surveillance and analysis, the real break in the case came out of the murky realm of family dynamics.
Of course, Mr. Kaczynski may not be the Unabomber. If so, my speculations are but another example of a mathematician's failure to produce a model that works in the real world.

HEADLINE: The World;
Donors of Foreign Aid Have Second Thoughts

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso

 BODY:
THE 1990's have proven a grim time for foreign aid as we know it -- the grants and loans that are the traditional form of international development assistance. Everywhere these days, it seems, support for such aid is dwindling, and once-generous donors are focusing their energies inward.
It hasn't helped, of course, that three decades of foreign development assistance in the third world has failed to lift the poorest of the poor in Africa and Asia much beyond where they have always been. 
 Alarmed by the downward spiral of their budgets, and chastened by the lack of results, many of the world's leading aid agencies have begun the most serious rethinking of their efforts since the boom days of the development aid business began in the 1960's.
 
 
 
Two New Approaches
 Most dramatically, they are beginning to suggest something that once was heard only from outright enemies of foreign aid: that big cash outlays to central governments may only pave the way to corruption.
Part of the reason for this shift is competition from another approach to development altogether. The United States has moved far from the original notion of shipping money to governments (in competition with Moscow) so they could finance showpiece projects. For a decade and a half now, budget-conscious officials in Washington have been putting far more emphasis on revising trade rules and promoting direct investmant by American companies.
Increasingly, direct grants and loans are coming from other countries, such as Japan and Germany, or from pooled sources like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank (often with strings attached). And in those quarters, illusions of quickly transforming an entire country's economy from the top down through aid have faded.
At the same time, a tendency to lend money for big projects -- visible things like bridges and dams, which often prove ruinous even though they mean fat supply contracts for companies in the donor countries -- is giving way to a new emphasis on projects to improve the welfare of ordinary people.
In the future, lenders see themselves spending more on skill-building projects, like professional training programs and basic education. The World Bank and its wing, the International Finance Corporation, for example, are lending money and training people to create local credit unions and small businesses.
One of the most frequently heard buzzwords in this emerging discussion is "capacity building." The underlying philosophy is that development has been held back in the world's poorest countries by a lack of qualified local officials and entrepreneurs. Implicit in this change, too, is the idea that working through central governments is a recipe for waste.
Many donors say they want to encourage decentralization and reinforce democratic practices, to which most lenders have paid only lip service in the past.
"For too long development cooperation has focused on the economy and not on the polity," said James Gustave Speth, administrator of the United Nations Development Program, which has just launched a $25 billion development program for Africa that is is driven by a "capacity-building" ethic. "Without a functioning political system and effective governance, the best-laid economic plans are not going to succeed."
 
 
 
Fattening the Elites
 Many critics of international development assistance are far from certain that this shift will make aid "work" in the future. But what is certain, they say, is that the approaches of the past have mostly failed.
In a research paper published last fall, Peter Boone, a professor at the London School of Economics, concluded that development assistance had fattened political elites and spawned a thriving global community of non-governmental organizations, but had done little to improve living standards in poor countries. "In terms of human development, I looked at things like primary school enrollment, infant mortality and life expectancy in 97 countries between 1970 and 1990, and there was no correlation between these sorts of indicators and development assistance," Mr. Boone said.
The study also compared French-speaking West Africa with its English-speaking neighbors. Although the Francophone countries have consistently enjoyed higher levels of foreign support, Mr. Boone's study indicates that they have little to show for it.
What most separates countries that lift living standards of the poor and those that don't, Mr. Boone concludes, is not the amount of funds, but rather the dedication of third-world governments to resolving basic quality of life issues. "If you look at Chile, they reduced infant mortality by 70 percent because they decided they were going to make that their priority," Mr. Boone said. "A leftist government in Kerala state in India did the same thing."
 
 
 
A Source of Anger
 In the developing world, calls to bypass central governments and impose closer scrutiny on the use of aid funds have already brought one unexpected type of response: anger at the perceived cynicism in how the West has used development monies in the past for the good of companies and privately-run groups known as non-governmental organizations (like the Red Cross or Church World Services) back home.
"Experience in many places suggests that there are many who are jumping on the N.G.O. bandwagon for reasons that have nothing to do with development as such," said Kwesi Botchway, a former Ghanaian minister of finance who spoke at a major international conference on development in Maastricht, Holland in November. "Some promote narrow sectarian interests even as they purport to advance popular aspirations. Some see N.G.O.'s as plain business."
Other advocates of profound reforms in foreign aid see a self-interested West as the root of many past failures as well. "A lot of the aid given in the 70's and 80's was fueled by cold war competition or by the ambitions of the French," said Mats Karlssen, Sweden's Under Secretary of State. "If you really wanted to make an impact on things like child mortality or illiteracy, I could have told you from the beginning that that kind of aid would not have any impact." He also said donors shouldn't continually impose their own thinking about development, and instead need "stronger policies from the borrowers themselves."
Where these two schools of thought come together is in the need for foreign donors to give greater encouragement to countries where real democratization is taking place -- places. Mr. Boone said, where "the poor are more empowered," and where "this induces governments to provide more basic services."

HEADLINE: The Freedom to Marry

 BODY:
Chances are that Americans will look back 30 years from now and wonder what all the fuss was about. At the moment, however, the question of opening the institution of marriage to homosexuals is the subject of an emotional national debate taking place at family dinner tables, state legislatures and in the press.
A "marriage protection" rally in Des Moines on the eve of the Iowa Republican caucuses drew predictable support from Patrick Buchanan in person, but also written support from the party's presumptive nominee, Senator Bob Dole. Opponents of same-sex marriages invoke religious tradition and family values. Allowing same-sex couples to marry, they assert, would somehow diminish the meaning of marriage for heterosexuals. These arguments, uncomfortably similar to those raised in resistance to repealing miscegenation laws a few decades ago, cannot obscure the entrenched anti-gay bigotry underlying much of the public dialogue. Nor can it disguise the fundamental unfairness of government denying a whole class of citizens the important benefits that flow from civil marriages. 
 What brings the issue to the fore is the likelihood that a court case in Hawaii will soon lead to that state's legal recognition of same-sex marriages. In 1993, Hawaii's top court ruled -- not unreasonably -- that the state's refusal to marry same-sex couples violated Hawaii's constitutional guarantee of equal protection. Unlike its Federal counterpart, Hawaii's Constitution explicitly prohibits discrimination based on sex. The state now has the burden of showing in a trial court proceeding that it has a "compelling interest" in perpetuating the state ban on same-sex unions -- an appropriately high hurdle that experts predict the state will be unable to meet.
Indeed, if the state has a "compelling interest" here, it is to foster stable, long-term relationships and to clarify important legal and economic issues. Allowing marriage by same-sex couples would surely do that on matters of joint property, inheritance, insurance coverage and other important household business. Contrary to rhetoric on the other side, this is the real family values issue.
Unhappy with the direction of the court ruling, the Hawaiian Legislature passed a new law asserting that marriage is "intended for the propagation of the human race by man-woman units." But that rationale collapses under the reality that many heterosexual couples are infertile, choose not to have children or simply marry past childbearing age. On the other hand, many gay and lesbian couples do end up raising children. In other contexts, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that civil marriage rights do not flow from procreation but from the commitment and choice of couples.
Meanwhile, opponents led by religious fundamentalists have mounted a pre-emptive campaign aimed at getting other states to enact laws to prevent recognition of same-sex marriages performed in Hawaii. Last week, Georgia became the fourth state to enact such a law. Though similar measures have failed in 12 states, battles still rage in 15 others. This could create an absurd, demeaning and unconstitutional situation where marriages lawful in one state would suddenly be void when a couple crossed state lines. The backlash against same-sex marriages is driven by social intolerance, but it also poses an ominous challenge to the nation's Federal system of laws, and the basic requirement in the U.S. Constitution that states give "full faith and credit" to the legal actions taken by other states.

The Cost of Luxury Could Blow Sky-High

BYLINE: By JON E. HILSENRATH; Jon E. Hilsenrath is a Knight-Bagehot Fellow in economics and business journalism at Columbia.

 BODY:
There is a dirty word in real estate markets that probably won't be uttered by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani or by the Yankees owner George Steinbrenner in the months ahead, as the terms of a new baseball stadium are negotiated. The word is overbuilding.
With his remarks last week about building a new stadium for the Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan, Giuliani joined a legion of municipal officials nationwide who have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to build lavish new stadiums for their teams. 
 Nearly $7 billion has been committed or spent in the last three years to build or renovate more than 30 major sports facilities across the country, according to Marc Ganis, the owner of SportsCorp, a Chicago-based sports consulting firm. And that does not include the millions more committed to build smaller facilities in cities like Newark, which announced last week it plans to build a 6,000-seat stadium downtown to revive minor league baseball in the city.
One of the secret ingredients in almost all of these deals is the luxury box. Each of these plush suites produces five- and six-figure revenue streams that help finance the stadiums. They also produce rich rewards for the owners who oversee them.
The proposed Manhattan facility would include 120 to 220 luxury boxes, compared with the paltry 19 boxes in 73-year-old Yankee Stadium, which is near the major league low.
But sports business professionals quietly say the industry might be going through a period of overbuilding. They say there is a limit to the amount of money that businesses are willing to spend to entertain clients and executives in suites that loom over playing fields.
"Companies are not going to double their sky-box budgets," said Allen Sanderson, a University of Chicago economist who also teaches sports business. "I think overbuilding is a legitimate risk."
These markets, after all, are subject to outside shocks. Consider, for example, the luxury-box business in Dallas. Today, the Dallas Cowboys' owner, Jerry Jones, wields 360 luxury suites at Texas Stadium, the most in professional sports. They helped generate $37.3 million in stadium revenues in 1994.
But luxury suites were not always a boon to the Cowboys. In 1989, when Jones bought the team, the Texas economy was in a deep recession, the team was 3-13 and the Cowboys were having trouble making money on those deluxe boxes. Tex Schramm, formerly the general manager and president, had built 108 new suites in 1985. By 1989, 102 of them were still unsold and many could not be leased, said George Hays, vice president of marketing for the Cowboys. Sales improved only as the economy and the Cowboys did.
What happens when the economy slows? Will corporations be able to justify $250,000 suites for football games? What happens if labor-management strife continues? Last year, several baseball teams saw longstanding suite residents cancel their subscriptions when the strike delayed the start of the season.
Very often, taxpayers will get hurt if municipalities and teams over-build. Stadium expansions are often publicly financed and suite revenues help make payments on the debt needed to pay for the construction. Furthermore, in some places, like St. Louis, teams have been guaranteed revenue from the suites.
"I don't think with luxury suites, it's an if-you-build-it-they-will-come scenario," said Robert Caporale, a partner in Glan Plan Inc., a Boston-based investment banking and consulting firm. His firm was an adviser in the recent construction of the new Fleet Center in Boston. Caporale said a great deal of planning and marketing went into the construction of the 104 suites in the Fleet Center. But he worries that in many other cities, suites are being constructed at great cost and in great haste, but with little foresight.
"In many of these communities, nothing is happening on the planning side," he said. "Who's going to buy them? Who's going to sell them?"
Consider the rapid expansion under way at the Oakland-Alameda County Stadium in California, home of football's Raiders and baseball's Athletics. It is in the process of expanding its luxury suites from the 45 currently available to 140 for the next football season, an increase of 311 percent.
Ezra Rapport, Oakland's deputy city manager who is involved in marketing the suites, said the expansion is a "roller-coaster ride." He added, "Everything we do is on a really tight schedule."
And now, in the midst of that rapid expansion, voters across the bay in San Francisco have approved plans for the construction of a privately financed stadium for the baseball Giants. "It's not just the number of new facilities, it's how closely together they are being built," said SportsCorp's Ganis.
In the Baltimore-Washington area, a basketball and hockey arena is being constructed in downtown Washington. A
new football stadium for the Redskins is planned for Maryland. And Washington has long sought a baseball team. When the Browns move to Baltimore and become the Ravens, the Baltimore-Washington area could have close to 600 sky boxes for rent. That dwarfs the 328 luxury suites available in the New York market, an area with more teams, more events annually and a much larger business community.
"Where are all of the corporations going to come from?" asked Jeff Turner of Brailsford Associates, a Washington-based sports consulting firm. Are there enough lobbyists in Washington to fill all of these suites? Perhaps.
Bill Dorsey, executive director of the Association of Luxury Suite Directors, acknowledges that he and others are concerned about overbuilding in some markets. "There's been a lot of talk about saturation, and what the market will bear," Dorsey said. His association has grown from 13 members six years ago to 250 members today.
So far, the classic signs of overbuilding have not emerged. The most important indicator of overbuilding in real estate markets is the vacancy rate in office buildings. During the last recession, vacancy rates were more than 30 percent in some parts of Texas, and more than 20 percent in parts of California. But Dorsey said luxury suites are a healthy 90-95 percent full nationwide.
Another important indicator is leasing rates. When markets become saturated, it becomes more difficult for developers to raise rental prices. But Dorsey said rental prices have generally been rising, as the quality of the suites also rises. Lease rates range from $15,000 in cities like Green Bay, Wis., to $250,000 in Toronto and Boston, according to Dorsey.
But overbuilding happens when markets are booming.
Dorsey said he worries about places like Tampa, which is in the midst of a rapid expansion in luxury suites. In the fall, the Tampa Bay Lightning hockey team will move to a new arena with 72 additional suites. Baseball's expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays will occupy the Thunderdome with more than 70 new luxury suites. The N.F.L. Buccaneers house 57 suites at Tampa Stadium, and ownership is looking for more.
"Corporations, like individuals, just have so many dollars to go around," said Larry Silver, a spokesman for Raymond James & Associates, a Tampa-based brokerage firm. He said Raymond James has begun splitting time in luxury boxes with other firms. "This community is stretched, like a lot of communities," he said.
"The market is very competitive," said Charlotte Martin, manager of corporate sales and marketing for the Lightning, acknowledging that many local companies are complaining that they are "really strapped."
To date, the Lightning has leased 54 of 72 suites at the Ice Palace, which is scheduled to open in October. Can the Buccaneers fill the suites if ownership gets the stadium it is looking for?
"I don't know if they're going to sell them," Martin said.
"You just can't bleed a stone," Silver said.

How to Elect a President: The Campaign Strategy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
WHEN Ronald H. Brown died in a plane crash in Croatia last week, the nation lost an energetic and successful commerce secretary -- a man who crisscrossed the globe with American business executives, arm-twisting foreign governments to buy anything stamped "Made in U.S.A." But for President Clinton the loss was particularly acute: He called Mr. Brown the single most important strategist in the 1992 Presidential campaign.
His talent was honing a message, reducing it to its essence. Recently Mr. Brown worried in private meetings that that the current re-election campaign -- which he could not formally join because of investigations into his financial dealings -- still lacked energy, a sharp focus, a clear message, a tactical plan. 
 A confidential memo he sent to Democratic leaders four years ago, before Bill Clinton emerged as the party's nominee, provides an intriguing insight into the workings of Ron Brown's political mind. As the following excerpts suggest, it is also filled with advice that both President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole might consider in 1996, as well as a few passages that may make the White House wonder if it is now vulnerable to similar charges to the ones it leveled at George Bush.
Mr. Brown, who was then the Democratic National Chairman, suggested belittling Mr. Bush's argument that his foreign policy focused on creating jobs at home. Just the week before the memo was written, Mr. Bush had taken a bickering gang of auto executives to Tokyo in a trip that turned out to be politically damaging. As Commerce Secretary, Mr. Brown turned similar trips into a political asset. To Mr. Brown, who seemed to light up whenever conversation turned to election strategy, that was the kind of political irony that made Washington interesting. DAVID E. SANGER

Re: Some Strategic Thoughts About the Message That Helps Bring About George Bush's Defeat
 
George Bush has suffered the biggest one-year collapse of approval ratings of any President in history. George Bush has presided over the lowest growth Presidency of the postwar period. . . . However, we should have no illusions. Defeating a sitting President, especially one who has himself "won" a war, is a difficult challenge indeed.
 
What We Have to Do in 1992
Identify and understand the concerns of the voters who are open to a Democratic appeal. No matter what we say or do Barbara Bush and about 40 percent of the country will vote Republican. Our message focus is on the remaining 60 percent: both ticket-splitting, "persuadable" voters as well as the Democratic base -- voters who also need to be "asked" and mobilized.
Fortunately from a message perspective, the country's economic and domestic social problems are so pervasive that the level of agreement between ticket-splitters and Democratic base voters is the highest it has been in decades.
Virtually all (more than 95 percent) of these potential supporters -- no matter what race, gender or income/employment status -- think of themselves as middle class. Frankly, the middle-class tax cut has more value to use as a "strengthening chord" to expand our middle-class identification than it does as an element of Democratic economics, where it also helps.
Every instance where Bush sounds defensive (e.g. "I really do have a domestic agenda; I really do know the pain that ordinary Americans, and especially the unemployed who have exhausted benefits, are feeling") is an example of forcing BUSH into the Democratic message framework. By doing such, in effect, we are forcing the theme of "I'm not who the Democrats say I am" into the G.O.P. Message Structure. . . .
 
Stick to a unified criticism of Bush's leadership failures. I believe, on the basis of substantial survey evidence as well as my own travels across the country, that by working together we have already established three things:
 
1. Bush is way too concerned with foreign policy at the sacrifice of his domestic and economic responsibilities to the American people. In effect, his foreign policy "strength" is being made into a weakness. Our success is measured by the amount of effort they are spending trying to counter this theme with their recent "foreign policy is really an economic and domestic jobs-creating effort" message.
 
2. The elitist George (Herbert Walker) Bush favors the rich and powerful special interests and just doesn't understand what the lives and problems of ordinary Americans are like now. His inaction is a natural consequence of his just not "getting it."
 
3. Most of what Bush is saying and doing is POLITICAL, designed to halt his support hemorrhage and snare votes in the short term. It is all "photo ops" expressing a superficial concern by someone who is dodging the real changes that need to be made -- changes that will hit his pals and his interests hard if they are ever to help the ordinary American.
 
WE MUST KEEP POUNDING AWAY AT SEVERAL MORE THINGS.
A. What is wrong with the country is exactly what is wrong with George Bush's leadership. He and his Administration are drifting, maybe with his heart in the right place but WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO GET THE JOB DONE, WITH PLENTY OF TALK BUT NO FOLLOW THROUGH. Do they understand that "the buck stops here" is the core of the modern Presidency? ...
B. Trickle-down, supply-side economics is making us a second-class economic power and is killing the middle class. But BUSH DOESN'T KNOW IT. HE IS INCAPABLE OF CHANGE. It is the end of a Republican JUNK-BOND VALUES era, and they are OUT OF IDEAS, OUT OF GAS, OUT OF LUCK, and soon to be OUT OF OFFICE.
Answer immediately and ferociously every G.O.P. slur. When they use "wedge issues," racial code words and "exotic" social value charges, we must denounce these tactics as the un-American politics of demagoguery. This garbage trivializes a fundamental decision time in our country's history and will prevent us for another four or more years from confronting our real challenges. LAY THESE GROSS G.O.P. tactics at Bush's door.
 
OUR MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE TASK
Put forth a CLEAR, ALTERNATIVE, AFFIRMATIVE, POLICY AGENDA and DIRECTION for our country's central challenges AND FIGHT FOR IT. . . .
 
We Democrats need to speak frankly and often about personal responsibility, knowing right from wrong and being prepared to punish wrong, loving our country and the American ideal, hard work, and caring about those who need help (the safety net has been shredded).
Policies that Are Important to Our Future Which Strain the Republican Presidential Coalition
* pro-choice
* environment
* children and poverty
* anti-racism
* fair trade and job exports
I believe that anti-incumbency is centrally tied to the appearance of lots of Washington time and work on things voters see as marginal to their lives in this time of economic threat. If we keep our eyes on the prize and approach the major, basic issues with common-sense approaches, then we will, in 1992, elect a larger Congressional majority -- as well as a Democratic President.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends;
And Now, the Kinder, Gentler Merger

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
PACIFIC TELESIS and SBC Communications made a bit of history last week -- and not just because they became the first of the Baby Bells to grow up and get married. In announcing their $17 billion merger, the two regional Bell telephone companies promised not to dismiss any workers.
In fact, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the plain-spoken chairman of SBC (originally Southwestern Bell), said the deal would generate 1,000 new jobs in California, where SBC plans to offer long-distance telephone service. "The union of these companies is not about layoffs," Mr. Whitacre declared. 
 In this decade of downsizing, such a pledge sounds almost heretical. By promoting the merger as a job creator rather than a job destroyer, Mr. Whitacre is flouting the conventional wisdom on Wall Street about how to sell such deals to shareholders. But he feels that SBC's broader horizons will enrich its 100,000 workers -- everyone from cable splicers to senior executives -- bringing both a robust share price and swift government approval of its deal.
To many industry experts, Mr. Whitacre's rhetoric is the latest evidence that downsizing is itself being downsized, at least up to a point. In addition to SBC, several other companies have either soft-pedaled the role of layoffs in their new corporate combinations, or held up their commitment to job security as a virtue in announcing mergers.
For that, rank-and-file workers can probably thank the odd combination of a politician and the nation's largest phone company. In January, AT&T said it would slash 40,000 jobs, one of the biggest corporate bloodlettings ever. Patrick J. Buchanan promptly made downsizing, and the anxiety it causes, a theme of his Presidential campaign.
With his harsh criticism of AT&T's top executives, Mr. Buchanan managed to turn the company's layoffs -- which it had blandly justified as a response to technological change -- into a symbol of corporate America's ruthless pursuit of profits over the welfare of the worker. Newsweek even placed AT&T's chairman, Robert E. Allen, in a police lineup of chief executives on its cover, under the headline "Corporate Killers."
"AT&T has had to face withering criticism," said John Challenger, vice president of Challenger, Grey & Christmas, a Chicago "outplacement" firm, which helps companies find jobs for employees who have been laid off. "We're beginning to see some authentic efforts to redress the loss of good will that has come from downsizing."
 
Reading Political Tea Leaves
But if these companies are astutely reading the political winds -- and backing it up with a real commitment to saving jobs -- they may not be pursuing the soundest business course. The economic pressures that drive corporate downsizing have not gone away. Indeed, few companies face the triple whammy of global competition, technological change and demand for stock performance more keenly than the Baby Bells. Given that, some industry experts wonder if all the talk about jobs is merely a public-relations ploy.
SBC is not the only company that has tried to turn the ambient fear over layoffs to its advantage. First Bank recently used the threat of downsizing as ammunition in its takeover battle for a big Los Angeles bank, First Interstate. Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, had mounted a rival bid for the bank, contending that it could extract huge savings by shutting down 400 neighboring branches and dismissing the employees.
So First Bank, which is based in faraway Minneapolis, took out full-page ads in California newspapers to dramatize its more benign intentions. The bank said it would reduce only 6,000 positions, while it claimed that Wells Fargo would whack 10,000 jobs. In case the arithmetic didn't make the point, the ads carried a headline warning: "It's not a fire, flood, or an earthquake. But it could be a disaster for California." In the end, First Bank lost out to Wells Fargo's richer bid.
After weeks of drubbing from Mr. Buchanan and other critics, AT&T has tried to put a human face on its financial engineering. In a recent Newsweek column responding to the magazine's cover story, Mr. Allen wrote about the personal anguish he suffered in ordering the cutbacks. The company also recently published full-page ads in The New York Times and other newspapers urging other companies to consider hiring people laid off by AT&T.
"If this were a prize fight of 12 rounds," said Burke Stinson, an AT&T spokesman who has helped shape the company's strategy, "I would say we lost round one; we lost round two; we fought to a draw in round three; and pretty soon, we'll start winning rounds."
Even companies that are still promoting deals because of their cost savings are playing down layoffs. Aetna Life and Casualty, which announced last week that it would acquire U.S. Healthcare, promised to generate $300 million in savings by melding the two insurance companies. But in the same press release, Aetna said, "We will be sensitive to the interests of our employees."
Such warm but vague pledges make some observers wonder how sincere the companies are about about their promises. Executives at rival phone companies, for example, said they doubted that SBC could avoid wholesale cutbacks. "You just know there are headquarters staffs and other corporate functions that will overlap," Mr. Challenger said.
Times Mirror has devised a novel way to deal with such skepticism. The publishing company, which has announced sweeping job cuts at its newspapers, recently announced that it would sell its educational publishing division. But Times Mirror wants these employees to stay in their jobs. So it awarded them a $1,000 bonus to remain with the company through its transition to a new owner. Of course, once the company changes hands, all bets are off.

HEADLINE: Suicide Rates Are Rising for the Unpopular, Harassed Police Force in Paris

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 5

 BODY:
Parisians do not have warm feelings for their police. Older people remember them as collaborating with the German occupiers. Middle-aged Parisians still resent their rough repression of the 1968 student movement.
To some young people, "les flics" are walking emblems of the state, who are fun to taunt, insult and, when possible, bombard with bottles and stones. 
 But an emerging secret is making the police look lonely, harassed and vulnerable -- in short, more human. According to their union, a growing number of French police officers are committing suicide.
Last year, a record 60 police officers took their own lives, 50 percent more than the average for the last decade. At least 24 have killed themselves this year. The rate is highest in Paris -- almost twice the rate for New York City's police.
These cases are not normally reported here, but a spate of suicides last month, set off uncommon news coverage and alarmed and embarrassed the Government. Within one week, one officer was found hanging in his garage in the northern city of Arras, while near Paris two others killed themselves with their service revolvers. In January, an officer shot her three children, then herself.
"The cops are scorned by the public and badly treated by their superiors," said Dominique Borde, a prominent Paris lawyer. "No wonder they feel bad."
Jean Louis Debre, the Interior Minister, has hastily promised more psychologists and more medical check-ups to monitor stress among the men and women in uniform and pledged that higher-ups would pay more attention to the needs of the rank and file.
"The police are under constant stress," said Guy Maurin, a police union official. "And they take their stress home, so there are a lot of domestic problems."
The strain is all the more unrelenting, Mr. Maurin said, because there are few places to turn for counseling. "If someone is troubled, is quiet or is depressed, well, that is his problem. There are exceptions, but many bosses are rigid and aloof. All they do is order or punish their staff."
From conversations with police officers on the street and with union and social workers, a picture emerges of a profession in which no matter how tough some of its members appear to be, they in many ways have become scapegoats for the growing anger in French society.
The police say the pressure brought on by economic crisis, joblessness, racial tension and drug abuse often falls on them. Increasingly, they have to cope with angry youths and tough gangs in big city suburbs, which are France's social equivalent of America's inner cities. Pressures on the police worsened last year, when the country suffered a wave of terrorist attacks in the summer and national strikes accompanied by unruly demonstrations in the winter.
The police say that as their duties have grown more difficult, their professional work conditions have worsened. Because of cutbacks, they say they are understaffed and underpaid, and many feel chronically stressed.
In turn, they have often been accused of brutality, which helps explain some of the public's hostility. In a recent report, Amnesty International said the French police were especially abusive toward North African youths in poor neighborhoods.
On a dark corner near the St. Lazare train station the other night, two young officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, talked of their troubles.
"It's the stupid way our bosses treat us," said one, explaining that he had just finished four days of guard duty at a Government building. This meant he had to stay in one spot. Yet at the end of his tour, his boss reprimanded him for not delivering his quota of fines.
Police officers on street duty in Paris are expected to collect at least 10 fines a day for driving offenses. "Otherwise you're not considered a good cop," one said.
Morale problems are biggest in the Paris region, where young recruits are brought in from the provinces because public contempt for the police makes it hard to find local men and women. Mr. Maurin, the union official, said that of the 24,000 police officers stationed in the Paris area, 14,000 have asked to return home.
"We're cut off from our family, cut off from our friends, and we get insulted here," said a young rookie from Nice, who was patrolling an area of rowdy nightclubs behind Bastille Square.
The other officer, from Brittany, said he could not wait to get back there. In Paris, he said, he and his wife and two young children could hardly survive on the standard salary for rookies, about $1,500 a month, or 20 percent more than minimum wage. By comparison, a rookie in New York City, which is less expensive than Paris, earns $2,300.
"I had a lot of illusions about being in public service," he said. But some days, he said, he feels surrounded by hostility on the streets. Some days he ends up fighting running battles with demonstrators.
Back at the station, there is the hazing and barking from his superiors. "There seems to be no way ever to decompress," he said.
The suicides that were reported have involved the country's 120,000-member National Police. There have been similar troubles among the gendarmes, the paramilitary police who number about 80,000 and are under Defense Ministry jurisdiction, but their suicide numbers have not been disclosed.
At the union office of the National Police, Mr. Maurin's list of grievances is long. The union has asked for improvement of the "archaic training" at the one-year Police Academy, where much time is devoted to learning laws and when to levy fines. "We need courses on how to communicate with people, how to understand the behavior of immigrants from other cultures," Mr. Maurin said.
A black female officer from the French West Indies has complained to the union of racism, saying that at the station, her colleagues spray the rooms when she walks through.
One officer, whose wife had just left him and their three small children, said he had explained his difficulties to his superiors, but was punished every time he arrived late.
Another has repeatedly asked to move back to Auch, his hometown in the southeast, because in Mantes-la-Jolie, a Paris suburb, he says his wife is harangued on the street and his children are pestered in school because of his job.
Interior Minister Debre has argued that police officers have no higher suicide rates than other French citizens. But in a recent report to the Interior Ministry, Frederique Mezza-Beliet said the suicide rate among police officers, most of them of low rank and aged 30 to 40, was one-third higher than that of others of similar age. She cited unstable family lives, job stress and easy access to firearms.
Officers often leave suicide notes, according to Patrick Oribes, who is in charge of investigating these deaths. One recent note was left by an officer who two years ago was accused of killing a man unnecessarily during a gunfight. The investigation and trial took eight months. By the time the court agreed that the officer had acted in legitimate self-defense, he had fallen into a deep depression.
A few weeks ago, he was involved in an almost identical situation. In his suicide note, he said he could not bear to relive the episode.
"He got no support or understanding from his superiors," Mr. Maurin said. "They might well have saved his life."

HEADLINE: The Right to Suicide, Some Worry, Could Evolve Into a Duty to Die

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
Now that two Federal appeals courts have lifted bans on physician-assisted suicide, many in medicine are struggling with a tormenting question: Will the right to die become the duty to die?
They wonder if the sick and the disabled will feel pressure -- either self-imposed or from relatives -- to choose suicide over prolonged and inevitably futile treatment, particularly at a time when health care dollars are increasingly limited. They even raise the specter of the right to assisted suicide leading to euthanasia. 
 "People who are sick already feel that they are a financial and emotional burden to their families and to society," said Lisa Gigliotti, a lawyer for the Michigan Protection and Advocacy Service, a lobbying group for people with disabilities. "Now society is telling them, 'You have an option. You have the right to die.' For them, this translates easily into an obligation to die."
Society is already grappling with the imposition of economic limits on medical care. To save money, managed care plans often dictate which doctors patients can see, limit access to costly tests and demand shorter hospital stays.
But the decision on Tuesday by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York, freeing doctors to help terminally ill patients commit suicide, raises the stakes and the fears in that struggle: Death is suddenly not an unfortunate result of treatment withheld, but a real option in the treatment arsenal.
To some doctors and patients, that option is a blessing, offering a quick end to those with agonizing illnesses. But there are many who worry that even if the state regulates assisted suicide, sick patients, afraid of bankrupting their family, will feel it is their only choice.
These opponents of the ruling, which struck down parts of a New York ban on assisted suicide, say they fear that doctors, poorly trained in pain treatment and pressed by managed care companies to avoid such costly therapies, will put implicit pressure on their patients to choose suicide by not offering them acceptable alternatives.
"In an era of economic limits, the consequences of this decision are limitless," said Burke Balch, director of medical ethics for the National Right to Life Committee. "The acceptance of death as a medical management option in an era of health care limits and managed care creates a duty and not merely a right."
Furthermore, critics of the decision say it can lead to involuntary euthanasia through the use of surrogates. Existing law allows surrogates to withhold life support for mentally incompetent patients. Now, will it also allow surrogates to decide that a terminally ill person should be given a lethal dose of medication?
Surrogates could gain this power, the the critics pointed out, as an expansion of the court's ruling, which held that there was an inherent inequality in existing law, which allowed terminally ill patients to hasten their deaths by withdrawing or withholding life sustaining treatment; for those whose illness did not demand such treatment, however, there was no avenue to a quicker death. Patients in each of those situations, the court ruled, should be treated equally.
Ms. Gigliotti said euthanasia was the extreme danger of allowing terminally ill patients to hasten their death by "commission rather than omission."
She and others question whether such decisions would be made in the best interest of patients, or because of economic pressures.
"I'm scared of the whole medical system in terms of economics," said Rashi Fein, a professor who teaches the economics of medicine at Harvard Medical School. "This is an area where there is tremendous economic advantage to not getting involved with keeping people going. But I come down grudgingly on the side that regulation can come much closer to keeping us honest than the unregulated, underground system we have now."
Critics of assisted suicide -- among them many religious leaders -- think the danger of economics motivating the decision to choose suicide or to impose it on a mentally incompetent person are too acute to be regulated safely. The National Conference of Catholic Bishops, for one, has promised to wage a campaign against assisted suicide equal to the group's efforts opposing abortion, including pressing for an appeal to the Supreme Court and trying to influence political debate.
Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard and an expert on health law, said such fears were exaggerated. "There are far greater economic pressures on patients who must maintain expensive life-sustaining treatment than on those forced to endure painful, drawn-out illnesses where no such therapy is available," he said. "And there has been no evidence that people in those situations are being pushed to withdraw treatment because of the high cost."
Regulating assisted suicide might actually reduce the need for it, said Dr. Howard Grossman, a Manhattan internist who was a plaintiff in the New York lawsuit. The laws, he said, would probably compel insurers to pay for more psychiatric care and pain management therapy than they do now, mitigating a patient's desire to die. Any rules, he explained, would probably require that before acceding to a patient's request to die, doctors must exhaust other treatments, evaluate a patient's mental health and demonstrate that the patient's wishes were not swayed by efforts to control pain.
"There are some very valid fears that need to be addressed, but I think we can address them through regulation," said Dr. Grossman, who conceded that some doctors have quietly defied the ban on assisted suicide and helped terminally ill patients eager to end their doomed and painful lives.
There are those, however, who say that the ruling by the court in New York and a similar decision by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco should provoke a much-needed, though generally avoided, debate about the economic realities of the current health care market. Leonard M. Fleck, a professor of philosophy and medical ethics at Michigan State University's medical school, contends that in an era of limited financing for health care, assisted suicide is a legitimate option for doctors to offer terminally ill patients near the end of life.
"The need for health care rationing is inescapable because the parameters for adding care expand each day," he said. "The moral challenge is to come up with approaches that are open, rational and democratic, but that limit marginally beneficial and non-costworthy care. In my opinion, there are no good options given the current situation, but assisted suicide is the least worst option."
Daniel Callahan, the president of the Hastings Center, a research institute that focuses on biomedical ethical issues, is repelled by the thought of assisted suicide as an answer to limited health care resources. "It is one thing to talk about cutting corners to find cheaper ways to handle the soaring costs of health care," said Dr. Callahan. "But we are talking about forcing death, or at the very least, coercing it or encouraging it."

HEADLINE: New Poll Finds Strength for Dole On Personal and Political Traits

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
Though Senator Bob Dole was ridiculed by his rivals in the Republican primaries as unelectable in November, he shows considerable strength against President Clinton on many traits, including leadership, personal values and his vision for the country, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
The findings set the stage for what could be a closely matched general election contest. Despite Mr. Dole's greater personal appeal, Mr. Clinton continues to maintain a comfortable lead over him in trial heats, in part because many voters say they want the President re-elected if for no other reason than to have a check on the Republican Congress. 
 The poll also found that if Ross Perot entered the race as a third-party contender -- and if the race were held today -- he would take votes evenly from Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole, and would draw 18 percent, almost matching the 19 percent that Mr. Perot won in 1992.
Another reason that Mr. Dole's relatively high personal ratings might not be translating into broader support at this early point is that the public's image of the Republican Party has sunk to 41 percent favorable, the lowest level since The Times and CBS News began asking the question 12 years ago.
For months, voter surveys have hinted at an emerging disenchantment with the Republican Party. Polls show that voters blame Republicans for the shutdown of the Federal Government last fall and winter, and that the fractious Republican primaries compounded their concerns.
Many continue to say they are impatient with Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is considered by nearly one-third of voters to be the leader of the Republican Party. The decline in good will toward Republicans has occurred since August, the last time Mr. Dole prevailed over Mr. Clinton in a head-to-head matchup.
Yet, in terms of personal qualities, Mr. Dole might be enjoying a burst of popularity because he has the aura of a victor after rolling over his rivals in the last two dozen primaries.
The survey also suggests that Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader, has succeeded in emphasizing his roots from a poor family in a small town in Kansas who understands the hardships of ordinary Americans.
And he has maintained that image even though he had to endure vituperative attacks from Steve Forbes, the magazine publisher who spent millions of dollars in a television blitzkrieg in the early primaries, and Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator. The President, on the other hand, did not face a primary challenger this year.
Now that the primary phase is abruptly over and the candidates gear up for the general election, Mr. Dole's standing with the broader general electorate moves to the forefront. The Times/CBS News Poll of 1,257 adults nationwide was conducted from March 31 to April 2 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The survey found that Mr. Dole scored better than Mr. Clinton among registered voters in several areas. Seventy percent said Mr. Dole has a vision of where he wants to lead the country; 62 percent said that of Mr. Clinton. (By comparison, earlier polls of Republican primary voters found that they were split over whether they believed Mr. Dole had new ideas.)
The new poll also found that 70 percent believe Mr. Dole shares the moral values most Americans try to live by; 59 percent said that of Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Dole matched or exceeded Mr. Clinton on the question of leadership, even though incumbent Presidents have historically had the advantage. Sixty-three percent said Mr. Dole has strong qualities of leadership; 58 percent said that of Mr. Clinton.
The President does a bit better than the presumptive Republican nominee when voters were asked if each man cared about the needs and problems of people like them. Sixty-one percent cited Mr. Clinton; 51 percent said that of Mr. Dole. But Democrats almost always score better in this category; Mr. Dole's showing was seven percentage points higher than that of President George Bush in 1992.
The poll shows that both the President and the Senator are closely matched on issues of public policy. Mr. Clinton is viewed as somewhat more inclined to make sure that the Social Security system has enough money to provide benefits for current contributors, but the difference is only 54 percent to 46 percent.
By a similarly close margin, 41 percent to 33 percent, voters believe Mr. Dole is somewhat more likely to reduce the deficit. When asked if each candidate was likely to change welfare the way the voter would like, likely to improve the economy or likely to deal competently with an international crisis, both men were viewed as about equal.
Moreover, while Mr. Dole was viewed as moderate to conservative and Mr. Clinton as moderate to liberal, neither candidate was seen as extreme in his political philosophy.
In trial heats with Mr. Dole, the President has had an advantage since October, and he still does, although the Senator has picked up some support since clinching the Republican nomination. If the election were held today, 49 percent of registered voters said they would back Mr. Clinton, while 39 percent would support Mr. Dole.
One reason Mr. Dole is trailing Mr. Clinton in a head-to-head competition is that many voters seem to want the President as a brake on the Republican Congress. Fifty-three percent said it would be better to re-elect Mr. Clinton as a way to limit the power of Republicans in Congress.
Voters remained divided on legislation produced by the Republicans' Contract With America. And the public's opinion of Mr. Gingrich remains quite negative: 49 percent of voters disapprove of his job performance, while only 32 percent approve.
In a follow-up interview, one of the poll's respondents, Sandra Arnold of Tiverton, R.I., a 39-year-old military researcher, explained her qualified support for Mr. Clinton: "To be honest, Clinton isn't really doing too much for us right now. But I think Clinton would give the Congress a good balance. Republicans, no matter who they are or what their views are, tend to think of themselves as godlike."
Anna Toth, 67, a retired nurse from Pittsburgh, said, "I just don't think it's good for the country if one party has complete control, making all the decisions."
Although the Republican Party's image has waned, both parties are somewhat at parity now: 46 percent hold a favorable view of the Democratic Party, while 41 percent have a favorable view of the Republicans.
In further evidence that the Clinton-Dole matchup might shape up to be especially competitive, the job ratings of both men are quite similar. The President's overall job performance rating is 48 percent approval, while Mr. Dole's is a statistically indistinguishable 52 percent. Mr. Clinton's personal favorability rating is 50 percent, compared with 37 percent for Mr. Dole. But when those with no initial opinion were pressed, Mr. Dole's personal favorability rose to 52 percent, about the same as Mr. Clinton's.
There are, of course, numerous other factors that could affect an election that will be held seven months from now. One-third of the registered voters said, for example, that Mr. Dole's age would be an obstacle to his being an effective President. The Kansan is 72 years old and, if elected, would be the oldest President ever to take office for the first term.
Some voters were far from enthusiastic for Mr. Dole, but they viewed him as their only opportunity to oust Mr. Clinton from the White House.
"It doesn't matter to me if they're Democrats or Republicans, as long as it's not Clinton," said Jim Nareau, a 46-year-old stockbroker from Fort Myers, Fla. "I don't like Clinton's leadership, his personality or his moral standing."
The poll also showed that Democrats should be no less worried than Republicans about Mr. Perot's entering the race. In a three-way trial heat, Mr. Clinton drew 44 percent, Mr. Dole won 33 percent and Mr. Perot got 18 percent. the Texas billionaire's entry reduced Mr. Clinton's vote by five percentage points and Mr. Dole's by six percentage points.
This pattern of pulling evenly from both parties is reinforced when current Perot voters are examined more closely: one-half are independents, one-fourth are Republicans and one-fourth are Democrats.
Despite Gen. Colin L. Powell's insistence that he will not be Mr. Dole's running mate, speculation about such a pairing persists. A trial heat between a ticket of Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore versus Mr. Dole and General Powell was a statistical tie.
One of the respondents, Michael Morganelli of Bullhead City., Ariz., said he was not fond of any of the contenders but would back Mr. Dole because he prefers Republicans.
"A Republican President would work with Congress and sign the bills that would limit the Government," said Mr. Morganelli, 46, a retired construction worker. "Dole's a moderate and would probably bow to special interests. But what choice do we have?"
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted March 31 to April 2 with 1,257 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 1,035 said they were registered to vote.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 36,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus five percentage points for either Democrats or Republicans or independents taken as a separate group.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in the wording of questions or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

America's Cup Mischief Drives Winner Away

BYLINE: By WILLIAM I. KOCH; Bill Koch is both a member of the New York Yacht Club and the San Diego Yacht Club.

 BODY:
Bill Koch recently decided to abandon any further efforts to race for the America's Cup. Koch successfully defended the cup as skipper in 1992 under the America3 banner, and in 1995, he organized an America3 women's team. That group lost the cup defense trials to Dennis Conner and his Stars & Stripes team. The next America's Cup competition is scheduled for 1999-2000 in New Zealand, but Koch will not be there. His America3 Foundation syndicate will continue to sponsor Olympic sailing, but the America's Cup portion of the office has been closed. Here he explains why.
The America's Cup is the oldest, and reputably the most prestigious trophy in sporting history. As the ultimate sailing trophy, it has been said to represent the greatest in gentlemanly sportsmanship and fair play. Quite the contrary, it represents the worst. 
 To understand this, you have to look at both the history of the cup and the economic impact on the community where the competition is held.
The America's Cup competition started in 1870 when it was deeded to the New York Yacht Club by a group of club members (my ancestor was one of them) who had won it as a result of a gambling venture in 1851. Although the Deed of Gift had the noble purpose to foster "friendly competition between foreign countries," it provided that only yacht clubs could challenge for the cup and that races would be conducted in the home waters and managed by the yacht club that was defending the cup.
The New York Yacht Club had the longest winning streak in sports history, 132 years, winning in 1851, and successfully defending 24 times from 1870 to 1983.
The New York Yacht Club was accused, both unjustly and justly, of changing the rules during the competition, of stacking the jurors and other nasty shenanigans.
During the time the cup went to Australia in 1983 and then to San Diego in 1987, the charges of foul play were so intense that it took a number of lawsuits and four years for the competitive yacht clubs to come to an agreement on how the races should be conducted.
However, that did not change things. In 1992 the race committee of the San Diego Yacht Club moved a mark during one of the defender trials to benefit its favorite competitor. This was the equivalent of moving one competitor's goal line.
As recently as 1995 the San Diego Yacht Club, directly contrary to the rules, gave permission only for its favorite competitor to change his boat by making it faster during a playoff series. All of this greatly detracted from the cup and has turned off the viewing public.
To win the America's Cup requires outstanding management, state-of-the-art technological development, superior athletes and a lot of money. In fact, one of the reasons most nations compete so fanatically for it is that the America's Cup stands for a nation's strength in management, technology and athletics.
If the America's Cup represents a country's nobility and is to foster "friendly competition" among nations, why is there so much unsportsmanlike conduct and even blatant cheating?
The answer is simple. Under the Deed of Gift, the defending yacht club manages the event, and the event itself means a lot of money to the local community. In San Diego, the America's Cup in one year alone produced between $250 million to $500 million in tourist-related business, construction, marina rentals, boat repairs, etc.
That is not inherently evil. What is evil is the fact that the defending yacht club, whose members stand to gain greatly, manage the event. That is equivalent to the hometown picking not only the location of the Super Bowl, but also the field, the referees, umpires and scorekeepers.
Is that fair? No, simply because it asks too much of normally good human beings to resist such overwhelming temptations. As Lord Acton said, "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
Ironically, in spite of all this money, there is very little money for the competitors, except very modest endorsements for the winning skipper. Corporate sponsors get a return for their advertising, but they get much higher returns for advertising on the winning boat. An individual financial backer gets no returns except for whatever psychic gain that comes from the competition.
With the high costs ($25 million to $50 million per team) and no returns for individuals, the sport is no longer for the fabulously wealthy but is now the exclusive domain of the professional sailors/managers and the sponsors. As a result, there is more pressure to win at all costs.
There is a simple way to fix what is wrong with the America's Cup. The competition should be managed by a professional organization that has no interest financial or otherwise in the outcome. That is what every professional sport has done: the N.F.L., the N.B.A., the N.H.L., etc.
Unless the management of the event is changed, the America's Cup in New Zealand in 2000 will be just another version of America's Cup lack of sportsmanship. The cup will continue with its tarnished image. My advice to any competitor is to have such a fast boat, and such a good crew, that you can win no matter how much cheating is done against you. Maybe winning against all those odds is something to be proud of.

HEADLINE: Raymond S. Rubinow, 91, Master of Civic Causes

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Raymond S. Rubinow, a longtime political gadfly and New York civic leader who fought with equal zeal to save Carnegie Hall and demolish Tammany Hall, died on Tuesday at his home in the Esplanade Hotel on West End Avenue in Manhattan. He was 91.
A self-styled philanthropoid who made a science of giving away other people's money, Mr. Rubinow coined the term in Chicago in the 1930's while working for the Julius Rosenwald Fund, the foundation endowed by the founder of Sears, Roebuck. 
 Mr. Rubinow elevated his work to a high art in New York two decades later when he joined the J.M. Kaplan Fund, which had been established in 1947 by Jacob Kaplan, the self-made businessman who had made a fortune by reorganizing the Welch's grape juice company.
As executive director of the fund from 1955 to 1977, Mr. Rubinow was soon in the forefront of virtually every do-good cultural, social and civic cause in the city, often as chairman of some long-named committee seeking to preserve, advance or create a piece of the city's heritage.
His first major success came in the late 1950's when, as chairman of the Joint Emergency Committee to Close Washington Square Park to Traffic, he succeeded in blocking a plan to extend Fifth Avenue through the Greenwich Village park.
Another came in 1960 when, as chairman of the Citizens Committee for Carnegie Hall, he helped save the venerable concert hall from the wrecker's ball after it had been abandoned by the New York Philharmonic for Lincoln Center.
His work to keep traffic out of Washington Square Park made Mr. Rubinow something of a hero to many residents of Greenwich Village, particularly the artists, writers and upscale newcomers whose interests often clashed with those of the older Italian-American community there.
Mr. Rubinow, who had helped form the first citizens' committee to support the election of Mayor Robert F. Wagner in 1953, was soon in the thick of the so-called reform movement to depose Carmine De Sapio, the entrenched leader of the Manhattan Democratic Party whose political power base was in Greenwich Village.
As chairman of the Democratic Mobilization in 1963, Mr. Rubinow helped a young lawyer named Ed Koch defeat Mr. De Sapio as district leader. Together with Mayor Wagner's famous break with the political bosses that year, the victory effectively shattered the power of the Tammany Hall political machine and laid the groundwork for Mr. Koch's later career in Congress and at City Hall.
For Mr. Rubinow, a native of Washington who grew up in New York, his role as an adviser to public figures like Mayor Wagner was something of a family tradition.
His father, I.M. Rubinow, a Russian-born physician who became an eminent American economist and social theorist, is regarded as an intellectual godfather of Social Security, which was created by the Wagner Act of 1936 after being pushed through the Senate by Mayor Wagner's father, Senator Robert F. Wagner.
Mr. Rubinow, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and received a master's degree in economics from the University of Wisconsin, took a while to hit his stride. But after working briefly for the National Recovery Administration and the Social Security Board in Washington and teaching economics at Swarthmore, he found his niche in foundation work, initially as a consultant and later as an executive of a series of foundations before finding a permanent home with the Kaplan fund.
In the pitched battles between preservationists and developers, Mr. Rubinow was often on the winning side. As chairman of the Emergency Action Committee to Save the Beach at Breezy Point, for example, he helped preserve the Queens beach from development in 1963 and he had a similar triumph in 1965 as chairman of the Committee to Save Madison Square Park.
Not all his campaigns were successful, however. In 1967 he was chairman of the Emergency Civic Committee to Oppose a World Trade Center.
Mr. Rubinow, whose wife, Consuelo Kamholz, died in 1993, is survived by a sister, Dr. Olga Lurie of Mamaroneck, N.Y.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Municipal Bond Funds May Be Perking Up

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
THE year did not start out well for municipal bond funds. A roller-coaster ride in interest rates -- especially the sudden rate surge in mid-February -- whipsawed them far more than corporate bond funds.
But in the months ahead, municipal bond funds may begin to provide investors fewer bumps and better returns, many bond analysts say. "Looking out for the next six months, I think it's a pretty decent environment for municipal bonds," said Thomas Kenny, director of the municipal bond department at the Franklin/Templeton fund group. 
 What is behind these changes is a nice improvement in the economic environment: Inflation remains steady and low, keeping a lid on sudden shifts in interest rates; investors are becoming skittish about the sky-high returns on equity funds and are beginning to seek some less-risky tax-free income; yields on municipal bonds hover around an attractive 6 percent range, and investors in some high-tax states can do better on an after-tax basis investing in municipals than in Treasuries.
"As you start seeing those municipal bonds reaching yields of 6 percent, you are beginning to see some buying interest by retail investors," said Mary Miller, a managing director at T. Rowe Price Associates.
The first quarter was truly terrible for municipal bond funds, which vastly underperformed taxable bond funds. According to Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking company, the average taxable bond fund lost 0.59 percent in the first quarter, compared with an average loss of 1.56 percent for municipals, which are tax free. At the same time, investors who put their money into domestic equity funds enjoyed a 5.58 percent gain, on average.
Municipal funds did even worse than the bonds themselves. In general, said Guy Davidson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, municipal bonds outperformed Treasury bonds in the quarter on an after-tax basis. But that rosy situation did not extend to municipal funds because so many are filled with bonds of longer maturities -- 20 to 30 years -- which suffered the most because of their sensitivity to sudden shifts in interest rates.
For instance, the Lehman Brothers municipal bond index shows that the average five-year municipal bond had a total return of zero for the quarter just ended -- compared with a 1.6 percent loss for the five-year Treasury bond.
Other factors that depressed the municipal bond market have changed as well. The bonds took a beating in 1995 because of concerns that a flat tax could wipe out their value as tax-exempt instruments and because of creditworthiness questions raised by the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. But now that the flat tax appears to have become a notion of the past and that Orange County is wending its way out of bankruptcy, investor sentiment appears to be improving. And about half of all new municipal issues are now backed by bond insurance that promises to pay investors even if a municipality goes belly-up.
With municipal bonds, the truism is that funds with shorter-term bonds are less volatile, while those with longer-term bonds are more sensitive to interest-rate swings. When rates rise suddenly and prices drop, as they did in the first quarter, the yields of longer-term funds plummet more than funds with bonds of shorter maturities.
Analysts expect this situation to change in the months ahead, and recommend that investors opt for funds with longer-term bonds -- and then hold them. "We expect low volatility in municipal bond prices over the next nine months," said Ian MacKinnon, a senior vice president at the Vanguard Group.
"We think that it's a good time to be buying municipal bonds, and we are encouraging investors to look at intermediate- and longer-term bonds," he said.
Many municipal bond investors judge their investment on how much after-tax income they receive relative to how much they would get if they put the same amount in a Treasury security. For the last half of 1995, municipal bonds were trading at levels that equaled about 95 percent of Treasury securities -- which gave municipal bonds a far superior after-tax return, especially for high-income investors.
Since, then, as municipal markets have calmed, the ratio has changed. Municipal bonds are now trading at 70 to 85 percent of Treasury securities, depending on the maturity.

HEADLINE: Health Care In the Era of Capitalism

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
FOR all the much-discussed emphasis on the need to cut costs, the health care system still is rich enough to excite deal makers. Witness the $8.9 billion agreement last week for the purchase of U.S. Healthcare Inc., one of the country's biggest health maintenance organizations. The would-be buyer, the Aetna Life & Casualty Company, is an even bigger health insurance company.
Aetna's plans were announced only a few days after a big for-profit hospital chain, the Columbia-HCA Health Corporation, announced an important agreement to buy most of the business of Ohio Blue Cross and Blue Shield, a policyholder-owned insurance company. 
 Both deals ride the wave of shifting market forces that have shaken health care in the last few years. The movement toward managed care that was so important to the the Clinton Administration's failed attempt to remake the system has in fact accelerated since then, as the percentage of Americans in H.M.O.'s has risen to about 22 percent, from 16 percent in 1992.
 
 
 
Squeezing Doctors and Patients
 During that time, the race to cut costs has brought robust profits for many insurers and hospitals, a squeeze on doctors' incomes and a trend toward tighter discipline for sick Americans, who typically must pay a greater share of their medical costs and have less say in choosing their doctors.
"Market-driven health system reform is occurring faster than Federal legislation and regulators can measure, much less control," said Alain C. Enthoven, a Stanford University economist, in an article he wrote with Sara J. Singer for the spring issue of Health Affairs, a policy journal.
About 58 million people are enrolled in H.M.O.'s and 81 million more in less tightly disciplined varieties of managed health care, by the count of the American Association of Health Plans, a managed care trade group. H.M.O. enrollment is growing by about six million a year, said Rich Hamer, the director of Interstudy Publications, a Minneapolis-based H.M.O. research firm.
Health maintenance organizations have kept a lid on their costs by requiring patients to choose from a limited list of primary-care doctors, who typically must approve any diagnostic tests or referrals to specialists. In most cases, the primary physician is paid a set fee for each person assigned to him by the H.M.O. In many of these arrangements, the doctor may lose money if too many patients require expensive treatment. This can be an incentive to deny needed care, although some H.M.O.'s reward doctors whose patients say they received good treatment.
Most U.S. Healthcare doctors work under this system, and most Aetna doctors do not. Securities analysts expect Aetna's H.M.O.'s to switch to the per-patient model.
Kenneth S. Bernstein, a health care securities analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said that U.S. Healthcare had trouble getting the best doctors for its network until it started paying more generously two years ago. The higher payments cut into the company's profits, so "the doctors liked them and then the investors hated them," Mr. Bernstein said.
Close to 12 million Medicaid recipients, or 32 percent, are enrolled in H.M.O.'s, as are about four million elderly Americans on Medicare, or about 10 percent of the total. Both Medicare and Medicaid H.M.O.'s are already growing rapidly, and their business would really take off if Congress passes legislation to encourage managed care as a cost-saving measure.
The growth of these H.M.O.'s threatens hospital revenues as they cut back on treatment and hospital stays. Hospital executives said one reason for Columbia-HCA's bid for Ohio Blue Cross was to find a way to start hospital-owned Medicare and Medicaid H.M.O.'s. Columbia would also get Blue Cross-insured customers for its Ohio hospitals.
Naturally, competing hospitals as well as employers who are Blue Cross customers are not thrilled by Columbia's strategy. Some employers also take a skeptical view of the Aetna-U.S. Healthcare deal. "The question is, will it mean lower premiums for the patients and the purchasers?" said Helen Darling, a health care executive with the Xerox Corporation.
 
 
 
Whose Savings?
 John F. Holahan, a health policy expert with the Urban Institute, a research center in Washington, also questioned whether the cost savings from competition among managed care plans "will be eroded through mergers and consolidation."
Nor will any improvements in efficiency help the uninsured, who by most counts now exceed 40 million.
Stuart Butler, a health care economist with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy center in Washington, said his concern with the current system was that employers, not patients, pay for health care and call the tune. For example, he said, small employers with a high turnover are unlikely to care about the long-term health of employees' children. Indeed, many small employers no longer insure employees' families.
Mr. Butler would like to make health care benefits less dependent on employer financing, possibly through tax breaks for groups of church or union members.
Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton, lamented that restraints on "raw and joyful entrepreneurship" are falling away. "We can compete brutally on price," he said. "We can allow well-to-do people to have free choice of doctors, and middle-income and lower-income people to lose that free choice. We no longer trouble either the entrepreneur or anyone else over the issue of social equity and over the people who fall through the cracks."

HEADLINE: CUNY, the Vocational University

BYLINE: By Sandi E. Cooper and Dean Savage; Sandi E. Cooper, a history professor at the College of Staten Island, is chairwoman of CUNY's faculty senate. Dean Savage is an associate professor of sociology at Queens College.

 BODY:
Facing the second year of a financial emergency, many faculty members of the City University of New York are worried about the university's direction.
Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds's reorganization is further diminishing its liberal arts orientation and emphasizing vocational preparedness. The students will lose in the long term. 
 America's third largest university system, CUNY is not Traditional U. The student body consists predominantly of poor minority members and poor women. Last year, the valedictorian at City College was a Caribbean-born grandmother.
 We have opted to serve this population an intellectual diet that barely resembles what past graduates feasted on. This is not a result, as conservatives might crow, of political correctness driving curriculum decisions. This is the result of 20 years of fiscal crises, during which several administrations have de-emphasized the liberal arts and introduced numerous vocational programs.
This direction is particularly marked in the newer colleges. In 1976, York College, in Jamaica, gave fewer than 10 percent of its degrees in vocational programs; in 1992 (the latest data available), the figure exceeded 70 percent. In that period, the College of Staten Island's vocational degrees rose from 8 percent to more than 40 percent, and those at Medgar Evers College, in Brooklyn, went from 13 percent to 57 percent. This tendency is also found at the golden oldies -- City College, Queens College and Brooklyn College. (At Hunter College, vocational degrees declined, though it is not clear why.)
Albany insists that the only new programs it will finance are job-related. To attract this financing, liberal arts faculty members are continuously reminded that they must find ways to make their courses "relevant to a job outcome." So sociology develops a tie with social work or market research. Economics survives in an alliance with business management.
The administration maintains that the curriculum shift is consumer-driven -- that it reflects what students want. But what they really want, as a sociologist's recent survey of 1,400 Queens College graduates demonstrated, is the ability "to learn new things rapidly," "to write clearly and effectively" and "to analyze problems." What they don't need is training for jobs on equipment that might be obsolete on graduation day.
A sound education presupposes good faculty. One obstacle is that many professors rightly fear for their jobs. At Harlem-based City College, CUNY's flagship, the liberal arts banquet that once rivaled Columbia's is threatened with extinction.
Just when the faculty begins to mirror the diversity of the students, the university begins to talk about electronic classrooms. Just when the majority of the student body consists of minority members and women, the commitment made in 1847 -- "to educate the children of the whole people" -- is redefined. CUNY should return to its roots.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
When Elderly Buddies Take Politics Seriously

BYLINE: By WILBORN HAMPTON 

 BODY:
If P. T. Barnum's law on the ratio of the birth of suckers to time (one per minute) worked for Ross Perot in his 1992 Presidential campaign, the producers of "The Shattering" must have hoped it would apply to theater audiences as well. That's the only apparent reason for the vanity staging of this inept exercise by Mark R. Shapiro at the Players Theater.
The play concerns the conversion of Harry and three of his buddies, all near retirement age, into Perot zealots and how their lives are shattered (hence the title, one supposes) when Mr. Perot pulls out of the race. 
 The first act plays like a bad infomercial. Although all four men have jobs and live comfortably, they complain about the "recession." They want a "change" and a "voice" in the Government, without ever thinking about what they want changed or what they would say if anyone listened to them. Harry becomes such a disciple of Perotism that he cashes in his life insurance policy so he can pay out of his own pocket for Perot-for-President T-shirts, placards and bumper stickers.
Mr. Shapiro, who is a Washington lobbyist in real life, should know more about politics than he lets on through these cardboard characters. The writing is so vapid it would make daytime soap opera seem inspired. When Mr. Perot quits the campaign, the men's sense of betrayal couldn't be greater if Ronald Reagan suddenly announced he was a Communist.
The one possibility at turning any of this into a real play comes in the realization that Harry and one of his friends both have sons who are among those still missing from the Vietnam War. They seem to think Mr. Perot will find their boys and bring them home. There is some dramatic potential in a brief scene in which Harry and his wife and married daughter confront the realization that the son is probably dead and that it was Harry himself who pressured the boy into "doing his duty" for his country. But Mr. Shapiro abandons it before it is fully developed.
There's not a lot a director or actors can do with such material. Kenneth Elliott, the director who has enjoyed success staging Charles Busch comedies, has Harry shout and throw things around from time to time, but it mostly serves only to keep the audience awake. Marge Redmond is longsuffering as Harry's wife. Robert Hogan, who played the role at a press preview, portrayed Harry as though he were Clint Eastwood doing an Archie Bunker impersonation.

HEADLINE: Raymond S. Rubinow, 91, Master of Civic Causes

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Raymond S. Rubinow, a longtime political gadfly and New York civic leader who fought with equal zeal to save Carnegie Hall and demolish Tammany Hall, died on Tuesday at his home in the Esplanade Hotel on West End Avenue in Manhattan. He was 91.
A self-styled philanthropoid who made a science of giving away other people's money, Mr. Rubinow coined the term in Chicago in the 1930's while working for the Julius Rosenwald Fund, the foundation endowed by the founder of Sears, Roebuck. 
 Mr. Rubinow elevated his work to a high art in New York two decades later when he joined the J.M. Kaplan Fund, which had been established in 1947 by Jacob Kaplan, the self-made businessman who had made a fortune by reorganizing the Welch's grape juice company.
As executive director of the fund from 1955 to 1977, Mr. Rubinow was soon in the forefront of virtually every do-good cultural, social and civic cause in the city, often as chairman of some long-named committee seeking to preserve, advance or create a piece of the city's heritage.
His first major success came in the late 1950's when, as chairman of the Joint Emergency Committee to Close Washington Square Park to Traffic, he succeeded in blocking a plan to extend Fifth Avenue through the Greenwich Village park.
Another came in 1960 when, as chairman of the Citizens Committee for Carnegie Hall, he helped save the venerable concert hall from the wrecker's ball after it had been abandoned by the New York Philharmonic for Lincoln Center.
His work to keep traffic out of Washington Square Park made Mr. Rubinow something of a hero to many residents of Greenwich Village, particularly the artists, writers and upscale newcomers whose interests often clashed with those of the older Italian-American community there.
Mr. Rubinow, who had helped form the first citizens' committee to support the election of Mayor Robert F. Wagner in 1953, was soon in the thick of the so-called reform movement to depose Carmine De Sapio, the entrenched leader of the Manhattan Democratic Party whose political power base was in Greenwich Village.
As chairman of the Democratic Mobilization in 1963, Mr. Rubinow helped a young lawyer named Ed Koch defeat Mr. De Sapio as district leader. Together with Mayor Wagner's famous break with the political bosses that year, the victory effectively shattered the power of the Tammany Hall political machine and laid the groundwork for Mr. Koch's later career in Congress and at City Hall.
For Mr. Rubinow, a native of Washington who grew up in New York, his role as an adviser to public figures like Mayor Wagner was something of a family tradition.
His father, I. M. Rubinow, a Russian-born physician who became an eminent American economist and social theorist, is regarded as an intellectual godfather of Social Security, which was created by the Wagner Act of 1936 after being pushed through the Senate by Mayor Wagner's father, Senator Robert F. Wagner.
Mr. Rubinow, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and received a master's degree in economics from the University of Wisconsin, took a while to hit his stride. But after working briefly for the National Recovery Administration and the Social Security Board in Washington and teaching economics at Swarthmore, he found his niche in foundation work, initially as a consultant and later as an executive of a series of foundations before finding a permanent home with the Kaplan fund.
In the pitched battles between preservationists and developers, Mr. Rubinow was often on the winning side. As chairman of the Emergency Action Committee to Save the Beach at Breezy Point, for example, he helped preserve the Queens beach from development in 1963 and he had a similar triumph in 1965 as chairman of the Committee to Save Madison Square Park.
Not all his campaigns were successful, however. In 1967 he was chairman of the Emergency Civic Committee to Oppose a World Trade Center.
Mr. Rubinow, whose wife, Consuelo Kamholz, died in 1993, is survived by a sister, Dr. Olga Lurie of Mamaroneck, N.Y.

HEADLINE: YACHT RACING;
All-Black Crew Finding Its Horizons

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

 BODY:
Responding to a wish from his mother that he take up collegiate sailing, Byron Gully Jr. of Chicago tried out for the team last fall during freshmen orientation at Hampton University.
Unlike the football and track he had competed in at De La Salle, a Chicago high school, Gully found that making the sailing squad at the Hampton, Va., college did not involve much more than showing up at a meeting. That was lucky for Gully, since he had never set foot on a sailboat before. 
 As it turns out, he was not the only fledgling sailor. Eight other students have since joined Gully to form the first intercollegiate sailing team at a historically African-American university. Hampton was founded in 1868 to educate freed slaves.
Competing this month in their first round of spring competition, the five men and four women on the all-black team have about as much cumulative sailing experience as a youngster enrolled in his first yacht club summer camp. And yet, they have beaten a few other collegiate sailing teams.
"I did this as a favor to my mother," the 19-year-old Gully said recently. "It sounded like something different. When I went out on a boat for the first time, I capsized twice that day. And then I realized this wasn't going to be boring."
Gully's unfamiliarity with the sport, despite having grown up in a city neighborhood minutes from the shores of Lake Michigan, is not uncommon for African-Americans. As with tennis and golf, sailing has been marked by mostly white participation at country clubs and yacht clubs.
"There has been a dearth of African-Americans in sailing because of the kind of sport it is," said Dennis Thomas, athletic director at Hampton. "You don't catch many African-Americans going out and buying a sailboat. You're talking a different kind of economic strata there."
The doors are opening now for African-Americans as club memberships become less exclusive, and as community sailing programs flourish. But Hampton chose not to wait but to lead. An effort by Hampton professors and administrators developed a program for the 1995-96 academic year. Through Gary Jobson, an ESPN sailing commentator who is also a member of Hampton's board of trustees, the school received donations that included a fleet of 13- to 14-foot dinghy sailboats, including 11 new Lasers and eight Club Flying Juniors (FJ's).
An even greater addition to the Hampton program was the hiring of Gary Bodie, a sailing coach with impressive credentials in yacht racing as well. Having left the United States Naval Academy last fall after a decade as a sailing coach, Bodie left behind a legacy of 14 intercollegiate championships and 34 all-America honors. Bodie concedes that his new team is struggling. But competition among the 35 sailing squads in the Mid-Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association has taken his team beyond the beginner's stage.
"Sometimes I get impatient because I know from my Navy experience that No. 1 is way off," Bodie said. "But when I step back, I think our progress is pretty amazing."
Bodie has also started to recruit students from countries where black and minority students are more likely to have been brought up sailing. That includes Bermuda, the Virgin Islands, the Dominican Republic and Central as well as South America.
"At Navy, you didn't make the team if you weren't recruited," Bodie said. "I was getting a major player every year with lifelong experience. But sailing is not a scholarship recruitment program. You're pretty much selling a program, and a good education."
The students at Hampton came to the team with uneven experience and expectations, he added. Granted, Devin Walker, team captain, had raced occasionally on a Cal 25 owned by Benjamin Cuker, an associate professor of marine science who was also instrumental in organizing the sailing program. And Jennease Hyatt had taken a few sailing lessons one year in a community program on the Charles River in Boston. But the others had barely got their feet wet.
The reality of sailing competition hit them in a cold, wet rain at the start of spring training in mid-February. In the beginning, the students had little or no gear to ride out their occasional dunkings in the murky Hampton River, and nothing to protect them from the windchill on Hampton Rhodes Harbor, a nearby waterway that leads into Chesapeake Bay. Now they have dry suits, synthetic body warmers, spray tops and sea boots.
Gully says he doesn't capsize much anymore. He can swim, an accomplishment that even Dennis Conner, who has raced for the America's Cup seven times, says he hasn't mastered. But the fact about Conner doesn't matter much to Gully, who asks matter-of-factly, "Who's that?"

HEADLINE: As a Hospital Is Fixed, A Wound Is Healed

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER 

 BODY:
For 20 years the old Morrisania Hospital building has loomed grim and vacant over its Bronx neighborhood, sheltering only junkies, homeless people, huge rats, even a family of hawks. With its outlying buildings, the hospital complex occupies an entire city block. When the central structure rose 11 stories above the neighborhood in the booming 1920's, it was a symbol of the borough's ascent. When it was abandoned in 1976, it became an equally potent indicator of decline.
But on a frigid day late last month, a crowd of politicians, neighborhood advocates and urban-renewal specialists gathered at the base of the hospital's neo-Renaissance facade to celebrate the start of what local officials say is the last major renovation job left in the Bronx. Construction is under way, and in 14 months the former hospital is to reopen as an apartment building, complete with social services for the tenants. 
 Cashmere coats were much in evidence among the nattily attired crowd, the buffet table was loaded with fancy cheeses and fruits, and there was a buzz of purposeful chatter in the air. All this, set against the South Bronx tenements, seemed like something from another planet.
This wasn't science fiction, however, though it was something of a miracle.
For the story of how a brand-new advocacy group snared the largest single grant in the history of New York State's housing agency -- $6.3 million -- negotiated the shoals of local politics and kept alive the idea of renovation for the hulk in the face of skepticism and attempts at sabotage, is a surprising one. It is a lesson in how political finesse, combined with a certain vision, may result in change for even the most recalcitrant patches of urban blight.
There is the cost of the project, $24 million, nearly half in state funds. There is the fact that the building has never been used for housing. But mostly, there is the ambition of this scheme, which aims not only to provide pleasant, inexpensive apartments, but to give their occupants jobs and training, right in the grand old structure itself. The developer, the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation, has detailed plans -- with money in place -- to train local people, not just the new tenants, in commercial food preparation, nursing and child care.
For Nancy Biberman, mastermind of the project, faith was an integral ingredient from the beginning. A housing lawyer who was a student leader during the 1968 strike at Columbia University, she became haunted by the beautiful old hospital building while directing, for the Archdiocese of New York, a housing rehabilitation project in nearby High Bridge in the late 1980's.
In 1991, she struck out on her own, founding the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation, or Wedco, to devote herself to reconstituting neighborhoods not just with renovated apartments, but with jobs and services for the people who were to live in them.
The new organization was looking for what Ms. Biberman calls a "signature project." The Florentine arched windows of Morrisania Hospital were on her brain. "I said, 'Like, why not?' " Ms. Biberman recalled recently.
But local people, bureaucrats downtown, housing renovation experts -- all told her to forget about it. She was plied with vague insinuations about a political "fix" on the building. Nobody could point to anything specific. Nonetheless, some of the truth of these allegations was later borne out.
"Everybody said, 'Don't even think about it; it's way too political,' " Ms. Biberman remembered. "There were all sorts of rumors about it, that every single plan that had been advanced had always bit the dust. It was cursed, in a way."
An initial visit was discouraging. She climbed in through a hole in the gate. "It's dark. It's scary. It's truly scary," Ms. Biberman recalled. "There were people sleeping in there. It was a mess, filled with debris. It was disgusting. Lot of dogs running around."
Visits to the local community board -- its approval was vital in getting control of the site from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development -- were hardly more encouraging.
Community Board 4 in the South Bronx, which represents an area where almost half the population is below the poverty line, was not interested in more low-income residents in the neighborhood. All through the 1980's, renovation dollars had poured in. Tenants with few resources had followed. That era, local officials felt, was over.
"The initial response was, 'Hey, we don't need more housing,' " said Robert Hannibal, chairman of the board. Mr. Hannibal remembered his youth, when neighboring 167th Street bustled and there was an Automat instead of today's shabby bodegas. That was what he wanted to bring back.
While lobbying the community board, Ms. Biberman discovered a potentially critical ally: Public School 235, a local bilingual elementary school that was born in a vacant supermarket in 1970 and had been rootless ever since.
Providentially, school officials had identified the old Morrisania Hospital site as the best place to build a home for P.S. 235. The problem, from their point of view, was the hospital building itself, a white elephant.
Wedco turned the elephant into a draft horse. A marriage was born: "A blessing," said Sylvia Rosario, former president of the Parents' Association of P.S. 235. The old hospital would be apartments and economic development; the outlying buildings would be torn down for the new school.
Meanwhile, Wedco was begging another critical player, Borough President Fernando Ferrer, for his support. Without it, the whole project would collapse. But this gift would not come easily. "I didn't know Wedco from a hole in the wall," Mr. Ferrer recalled.
As word of Ms. Biberman's plans spread through the borough in 1992, rival plans for the hospital began to surface.
One was hatched by a local politician, whom neither Ms. Biberman nor Mr. Ferrer would identify, who had connections to his proposed developer. As Wedco gained the upper hand, the incensed politician made phone calls to officials in New York and Albany, attempting to kill the women's plan, Ms. Biberman and Mr. Ferrer said.
"It was a very nasty business for a while," Ms. Biberman remembered. "He really tried to sabotage us."
Mr. Ferrer recalled, "I came under intense lobbying by some of my colleagues in government." They thundered, in his recollection: " 'This isn't a Bronx group, this isn't a group of people of color, they come out of nowhere.' " Ms. Biberman acknowledged, "We're white girls, after all."
Hovering in the background, there had always been the matter of procuring $24 million to finance the grandiose scheme.
Early signs were not promising. The city turned Wedco down: no money left in the housing till. But the group had an initial trump up its sleeve. Forty-eight of the 132 new apartments were planned for homeless families.
This part of the scheme was in tune with Wedco's goal of helping those on public assistance. But it was also strategically savvy. Ms. Biberman knew that the state agency that subsidized housing for the homeless was sympathetic to her plans, and was likely to speed her money request. She had worked with them before. They liked her.
The strategy proved correct. In July 1993 the Department of Social Services' Homeless Housing Assistance Program came up with the initial grant of $4.5 million, "a nice commitment," Ms. Biberman said. Housing for the homeless, the part of the plan perhaps least attractive to local officials, provided the financial breakthrough.
Money attracted support. Two months later, Community Board 4 signed off. In November 1993 the city turned the building over to Wedco.
But that still left the biggest hurdle of all: persuading the state Department of Housing and Community Renewal to make its biggest-ever housing grant and part with half of its annual New York City allotment for a single project, an unprecedented action.
Finally, on a fall day in 1994, more than three years after the idea was conceived, there was a phone call to Wedco's offices in lower Manhattan: The money was theirs. But the jubilation proved to be short-lived.
In November, several days after a ceremony in front of the building, disaster struck: the Democratic administration of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo that had agreed to finance the renovation was defeated. The new administration had every right to rescind commitments made by the old. Throughout 1995, the staff at Wedco waited with dread for that phone call. Every detail of the Morrisania project was once again picked over minutely.
Four months ago, Ms. Biberman got the word: The project was on. She was too exhausted to feel much relief. That same month the contractors went to work.
On the day the fancy crowd showed up to make speeches, residents hung out their windows or paused on the street. "This is great," said Pearl Matthews, a retired city worker. "That place is rat-infested. People are using it for shelter."
Ms. Biberman, assessing the outcome of the five-year struggle and her stake in it, said: "I don't think it compares to anything other than after you've given birth to a child."

HEADLINE: A Moment in the Sunset For Heroes of the Slopes

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: KEYSTONE, Colo., April 2

 BODY:
To the spring-break college crowd, snowboarders in baggy pants and ski bunnies in pink ear muffs, the sight must have seemed strange: a dozen aging men, wearing white camouflage, descending a ski run in a slow, serpentine formation, making the wide, graceful turns popular in the 1930's.
In World War II, these crack ski troops of the United States Army's 10th Mountain Division were known as the invisible men in white. After the war, they were the heart of an extraordinary boom in recreational skiing. From 200,000 skiers at the end of the war, the number has grown to about 10 million skiers in the United States, according to the industry. 
Before the sun-creased septuagenarians schuss into the sunset, they are being hailed with a shower of ski passes, documentary movies, coffee-table books, memorial highways and ski-run dedications.
"For the second generation of the ski business, we can be especially grateful that they came home and founded many of the 500 ski areas in the country," John Rutter, a vice president of the Keystone Resort, said recently as sun shone off packed powder at the resort's 11,640-foot summit. "They touched every ski area in the nation."
Moments later, a white-haired former drill instructor barked, "Hoods up, tips down," and the camouflaged veterans, as old as 84, glided under an arch of ski poles to dedicate another ski run to their old unit. Watching the reunion of a few of the division association's 3,500 members, Dean G. Carmichael, 70, the group's president, said in a choking voice: "I hope our name will live on long after we are gone from these slopes."
In a state with a young population and many new residents, Coloradans are waking up to the deep impact made on the Rockies by the 10,000 men who trained in the mountains 35 miles from here in World War II. Postwar demobilization did more to promote skiing than the simple flooding of sports stores with Army surplus skis, boots and parkas.
"The 10th Mountain Division introduced a lot of us to the Rocky Mountains, to the West," said one veteran, Peter W. Seibert. 71, "and to the desirability of the weather and snow here." A native of the White Mountains of New Hampshire, Mr. Seibert came back here after the war. In 1962, he opened the Vail ski resort, now the nation's largest. Other 10th Division veterans returned to Colorado and started ski resorts at Aspen and Steamboat Springs.
"Tenth-Mountain vets founded 12 major ski areas, managed 17 others, and directed 33 ski schools," said Beth Gage, who last year produced and directed with her husband, George, a documentary film on the unit, "Fire on the Mountain."
Overall, 2,000 10th Division veterans moved to ski areas where they worked as instructors, patrolmen and managers, according to unit historians. In New England, unit veterans founded Sugarbush in Vermont, ran Waterville Valley, N.H., and directed ski schools in the Vermont resorts of Bromley and Stowe. The first publisher and the first three editors of Skiing Magazine were 10th Mountain veterans. Promoting mountain sports and conservation, division alumni include David Brower, who became executive director of the Sierra Club; Bill Bowerman, who founded Nike shoes, and Paul Petzoldt, who founded the National Outdoor Leadership School.
In politics, Francis Sargent became Governor of Massachusetts, and Bob Dole became a Senator from Kansas and the presumed Republican Presidential nominee.
"There are very few examples in our country's history where a military division has had such an impact on the culture, economy and spirit of a region," said John Frew, president of Colorado Ski Country USA. This ski resort association was founded in 1963 by Steve Knowlton, another veteran of the 10th Division.
With the unit lending its name to a wilderness trail system in Colorado and stretches of highway in Colorado, New York and Texas, a veritable industry has grown up around telling the unit's tale. Barbara Walton, director of the 10th Mountain Division Resource Center at the Denver Public Library, said 40 books and three major movies had been brought out about the unit.
Mr. Gage, the filmmaker, of Telluride, Colo., said he was stunned to see teen-agers "mesmerized" by his documentary. "People are looking for heroes," he said. "In the last five months, we have sold 2,500 videos out of our garage." The film is to be shown this summer on TNT's National Geographic Explorer.
The 10th Division's story began in 1940 when Charles Dole, founder of the National Ski Patrol System in 1937, watched with admiration as Finnish ski troops exacted heavy casualties from Soviet troops who had invaded in a territorial dispute. Mr. Dole, no relation to the Senator, wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, urging him to set up a mountain division to protect "snow-bound America" from an invasion.
After being given the green light, Mr. Dole decided to turn skiers into soldiers, rather than to turn soldiers into skiers. Using the ski patrol as a recruiting agency, he enlisted Ivy League ski team captains, exiled European athletes and cowboys of Scandinavian origin who had grown up herding cattle on cross-country skis.
Since few American teen-agers could afford a $2 lift ticket during the Depression, skiers tended to be from the upper class.
At the training base, Camp Hale, recently listed on the National Register of Historic Places, soldier-mechanics developed the nation's first snowmobiles and snowcats. But members of the unit slogged on snowshoes with skis and 100-pound packs on their backs, climbing the same mountains that skiers today ascend in 10-minute gondola rides.
In contrast to the current high-tech equipment, the mountain soldiers used hickory skis and bamboo poles. Square-toed leather boots were clamped into bear-trap bindings.
"The maple skis were damn good, but of course that was too expensive for the Army," John McLellan, a 73-year-old veteran, as he rode a ski lift.
As the war evolved, it became clear that German commandos were never going to parachute into the Rockies. Instead, in December 1944, the 10th Mountain Division, strengthened to 14,000 soldiers, with most of the additions non-skiers, crossed the Atlantic to join in the attack on German forces in the northern stretches of the Apennine Mountains in Italy.
Spearheading the campaign, division troops made a daring 2,000-foot ascent of Riva Ridge. They overran German units there, helping to break the back of the German defenses. But victory came at a great cost. In only five months of fighting the division had 992 killed and 4,154 wounded -- a 37 percent casualty rate.
"I went on two ski patrols," Howard R. Koch, an athletic 71-year-old, said, in a gondola interview. "You'd get over the tree line in the Apennines, the Germans would see those ski tracks, and they wouldn't let you have any fun -- Kaboom!"
On the night of April 14, 1945, Lieutenant Dole, a 22-year-old replacement officer with only two months experience with the unit, was cut down by German machine-gun fire, suffering near fatal wounds.
"This Kansas soldier never did learn to ski," Senator Dole stated in a foreword to Soldiers on Skis, a pictorial book on the unit published in 1992 by Boulder's Paladin Press.
But at the reunion luncheon at Keystone, unanimity prevailed over Mr. Dole's full membership in the 10th Division fraternity.
"Dole may have been a flatlander," said Mr. Carmichael, the association's president, "but when he walked into those mountains and got shot -- he was a Mountain man."

HEADLINE: Armed North Korea Troops Again Violate the DMZ

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, April 7

 BODY:
Heavily armed North Korean troops entered the sensitive buffer zone between North and South Korea tonight for the third day in a row, violating the armistice that ended the Korean War, United States and South Korean officials said.
The actions by the North Koreans have heightened tensions on the heavily fortified border, where the cold war has never thawed. But some American and South Korean officials have said the North, by thumbing its nose at the armistice agreement, appears to be making more of a diplomatic gambit than actually preparing for war. 
 "We view these activities of the past three evenings as a series of continuing serious armistice violations, but we see nothing that would warrant particular alarm," said Jim Coles, a spokesman for the United Nations Command, which encompasses American, South Korean and other allied troops in South Korea. In Seoul, people appeared to be calm tonight.
[In Washington, a spokeswoman for the Defense Department, Lieut. Comdr. Karen Jeffries, called the latest incursion by North Korean troops "a serious violation of the armistice, though not unprecedented." She said American officials had not seen an increase in military activity to suggest that North Korea was preparing for war.]
Mr. Coles said between 150 and 180 North Korean troops entered the joint security area at the village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone at about 8:05 P.M. and appeared to be engaging in training exercises. They were carrying weapons including AK-47 assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, recoilless rifles and mortars, but left at 10:45 P.M. without firing a shot.
Officials at South Korea's Ministry of Defense gave a similar account. But one of them said there was some speculation that the number of North Korean troops might have been as high as 400, based on the capacity of the six small trucks and six large trucks used to transport them.
The armistice agreement allows only 35 soldiers from either side from entering the joint security area, and they may carry only sidearms.
North Korea, which has violated the 1953 truce agreement in the past, has made little secret over the years that it wants to dismantle the pact and replace it with a peace treaty between itself and the United States, bypassing South Korea.
On Thursday, the day before the incursions at the demilitarized zone began, the secretive Communist nation declared that it would abandon its role in maintaining the demilitarized zone.
In response to the recent incursions, the United Nations Command has heightened its surveillance over North Korean actions. But Mr. Coles said that contrary to some reports, troops on the border had not gone to a higher level of combat readiness and that there had been no unusual troop movements on either side of the 151-mile-long border other than the Panmunjom incursions. "It's business as usual, even on the North side," he said.
Washington and Seoul are talking about stationing an American Awacs in South Korea or having the South Koreans buy one. Awacs, which stands for airborne warning-and-control system, is a plane with sophisticated equipment for monitoring a battlefield. Mr. Coles said such discussions had been going on for months.
South Koreans also say they hope that the meeting between President Clinton and President Kim Young Sam set for early next week on Cheju Island will send a sign to North Korea that the United States, which has 37,000 troops in this country, remains committed to defending South Korea.
At first the White House had said Mr. Clinton had no time to stop in South Korea on his trip to Japan and Russia. But after South Korean officials pressed for a visit, Mr. Clinton's schedule was changed.
Some analysts said North Korea must realize that Washington would not negotiate a peace treaty without involving Seoul. So the North's recent saber-rattling might be intended more to solicit economic aid to help the Communist country cope with famine and a crumbling economy, just as its threatened nuclear weapons development led to an agreement to supply it with modern atomic power plants and fuel oil.
They said it also could be an effort by Kim Jong Il, who is believed to be the de facto ruler of North Korea, to show his toughness before formally ascending to the high titles held by his late father, Kim Il Sung.

HEADLINE: The U.S. Must Pay Its Dues

BYLINE: By Boutros Boutros-Ghali; Boutros Boutros-Ghali has been Secretary General of the United Nations since 1992.

 BODY:
The United Nations is on the brink of financial disaster. Americans need to know what's going on, because their country took the lead in creating the organization, and its delinquency in paying arrears is threatening it.
When I took office, major challenges lay ahead. With the cold war over, vast new responsibilities were heaped on the United Nations. But resources needed to carry them out were inadequate because many member states were not paying their dues. In addition, the Secretariat, which was underproductive, needed reform. 
 For four years, the Secretariat has carried out its mandates under near-impossible conditions. A perpetual but not very successful effort has been made to convince members to pay up.
In this period, the organization has been streamlined -- as far as the Secretary General's powers permit. The staff is leaner, procedures have been simplified and waste and duplication have been sharply reduced.
For 18 months, I have focused on reducing the operating budget. My proposed $2.5 billion budget for 1996-97 is $98 million less than the previous year's budget. In December, the members asked for $154 million more in cuts. Since then, the we have identified $140 million in cuts, and the rest can be found.
The staff will be reduced. Originally, I had planned not to fill 200 Secretariat positions, but now 800 more must be vacated. In making cuts, I cannot favor one operation over another, and I have to carry out all mandates substantially as required. But no wizardry can achieve cuts of this magnitude without reducing the extent and quality of the work the members want done. The General Assembly, which approves the budget, will not help matters if it nitpicks.
The financial crisis has not been made any easier by the refusal of many to pay dues. The United States and Russian Federation dominate the past-due list. I am grateful that the Federation decided last month to pay $400 million, including its full regular assessment of $46 million for 1996. But America owes $1.5 billion in dues and assessments. Thus, even with the Russians' payment, the United Nations will run out of money by the end of 1996. Incredibly, our cash on hand is under $100 million.
Borrowing from the peacekeeping budget to meet regular operating needs cannot continue much longer. Huge sum are owed to states that have provided troops and equipment for peace operations. Besides, while we carry out old mandates new ones keep coming.
It would be counterproductive to cut off important operations such as democratization in Haiti and the promotion of human rights in Guatemala. These operations are precious for the peoples involved. They are also United Nations success stories.
Still, the stark truth must be faced. Something has to give. If the Haiti and Guatemala operations are to go forward, other obligations must be scaled back or dropped. The members must make that hard call. If they don't, we will run out of money before long.
When the League of Nations collapsed, many members were surprised. They did not understood the depth of its problems. Today, the United Nations, created 51 years ago, is in deep trouble. This time around, there should be no surprises.

HEADLINE: Hanoi Seeks Western Cash but Not Consequences

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, April 7

 BODY:
In Da Nang, the favored paint color seems to be electric blue. Here in the city still popularly known as Saigon it is mostly white. On storefronts and billboards all over the country, neat swatches of paint have recently been applied, under Government orders, to blot out the brand names of foreign consumer products.
Even as Vietnam hustles desperately for foreign investment, it has launched a campaign to obliterate one of the most visible indicators of its success. In a two-month-old campaign against what the Government calls "social evils," foreign advertising has been demonized along with prostitution, gambling and illicit drugs. 
 The seeming contradiction is the product of a watershed moment for Vietnamese leaders. They are engaged in a far-reaching debate as they pause to assess the effects of an economic and social transformation that they themselves unleashed. Their experiment in economic liberalization -- called "doi moi" -- is succeeding in textbook style, but it has brought with it unruly market forces and social changes that threaten the dominance of the Communist Party.
A party congress scheduled for June is expected to take a hard look at the new Vietnam that is emerging. Foreign and Vietnamese analysts say a struggle has already begun over the future direction of the country's policies and over the composition of the leadership itself.
"It is a particularly important moment in Vietnamese history," said Bradley O. Babson, the resident representative of the World Bank. "It has taken on a significance beyond the normal five-yearly party congress. They are coming out of a period of very aggressive openings to the outside world, and the consequences are beginning to become real for them."
As the Government seeks to define its own version of Communist Party control with an open marketplace, one Western ambassador said, the mostly aging leadership is surveying the tumult of a modernizing nation and asking itself, "Is this good?"
Since the "big bang" of liberalization in 1989, as some economists call it, Vietnam's ailing economy has righted itself, investment and exports are up, and the vigor of private enterprise and rising incomes is evident from north to south.In 1990, Vietnam had 100,000 telephones; today it has 800,000. Two years ago, Hanoi had no taxis; now it has a thousand. Last year the nation went from importing rice to being the world's third-leading rice exporter.
This year the economy is expected to grow by more than 9 percent. Inflation, which had soared to 600 percent or higher, is down to around 12 percent. Nearly $18 billion in foreign investment is on the books, with the first big wave of dollars having poured into the country last year.
In one month last year, Vietnam established diplomatic relations with the United States, set up a framework for relations with the European Union and joined the formerly antagonistic regional bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
At the same time, though, gaps between rich and poor and between the fast-developing cities and the lagging countryside have widened rapidly, threatening social instability. With reduced Government support, the quality of education and health care for the poor -- more than half the population -- has deteriorated. Unemployment and underemployment have emerged as problems, along with a migration of poor people to the already overcrowded cities.
But however rough the road, the Western ambassador said, the economic reforms are irreversible.
"You see heated discussions now on ideology and it looks like the leaders are heading away from the pragmatism of doi moi," he said. "But at the same time, the Ministry of Trade has begun discussions on how to reduce tariffs. If you go to the Finance Ministry they are working on a value-added tax. At the Central Bank they are working on a stock market. I think the most important signals are these structural ones relating to trade and investment."
The core issue for the party congress is control. "As Lenin taught, we are not afraid of capitalist enterprises, but of not being able to supervise and control them," the party's General Secretary, Do Muoi, said last December.
Despite the clear success of economic liberalization, the party appears to be determined to maintain a central role for state-owned enterprises. Do Duc Dinh, an analyst with the Institute on World Economy in Hanoi, said that 15 to 17 "strategic industries," including energy, transportation, steel and oil, would continue to dominate the economy under state control in the decades ahead.
"The private sector has grown very fast, but the Government still sees the state sector as the main sector," he said.
The sudden attempt to supervise and control foreign advertising earlier this year rattled the confidence of the American entrepreneurs who have staked claims here since President Clinton lifted an economic embargo two years ago. Already they had begun to complain that Vietnam, with its shaky legal structure, its corruption and its exhausting, multilevel bureaucracy was a bigger challenge than they had realized.
"There was a certain sense for a while this year that perhaps things had stalled out," said Michael J. Scown, a lawyer with the Washington-based firm Russin & Vecchi who heads the American Chamber of Commerce in Ho Chi Minh City. "People were wondering whether reforms were going to continue, or whether there would now be a backlash against foreign investment. You would hear things from the Vietnamese like, 'We've got enough representative offices already. We don't need any more.' "
Like others who monitor the situation here, Mr. Scown said that both Vietnamese and foreigners were holding their breath now, waiting for the results of the party congress.
"Nobody knows what policies will come out or who the policymakers will be," he said. "Everything is on hold. There's also something of the flavor of an American election year with a lot of rhetoric about law and order and protecting traditional Vietnamese values."
For Vietnam today these are new and genuine concerns.
"The real issue under the surface is the issue of national identity," said Mr. Babson, of the World Bank. "There is a question where the country is headed."
Last November, Ha Dang, a member of the Communist Party Central Committee, summarized the dangers that face the party as "lagging behind economically; deviation from socialist orientation; red tape and corruption; and peaceful evolution."
"Peaceful evolution" -- what the party fears from such influences as foreign advertising -- is an Asian Communist term referring to a Western conspiracy to impose capitalism by peaceful means. And it has never been better defined than by President Clinton when he announced the establishment of diplomatic relations last July.
"Increased contact between Americans and Vietnamese will advance the cause of freedom in Vietnam just as it did in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union," Mr. Clinton said.
Or as some Vietnamese commentators have suggested, the United States is still trying to win the Vietnam war, this time with consumer goods instead of B-52's.

HEADLINE: How to Turn Around a Magazine for Walkers

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY 

 BODY:
Everyone loves a success story. Particularly the beleaguered magazine industry, where 7 out of 10 start-ups fail within a decade.
This story is about Jan Thaw Bruce, a woman with a tenacious belief in a foundering magazine devoted to walking. With the magazine in its death throes, Ms. Bruce, who was then its publisher, raised more than $1 million, acquired the publication from her boss and persuaded staff members to stay on without pay until the magazine could be repositioned and turned around. 
 Started as The Walking Magazine in 1986 by Raben Publishing, a small Boston-based publisher of sports and fitness magazines, it began life with a circulation of 250,000, aimed at older people who liked to walk. Newsstand and direct-mail response were strong, and circulation grew to more than 400,000 in three years.
But the magazine was not making money. In 1990, with the industry in a deepening recession, the owners put the magazine up for sale.
There were no takers, and no wonder. Walking is an improbable subject for a magazine -- neither a competitive sport nor even an athletic endeavor. It requires no special expertise, no special equipment and certainly no special clothing. Not even special shoes.
Ms. Bruce saw things differently. In 1980, as associate circulation director at Rolling Stone, she had learned a valuable lesson about the importance of positioning a magazine correctly.
Rolling Stone had been started as a music magazine but was later repositioned as the magazine for the rock-and-roll generation.
"The whole spin for the magazine came together," Ms. Bruce said of Rolling Stone. "The vision for the product was right and it spoke to a generation. It leaped ahead into a general-interest category."
With that model in mind, Ms. Bruce, who had started as circulation director and then became publisher of The Walking Magazine, presented the owners with a new marketing strategy: aim the magazine's sights a generation lower than the older readers it was then attracting.
"As the baby-boomer generation was walking into middle age, growing up, having careers and families and needed to stay fit, I saw that walking could have a tremendous role to play as an effective fitness activity," she said.
When the owners began to talk about closing the magazine, Ms. Bruce went to investors and began to raise money herself.
Within six months she assembled an investment group, raised more than $1 million, founded Walking Inc., acquired the publication and changed the title from The Walking Magazine to Walking. Staff members agreed to stay on and went without pay for two weeks before eventually being reimbursed.
A new ad sales staff was hired. Subscription prices were raised by 26 percent. And the magazine was repositioned as the authoritative publication about walking.
The gamble worked. In 1994, Cowles Magazines Inc., a unit of the Cowles Media Company, bought Walking for $9.4 million. The new owners have invested in circulation and much-needed reader research. They also called in J. C. Suares, a well-known illustrator who has redesigned many magazines. As a result, Walking is more accessible and makes greater use of graphics, short secondary articles and charts. The first two redesigned issues, June and August, saw 50 percent increases in newsstand sales, Ms. Bruce said.
The magazine's main topics are health, fitness and, of course, walking. There are articles on body strength and inner strength, weight-reduction pills, nutrition and tips about botanical-based skin care products.
Ms. Bruce, who took the title of managing director, said the magazine was now "just about profitable."
Walking's primary audience is now 25 to 54 years old, with women making up almost 70 percent of the readers.
The most recent figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations show an average circulation of 510,000 an issue for Walking, which comes out six times a year. This gives Walking a larger circulation than Runner's World, Outside or Bicycling.
In 1995, Walking had 300 ad pages, up 2 percent from 1994. Advertisers include Reebok, Nike, Nordic Track, Kraft, Lipton, Excedrin and the Better Sex Video Series.
"This magazine has an active audience and people tend to be somewhat upscale," said Mike Gross, president of Paragon Media Inc., a media-buying consultancy. "After gardening, walking is the No. 1 recreational activity. It's something that people do for exercise no matter what their age. I recommended Walking to clients for 1995 and I'm recommending it for 1996."
Walking is testing offshoots of the magazine, including a newsletter, a walking program and affiliations with more than 800 walking clubs around the country. Ms. Bruce has also tried to sell the company's walking program to health care companies for their members.
"Our success fits in with major trends," she said. "People now see that fitness is a sort of cornerstone to good health, which wasn't the case 20 years ago."
Now, her mission over and her magazine up and running, Ms. Bruce has decided to move on. She has taken a job as senior vice president and general manager of consumer sales at Individual Inc., a company based in Burlington, Mass., that supplies customized business news to companies and individuals.
"This is a fascinating time to be in publishing," she said. "A new set of rules for media is about to be created and I want to be part of that."

HEADLINE: Global Talks Covering Phones Near Deadline

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Negotiators from 51 countries are racing against the clock at the World Trade Organization in Geneva this month, hoping to meet their self-imposed deadline of April 30 for an agreement on liberalizing trade in telecommunications.
At stake is the future of the global telecommunications industry, and possibly of the World Trade Organization itself. The goal of the talks is to open domestic telecommunications markets to foreign companies, potentially saving consumers billions of dollars. But an agreement would also put many sluggish national telephone companies at risk of being trampled by more efficient foreign competitors. 
 But political battles and fears by some countries that their home-grown companies will be no match for foreign competition have put the talks in jeopardy.
Last week the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, warned that the negotiations would "soon be in serious trouble" unless other countries made more generous liberalization offers.
And the director general of the World Trade Organization, Renato Ruggiero, expressed concern "about the amount of work still to be done," saying it would be "simply unacceptable" to let the talks fail.
The United States set the pace of the Geneva negotiations in February when it offered to throw open its telecommunications market to foreign companies provided the other countries that have so far made liberalization offers agreed to improve those offers.
"We are ready to open up a $213 billion a year market -- $100 billion worth of local calls, $100 billion worth of long-distance calls and $13 billion worth of international calls -- if other countries do likewise," said a senior American trade negotiator who asked not to be identified.
In addition to better access to foreign telecommunications markets, American officials said they were seeking a binding agreement insuring even-handed regulation of competing companies. The organization would enforce such an agreement, imposing sanctions on offenders.
So far, however, American trade officials have insisted that foreign liberalization offers made in Geneva are insufficient, raising fears that the United States might again walk away from an agreement, just as it did last summer on the deal to free trade in financial services.
"Most of the offers from U.S. trading partners are simply deficient," said Kim N. Wallace, a telecommunications analyst with Lehman Brothers. "Some do not seem aimed at a successful conclusion of the talks at all."
And at a meeting of European Union foreign ministers on March 25, Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's trade negotiator, tried to persuade member governments to improve their offers, ending all restrictions on foreign providers in 1998. But his efforts were blocked by the hostility of powerful state-owned telecommunications monopolies, in a sense, undercutting the European Union's negotiating authority.
While 38 of the 51 governments participating in the negotiations have made offers so far, the quality of the offers varies, American trade officials said. Some countries, including Venezuela, Hungary and the Czech Republic, want liberalization. But many developing countries, including India, South Africa and Malaysia, have yet to make offers, and other proposals have been deemed less than satisfactory by American negotiators.
What is at stake in the negotiations is much more than increased competition leading to lower charges and better service for telephone, fax and telex users. When the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations ended with the creation of the World Trade Organization last year, this new body was given the immediate task of negotiating three agreements: freeing trade in financial services, in telecommunications and in maritime transport.
Its record so far, however, is unimpressive. Last summer the Clinton Administration refused to sign an agreement allowing foreign banks, insurers and other financial service companies better access to the United States market because it said other countries were not offering enough access in return.
Then last month, Sir Leon warned that the talks on liberalizing sea transport -- due to end in June -- were "not going very well." He called for a "change of heart on the part of the United States," which has refused to dismantle a 76-year-old law restricting trade between American ports to American ships.
"Three failures in a row would be a bad blow for W.T.O.'s role as a forum for negotiating freer trade, leaving it as only a depository for trade complaints," said Gary C. Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. The institute calculates that a successful telecommunications agreement could save consumers $100 million a year over the next decade.
A Federal Communications Commission study published in January found that roughly half the $4.3 billion that American phone companies paid foreign monopolies in 1994 to deliver overseas calls went straight to the bottom line as profit.
The fear that the World Trade Organization might be heading for another failure, diplomats said, helped explain why Mr. Ruggiero was pressing behind the scenes for a special world trade conference next year to inject new political momentum into multilateral trade liberalization and to strengthen his organization's role.
Some of the difficulties of the talks are shown by the position of the 15-nation European Union, which negotiates as a single body. While the union is offering in principle to extend the planned liberalization of its internal telecommunications market in 1998 to the rest of the world, a number of exceptions remain.
Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland want to delay opening their domestic markets until the year 2000 or 2003, while Belgium plans to continue rationing the award of radio licenses. And these exceptions have been used as excuses by developing countries for not making more generous offers themselves.
Developing countries have defended their restrictive position by saying their domestic telecommunications industries would be hurt by free trade.
But the World Bank disagrees, contending in a recent study that opening these countries' telecommunications industries to outsiders would help attract the estimated $60 billion they need over the next five years to bring the industries up to the standards of the industrial world.

HEADLINE: The Young and Restless Audience: Fine Tuning -- A special report;
Computers, Cable and Videos Cut Into Children's TV-Watching Time

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
Through the years in TV land, an advertiser seeking the eyes and ears of children knew pretty much where to find them. So Bucky Beaver might pitch Ipana toothpaste during "The Mickey Mouse Club," Maypo could promote porridge on "Captain Kangaroo" and Mattel could send Barbie waltzing through the commercial breaks of "Garfield and Friends."
But these days marketers seeking the pre-teen-age mass audience have a tougher time of it, because of a trend that has been quietly developing for more than a decade. 
 Simply put: Children watch less television than they used to.
Weekly television viewing hours among children ages 2 to 11 are down 18 percent from a dozen years ago, according to Nielsen Media Research.
And even when a child is perched in front of a television these days, he or she is part of an increasingly fragmented audience. Some are watching free over-the-air programs, while others gravitate toward cable channels.
One activity not captured by these Nielsen numbers is videocassette viewing. While this activity may look a lot like TV watching to many parents, it is considered something completely separate by the advertising industry, because videocassettes contain no conventional advertising.
And now that one-third of households in the United States have personal computers, a growing number of children are forsaking at least part of their TV time to gaze into the cool glow of a computer monitor.
No wonder advertisers are looking beyond conventional television in search of the more than $7.3 billion in spending money that American children have jingling in their piggy banks each year. "To reach kids, you have to be in a lot of different places," said Jack Irving, executive director of the New York office of Saatchi & Saatchi, the advertising agency. "New technologies and other activities are beginning to take them away."
Make no mistake: most of the nation's 28.2 million children ages 2 to 11 still spend more time watching television than they devote to almost any other activity -- an average of 21 hours and 38 minutes a week.
But that is down more than five hours a week from the mid-1980's, according to Nielsen.
And the falloff is all the more striking because it has come in an era when television viewing in the United States has held steady over all, with some groups, like adult men, watching even more than they did a dozen years ago.
So where has the young audience wandered? There are few definitive studies.
But a recent New York Times survey found that in households with at least one child in the 2-to-12 age range, slightly more than half the homes reported that the child had watched television "some" or "a lot" during the previous day. And yet, the survey also found that in one-third of those households the child had spent time watching a videocassette.
And in perhaps the most revealing new clue to how today's children are spending their time -- and the biggest new challenge to advertisers -- the survey found that in 33 percent of the households the child had used a computer "some" or "a lot" on the previous day.
"I'd rather have the girls do almost anything else than watch TV," said Tracy Levin of Birmingham, Ala., explaining why she and her husband recently bought their daughters a Gateway 2000 PC and opened an America Online account for the family.
Like many teen-agers today, 13-year-old Shoshanna Levin was already proficient with PC's. And now her 4-year-old sister, Alison, is getting up to speed.
With children like the Levin girls in mind, advertisers are casting a wider net. McDonald's, which once might have reached most of the Happy Meal clientele with Saturday morning ads on CBS programs like "Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles," now more carefully picks its spots among broadcast programs, while also buying time on the Nickelodeon children's cable channel, taking out ads in the related Nickelodeon magazine and experimenting with an interactive McDonald's game on Nickelodeon Online, one of the leading sites for children on the America Online computer service.
Recognizing that children with PC's and on-line access tend to come from the relatively well-to-do households that consumer marketers covet, McDonald's also has its own "McFamily" site on America Online. Other marketers trying to reach children on line include the Kellogg Company, Nintendo, Pepsico, Toys "R" Us and Nabisco, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings.
"The dollars being committed are really viewed as research-and-development spending," said Erica Gruen, director of media services at the advertising agency Merkley Newman Harty and a former senior vice president at Saatchi & Saatchi Interactive.
"But there is a truism that advertising follows eyeballs," Ms. Gruen said. "This year we will see a lot of dollars chasing kids on line."
Jane Dukes, McDonald's manager of marketing communications, said that so far the company's on-line efforts were considered more a marketing of the McDonald's brand than they were advertisements for products. But that could change.
"We think we have to innovate, be relevant and stay contemporary," Ms. Dukes said, "because if cyberspace is where our customers are, that is where we want to be."
It is not clear, though, whether parents want marketers to be there.
The Center for Media Education, a nonprofit research and lobbying group in Washington, recently released a six-month study of World Wide Web sites and on-line services directed at children.
Among the concerns raised by the report were potential invasions of family privacy through unwitting children: at some sites, a child may be invited to play a computer game, to join a club or to enter a contest. But to do so, the child may be required to answer questions asking how old the child is, how old the family's other children are, what movie they saw last, what toys they like and what their parents do for a living.
To many parents, "computers still have this 'halo effect' as something new and wonderful, something they'd rather have kids do than sit in front of the TV," Kathryn C. Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education and a co-author of the report, said when it was released. "But it's in no way safe from the kinds of advertising and marketing practices that can harm kids."
The report angered some of the marketers cited, including Kellogg and Nabisco, which said that the criticisms were overly broad, because no two on-line sites were alike.
"We're confident that the information provided on our home page is consistent with children's advertising guidelines," said Anthony Hebron, a spokesman for Kellogg. "Anyone providing personal information or E-mail addresses on our site is doing so on a strictly voluntary basis."
Regardless of what the social merits of on-line outreach may be, some television executives, like Geraldine B. Laybourne, who recently became president of Disney/ABC Cable Networks after serving as president of the Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite cable services, see the PC as their most threatening rival for audiences. "Computers are not as faddish as video games," Ms. Layborne said. "They are far more interesting."

The Choices
More Sources Of Programming
Computers, of course, account for only a portion of the falloff and fragmentation of the children's television viewing audience. Market studies and demographic trends point to other factors as well.
Data from Nielsen indicate that even when children are sitting in front of the television, increasingly it is to view a rented or purchased videocassette, like the Disney movie "Pocahontas."
Not only does a video mean that the parent or child -- not a broadcasting executive -- is acting as programmer, videos are also a limited-access medium for marketers and advertisers.
The beginning of the "Pocahontas" tape, for example, presents a parade of Disney promotions: for Walt Disney World; for a Disney video game; for a coming animated feature, "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," and for older Disney films that are available on video.
Cable programming for children also helps to fragment an audience that once could be counted on to watch the Saturday-morning cartoons of ABC, CBS and NBC.
Today, though only about two-thirds of the nation's households subscribe to cable, one cable programmer, Nickelodeon, has 4 of the 10 programs most watched by children ages 2 to 11. The rest are broadcast by the Fox network, whose "Goosebumps," a series of ghost stories, late on Friday afternoons, is the most popular children's show. Nickelodeon is owned by Viacom Inc., and Fox is owned by the News Corporation.
And many children spend more time than they did a decade ago in weekend and after-school sports or other activities, according to a Nickelodeon/Yankelovich study released last November. More children, too, spend at least part of their week in paid day care -- including nearly one-third of pre-schoolers today, compared with 23 percent five years ago, according to the Census Bureau.
The example of Shelia Martin and Donald Alexis of Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, sheds light on day care's television impact.
Ms. Martin is director of the New York City Partnership, a nonprofit developer of affordable homes for moderate-income buyers. Her husband, Mr. Alexis, works at the Park Slope Food Co-op.
Their 5-year-old son, Stephen, a kindergartner, attends an after-school program at the YWCA of Brooklyn, where his 3-year-old sister, Darian, goes to Montessori school. Neither child watches television at the Y, and their parents strictly limit viewing at home.
"The children don't get home until 6:30 P.M.," Ms. Martin said. "They can watch one half-hour a night after school and two hours each on the weekend."

The Money
Class Division At a Young Age?
If the children's television audience is becoming more fragmented, it may be breaking along economic fault lines. One-third of the nation's households do not subscribe to cable television, and income appears to be a factor in who does. The average income of households with cable in 1995 was $43,637, compared with $38,853 for all American households, according to Media Mark Research Inc.
So far, the sheer volume of viewers that the over-the-air broadcasts like Fox's "Goosebumps" can still attract enables broadcasters to charge higher ad rates than cable programmers can. One advertising executive, insisting on anonymity, said a broadcast network might be able to charge $5.50 per thousand viewers for advertising on a popular children's program, compared with $3 per thousand on a similarly popular cable program.
But the executive said that the price gap would not necessarily continue. And certainly Nickelodeon, now in 63 million homes, is benefiting financially from its popularity: its advertising revenues soared 18 percent last year, to an estimated $277 million, from 1994, according to Paul Kagan Associates, a cable industry research and consulting firm.
Yet for advertisers, even cable is not an automatic conduit to the children with the biggest piggy banks. Various data, including the recent New York Times survey, indicate that the children in the most affluent homes may be the ones spending the least time on television of any sort. Many children's advertisers, as a result, are looking more carefully at print, said Robert Horne, executive vice president at Griffin Bacal, the advertising agency that represents Hasbro and Discovery Zone.
A number of children's publications have been created since 1989, including Sports Illustrated for Kids. And even some children's cable programmers, like Nickelodeon and Disney Adventures, have branched out into magazines.
Nickelodeon magazine, which has a circulation of 550,000, is seeing significant growth in paid advertising pages -- 220 last year, compared with 178 in 1994, according to the publisher, Lynn Lehmkuhl.
From an advertiser's perspective, Mr. Horne said, magazines "supplement what you do on television, so you create a synergy between what kids are reading and viewing."
As advertisers sift through the fragmenting children's audience, some experts on children's television wonder what the trend means for the nation's youth.
"It is the rare child who would not watch the most popular TV shows, but wealthy kids are doing more sophisticated things, too," said Joan Ganz Cooney, the founder and executive chairman of the Children's Television Workshop and the driving force behind "Sesame Street" and other educational children's television programs.
Ms. Cooney adheres to the philosophy that the best children's television programming helps give the nation's youth a common basis for understanding the world.
Whether most broadcast television programming has ever fulfilled that potential is debatable, of course. But because much of the popular children's programming is gravitating toward cable, where less affluent children may not follow, Ms. Cooney worries about their ability to share in mainstream cultural experiences. And the home PC may increase the fragmentation, she said.
"Now the differential will be widened further by computers in the home," Ms. Cooney said. "The children in more affluent homes are being prepared for the future at a very young age."

HEADLINE: Books on Tape Inc. Carves Out Quiet Niche Among Big Publishing Houses

BYLINE: By ANDY MEISLER 

DATELINE: COSTA MESA, Calif.

 BODY:
In 1975, when a former Olympic rower named Duvall Y. Hecht founded Books on Tape Inc., his plan to market audiocassettes containing complete spoken-word versions of printed books was considered foolhardy, even eccentric.
By the mid-1980's, when publishers like Random House, a unit of Advance Publications, and Simon & Schuster began pushing "audio books," or condensed versions of best sellers and self-help books, the most important part of Mr. Hecht's business strategy -- offering unabridged recordings of a wide variety of books -- was rejected by these publishing giants as impractical. 
 Today, while the mainstream audio-book industry has mushroomed into a fiercely competitive $1.4 billion business, Mr. Hecht, 65, maintains a genteely profitable cottage industry.
"If anything, their success has resulted in increased business for us," said the silver-haired Mr. Hecht.
Indeed, the continued health of Books on Tape reflects the fact that niche opportunities remain as the publishing industry searches for mass markets in new media.
"When people who've been buying abridgments find us, they think they've died and gone to heaven," said Mr. Hecht over lunch near his company's headquarters in this seaside community in Orange County.
Heaven, by the definition of Mr. Hecht and his customers, is the ability to cushion oneself against grueling commutes by listening to, say, 12 hours of "Economics of Crisis" by Eliot Janeway or seven hours of "Northanger Abbey" by Jane Austen on tape.
Mr. Hecht's larger rivals publish and sell a limited number of titles, typically six to eight a month, in severely edited one- or two-cassette versions. Books on Tape rents and sells an eclectic range of about 3,000 titles, which come in packages of 90 minutes, 6 hours, or 15 hours of cassettes. The company commits every word in the printed version to tape.
Books on Tape contends, without serious challenge, that it publishes the world's largest selection of unabridged audio books -- from "The Client" by John Grisham to "Down and Out in Paris and London" by George Orwell and the complete works of Winston Churchill.
The big publishers' audio books are usually sold in retail bookstores, with all the rewards for successfully appealing to a large audience, as well as the heavy penalties for misjudging public demand.
Books on Tape rents and sells its products almost exclusively through the mail. Mr. Hecht said his privately held company reported $10 million in annual revenue last year. That might be barely a blip on the publishing industry's radar screen but some 150,000 customers receive Books on Tape's 300-page catalogue.
About a third of the company's business is sales to libraries that pay an average of $60 a title. A core group of about 85,000 individuals are steady renters, Mr. Hecht said. Some spend up to $1,000 a year on tapes, which cost $9 to $20 each for 30 days.
"For the price of a two-hour freeze-dried abridgment they can get the full story told in the author's own words," Mr. Hecht said.
At the company's office in a converted sailmaker's loft, dozens of books being considered for recording line the bookshelves. "A lot of these are suggested or actually sent to us by our customers," said Mr. Hecht, who oversees a staff of 65.
On a second-floor balcony, a dozen or so tape decks are busy duplicating titles from master cassettes. More than 350,000 sets of rental tapes leave the building each year; about 99 percent eventually return.
To the mainstream audio-book industry, the idea of concentrating on a relatively small number of customers -- and the postage- and labor-intensive operation that supplies them with easily copied rental tapes -- is out of the question.
Seth Gershel, publisher of the audio division of Simon & Schuster, owned by Viacom Inc., which controls about a third of the market, said: "If we did what Books on Tape did, we would not be moving enough units, reaching enough customers. It would put us out of business."
Mr. Hecht said that Books on Tape is almost completely immune to the twin perils of the mass-market book business: press runs that are too small, frustrating potential customers, and overly optimistic sales predictions, which leave the publisher eventually swallowing thousands of unsold books.
"Except for a few big titles, for which we stock 500 or 1,000 tapes, we have no backlog to speak of," Mr. Hecht said.
Rather than hire the television and movie stars that the big publishers generally use to record audio books, Books on Tape employs experienced regional actors.
The company also economizes by recording books in the public domain and sublicensing unabridged recording rights, often on a nonexclusive basis, from big publishers issuing their own abridged editions. The authors whose works are published by Books on Tape typically receive a small advance and a royalty of 10 percent of all sales and rentals.
"They're not getting rich from us, but I haven't heard many complaints," Mr. Hecht said.
Mr. Hecht is quite satisfied with the way things have gone. After winning a gold medal in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, he entered the financial industry. The idea for Books on Tape was born in 1973, during an hourlong commute from his Orange County home to his securities firm office in Los Angeles.
Mr. Hecht and Sigrid Hecht, then his wife, invested $100,000 in the business. Another $100,000 was provided by a group of silent partners who own a third of the company stock.
 The first title issued by Books on Tapes was "Paper Lion" by George Plimpton. Within a few years the business had moved out of the Hechts' living room. It has since attracted several smaller rivals, most notably Recorded Books Inc., based in Prince Frederick, Md., which offers about half as many titles as Books on Tape.
 "That competition keeps us sharp," Mr. Hecht said. "If you believe in the free market, as I do, the important thing is for the customer to have what he wants and to have it in profusion."

HEADLINE: Jury-Duty Dodgers Tell It to the Judge;
After He Hears Their Best Whoppers, a Get-Serious Warning

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
A summons for jury duty in New York State these days arrives with a bunch of tender little carrots dangling from it. Like, say, shorter service. Expanded lists, so that everyone else will be roped in, too. A juror-complaint person. Comfortable chairs. And court employees who have had to attend niceness training seminars. So, nibble, nibble?
This is not, however, about the new carrot inducements to lure prospective jurors from their hiding places. 
 This is about what happens to those who refuse to bite.
This is about the stick.
Every Friday morning, hearings are held in a Manhattan courtroom, affording the indignant and the sheepish an opportunity to tell their best whoppers to a judge. One after another, they offer theories about why they appear to have ignored years of summonses for jury duty, why they should not now be fined $250 and why they should not start jury service immediately.
The Friday hearings are obviously perceived as a last-ditch, get-serious warning, because proportionally, people respond in far greater numbers than they do to the earlier waves of jury summonses. A morning's calendar may have 60 cases, and usually about 40 people show up. They are held weekly only in Manhattan, which has the greatest need for jurors and the greatest number of evaders.
One recent Friday morning, an Upper West Side therapist approached the bench, confident, annoyed. Years ago, he said, the city changed the address of his corner building, from the street to the avenue, and he still hasn't been getting all his mail. So the fault for his seeming juror scofflaw status lay not with him, but with the post office.
Vincent Homenick, Manhattan's earnest and indefatigable chief jury clerk, ominously rattled a computer printout and reeled off a half-dozen dates since 1989 on which notices to the therapist had been mailed.
Justice Louis I. Kaplan fixed the therapist with a deeply skeptical gaze. "You haven't gotten mail on all those dates?" asked Justice Kaplan, who always presides over the Friday hearings in State Supreme Court. "What about the most recent one? It has the right address. And why didn't any of the other letters come back to us?"
The therapist sputtered. Sized up his options. And then punted. "Well, aren't there any exemptions?"
Actually, no. On Jan. 1, professional exemptions, covering some 20 lines of work, were ended. Even so, the therapist would not have been covered because he has a master's degree, not a Ph.D.
"What about my patients?" he tried.
"Change their hours," replied Justice Kaplan, who handed him a $35 judgment and a May date to start jury duty.
Cruel? Heartless? Court officials want to know just how much groveling they have to do to attract jurors to serve. Innovations to increase juror enrollment and decrease juror misery throughout the state have just kicked into high gear, largely at the urging of Judith S. Kaye, New York State's top judge. In civil trials, judges now supervise and sometimes take over the questioning of jurors, cutting down on intrusiveness and expansiveness by lawyers. Overnight stays for deliberating juries are no longer mandatory. By 1998, jurors' daily fees will rise to $40 from the current $15.
And no longer are the same people being called over and over. Names are now drawn from five sources: lists of registered voters, the unemployed, those on public assistance, taxpayers and drivers. Podiatrists and embalmers are among the professionals who can no longer duck service. The same goes for doctors, lawyers and police officers (all three of whom were represented on a recent Manhattan murder jury). Returns are improving so much that in many counties, jurors need only serve one day if they are not selected for a trial.
In Manhattan, that required term of service has been whittled down to three days from two weeks. Norman Goodman, the County Clerk of Manhattan, said the percentage of jurors who were showing up for service had doubled from January's, to nearly 30 percent. "It's a miracle!" exclaimed the incredulous Mr. Goodman, who said this was the first real good news he'd had since taking office in 1969.
But not everyone is getting with the program. In Manhattan, which has the most jury trials of any jurisdiction in the state and which consumes jurors at a voracious rate, some 30,000 people have resisted the urge to serve, and their cases are pending.
For them, there does come a moment when the normally accommodating Mr. Homenick, who has heard every juror excuse conceivable, stops being Mr. Nice Guy.
So exactly how many times can someone ignore a summons before the system starts sending those nasty-grams? Mr. Homenick declined to specify. "We don't want your readers to know how many notices they can just chuck in the garbage," he said.
As chief clerk of the jury division, Mr. Homenick has even been sent obscene responses to his summonses ("makes you wonder what kind of jurors they'd be," he said). He vows that he does try to give breaks to people in tight situations. Although the exemptions for sole proprietors have been tanked, he will, for example, try to figure out whether there is a seasonal aspect to their work and schedule jury service during their slower months.
And he will grant temporary exemptions to a person who can show that three days of jury service will cause extreme financial hardship. "That means compromising the ability to support themselves and their families," said Mr. Homenick, during a break in the Friday hearing. "But we've had doctors come in and complain that they'd lose $10,000 in billing for three days. Do you think they're the kind of people who will have trouble feeding their families?"
The hearing resumed. Another prospective juror, a woman from Hell's Kitchen, approached Justice Kaplan. According to Mr. Homenick's records, the woman had not answered inquiries sent to her home repeatedly over the last 18 months.
"So?" Justice Kaplan said.
She took a deep breath and said evenly, "Due to my emotional problems and chemical dependencies, your honor, I don't think I'm an appropriate juror at this time."
Justice Kaplan, who has heard dozens of stories, asked for proof. She produced a letter from her doctor. "This just says you're being treated by him," the justice said gruffly. "How do I know it's not for an earache?"
The woman pointed to the letterhead. "That's a methadone clinic," she said, blushing. The justice hastily excused her.
Most pleaders do have the forethought to bring documentation and witnesses to support their case: passports, tax documents, copies of letters, even their lawyers (although a paralegal who brought a lawyer to argue that she was indispensable to their firm was fined the full $250). Once, a secretary to a building contractor brought her boss, who thundered that he would not be able to work if his assistant went on jury duty. In ringing tones, the contractor summed up: "And if she does, I'll fire her!"
For a long moment, the silence in the courtroom hung thick and threatening. Then Justice Kaplan broke it. He not only ordered the secretary to start jury duty the following Monday, but also ordered the boss to do his service immediately after hers was finished. And if the secretary wound up being fired for doing her civic duty, said the justice, he would hold the boss in criminal contempt.
In fact, it would appear that if a pleader's goal is to reduce a fine or further delay jury service, belligerence should not be the tactic of choice.
Adrienne Gorman, another therapist, stormed up to the bench, her short hair quivering. Mr. Homenick conceded that Ms. Gorman had served in 1982 and deliberated on juries in 1987 and 1991 but said that she had refused to sign the summonses mailed to her in 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995.
"I know many people who haven't been called," Ms. Gorman snapped. "When they have served two times, I'd be very happy to serve again. But not until."
Justice Kaplan icily told her that she had to serve, starting in mid-May. "I'll be a hostile juror, then!" Ms. Gorman said.
He fined her $50.
"I'm not paying," Ms. Gorman said.
If a judgment for not complying with a jury summons goes unpaid, it is entered on one's record. That means whenever the adversely judged wants a line of credit or a mortgage, the unpaid judgment will pop up.
All morning long, the grumpy parade marched up to Justice Kaplan. Some began unctuously: They really, really believed in jury duty and would just love to serve -- except they had a problem.
Said one pleader: "I couldn't show up for jury duty that day because I was in so much pain that I had to go to the emergency room!" With a flourish, he produced his medical bill.
The justice scoured it and scowled. "But this says you were only there for a few hours!"
Another pleader tried his luck. "I'm in the export business and I travel a good deal, so I can justify all 10 of those adjournments for jury duty!" he announced.
Justice Kaplan was not bowled over. "But it's not up to you to justify them," he said. "Pay a fine of $100 and start serving in May."

HEADLINE: Cities Are Digging Deep and Wide as Congress Tightens Purse

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
When Congress began swinging its ax in earnest last fall at the Federal deficit, somebody forgot to tell Amarillo to duck.
The transportation spending bill that Republican legislators pushed to passage in November whacked $225,000 off the annual subsidy to the 13-bus transit department in the Texas panhandle city. A political impasse over poverty programs bottled up a $48,000 allotment for summer jobs for youths in Amarillo. 
 A White House veto of another Republican spending bill put housing programs on a month-to-month budget that is shaving about $100,000 a year from Federal subsidies to poor renters in the city. More reductions loom.
"Assuming the worst, we're looking at a 33 percent cut in funding" for aid to the homeless, said Vicki Covey, assistant director of community services in Amarillo, "and I'm starting to assume the worst."
What is striking after six months of Republican-inspired parsimony, though, is how seldom the worst has occurred so far. Some belts have surely tightened, as Republican leaders promised, and millions have in fact felt the pinch of Federal-spending restraints, sometimes painfully, as President Clinton has warned.
But Congress is already loosening other cinches, agreeing to restore money to programs and agencies it had vowed to slash only months ago when elections seemed less imminent. And some targets of Republican budget cuts have discovered, a bit grudgingly, that it is possible to make do with less Federal financing than they had been accustomed to.
Facing at least a 23 percent cut in Federal subsidies to employ teen-age students this summer in city parks and offices, Sacramento, Calif., and Pittsburgh are recruiting private businesses to fill the breach with hundreds of jobs of their own. Louisville dug into its own budget for $600,000 in summer-jobs money.
Memphis decided that it could renovate the historic Exchange Building into 270 apartments with a smaller dollop of Federal aid than it had counted on. Iowa's State Legislature may make up some of the money that a deeply suspicious Congress has withheld from the Legal Services Corporation, the federally financed agency that helps provide lawyers' services to the poor.
The Amarillo Transit Department, which ferries a half-million mostly working-class passengers each year, planned for a 50 percent cut in service when the Transportation Department sliced its subsidy in November. Instead, the state government dug deep and ponied up the lost $225,000, at least for this year. Which is not to say that anyone is happy about his new circumstances.
"This year, we're O.K.," said the city's transit manager, Wayne Pelton. "Now, from there on, I can't say what's going to happen."
In fact, any respite from spending cuts may be temporary, because both Congress and the White House insist that they have just begun to clamp down on domestic spending.
Republicans say spending in this fiscal year on so-called domestic discretionary programs -- most domestic spending, except for the military and entitlements like welfare and Medicare -- will be $23 billion less than was forecast when they took control in January 1995. As envisioned by the Republicans, spending in real dollars (the amount adjusted for inflation) would more or less drop steadily as the Federal budget moved toward balance in 2002.
Mr. Clinton has denounced the "extreme Republican effort to balance the budget through wrongheaded cuts and misplaced priorities," but his latest budget also proposes real cuts in domestic spending later this decade, followed by modest increases in 2001 and 2002.
It is too early to say with precision how deeply this year's budget reductions will eventually bite. Some Federal programs are financed with 1996 allotments earmarked for 1997 expenses, so that state and local governments will not feel the effects of cuts until they begin to spend it some months from now.
Federal aid to schools, which is usually parceled out in the winter to be spent when classes begin in the following autumn, is one example. This year's budget battle has stalled passage of legislation setting a budget for education spending, and schools are complaining that they cannot hire teachers and buy supplies for September's classes until it is settled.
Scores of other programs are limping by on monthly stipends, usually at or slightly below 1995 spending levels, while Republicans and Democrats continue fighting over permanent budgets for the programs. They include social programs like nutrition services for the aged and adult day care that may not be major bones of contention in Washington, but have gotten caught up in the larger legislative battles.
"It's housing, economic development, riverfront trail development -- a whole potpourri of initiatives," said Margaret McCormick Barron, director of intergovernmental relations for Pittsburgh. "To the best of my knowledge, we've not had to stop anything. But we've had to be very, very creative in our planning."
And then there are many federally financed initiatives that have been forced to make cuts, large and small, to cope with the new budget reality.
Sacramento and Pittsburgh may have found money and employers to provide jobs for thousands teen-agers this summer. But Amarillo has not. Its summer youth program, which would have put 15 young people to work in city departments, has been zeroed out for this year by the Texas state government, which acts as a conduit for Federal jobs grants.
In Fresno, Calif., unlike Iowa, nobody is making up a 30 percent cut in Federal money for legal aid to the poor. So Central California Legal Services has shrunk its office space by about half; cut its roster dealing with evictions, domestic violence complaints and similar cases by 20 percent, to 2,000, and canceled weekly seminars on common legal problems.
"Now we just give them packets," said Sherry Carey, the agency's executive secretary.
The public-housing authority in Kansas City, Mo., is already in receivership and has laid off its security police and stopped assisting disabled applicants for housing, among other things, to offset the loss of $800,000 from an annual Federal subsidy of $4.8 million.
Amarillo, which has a program that gives vouchers for Federal rent subsidies to the poor, is withholding unused vouchers for three months before giving them to other families, those whose annual average income is about $5,000.
Idling the surrendered vouchers saves the Federal Government about $100,000 a year that would have been spent on subsidies had another family been given the chance to use them immediately. For the 2,100 Amarillo families vying for the 935 vouchers, it means that two and a half years of waiting for an apartment they can afford has been extended by three months.
Indeed, services to the poor have been cut about three times as deeply as other domestic discretionary programs, according to an analysis released last month by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group in Washington.
Whether that will remain so is another question. The White House has used such reductions as weapons in the emerging Presidential campaign, and Republican leaders have agreed to trim back some proposed cuts, in programs like those for education and subsidies that help pay heating bills for the poor. More such easing in reductions can be expected this summer as both sides wrap up the spending battles and move on to the fall campaign.

HEADLINE: Optometrists Clash With Eye Surgeons Over Laser Process

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 7

 BODY:
Eager to perform a new eye procedure that experts say could generate as much as $10 billion in revenues, two groups of eye-care specialists are battling each other here and in other capitals over bills that will help to determine which side will control the market.
On one side are optometrists, whose duties were once limited to eye examinations and prescribing glasses but who have been winning broader rights to diagnose diseases, treat them and prescribe drugs in 47 states. 
 On the other side are ophthalmologists, eye doctors who have attended medical school and have gradually lost their monopoly on many eye treatments but still are the only ones who can perform eye surgery. They contend that the procedure is too risky to allow people without medical degrees to conduct it.
The pot of gold shining in front of both groups is a relatively new -- and expensive -- laser procedure, known as photorefractive keratectomy, that corrects nearsightedness by slightly flattening the cornea. If it catches on as many experts predict, it could mean millions of dollars in fees going to whichever group performs the procedure, and it could hurt the market for new glasses and contact lenses.
While no one is questioning the right of ophthalmologists to perform this new procedure, optometrists are saying they should also be authorized to do it. With both sides under the same intense economic pressures that are pinching many medical specialties, the fight over who will be allowed to execute this laser procedure is shaping up as one of the nation's most bitter medical turf wars.
"It's economics," said Dr. Kenneth P. Taylor, director of the medical and ophthalmic consulting unit at Arthur D. Little Inc. "Everyone's rushing for the cash flow from a procedure that in 10 or 20 years may become as common a right of passage as getting braces."
Experts say the relatively painless procedure, which now costs from $1,800 to $2,300 per eye, should revolutionize the eye-care industry by correcting the vision of people with moderate to mild nearsightedness. Still, some ophthalmologists caution that the procedure is not all it is cracked up to be and note that there are no studies of its impact on a patient's vision beyond three years.
Dr. Taylor warned that the initial market for the procedure would be relatively small -- roughly 240,000 patients a year -- and that other laser procedures may supplant this one. Still, he added that both ophthalmologists and optometrists are looking to refractive surgery as "the holy grail" that will compensate for declining government reimbursements and the pressure from managed-care organizations to cut rates.
This has led to a nationwide movement by optometrists to gain the right to perform laser procedures, and Connecticut is at the forefront of the debate. Last month, the State Senate voted by 28 to 7 to authorize them to use lasers, as well as to treat glaucoma and prescribe oral drugs, including painkillers and steroids.
That victory was the result of an extensive lobbying campaign that has intensified in recent weeks as the Connecticut Association of Optometrists strives to win the next vote in the State House of Representatives and to overcome the suddenly mobilized ophthalmologists. The optometrists have been running full-page newspaper and radio advertisements and sending sacks of letters to lawmakers, pleading with them to allow optometrists to perform the procedure.
Both sides have hired two of the capital's most influential and costly lobbying firms, and lawmakers say it has turned into one of the most heated battles before the legislature. "I've seen legislators hollering at each other over this," said State Representative David Pudlin, a New Britain Democrat.
In the last two years, similar legislation to let optometrists use lasers has been offered in Alaska, Colorado, New Jersey, California and Virginia and, ophthalmologists and optometrists agree that new fronts will break out across the nation over the next several years. Optometrists are already performing this procedure in Idaho.
The clashes are the latest in a long-running feud that began more than 20 years ago when optometrists began seeking the right to use diagnostic drugs. Since then, they have won the right to do this in almost every state and have obtained varying powers in 34 states to use drugs for treatment of serious eye diseases, like glaucoma, a chronic disorder that can lead to blindess.
This gradual expansion in the scope of optometry represents a concerted effort to redefine the profession beyond eye exams and glasses to being the primary health care provider for eye problems. Some health experts say that this attempt to supplant ophthalmologists as the basic eye practitioner has been further encouraged by the general trend toward managed care and its emphasis on using less costly types of service.
According to figures provided by associations for the two groups, a typical optometrist earned about $80,000 in 1994, about half what an ophthalmologist earned. The ophthalmologist's education is more extensive, having gone to four years of medical school and completed four years of internship and residency, compared with the optometrist's four-year optometry program.
Indeed, a central question in the debate over laser procedures is whether optometrists' knowledge is sufficient to do them.
Dr. Alden N. Haffner, president of the State University of New York College of Optometry, told Connecticut lawmakers earlier this year that optometric education has changed sharply in the last two decades, teaching students about treating diseases and using prescriptive medications and now offering guidance with laser therapies.
"The profession has been undergoing a metamorphosis," Dr. Haffner said in an interview last week. "We are now primary eye-care practitioners, and using lasers is going to be a fundamental part of that role."
But ophthalmologists maintain that optometrists have already expanded their authority too far and that laser procedures should generally be considered surgery -- an area off limits to those without medical training. They note that despite claims by optometrists to being primary eye-care providers, a recent survey in The Review of Optometry showed that optometrists write only 2.5 percent of ophthalmic prescriptions and that many did not consider themselves well prepared for such a role.
Although optometrists contend that they can learn the new laser procedures just as most ophthalmologists will have to learn them, Dr. Patricia Caton Reardon, president of the Conecticut Society for Eye Physicians, dismissed that argument.
"You have to scrape off the outer skin and then reshape the eyeball," Dr. Reardon said. "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that's invasive surgery."
Still, the procedure does not involve opening the eyeball, and the Federal Government has left it up to the states to decide whether optometrists can perform photorefractive keratectomies.
The procedure has only been authorized since last October, when the Food and Drug Administration granted Summit Technology of Waltham, Mass., the right to manufacture and market an excimer laser system designed for this procedure. On March 27, another company, VISX Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., received F.D.A. approval to produce and sell its own excimer laser.
The procedure lasts about 40 minutes, though only 30 to 40 seconds involve the laser. In the first part, the epithelium, the skin covering the cornea, must be peeled off. Then, a computer-operated laser, set and positioned by the practitioner, shoots pulses of cool ultraviolet light that reshape the cornea. Finally, a soft contact lens is placed over the eye, serving as a bandage until the epithelium is healed.
In the first few days, the practitioner must watch closely to see how the cornea is growing back and to use medications to guide its formation. While the eye may hurt a bit initially, the vast majority of patients report an improvement in vision. A small number continue to need glasses and may suffer other complications.
The procedure is generally not covered by insurance.
With as many as 70 million nearsighted people in the United States, the potential market is large, easily $10 billion. Yet, it is far from clear how quickly that potential will be reached.
Dr. Taylor of Arthur D. Little said that the procedure now makes sense only for those between about 25 and 45 years old, that a large number of nearsighted people's vision is too impaired to be helped by the process and that others will not be able to afford it. Of this pool of about 10 million people, he assumed that only a small percentage would be ready in the next few years to try the new procedure.

Cykiert, an ophthalmologist, with Randy Kilminick, a laser technician. In the chair was Wendi Fitzpatrick, who has had the procedure and can now see without eyeglasses or contact lenses. Optometrists are battling to be allowed to perform the procedure. (Jack Manning/The New York Times) (pg. B7)

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALLAn Early Lesson on Expectation vs. Reality

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
When the comparison was suggested to him yesterday, Dallas Green laughed and said it probably was fair: Having Zane Smith and Danny Darwin shut out the Mets for a total of 11 innings during the dry part of the weekend was like Green's pitching two successive shutouts when the manager played for the Mets in 1966.
The only problem is, Green didn't pitch a major league shutout beyond 1961, and the Mets did fail to score a run against the retreads Smith and Darwin in the space of 20 hours Friday and Saturday. 
 The Pirates' outlook with the 35-year-old Smith and the 40-year-old Darwin is not as bright as the Mets' outlook with their pair of 23-year-old pitchers, Jason Isringhausen and Paul Wilson. But the Pirates came to Shea Stadium for the second series of the season and showed why teams play the games on the schedule rather than let the experts determine the outcome.
They play the games because expectations do not always translate into achievement on the field. Some players and teams, in fact, crumble under the weight of expectations.
Asked on opening day what his expectations were for the Mets, Green said: "I'll be disappointed if they don't play very sound defense. If they're not one of the five best defensive clubs in either league, I would be very surprised."
Five games later, the Mets were the worst defensive team in the National League, having committed nine errors, which, for just one example, happened to be nine more than the Colorado Rockies had committed.
That is not to say that Green's defensive expectations have placed some sort of unbearable burden on his players.
"We've been reading and hearing that stuff since last year," Green said, discussing the expectations others brought into this season for the Mets. "That's what I told the guys. It's part of big-league baseball. It's part of the expectations of every spring when every team thinks it can win a championship. All of us have realistic ideas of what the team can do. I don't think we're putting any more pressure on this team than already is on it. Every time Izzy and Wilson go out there, they're supposed to throw no-hitters. But they're used to that."
The Pirates entered the season lugging no one's expectations as excess baggage. But Jim Leyland, their manager, said before rain washed out the third game with the Mets: "I'd rather have high expectations than none at all. When people have pretty high expectations, that means you're normally pretty good. I'd much rather have the pressure of a team that's supposed to win than the pressure of managing a team that's not supposed to win. There's more pressure with that than there is with a team that's supposed to win. A lot of guys say it's a lot of pressure to be expected to win, but I'd rather have that kind of pressure."
Leyland and the Pirates won three consecutive division championships not long ago, then watched as economics stripped them of their best talent. Now, scrapping to get back to respectability, the Pirates make whatever moves are necessary to fill holes. Thus, the presence of Smith (8-8, with a 5.61 earned run average last year) and Darwin (3-10, 7.45 e.r.a.) in the starting rotation.
The St. Louis Cardinals, on the other hand, filled their holes with people like Tony La Russa, Ron Gant, Gary Gaetti, Dennis Eckersley, Todd Stottlemyre and Andy Benes, rapidly raising expectations for themselves.
"Sometimes the expectations come from somewhere else and it's not fair," La Russa said. "The key is the expectations the club has for itself. If the club feels it's legitimate and all the experts think you've got nothing, so what. If all the experts think you have a good club and you don't, so what, because you have to believe you have a chance."
The Mets' 1996 expectations were fueled in the last eight weeks of the 1995 season, when the team won 34 of 52 games, a .654 percentage compared with .380 (35-57) previously.
"We all talk about going to the next level, but we don't know what that next level is going to be," Green said. "We have never played .500 baseball other than the stretch of 60 days last season, so we've got to learn to do that for a length of time. We're still young. We're still going to make mistakes. But I think this team can hold together and have a good summer. Some clubs have improved themselves. I think we can play with most of them. We've proven that. It's just a case of us learning how to handle the peaks and valleys of a 162-game season together as a team."
The season is only a week old, and the Mets have tumbled into their first valley. Committing nine errors in five games and failing to score a run against Zane Smith and Danny Darwin can do that. How they climb out of this early valley will be instructive for them and those who expressed the expectations.

HEADLINE: Let's Vote on Giving Yankees a Stadium

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your April 4 news article on building a new stadium for the Yankees: Politicians and other boosters will justify spending public money on George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner, for two reasons. They will contend that the city will receive an economic return from the investment, and they will profess that "civic pride" requires that the Yankees be kept in New York. 
 If the economic returns will be so bountiful, why would private capital allow the public purse to intrude on the investment? If the city places a higher value on keeping the Yankees than on police and fire protection, schools, transportation, parks, sanitation, hospitals, child welfare and other services, shouldn't New Yorkers whose money will be transferred to Mr. Steinbrenner get to vote on that curious preference? They should insist.

HEADLINE: The End of Broadway's Run

BYLINE: By Robert Brustein; Robert Brustein is the artistic director of the American Repertory Theatre and drama critic of The New Republic.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
The playwright William Gibson once remarked that a dramatist can't make a living on Broadway, only a killing. For decades now, serious writers haven't even been able to make a killing.
The commercial theater may still be considered one of New York's primary tourist attractions, but out-of-town visitors largely patronize musical spectaculars featuring falling chandeliers and whirring helicopters. By the end of this season, only eight plays will have opened on Broadway, and only Terrence McNally's "Master Class" will recoup its initial investment. 
 The Broadway Initiatives Working Group -- a consortium of commercial producers, theater owners and unions -- is trying to restore Broadway as an incubator of serious new plays by reducing the risks to investors. This well-intentioned idea ignores an unhappy truth: There is no longer an audience for serious Broadway plays.
The group's chief suggestions are Federal, state and city tax abatements. New York City has already waived its commercial rent tax on Broadway theaters for the first year of a play's run. The group wants similar abatements on materials for sets, costumes and stage props. It has also created a trust to give grants or loans to theaters and producers.
We should welcome anything that can help the ailing Broadway economy. But some might find it curious, at a time when the cultural buzzword is "privatization," that for-profit theaters should be requesting indirect public subsidies for the sake of encouraging private investment. Is this really the best way to ignite the creative spirit? Wouldn't American theater be better served by giving direct subsidies to the playwrights and the Off-Broadway and nonprofit theaters that can more easily stage new works?
It has been three decades since Broadway was a mecca for new plays, despite intermittent efforts to recapture the past. For example, in the early 90's the Broadway Alliance, a group of producers and theater owners, lowered ticket prices after gaining concessions from unions. Yet of the nine works produced, only two returned their initial investment.
 Yes, a few serious plays have gone straight to Broadway and made money, but success has been fleeting. David Henry Hwang's "M. Butterfly" was a hit, but his next play, "Face Value," closed quickly. And while August Wilson's "Fences" and "The Piano Lesson" were modest successes, his other plays, like "Two Trains Running," lost money for investors, despite his Pulitzer Prizes.
The problem lies with demographics. The audiences that flocked to "Death of a Salesman" and "A Streetcar Named Desire" have either moved to Florida or transferred their allegiance to Off-Broadway institutions like the Manhattan Theater Club and the New York Public Theater. Fifty percent of the patrons for Broadway's new musicals come from out of town, a number that increases to 80 percent for the long-running blockbusters.
Perhaps we should acknowledge that, having lost its traditional audience, Broadway can never again be a home for new plays. Theater foundations should consider giving money directly to playwrights and to the Off-Broadway theaters that are in a better position to risk new works.
Nonprofit theaters are languishing from dwindling Federal and foundation grants. Fellowships for playwrights have declined by 60 percent over the last two decades. The era in which the theaters and writers could count on subsidies produced Arthur Kopit, Edward Albee, Sam Shepard, David Rabe, David Mamet, Adrienne Kennedy, Christopher Durang, Marsha Norman and countless others.
Few of these playwrights started out thinking about Broadway profits. But out of their creative ferment came the flowering of American theater. To risk extending a horticultural cliche, the playwright plants the seeds and the nonprofit theater nourishes the flowers while Broadway, acting as the florist, occasionally plucks the splashiest blossoms.
Everyone shares Broadway's nostalgia for its past glory. But it is getting things backward to renovate the flower shop while the seeds are rotting for want of rain.

An article by Robert Brustein on April 8 about a plan to provide subsidies to Broadway theaters misattributed a quotation. It was the playwright Robert Anderson who wrote, "You can make a killing in the theater, but not a living."

HEADLINE: Help Close Technology Gap for the Disabled

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As Carl R. Augusto notes in "Technology Gap" (Op-Ed, April 3), the new Telecommunications Act of 1996 provides a chance to address some problems. One provision will require manufacturers and providers to insure that their equipment and services are accessible to people with disabilities, which can help level the playing field for 49 million Americans, 60 percent of whom are unemployed. Another provision is to insure that video programming is accessible to 38 million Americans with hearing disabilities and visual impairments. 
 Other provisions on universal service and deployment of advanced services to schools and libraries hold promise as equalizers of opportunity for all Americans traditionally underserved in telecommunications, including people with disabilities. I urge everyone who cares about these issues to become involved as the F.C.C. implements this historic law.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Drops in U.S. Stocks and Bonds Leave Dollar Mixed for the Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday against most leading currencies following sharp selloffs in United States bond and stock markets, then gradually recovered in New York to end mixed.
"It's a very thin market and nobody was going to load up the trucks with dollars on a day that was predicted to see a selloff in stocks and bonds," said Margaret Kudaraskas, a senior foreign-exchange analyst at Technical Data in Boston. 
 In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 107.75 Japanese yen, up from 107.68 yen late Friday. The dollar was quoted at 1.4817 German marks, down from 1.4835 marks. The British pound was unchanged at $1.5290.
American bonds and stocks tumbled yesterday, following Friday's employment report that was stronger than expected for a second consecutive month. The data indicated that the economy was growing faster than previously thought and that inflation -- and higher interest rates -- could revive.
While higher interest rates would bolster the value of the dollar by making United States deposits more attractive, the selloffs in stocks and bond threatened to reduce demand for dollars among foreign investors. Expectations of higher interest rates lifted the dollar on Friday, when the stock market was closed and bonds held a shortened session.
In other trading, the dollar fell to 1.1953 Swiss francs, from 1.1960, and to 5.0521 French francs, from 5.0850. Against the Italian lira, the dollar was unchanged at 1,566 lire.
Anticipation that the United States bond and stock markets would tumble at their opening yesterday dragged the dollar down in Asian trading earlier in the day. Still, trading was thin, with financial markets in Europe and Hong Kong closed.
The dollar continued to fall in New York trading as the Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 140 points, before recovering to end down 88.51 points. As bonds and stocks came off their lows, the dollar pared its losses in late trading.
"If we can contain the losses in stocks and bonds to where we are now, I think it will firm up," Ms. Kudaraskas of Technical Data said.

HEADLINE: Utilities Seek Deal's Approval

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, April 8

 BODY:
The Baltimore Gas and Electric Company and the Potomac Electric Power Company said today that they had jointly filed applications with the Public Service Commissions of Maryland and the District of Columbia seeking approval of the $2.9 billion acquisition of Potomac Electric by Baltimore Gas.
The companies said the resulting company, the Constellation Energy Corporation, would freeze basic electric rates until 2000, provide credits to reduce customer bills if the company met financial goals and provide a package of economic development incentives totaling $10.6 million annually. 
 Baltimore Gas and the Washington-based Potomac Electric both said they expected to complete the transaction, first announced in September, by the end of the first quarter of 1997.
The transaction still requires approval by the Public Service Commissions of Maryland, Washington, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

HEADLINE: Havana Journal;
25 Years an Exile: An Old Black Panther Sums Up

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
More than a quarter of a century after he sought political asylum in Cuba, William Lee Brent still seems American to the core. He speaks a Spanish tinged with the Louisiana accent of his boyhood, prefers whisky to rum, and continues to focus his attention on many of the same causes he once espoused as a member of the Black Panther Party.
But Mr. Brent has cast his lot with the Cuban revolution, and even if he wanted to, he could not return to the land of his birth. He arrived here in 1969 after hijacking an airliner bound for New York from San Francisco with 76 people on board, and after all these years he remains a fugitive from American justice. 
 Now, at the age of 66, Mr. Brent has written an autobiography, "Long Time Gone: A Black Panther's True-Life Story of His Hijacking and 25 Years in Cuba" (Times Books, a subsidiary of Random House). In it, he recalls growing up poor in the South, the years he spent in San Quentin prison on an armed robbery conviction, his career as a political activist in Oakland and the ups and downs of his life in Cuba -- but expresses no remorse for the act that first brought him here.
"I considered myself a foot soldier, out there with the troops, where I could make a contribution to the black liberation movement," Mr. Brent said during an interview here. "I was at war, as strange as that may sound to some people now, with an enemy, which was the United States Government, and the skyjacking was a continuation of that struggle."
If Mr. Brent has any regrets, they stem from his isolation from his mother and sister, who have never come to visit him, and his inability to fully "feel the pulse of what's going on in the black community anymore." In retrospect, he views his association with the Black Panthers as the highlight of his life, and refers frequently to party leaders such as Eldridge Cleaver, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale both in the book and in conversation.
By his own admission, Mr. Brent squandered the first half of his life on petty crime, which rewarded him with nothing more than an intimate knowledge of the American prison system and a bitterness that corroded his soul. Joining the Black Panthers, he said, plunged him into "a vital, effervescent, crazy, wonderful period of time" that gave him direction, purpose, pride and, above all, a political education.
"The Panthers were a street gang, but one that was highly politicized and conscious," Mr. Brent said when asked about several recent revisionist books that portray the group as basically criminal in intent. "It was a street gang with a political agenda directed toward bettering the black community. Instead of dealing dope and getting rich, they did what they were supposed to do."
But when Mr. Brent first arrived here, he found to his shock that the Cuban state security apparatus regarded him with the same suspicion as the American authorities. Instead of being hailed as a hero, he was tossed into jail for 22 months, where he struggled to convince his captors "I am a revolutionary" and not a C.I.A. agent. He was then sent to "hijack house," a halfway home full of renegade Americans unhappy to learn that the Cuban revolution had no use for sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.
Prison in the United States "is not as hard as here," Mr. Brent said when asked to compare his eight years in San Quentin and Tehachapi with his time in an isolation cell on the outskirts of Havana. "Here they don't allow you to do anything but hard time."
Since his release, Mr. Brent has done a bit of everything: cut sugar cane and raised pigs, worked in a soap factory, taught English to high-school students and been a disk jockey and announcer on Radio Havana. "I wouldn't trade those years for anything, because they taught me how to love work, instead of hating it and having to struggle to find a job," he said.
Mr. Brent now lives with his wife, Jane McManus, a fellow American radical who first visited Cuba in the 1960's, in a comfortable apartment with a view of the Almendares River and a tree-studded park. His neighbors may be Cuban, but the records in his music collection are jazz and blues. He uses a computer to stay abreast of "the movement," as he still calls it, and its crusades, attested to by a prominently displayed poster calling for freedom for Mumia Abu-Jamal, a radio journalist convicted of killing a police officer in Philadelphia in 1981 in a case that has drawn widespread protests.
"Here I have basically learned that I was an American," he said, idly petting a pair of longhaired dachshunds as they wandered by. "I had never considered myself an American before, but you can't get rid of what you are, what you grew up in, the way you were formed."
To promote his autobiography, Mr. Brent has taken part in several radio telephone call-in programs from the United States, and also recently held a book party at his residence here. That event drew a mixed crowd of American and Canadian expatriate leftists and prominent Cuban intellectuals.
"This is a remarkable book filled with authenticity and sincerity, with strong images of Bill's childhood," Victor Casaus, a Cuban writer, told the gathering. "It demonstrates the author's need to settle accounts, including with some demons from his own past."
But recent years have also been unsettling, Mr. Brent said, and a challenge to his beliefs. With the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the mounting economic privations that have followed here, he said, "the people who worked and sacrificed everything" have become disillusioned and the Government "has had to struggle to preserve some of the social gains that had been made."
"Cuban society is more and more dependent on outside forces" from the world of capitalism, Mr. Brent lamented. "People have discovered that not all Cubans are in agreement with the revolution, that they want some things the revolution taught them were bad, like Big Macs and Nikes."
Nevertheless, his own faith that socialism is the best path for humanity remains unshaken, he said. So is his conviction that he must never abandon his struggle against "the system" he still believes forced him here, even if it means he never sets foot in the United States again.
"I've been running all my life, fleeing one thing or another, looking for this, trying to find that," he said. "I've been on a flight from depression, oppression, racism, injustice, inhumanity, cruelty. That flight is not over, but I'm not just running from it. I'm fighting it."

HEADLINE: Jordan Allowing U.S. to Use Its Air Base for Flights Over Iraq

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 8

 BODY:
For the first time since the Persian Gulf war, American warplanes are preparing to carry out patrols over southern Iraq from neighboring Jordan, a step that could elevate tensions between Baghdad and Amman.
Jordan sided with Iraq during the war, in 1991, and remained aligned with Iraq until eight months ago. It has since reversed its course, but its decision to permit the American aircraft to use Jordan as a base for flights over Iraq is being seen as evidence of a a wholesale transformation in its policy toward Iraq. 
 "It's an irreversible step," said a Western diplomat based in Amman, the Jordanian capital. Another well-placed envoy there described the move as Jordan's "most hostile action so far" toward Baghdad.
Since he broke with Iraq last August, King Hussein of Jordan has granted refuge to several prominent Iraqi defectors, most notably to two sons-in-law of the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein. The King has encouraged Iraqi opposition leaders to establish an office in Amman and has ordered stepped-up scrutiny of shipments bound for Iraq by way of Jordanian ports to insure compliance with United Nations sanctions.
Beginning this week, nearly three dozen United States Air Force F-15's and F-16's will be based for at least two months at an airfield near the Iraqi border to give tangible new form to the King's change of heart.
The aircraft, drawn from various bases in the United States, will join other American and allied warplanes in enforcing the no-flight zone in the southern third of the country, where Iraqi aircraft have been prohibited from flying since August 1992.
The zone was established by the United States, France, Britain and Russia to limit Iraq's military suppression of dissident Shiite Muslims in the region. President Hussein and most of his Government are members of Iraq's large Sunni Muslim minority.
Until now the patrols have been carried out exclusively by aircraft operating from carriers in the Persian Gulf and from bases in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain, all wartime allies. The United States and its allies carry out similar aerial patrols from bases in Turkey to help protect Kurds in northern Iraq.
Because the pro-Iraqi sentiment in Jordan, particularly among the country's large Palestinian population, that led King Hussein to oppose Western intervention during the gulf war still runs deep, some officials and diplomats in Amman consider his decision to offer his territory as a base potentially risky politically.
They say the discomfort would multiply if an American plane operating from Jordan fired on a threatening Iraqi plane or anti-aircraft emplacement, as has happened more than half a dozen times since the daily operations began.
"Jordan is leading with a glass chin," one European diplomat said of the decision, which will put Amman, which long enjoyed close political and economic ties with the Iraqi Government, in the company of countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
"Particularly in the Arab world," the diplomat said, "it's not a friendly act to station hostile airplanes near a neighbor's territory."
So sensitive is the American presence that Jordan at first denied that the warplanes would carry out patrols over Iraq, saying they were in the country only to take part in American-Jordanian military exercises. It has refused to permit reporters access to the Azraq air base near the Iraqi border, where the first of the 34 American aircraft and the 1,500 personnel that make up the Air Expeditionary Force began to arrive last week.
Marwan Muasher, Jordan's Information Minister, said last week that the American fighter jets and their crews would be used in part to help train the Jordanian Air Force, which is due to receive F-16 aircraft from the United States. American officials said that joint exercises would be conducted by the two countries beginning later this week, involving about 1,000 American soldiers, but that they would be separate from the patrol flight operation.
Iraq, which for the most part has shrugged off Jordan's recent unfriendliness, has not yet commented on its former ally's plan to play host to the American patrols. But even after five years in which its northern and southern skies have remained the exclusive domain of foreign air forces, Iraq may find the new Jordanian role difficult to ignore, diplomats say.
Under an agreement with the United Nations, whose wartime sanctions otherwise prohibit Iraq from selling its goods abroad, Jordan still relies on imported Iraqi oil to meet all of its energy needs. Even today, stretches of the 600-mile desert highway that links Baghdad and Amman were busy with fuel tankers.
But in recent months, Jordan has slashed its trade with Iraq in half, and some drivers interviewed along the bleak route said they were having trouble finding work.
Officials in Washington initially described the decision to use Jordan as a temporary base for the patrols as a way of filling a gap between the departure from the Persian Gulf of the Nimitz aircraft carrier task force and the arrival of its successor, the George Washington.
The carriers play a central role as platforms for the aerial operations, and their absence from the strategic waterway tends to leave American military officials nervous.
But the George Washington has arrived already in the gulf, closing a gap that proved shorter than expected, and an American official in Amman conceded that there was no pressing military need to bring Jordan into the picture.
American aircraft involved in the operation will not fly directly from Jordan over Iraq, a step that would be perceived as an overtly hostile act because it would involve entering airspace still controlled by Iraqi forces, American officials said.
Instead, they will fly south over Saudi Arabia, then turn west and north to enter only the airspace over southern Iraq that the United States and its allies have deemed off limits to Iraqi planes.
Among the Iraqis who have defected to Jordan since last summer, the most significant was Lieut. Gen. Hussein Kamel al-Majid, a son-in-law of President Hussein and the former director of Iraq's military procurement program.
He and his brother, another son-in-law of the President, and their wives returned to Baghdad in February. The brothers were reported to have been killed by family members.
But King Hussein has continued to grant asylum to other Iraqi defectors, including Lieut. Gen. Nizar al-Khazraji, a veteran of the gulf war who arrived in Amman late last month after escaping into Turkey from the Kurdish area of northern Iraq.
The former director of Iraqi military intelligence, Gen. Wafiq al-Samerai, who had lived in Syria since defecting in late 1994, has also decided to settle in Jordan, officials there said on Sunday. Both military men are thought likely to join the ranks of the the Iraqi National Accord, an American-backed Iraqi opposition group that has operated an office in Jordan since January.

HEADLINE: Debating The Language Of Signs;
New Jersey Towns Tell Asian-Owned Stores: Advertise in English, Too

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: PALISADES PARK, N.J., April 8

 BODY:
Hong Gol Kim, owner of Nadri Tour and Travel, says 95 percent of his agency's business comes from Korean customers. So why, he asks, should he have to comply with a local law that requires him to put up a promotional sign with equal-sized letters in both Korean and English?
"The American people in the neighborhood don't come to my office," he said. "If my customers are 50-50 -- English and Korean -- then I'll do a 50-50 sign." 
 For all his misgivings on the language required in commercial signs in this town not far from the Hudson River, he said he will follow the law, but only after he goes to court on May 22 to answer a summons. He said he wants the judge to explain the logic of the law to him.
Palisades Park is one of seven towns clustered near the George Washington Bridge that have responded to a growing Asian presence in their downtowns by imposing regulations on the Asian merchants. Since 1992, all seven towns have enacted laws requiring that half of any foreign-language commercial sign be in English. But the impact has been most noticeable here, where Asian-American merchants now own most of the 144 stores on the milelong commercial strip, Broad Avenue.
Longtime residents grumble that the younger Korean merchants cater only to the growing number of Asian residents despite admonitions from their elders to accept the new sign law and to try to serve everyone in town. Older residents seem wary, resentful and suspicious. Often, they flood the town's building inspector, John Candelmo, with calls complaining about perceived violations of the sign law.
"We have a lot of people in town who police the signs," he said.
The Mayor, Susan Spohn, said there was a need for more tolerance and cultural understanding. "The whole issue for many is -- this is America, and signs should be in English," she said. "For a portion of the people -- if they had their druthers -- they'd have completely English signs. But we don't have a national language."
Mr. Candelmo's trouble with the Nadri travel agency is the latest skirmish between City Hall and some of the new Korean merchants. In the last six years, they have bought or leased aging stores, revitalized them and, seemingly overnight, recast the avenue's look. Gone are the fixtures that served Italian, German, eastern European and other immigrant groups that for much of this century shaped the insular, working-class texture of this 1.3-square-mile town of nearly 15,000.
The old ethnic mix has been changed by an influx of Asians since 1980. In 1990, they made up 20 percent of Palisades Park's population, up from about 6 percent in 1980. And more Asians have moved in since the last census. Over half the newcomers are Korean.
What they are finding on Broad Avenue are new Korean-owned restaurants and specialty food stores, art galleries and beauty salons, and stores for pianos and violins, golf equipment and pet supplies, books and artwork, dresses, carpets and furniture, office supplies and electronics.
The old Chamber of Commerce has disbanded, and Broad Avenue has only a few stores left with all-English signs. Paul's Fish Market, a fixture for 68 years, is one. "I have zero Korean customers," the owner, Jerry Nolan, said. "The Korean people prefer to do business with their own, which makes it very difficult."
Visidor DeCarlo, owner of Palisades Pizza, said his shop attracts Asian-American teen-agers. But he estimated that he has lost about $50 in nightly pizza sales since a bar next door was replaced by a Korean restaurant. Mr. DeCarlo said he thought briefly about adding Korean symbols to his sign.
"But it wouldn't be authentic," he said. "It wouldn't be an Italian restaurant. I wouldn't want them to come here because I have Korean writing. I'd want them because I have good pizza."
Soon after the influx quickened in the late 1980's, the town enacted a sign law that required English lettering but did not set any size specifications. That produced signs dominated by Asian symbols. In September 1994, an amendment was passed mandating equal-sized lettering. At the same time, the town banned flashy neon tubes framing windows and doors and more than two colors on a sign, saying the lighting was too garish.
"We were starting to get the rainbow effect, with bright, bright, clashing colors -- hot pink, red orange, and orange, black and yellow," Mr. Candelmo, the inspector, said.
Older Korean merchants on Broad like Andy W. Nam, the owner of Grand Furniture, endorsed the new law. Mr. Nam came to America in 1967 and opened his furniture store in 1989 in a former A.&P. store. English dominates the big awning above his front window, and he said he has always told younger merchants that use of two languages is the best way to entice American and Asian customers.
Not all abide. In recent months, six merchants have been fined from $150 to $250 each for violations, Mr. Candelmo said. "They usually plead ignorance," he said.
Since taking office last October, Mayor Spohn said she has started work on easing tensions and cultural divisions. She goes to functions of the Korean-American Chamber of Commerce. The Town Council has appointed a new liaison to the Asian community -- Peter Suh, a real estate agent who teaches citizenship classes to Koreans and, like Mr. Nam, believes the 50-50 sign law is a key to economic success and acceptance.
There are other cross-cultural overtures. The Korea-American Chamber of Commerce now donates money from its annual golf outing to the Police and Fire Departments and the ambulance corps. And Benjamin Joo, the chamber president, who is a pharmacist, is pleased that the Democratic Party invited him and some other merchants to a victory party after last fall's elections.
But frictions persist. Recently, a Korean church donated $10,000 to the town's $2 million fund for a new library. "When I accepted the check," Mayor Spohn said, "I heard criticism that 'she's catering to them.' "
City Hall must, she said, promote better cultural understanding. Zoning laws and building regulations are alien notions in Korea, she said, and officials must take greater pains to teach newcomers to abide by them. Longtime residents who object to Korean stores staying open nights and on Sundays must understand that Koreans are hard-working and industrious, she said. And, she added, residents must also understand Koreans' love for singing and abandon suspicions that the karaoke recording studios behind the blackened windows in one building on Broad Avenue are not dens of drinking and prostitution.
On the other hand, she said, the Korean merchants have to make the old-time residents feel more welcome. Mr. Nam, the owner of Grand Furniture, denies intentional slights. "Some store owners can't speak English well and are shy -- they just step back and smile," he said.
Officials in the other six towns with sign laws say they do not have Palisades Park's enforcement problems or cultural divisions. Fort Lee, Englewood, Leonia and Cliffside have all adopted 50-50 sign laws since the early 1990's. Officials in Fort Lee say it has less friction because the population is more transient and its Asian stores are not as clustered as Palisades Park's. Englewood, Leonia and Cliffside Park have fewer Asian merchants. Two other towns, Ridgefield and Englewood Cliffs, which adopted their laws in the last few months, have the fewest Asian merchants. But officials say they want laws in place should Asians start to move in in greater numbers.
Ridgefield's law is directed only at new merchants, and several longtime Italian restaurants, among them Ristorante Focacceria Italiana, are exempted from the 50-50 rule.
The towns justify the laws on safety grounds. English lettering, officials said, helps police officers, firefighters and ambulance attendants locate the businesses in emergencies. But a similar law in Pomona, Calif., was ruled unconstitutional by a Federal judge in 1989 on the ground that it limited free speech and discriminated against merchants' national origin. Pomona's Asian-owned businesses had filed the lawsuit.
But the ruling is not legally binding outside that judge's district. Here, the older Korean merchants seem to want the 50-50 signs.
"This is the United States of America," said Mr. Suh, the new liaison. "We have to follow the rules and regulations and must include the English name in signs. If I go to Germany and put in a sign in the Korean language, do they like that? I don't think so. We've got to live in peace -- everybody together. That's what I'm trying to teach the Korean community."

HEADLINE: Cash-Poor in New York City

 BODY:
New York City ran out of cash to pay its bills 21 years ago, brushing closer to bankruptcy than at any time since the Depression. The city is nowhere near bankruptcy now, but it is certainly short of cash. Companies that do business with the city have been told to expect delays in getting paid, while monthly contributions to employee pension funds have been suspended and property owners are being offered discounts for early tax payments. All these problems are painful signs of chronic fiscal problems from Washington to Albany to City Hall.
The underlying problems are no secret. They result from a longstanding disparity between the city's stagnating economic base and the rising costs of government. Despite billions of dollars in budget cuts under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the imbalance remains. The State Financial Control Board, established in the fiscal crisis of 1975, projects deficits of $1.7 billion in the next fiscal year, growing to $4.6 billion by the end of the decade if nothing is done to further reduce costs or raise more money. 
 The gap has been compounded by labor agreements between City Hall and the municipal unions calling for wage freezes now and substantial increases in pay and benefits down the road. The budget impasse in Washington has added a further element of uncertainty.
Most states have gone ahead with budgets and not assumed any Federal windfalls in the form of reduced costs for welfare and Medicaid. But Gov. George Pataki of New York imprudently assumed such savings in his first budget proposal, and now he and the State Legislature are paralyzed over what to do if they do not materialize. Neither party in Albany has had the nerve to rethink the multibillion-dollar tax cuts enacted last year. They are looking instead at budget gimmicks to reduce the size of the deficit this year.
The refusal to face up to reality in Albany has, for the 12th year in a row, prevented enactment of a budget in time for the start of the new fiscal year on April 1. The temporizing, in turn, made it impossible for Mr. Giuliani to know how much state aid he can count on for his own budget, which is supposed to be presented later this month. More than likely, the Mayor will fill his budget with guesswork and empty projections, since he would rather assume that the state will help close his budget gap than embark on another round of tough spending cuts.
Seasonal cash shortages often occur in New York at this time of year. Tax revenues, for example, do not start pouring in until after July 1, when residents start paying their real estate taxes. Late budgets in Albany have meant delays in state aid payment for at least a dozen years. But this year, the city is hemmed in by a series of unreal and unwise budget assumptions of its own.
Two weeks ago, for example, the city got approval to raise $125 million in cash from the Municipal Assistance Corporation from a bond refinancing. The principle behind such refinancings is that you take the money now and promise to cut the budget later. The city is also trying frantically to unload assets, with mixed results. The sale of WNYC-TV has not won approval from the Federal Communications Commission. Hundreds of millions worth of mortgages on city-owned housing projects and liens on unpaid property taxes are supposed to be sold in the next few months, with many experts doubting they can be unloaded on schedule.
Because New York is the financial capital of the nation, a place of civic generosity, there is a tendency to think of the annual budget struggle as a game of no real consequence. But the numbers suggest otherwise. Like a family scrambling to make ends meet by refinancing its mortgage, selling the car and collecting old debts from deadbeat relatives, the city is facing some hard truths.
The last few years have seen cutbacks in services for the poor and middle class alike. The next few months will determine whether city and state politicians can rethink their support of tax cuts that have been enacted or proposed, wage and benefit increases that take place two years from now and costly employee work rules that have undercut the drive for savings in city government. The alternative is an endless cycle of cash shortages.

HEADLINE: The Limits of Openness in Vietnam

 BODY:
Vietnam eagerly welcomes foreign investment these days. But the American businessmen who rushed in after Washington finally normalized ties with Hanoi last year are discovering that Communist hard-liners still grip the reins. Tight ideological controls and a maze of bureaucratic regulations make Vietnam a difficult place to do business and imperil its continued economic advance.
The latest blow to foreign businessmen is a nationwide campaign that targets foreign commercial advertising as a "social evil" to be eradicated, along with prostitution, narcotics and gambling. All over Vietnam, billboards for products like Coca-Cola and Esso gasoline are being blocked out by new coats of paint. 
 While technocrats in the ministries of Trade and Finance draw up plans for modernizing taxes and tariffs and the central bank prepares for the opening of a stock exchange, hard-liners in the military and Communist Party politburo worry that foreign investment threatens to undermine Vietnamese traditions, Ho Chi Minh's Socialist legacy and continued tight political control by the Communist Party. "We are not afraid of capitalist enterprises, but of not being able to supervise and control them," the party's general secretary said last December. Indeed, the Government expects to keep the most important industries in its own hands.
A showdown between Vietnam's modernizing and hard-line factions could occur as early as this June's Communist Party Congress, when a new set of top national leaders is expected to be named.
Six years of market-oriented economic reforms have already brought impressive results. Foreign investors have thus far committed $18 billion. The economy is expanding rapidly, average incomes are rising and inflation has been tamed.
But no Communist Government anywhere, China's included, has yet established the rule of law and climate of predictability that businesses require for serious long-term investment. When Secretary of State Warren Christopher spoke in Hanoi last summer, he rightly emphasized that sustained economic development depends not just on legal protections for property but also on due process for all citizens, free exchange of information and a free press. Vietnam's hard-liners are headed in the opposite direction. They are not just cracking down on foreign advertising, they are also arresting Vietnamese intellectuals who argue that continued economic reform requires more, not less openness to outside ideas.
Capitalist development may be compatible, in its early phases, with authoritarian rule. But longer-term progress will be stunted by insistence on Leninist ideological puritanism. Further, the United States Congress will rightly resist extending most-favored-nation trading privileges to Vietnam until it commits itself more firmly to due process and human rights for all.
Sooner or later, Vietnam, like China, will have to choose between its hopes for rapid development based on international investment and its fears of foreign ideological pollution.

HEADLINE: MARKETS RETREAT AS INTEREST RATES CONTINUE TO CLIMB

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
Stock and bond prices tumbled today as long-term interest rates continued a swift, sharp ascent that is at odds with the Federal Reserve's policy of keeping rates stable and that analysts said could endanger the moderate rate of growth expected this year.
The latest rise in interest rates was set off by data on Friday that showed the economy creating jobs at a faster-than-expected clip. Although the stock market was closed for Good Friday, long-term rates jumped sharply in the bond market. Today that rise, plus a further increase in interest rates, gave the stock market a bad case of the jitters, put upward pressure on mortgage rates and further complicated the economic outlook in a Presidential election year. 
 Early this year, the economy appeared to be running out of steam. But more recently, investors seem to perceive it as rebounding strongly enough to revive fears of inflation. And that fear has set in motion an upward move in long-term rates -- including those that make home mortgages and auto loans more costly -- that may well act to restrain the economy's growth later this year without requiring any action by the Federal Reserve.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.51 points today, or 1.56 percent, to close at 5,594.37, after having been down as much as 140 points during the day. [Page D1.]
Interest rates on long-term Government bonds rose to 6.87 percent, up from Friday's close of 6.82 percent and well above the 6.67 percent rate on Thursday. At the beginning of the year, the benchmark 30-year bond yielded only 5.85 percent.
Investors sell bonds, driving up interest rates, when they believe that inflation may erode the value of their holdings or because they think that the Federal Reserve will raise official interest rates to stem inflation.
Unlike the Federal Reserve, which manipulates short-term rates after lengthy deliberations in an effort to keep the economy on an even keel, the bond market is driven by the self-interest of investors and their snap judgments about whether to buy or sell securities.
Those judgments often play a useful role in guiding the Federal Reserve and in helping to smooth out economic ups and downs. But in this case, many economists said, the market appears to be overreacting to economic data that may exaggerate the economy's strength, and that such a sharp rise in rates may well not be justified, especially since there are few signs of incipient inflation.
But whether its conclusions are justified or not, the market effectively sets mortgage rates and heavily influences other long-term loans. If the current surge in rates continues it could put the economy on the skids later this year, economists said.
"The market is saying that the economy cannot afford much of a re-acceleration in job growth without reigniting inflation," said Mark Vitner, an economist with the First Union Corporation, a banking company in Charlotte, N.C. "From a fundamental economic standpoint the market is overreacting. I don't think the pickup in job growth we've seen this year in any way confirms that the economy is about to re-accelerate or has already reaccelerated."
Previously worried about a faltering economy, the Federal Reserve last cut rates on Jan. 31, when it lowered its Federal funds rate by a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent, after cutting rates twice during the second half of 1995. After the January rate cut, most economists predicted further reductions this year, saying the economy was still weak.
But the Federal Reserve held rates steady at the last meeting of its policy-making committee, on March 26, and no one expects it to reduce rates when the committee next meets, on May 21. The outlook for the rest of the year is murky, economists said.
While the heavy selling in the bond market on Friday and today came in response to new data on the economy's strength, the rate increases also reflect the waning hopes of investors for a deal between the Clinton Administration and the Republican-controlled Congress to balance the budget in seven years, economists said. A balanced budget would mean less government borrowing and therefore less upward pressure on rates.
Already the rate rise has slowed the rush by homeowners to refinance mortgages and caused concern that home building would suffer just as the spring and summer selling season gets under way. Housing is one of the most important sectors of the economy.
If there is a positive side for consumers, it is that interest rates for certificates of deposit and other savings accounts are inching up.
But most of the concern among economists is over the potential damage higher rates can do to an economy that while improving still appears to be relatively sluggish. Sung Won Sohn, an economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said that if long-term bond rates reached 7 percent by the middle of this year, economic growth in the second half would be half a percentage point less than if rates had remained where they were at the beginning of the year.
"It's going to have a meaningful effect on the economy, especially in the second half of the year, just in time for the election," Mr. Sohn said.
The Mortgage Bankers Association, which tracks how interest rates are affecting the housing industry, a major sector of the economy, said the surge in rates was already dampening consumer interest.
David Learah, the association's chief economist, said the proportion of mortgage applications representing refinancings had fallen sharply, from 53 percent in February to 29 percent at the end of last month. Refinancing is economically important because it puts more cash into the hands of homeowners.
As mortgage rates have pushed up by a full percentage point this year, to an average of about 8 percent for a 30-year mortgage, hundreds of thousands of potential buyers are priced out of the market, Mr. Learah said. For now, home sales and home construction are holding up relatively well because the economy is creating jobs, he said, but rising rates could take their toll soon.
"The refinancing boom is over -- that's the first victim," Mr. Learah said. "Right now the housing sector will contribute to economic growth, because the economy's winning the battle. But interest rates will win the war, and when the housing sector goes down, so will the economy."
Monetary policy as practiced by the Federal Reserve has always taken account of the bond markets. Increasingly, as the White House and Congress have come to appreciate the link between long-term rates and economic health, politicians have also had to take notice of the cumulative weight of investment decisions made by bondholders around the world -- a kind of electronic plebiscite on their economic policy.
Indeed, in playing a major role in monetary policy, the markets can do the Federal Reserve a favor as well as make its job more difficult. After the 1987 stock market crash, bond prices surged, bringing interest rates down and helping to keep the economy out of recession. Should the markets this year be correct in seeing a resurgence in growth and in inflationary pressures, they will have helped provide a corrective action without the Federal Reserve having to move. Most analysts agree that the Federal Reserve would prefer not to raise rates during a Presidential election year.
The interplay among policy, politics and the markets can be even more complex. Investors today were speculating that because the economy was showing signs of strength, the Federal Reserve might have to raise rates later this year. The futures market, where investors bet on where interest rates will be months down the road, already reflects a belief that the Federal Reserve will raise the Federal funds rate, one of the short-term rates it controls, by next fall.
But if the rise in long-term rates is sustained and the economy shows signs of weakness by July or August, the Federal Reserve may well conclude that the proper policy is another cut in rates.
"Right now the market is doing the tightening for them," Mr. Sohn said of the Federal Reserve. "We still cannot rule out monetary easing by the Fed starting in July because they may have to offset the effects of higher interest rates on the economy."

HEADLINE: Stocks Tumble on Jobs Data, and Rates Hit 8-Month High

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
For the second straight month, the stock market fell victim to signs that the economy is growing faster than many on Wall Street had expected -- growth that bond traders fear will result in a revival of inflation and higher interest rates.
In the first trading session since Friday's report by the Labor Department that companies added a hefty number of new jobs to their payrolls in March, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.51 points, or more than 1.5 percent, to 5,594.37. But stock prices finished the day well above their lowest levels at midday, when the Dow was down 140 points. 
 Analysts said the partial turnaround in the afternoon came as traders reflected on the market's quick rebound last month after a similarly sharp selloff, which also followed a stronger than expected employment report.
Yesterday's decline in stock prices was matched by further losses in the bond market. After falling nearly 2 points on Friday, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 17/32, to 89 1/32 for each $100 of face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.87 percent from 6.82 percent on Friday. [Page D19.]
Traders had expected the stock market to decline sharply after Friday's bond market rout, which lifted long-term interest rates to their highest levels since late August and nearly a full percentage point above the lows hit in mid-January. Looking ahead, analysts said, stock market volatility is likely to continue, but general growth in the economy portends a further lift to corporate profits and the stock market.
"These are the initial signs of a true economic recovery," said John Y. Kim, chief investment officer at Aetna Retirement Services. "This is a decent buying opportunity and certainly not a situation where you should be lowering your equity exposure."
Broader stock market indexes also declined yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.62 points, or 1.7 percent, to 644.24, while the Nasdaq composite index slipped 12.55 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,105.66. On the New York Stock Exchange, volume totaled 421.9 million shares, up from 383.4 million shares last Thursday, and advancing stocks outpaced gainers, by more than 7 to 1.
Two historic patterns dominated the discussion among market analysts yesterday. The first compared yesterday's activity to the 171-point decline in the Dow Jones industrials on March 8, after the Labor Department's report the American companies added more than 700,000 jobs in February, twice the level expected. (That increase was revised to 624,000 on Friday.)
At that time, traders abandoned hope that the Federal Reserve would cut short-term rates further when it met at the end of March, a feeling that proved to be true. Nevertheless, in little more than a week, the Dow rebounded and hit a new high, thereafter bouncing along relatively unchanged until yesterday's drop.
Similarly, two years ago, on April 1, 1994 -- also Good Friday, with the stock market closed -- the Labor Department reported the biggest payroll gains in six years. That unexpected good economic news caused bond yields to rise sharply, to 7.26 percent from 7.08 percent.
The following Monday, April 4, 1994, the Dow industrials and the Standard & Poor's 500, which had lost about 7 percent of their value over the previous two weeks, each fell another 1 percent or so, to their lowest levels of the year.
But that Monday's trading was the end of that slide, and the stock market never looked back, rebounding 5 percent through the end of 1994, even as the Federal Reserve continued to raise short-term rates.
Yesterday's decline, like those of 1994 and last month, is likely to prove to be an overreaction, said Mr. Kim, who does not subscribe to the notion that the Fed will begin raising rates.
"I think they will stay neutral for the foreseeable future," he said. While bond and stock traders retain vivid memories of 1994, when the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by 2.5 percentage points., "I don't see that scenario repeating itself," he added.
The greatest danger to stock prices, Mr. Kim said, will come if growing employee payrolls result in upward pressure on wages, as companies raise wages to attract qualified workers. Significantly, he said, companies hired relatively few part-time workers in the first quarter, a trend that, if it continues, would mean that job growth is "more robust than we expect."
Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed, a mutual fund company in Overland Park, Kan., said the volatility characteristic of the last few weeks in the stock market was likely to continue as traders reacted to new economic data that would provide little clear direction to long-term investors.
"So long as we're in a period where there is no reasonable proof of the strength of the economy, the bond market is going to be in a defensive mode," Mr. Herrmann said. He predicted that stock and bond markets would continue to roil "until sometime in May, when we have enough hard numbers to suggest whether the economy is accelerating," and if so, how quickly.
Traders, with their shorter-term focus, however, are less willing to wait for definitive data, to the frustration of mutual fund managers, said Robert Bissell, a senior vice president at Wells Fargo Investment Management. "I was surprised to see the bond market react so negatively to a sign of some strength -- but not significant strength -- in the economy," he said.
Whatever the trend in the economy, some analysts still believe that stocks are overpriced. Melissa R. Brown, director of quantitative analysis at Prudential Securities, said the spread between the current price-earnings multiple of the S.& P. 500 and a "fair value" measure based on current interest rates "is the widest it has been since 1990." She calculates "fair value" at about 15 times earnings, while the S.& P. is trading at about 17 times this year's expected earnings.
Of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrials, only three managed gains yesterday, and they were some of the economically sensitive stocks that have been the strongest in the market this year. I.B.M. rose 1 5/8, to 119 3/8; Alcoa jumped 1 1/4, to 63 1/4, and Bethlehem Steel gained 1/8, to 13 3/4. Gains among those and other cyclical companies have pushed the Dow industrials to a gain of 9.3 percent since Jan. 1, twice that of the S.& P. 500.
Bank stocks were hit hard because of perceptions that higher interest rates would damage their earnings. Citicorp fell 1 1/2, to 79 3/8; Chase Manhattan fell 2 3/4, to 70 5/8, and BankAmerica fell 2 3/4, to 76.
Brokerage firms also declined amid expectations that a stock market drop would diminish trading. For example, Dean Witter, Discover fell 3 1/4, to 55 1/4, and Merrill Lynch fell 3 1/8, to 58 1/2.
Other interest-rate and economically sensitive stocks, like those of utilities, which rely on borrowed capital for the bulk of their financing, also plunged. Con Edison closed at 30 5/8, down 1 1/8; Duke Power closed at 48, down 1 1/2, and Southern closed at 23 1/2, down 7/8.
But technology stocks generally moved against the trend. Compaq rose 2 3/8,, to 40; LSI Logic rose 2 1/4, to 30 7/8, and Intel rose 1 3/8, to 60 5/8.
Informix, a software developer whose shares were the most heavily traded on American stock markets yesterday, plummeted 7 1/8, to 18 3/8, after saying that first-quarter profits would be below Wall Street estimates. Nearly 31 million shares changed hands, more than 10 times the stock's average daily volume.

HEADLINE: ON BASKETBALL;
St. John's Expectations Exceeded Its Means

BYLINE: By Malcolm Moran 

 BODY:
They used the word "family" at St. John's yesterday, a word that fit more comfortably when the university's place in the world was more consistent. When Fran Fraschilla was welcomed to the St. John's family as the 15th men's basketball coach in the university's history yesterday afternoon, identified by Ed Manetta, the athletic director and one-man search committee, as "our top choice," the mating dance was complete.
The cutting predictions of the basketball industry, an increasingly ruthless place, were right on target this time. The consensus thinking was simple. St. John's would start high, shooting for the giants of the industry, floating some names to give its search a sense of credibility. Then the university would realize how unprepared it is to deal with the highest economic reaches of the business, deal with the reality check and settle for a comfortable candidate. 
 Fraschilla has been doing more than just waiting for this chance. He has worked for years from the mid-major conferences to the Big East and the Big Ten. He speaks the language. His up-tempo style made him a popular candidate with the players. He could do for St. John's what Tom Penders did for Rhode Island in 1988: Turn the available talent into a National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament team, get hot at the right time and appear as if he had invented the game.
But it is a different St. John's that Fraschilla goes to work for, far different than it was in December 1975, when undefeated Indiana was the big-time team and St. John's took a bold if unsuccessful shot in the Holiday Festival. The ante has been raised because the Big East now makes everything possible. Now that St. John's has the intention of building dormitories and a new arena, tolerance is no longer affordable. There is only one constant -- a perception of a place in the world that is built upon a world gone by. The expectation of performance is the equal of that at Duke or Kansas, but the resources are not.
This is what has happened to the family at St. John's. The men's basketball coach is gone. The women's basketball coach is gone. The baseball coach is gone. The athletic director is gone, with far less ceremony than Jack Kaiser deserved for a professional lifetime of service. The hiring of Brian Mahoney, announced in the same room in Alumni Hall four years ago, was characterized yesterday as Jack Kaiser's recommendation to a search committee. Longtime family members have been treated better.
Lou Carnesecca, an assistant to the Rev. Donald Harrington, the university president, was an understated presence on Fraschilla's day. He was asked if the job had changed.
"When I first started coaching, you were allowed to grow and make mistakes," Carnesecca said, looking back more than 30 years. "They took a chance on you and they helped you develop. Today, you've got to do it. If not, you're on your way. The business has changed.
"The big thing about it is years ago, after you won a ball game, there was joy. You were happy. You had a little libation. Today, after you're finished you go to the video room. And where there was joy, now it's relief. It's different."
St. John's took too long to learn what many outsiders understood for years, that for much of the last three decades it benefited from the fact that a long time ago, a kid named Carnesecca set out for college in the Bronx, became homesick, came back to Brooklyn and never looked back. Goodwill was a constant, tolerance was a given.
Now the bodies come and go, with one noticeable problem. If this program has a national profile as high as its demanding followers insist, where were the high-profile candidates? Not Pat Kennedy or Rick Majerus. What does it say that John Calipari, the coach of the University of Massachusetts, a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference and a program that was dormant less than a decade ago, had no interest in discussing the opportunity to work for the Big East's New York City franchise?
"I would say there were coaches with higher profiles than Fran with whom there were discussions," Harrington said. "Either direct discussions, or through intermediaries. And there was a significant amount of interest there. But not all the factors came together in such a way that one of those people emerged as being the best candidate. I would say there was interest from high-profile coaches."
The St. John's that expanded its family again yesterday is neither the one that Fran Fraschilla observed in the 70's nor the place it aspires to be. It is somewhere in between, a work in progress, a place dependent upon a basketball identity that has far more to do with where it is than what it is.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Tumble As Treasuries Extend Selloff

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities tumbled yesterday, extending a selloff from Friday, when a stronger-than-expected employment report jolted the market.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 17/32, to 89 1/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.87 percent, from 6.82 percent on Friday.
It was the highest yield since Aug. 23, 1995, when the yield reached 6.91 percent. Trading volume was 58 percent heavier than on an average Monday, according to Govpx, a bond pricing service.
While the price decline was not as steep as it was on Friday, when trading halted early in observance of Good Friday, it shows how bearish the market has become.
Market participants see an economy growing faster than previously believed, increasing the chances that inflation, now moderate, will begin to accelerate. Such an outlook rules out any relief soon from the Federal Reserve through a cut in short-term interest rates.
"The latest breakdown in the credit markets has strongly confirmed the bearish bias," said Joel Marver, chief technical analyst at Technical Data in Boston. "Don't expect to see the yield floors we saw in 1995 and early 1996 again this year." Technical Data forecasts the yield on the 30-year bond rising to 7.25 to 7.40 percent in the next few months. The last time the yield was at 7 percent was May 11, 1995.
Concerns about the market's ability to absorb new supply also hurt prices yesterday as the Treasury began auctioning $30.25 billion in new two-year notes and five-year notes, in addition to $27 billion in its regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills.
Although the market was bracing for poor results at the Treasury's auction of two-year notes, prices sagged further than expected. The high yield at the auction was 6.144 percent.
Today, the Treasury will sell five-year notes and analysts expect dealers will have to make further concessions in price to see an improvement in demand. In when-issued trading yesterday, the five-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.48 percent, about 8 basis points more than it was on Friday and 36 points more than on Thursday. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Still, traders said there was fairly strong demand at the regular weekly auctions for three- and six-month bills. The average rate for the three-month bill fell to 5.03 percent, down from 5.07 percent last week, and the rate of the six-month bill rose to 5.19 percent, from 5.06 percent. Analysts said that the auction was good in light of the market's bearish sentiment and that the bills likely received help from both the selloff in the long end of the market and in the stock market.
Bond prices came off their lows in the afternoon, helped by a short-covering rally by investors who had bet against the market.
But the cash market was also weighed down by a decline in the futures market, as the June bond contract fell below 108 24/32. The contract dropped as low as 108 10/32 before closing at 108 29/32.
And some analysts see concerns about inflation mounting.
For instance, the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities is at its highest level since 1988. The index, which measures various commodity prices, is often looked upon as a harbinger of rising inflation.
"So far the rise in the index has not overly affected Treasury bonds, but you can be sure that the market is very much aware of the rise," said Margo Evashevski, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International of San Francisco, a market research and analysis firm. "But as wage inflation fears begin to surface, the inflationary outlook may be more concerning."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of new two-year notes and three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Man Arrested In L.I. Killings Of 5 Prostitutes

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: YAPHANK, L.I., April 8

 BODY:
A 42-year-old postal worker has confessed to killing five prostitutes, dismembering their bodies and disposing of them in garbage bins on Long Island and in Yonkers over the last five years, the police said today.
The suspect, Robert Shulman of Hicksville, hung his head and trembled as he was led from the police station this morning for arraignment on murder charges, which could result in the death penalty. 
 Asked by reporters how he felt, he said, "Horrible." Asked if he had anything to say to the families of his victims, he said softly, "I'm sorry."
At a news conference this afternoon, Detective Lieut. John Gierasch of the Suffolk County police noted several similarities between Mr. Shulman's case and that of Joel Rifkin, the unemployed Long Island landscaper who admitted in 1993 to having killed 17 prostitutes. But Lieutenant Gierasch said he knew of no connection between the two men, nor did he believe that Mr. Shulman had patterned his crimes after those of Mr. Rifkin.
"All I can say about Mr. Rifkin is, it appears coincidental at this time that Mr. Rifkin was apparently operating at the same time as Mr. Shulman and engaged in similar activity," he said. "We have no information that connects one to the other or indicates that they knew each other."
Asked if there might be more victims, Lieutenant Gierasch said the police believed Mr. Shulman had been "relatively forthright," but he added, "Obviously everything is subject to a continuing investigation and we are not yet prepared to conclude anything one way or another."
Mr. Shulman told the police that he picked up his victims on a street corner in Hollis, Queens, which he said he visited often because it was a known gathering place for prostitutes.
He said he took them to his one-bedroom apartment, where they would use drugs and have sex before he bludgeoned them to death with barbells, a hammer or a baseball bat.
He would cut off their arms so their bodies could not be identified. But Suffolk County detectives, with the help of a tattoo found on a victim who was dumped in a bin in Melville, L.I., in December, were able to identify her as Kelly Sue Bunting, 28, of Hollis, Queens, known as a prostitute.
When detectives questioned other prostitutes who worked along Jamaica Avenue near 201st Street in Hollis, they remembered Ms. Bunting and recalled that they had last seen her drive away with a man in a light blue Cadillac that often cruised there.
At least two prostitutes told the police they also had been picked up in the same car and taken by the same man to a house in Hicksville. They led the police to Mr. Shulman's apartment at 11 Glow Lane, Lieutenant Gierasch said. He said that Mr. Shulman, a letter handler at the post office in Hicksville, was arrested Saturday afternoon a short distance from his apartment. A search of his apartment turned up forensic evidence linking him to the murders, Lieutenant Gierasch said, but he declined to describe the evidence.
He said Mr. Shulman lived in an apartment on the first floor in a house shared with three other people, including Mr. Shulman's younger brother, Barry, 37, and an elderly man and woman who were not identified.
Neighbors said the Shulmans kept to themselves but often had visitors late at night.
"In all the 10 or 12 years he lived there, he never once spoke a word to us," said Henry M. Bialick, a retired weekly newspaper publisher. "We had him pegged as being a little weird, but of course nobody thought he was a killer."
Thomas Rottino, 21, said: "He really wasn't like a neighbor. He was just some weird guy. You'd wave to him and he wouldn't wave back."
Mr. Rottino's mother, Patricia, said she was shocked at Mr. Shulman's arrest. "It's pretty scary when you find out you are living next to an animal like this," she said. "It's a very trusting, middle-class area where some people don't even lock their doors. You'd never expect anything like this."
Mr. Shulman was to have been arraigned today in Suffolk County Court in West Islip, but when it was disclosed in court that he had assets totaling nearly $300,000, the hearing was delayed until Tuesday so Mr. Shulman could hire his own lawyer. Authorities argued that he was not indigent and therefore should not be assigned a court-appointed lawyer.
Detectives said that Mr. Shulman made $34,000 a year as a postal worker and said they did not know where he had obtained his large savings. The police said Mr. Shulman grew up in Long Beach and Westbury, where he graduated from high school in 1972. He also took courses at Hofstra University for two years, the police said.
Although he was initially charged with the murders of two women whose bodies were found in Suffolk, District Attorney James M. Catterson said Mr. Shulman would be tried on three counts of murder.
He said the third count would be for the slaying of an unidentified woman whose dismembered body was discovered on April 6, 1995 in a recycling plant in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. He said the body had been left in a Dumpster in Nassau County, but was not discovered until a truck that emptied the bin arrived at the recycling plant.
Mr. Catterson said he had not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty for Mr. Shulman. He said the death penalty was an option made available under the state's recently enacted capital punishment law, since the last killing took place after the law went into effect last year.
The law states that capital punishment may be sought if two or more people within the state are slain within a period of 24 months in separate but similar incidents or pursuant to a common scheme or plan.
The bodies of two victims were found in separate bins in Yonkers: The body of Lori Vasquez, 24, of no known address, was found in a garbage can in a residential area on Aug. 31, 1991; and the body of the second and unidentified victim, who had a butterfly tattoo on her back, was found June 27, 1992, in a bin at a small shopping center.
Lieutenant Gierasch said that Mr. Shulman's brother, Barry, was "still under investigaton" in connection with the case, but had "not been charged with anything."
"We do not believe, at this time, that he is involved in the murders," he said. "He may have had some complicity in the removal and discarding of the bodies. That's under investigation."
The police said that although the two brothers lived in close quarters, they had separate rooms and worked different shifts at the post office and did not necessarily know the activities of one another.
The police said the blue car driven by Robert Shulman to cruise the streets of Hollis, Queens, was registered in the name of Barry Shulman.

HEADLINE: New Jersey's Senate Race Attracts the Nation's Eyes

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 5

 BODY:
To reach voters in New Jersey, Richard A. Zimmer, who has already made his pitch in Texas, Florida and New York, will spend the next months seeking support in Illinois, Arizona, Minnesota and California.
Mr. Zimmer, a 51-year-old Republican Representative from Flemington, is running for an open Senate seat in a state served by two of the most expensive advertising markets in the country, and, following a well-trod path, he is looking for money wherever he can find it. 
 Although he is not as well known in his own state as the Democratic candidate, Representative Robert G. Torricelli of Englewood, Mr. Zimmer knows that political contributors nationwide are interested, for two reasons. First, this race for the seat being given up by Bill Bradley, along with 12 other open races, will play an important role in determining the makeup of the Senate. Second, voters here, among the first to revolt against high taxes and big government, offer a testing ground for national political messages.
A lawmaker who promoted fiscal restraint in nine years in Trenton and six in Washington, Mr. Zimmer wants the race to be a test of voters' willingness to approve Government spending.
"This kind of match is a matchup that will be seen as a referendum on government," Mr. Zimmer said after a campaign event this week, "and it will get national attention as a result."
A third-term member of the House, Mr. Zimmer has two primary challengers, State Senator Richard J. LaRossa and Richard A. DuHaime, a Passaic County freeholder. He has the endorsements of many New Jersey Republican leaders, including Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, and a big fund-raising advantage. Mr. LaRossa has tried to make an issue of Zimmer's out-of-state trips, saying, "We do not need another U.S. Senator jet-setting around the country raising money for campaign advertisements."
Mr. Torricelli, 44, who began the race with $1 million in his campaign treasury, has had an easier time than Mr. Zimmer raising money in and out of state. During the last three months, he has taken in more than $100,000 from contributors in Florida and $100,000 from labor organizations in Washington.
With seven months to go before Election Day, both national parties have already committed $750,000 each, the full amount allowed under Federal election laws, to their nominees in the fall. The Democratic National Committee has cited New Jersey as one of five states in which it will mount major get-out-the-vote drives.
"This is a top race and will receive top attention across the board," said Gordon Hensley, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Beyond direct financing, both parties are expected to contribute millions for such generic campaign efforts as telephone canvassing. Since New Jersey is also a swing state in the Presidential election, there will be numerous visits from President Clinton the Republican nominee, expected to be Senator Bob Dole.
By November, each of the two Senate candidates expects to have raised $6 million to $8 million, to pay for what is typically one of the more expensive races in the country, in a populous though small state. Broadcast advertising is their largest expense, because the candidates must buy time on stations in New York and Philadelphia to reach New Jersey voters. There are no major network affiliates in New Jersey.
Mr. Torricelli has moved ahead of Mr. Zimmer in raising money, according to estimates based on their Federal Election Commission filings, which will not be publicly released until mid-April. Lawrence Weitzner, Mr. Zimmer's manager, said the Zimmer campaign would report $2.2 million to $2.5 million in cash, with a small percentage from out of state. David Plouffe, campaign manager for Mr. Torricelli, said he would report $3.7 million in cash, with about 25 percent from outside the state.
The state's trend-setting position has magnified its national attention, several political analysts said. For example, the anti-tax Republican revolution that swept the country in 1994 first swept New Jersey in 1991, when control of the State Legislature switched from the Democratics to the Republicans. "New Jersey is the place that sort of seems like the harbinger of things to come," said Ross K. Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University.
The retirement of Senator Bill Bradley created a vacuum that drew in Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Torricelli, two strong candidates who reflect the national agendas of their respective parties in a state with the landscape, population and issues that make it a virtual microcosm of America.
Economically, few states better symbolize the nation's confusion than does New Jersey: a Republican Governor, Mrs. Whitman, has remained widely popular in large part because she delivered on her promise of huge income tax cuts over the past two years, while large employers like AT&T have laid off workers by the thousands.
To win over the state's traditionally nonideological moderate voters, both Mr. Torricelli and Mr. Zimmer are trying to paint each other as an extremist. But Mr. Torricelli's liberal-to-moderate record in Congress differs from the tax-and-spend liberal that Mr. Zimmer has described, while Mr. Zimmer's conservative-to-moderate record suggests that he is not a Newt Gingrich clone, as Mr. Torricelli has said.
Both are experienced campaigners, although Mr. Torricelli seems to relish the spotlight more.He has gained widespread attention for accusing the Central Intelligence Agency of sponsoring violence in Guatemala and for his courtship of Bianca Jagger, the former wife of Mick Jagger.
Mr. Zimmer, on the other hand, seems stiff and uncomfortable in public. Even Mr. Weitzner, who is managing Mr. Zimmer's campaign, conceded that Mr. Torricelli has more of a national profile. "He's more flamboyant," Mr. Weitzner said.
"He's a family man," Mr. Weitzner said of Mr. Zimmer. "He's got two kids. I think that's the profile that more voters are looking for."
Mr. Zimmer has begun criticizing Mr. Torricelli for absences during votes in Congress and for a recent reprimand that Mr. Torricelli received from the House Ethics Committee for preparing one press release, amounting to $2.83 of fax machine time, in his Congressional office for political purposes. "This will be about character," Mr. Weitzner said. "Mr. Clean against Mr. Mean."
The difference between the two candidates was underscored vividly in events each held this week.
Thirty minutes after his news conference in Newark was scheduled to begin on Wednesday, Mr. Torricelli finally arrived, his car backing rapidly up a one-way street before screeching to a halt.
Because of high winds that morning, Mr. Torricelli's announcement that he would receive the endorsement of a fellow Democrat, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, had been moved at the last minute from the steps of the Federal courthouse to a nearby indoor location. An aide to Mr. Torricelli explained that the Congressman refuses to wear mousse, so 'the wind would have made his hair look a mess in front of the television cameras."
Mr. Torricelli was loquacious, wading through a small crowd of uniformed police officers who attended to show their support for his gun control initiatives. Arriving at the microphone, Mr. Torricelli joked about his small size, comparing himself with the retiring Senator. "Thank you for combing Essex and Union County to find the only officers short enough to make me look more like Bill Bradley," he said.
Two days later, Mr. Zimmer held a press conference to announce that he was receiving the endorsement of former Gov. Thomas H. Kean. Mr. Zimmer chose the steps of the Somerset County Administration Building in Somerville, a quaint central New Jersey town.
Mr. Zimmer arrived early, and although he looked as if he would rather have been at a desk balancing a budget, he mingled with the few supporters and reporters who showed up. His straightforward announcement lasted five minutes.
For now, many voters seem unaware of the early campaigning and nationwide canvassing for money. A Quinnipiac College poll released in the first week of April of 908 registered voters in New Jersey found 38 percent still undecided.
But some voters, like Charles Jones 3d, are already watching closely. Mr. Jones, a resident of Somerville since 1958, is just the kind of voter who could make the difference in November. Although he is a registered Democrat and the vice president of the local building and trade workers union, Mr. Jones attended Mr. Zimmer's event outside the county administration building. "Sometimes I vote Republican," he said. "It all depends on the candidate and the issues."

HEADLINE: U.S. Puzzling Over Motives Of North Korea in the DMZ

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
American officials, while playing down the threat posed by North Korea's sudden round of violations of the military armistice that keeps the peace between the two Koreas, said today that they were baffled by the message Pyongyang was trying to send.
They presume North Korean troop movements inside the two-and-a-half-mile-wide demilitarized zone are part of a continuing effort to undermine the 1953 Military Armistice Agreement and push the United States into bilateral peace negotiations with Pyongyang. Yet they think the timing is symbolic, possibly aimed at the parliamentary elections in South Korea this week and a brief visit there planned for next week by President Clinton. 
 But without direct contact with the secretive Pyongyang Government, relatively faceless after the death of Kim Il Sung in July 1994 and the stillborn emergence of his successor and son, Kim Jong Il, American officials do not really know. "I think they're trying to coerce the United States to sit down with them and negotiate a peace treaty without Seoul, and we have no intention of doing that," a senior Pentagon official said.
The good news, he and others said, was that after three nights of armed incursions, North Korean troops did not enter the demilitarized zone again Monday night, showing an encouraging degree of restraint and political control in a country with severe economic problems and food shortages.
"But as to why they did it to begin with," the Pentagon official said, "we probably won't know that until we ask them." And asking them is problematic, he said, since the North Koreans no longer attend meetings at the DMZ and the last face-to-face meeting between North Korean and American diplomats was late last year at an undisclosed location.
In every meeting with Pyongyang officials, the United States has rejected any idea of peace talks with the North Koreans that would cut out Seoul, American officials said, emphasizing that peace was a question primarily for the North and South Koreans to settle among themselves.
While the United States can play "a supportive role," the officials said, the original Military Armistice Agreement was signed between Pyongyang and the United Nations, not the United States. That position was repeated today by the State Department spokesman, Glyn Davies, who urged the North Koreans to abide by the armistice agreement.
Still, some officials suggest that Washington's willingness to negotiate directly with North Korea over its nuclear program in October 1994 gave some impetus to North Korea's efforts, which began that February, before Kim Il Sung's death was announced in July, to replace the 43-year-old agreement through bilateral talks between Pyongyang and Washington.
The nuclear agreement promised future bilateral relations, including the establishment of interest sections, between Pyongyang and Washington -- but only after other commitments were met, American officials emphasized, including constructive dialogue between North and South Korea, a message "repeated at every opportunity."
But in December 1994, the Americans negotiated with Pyongyang again for the return of a helicopter pilot shot down over the DMZ. In each case, the South Koreans were kept informed, the Americans say, although Seoul made no secret of its unhappiness over the nuclear negotiations.
On Feb. 22, the anniversary of Pyongyang's proposal two years ago for direct talks with Washington on a peace treaty, North Korea proposed an "interim peace agreement" to be negotiated with Washington.
"Though the interim agreement was a new wrinkle, we viewed this as a continuation of the peace talks idea" and pronounced it unacceptable, an American official said. But that latest proposal seems at the heart of these most recent events.
Last Thursday, North Korea announced that it would no longer honor the terms of the Military Armistice Agreement and North Korean troops stripped off their required armbands. On Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights they moved an increasing number of troops -- up to 300 -- into the demilitarized zone 30 miles north of Seoul, setting up offensive positions with mortars before leaving.
The movements violated the armistice, which calls for no more than 35 soldiers and 5 officers with side arms to enter the demilitarized zone.
At the same time, Pentagon officials said, there has been no North Korean military activity elsewhere that would indicate any imminent invasion or aggression. On Friday, the officials said, the first day of the incursions, there was no military ground or air movement in North Korea at all, which the Americans understood as a message not to overreact.
And in what may be a reflection of North Korea's dire economic straits, the Pentagon officials said, the normal military training period of December to March was marked by "virtually no training that we could see." They also said that some North Korean soldiers were doing civilian police duty for the first time, an indication that potential civilian unrest over the lack of food is preoccupying the military more than an imminent invasion of the South.
"They do these exercises, and then beg the international community for food," one Pentagon official said. "April is a critical month for them and they don't have much to harvest, as we understand it, and we don't know what their food stocks are like."
Those concerns were articulated by Defense Secretary William J. Perry after a speech today. He called the incursions "provocative" and added: "The second and broader concern is that the North Korea economy is in terrible shape now. It is so bad that there is really not enough food distributed to feed all the people. And this is causing, as you can imagine, tremendous tensions and conflicts within the country."
 "We have a continuing concern that the Government in North Korea might respond in some sort of an irrational way to the problem they see in trying to simply keep themselves, keep the regime in power because of these great internal tensions," he added.
 The Presidential spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said that when President Clinton meets President Kim Young Sam of South Korea in Cheju on April 16, "the current status of forces along the DMZ will no doubt be a subject."
While Mr. Clinton's visit, announced only March 29, may explain the timing of the incursions, American officials discount the idea that Pyongyang is trying to influence elections, much as China tried to do when it twice organized military exercises near Taiwan before elections there.
"Raising the specter of a military threat would be expected to help the ruling party in South Korea, and they know that," an official said. "So we assume that's not their calculation."

HEADLINE: Hung Jury Declared in Killing Of a Chinatown Tourist in 1991

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
A Manhattan jury was declared deadlocked yesterday on murder charges against a reputed Chinese gang member accused of killing a tourist in Chinatown five years ago.
But the defendant, Jin Wai, 23, who officials say is a member of the Ghost Shadows gang, was found guilty of criminal possession of a weapon, a felony that carries a sentence of 5 to 15 years. 
 The victim, Rhona Lantin, a 26-year-old economist with the United States Agriculture Department in Washington, was visiting Chinatown when she was struck down by gunfire in what the police said was a gang dispute.
The Manhattan District Attorney's office will decide by May 3 whether to seek to retry the murder case, said a spokesman, Wayne Brison.
Miss Lantin had attended a high school reunion on July 4, 1991, at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, where she and five classmates watched a fireworks display and then drove to Chinatown for a late meal.
Prosecutors said Mr. Jin, also known as Chiu Wai-Ip, was arguing with an exiled member of the Ghost Shadows, a gang that has terrorized storeowners in the neighborhood through extortion and robbery, as the car carrying Ms. Lantin stopped at Mulberry and Bayard Streets at about 11:30 P.M.
Mr. Jin pulled a gun on the gang member and fired several shots, prosecutors said, but the gang member escaped harm. One bullet, however, struck Miss Lantin in the right temple, they said.
Two jurors who spoke on the condition of anonymity, a copy editor for a travel magazine and an author of children's books, said yesterday that the first vote as deliberations began was 11 to 1 for conviction but by yesterday had dropped to 8 to 4.
The jurors said the leader of the not-guilty group said he had "a gut feeling" that Mr. Jin was innocent. No gun was recovered and, while witnesses saw Mr. Jin with a gun, none of them actually saw him shoot Miss Lantin.
Finally, Justice Felice K. Shea of State Supreme Court told the prosecutor, William Mahoney, and the defense lawyer, Lawrence Dubin, that the jury appeared "adamant" about being deadlocked and to force them to continue deliberations "would not be fruitful and would be coercive."

HEADLINE: Proposed Multipurpose Stadium: Bucking Recent Trend

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
On the surface, the argument seems unassailable: A giant dual-purpose sports stadium on Manhattan's West Side as a future home for the Yankees would make more money for the city and for local businesses than a single-function baseball park. It would create more jobs and generate more tax revenue without significantly higher costs. Squeezing every possible use from the space, according to a consultant's report, offers the best hope of paying off the stadium's $1 billion-plus price tag.
But what looks like a cash cow might conceal, underneath, a clunky dinosaur, stadium experts said in assessing the report commissioned by New York City and the Yankees. The trend in major league baseball around the country is 180 degrees away from the switch-hitting megastadium with its artificial grass and multiple uses that is enthroned in the report as the city's most lucrative choice. 
 Most newer stadium plans are consciously aimed at recapturing the intimacy and innocence of the game as it once was, with smaller urban ball parks and real, easily trampled grass that does not lend itself to trade shows and concerts. The goal in places like Baltimore and Cleveland -- both recently cited by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for their successful downtown ball parks -- is toward cozy reconnection of fan and player, not the sprawling distances required in stadiums built for baseball and football. The Cleveland Indians, for example, went in 1994 from a 70,000-seat dual-purpose stadium, shared with the Browns football team, to a comparatively petite 42,865-seat downtown park and saw attendance soar.
"Every park that has been built for baseball in the last 10 years has been a baseball-only park," said Janet Marie Smith, a vice president for planning and development for the Atlanta Braves, who helped plan Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore as a vice president there in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Ms. Smith said that most megastadiums built in the 1970's, the height of that trend, had since been chalked up as failures.
"The Phillies, the Reds, the Pirates, the Braves -- they were all disappointed in their parks," she said. "They were designed as multipurpose, the seats weren't configured for baseball and they had little personality -- there's a spirit that's hard to capture in a domed multipurpose stadium because the orientation is toward concerts and other events."
The question, then, is whether the New York economy is different enough from the rest of the nation in that a tried-and-rejected idea identified with the 1970's might still make perfect sense here, or whether the numbers will drive the city into a corner where the only thing that can be done economically is not the right answer for baseball.
New York's Deputy Mayor for economic development, John S. Dyson, said in an interview that in a perfect world the Yankees would have their own smaller, dedicated ball park, with real grass instead of artificial turf. But he remains convinced that the pressures dictated by a limited amount of land, a tight public purse that constrains how much taxpayers should have to contribute and the vagaries of weather in the Northeast suggest the best solution may be a large, removable-roof multipurpose stadium on Manhattan's West Side.
"Is it ideal? No," Mr. Dyson said. "The ideal would be to have a sports stadium for everybody. But I believe this is the way it ought to be done -- we have to amortize the expenses over as many ways as possible to benefit the city."
He said that the aspect of the plan that gave him the most pause was the apparent impossibility of natural grass, which fans and players both prefer. "But we can't think of any other way, and neither can they," he said of the consultants working with the city. And the simple fact, he added, is that New York is different from every place else -- both in what can work and what has to be made to work because of the unique local pressures.
"When somebody says, 'This isn't how they do it in Boise,' I say with all due respect, 'This is New York,' " Mr. Dyson said.
The stadium proposal for Manhattan does conform to some national ball park trends. In cities from Denver to Baltimore, teams are moving their teams closer to the downtown urban centers. Stadium experts say part of the pressure for that is cost saving, to try to capitalize on the transportation and parking that already exist.
But again, the Yankee plan, with its huge cost, counters that trend on another level. The driving economic force for a Manhattan location is not the existence of an infrastructure that makes the plan cheaper -- there are huge obstacles to overcome, like the construction of a platform over the existing West Side rail yards -- but rather the allure of a huge market that makes its high cost feasible.
Many of the new downtown stadiums are also envisioned specifically as anchors of downtown urban renaissance. A spokesman for the Cleveland Indians, Bob DiBiasio, said that the area around the team's new park was "awful." But he said that 15 new restaurants had opened in the last two years within a five-minute walk of home plate.
In New York, the Yankees would be leaving the city's poorest borough and moving to its richest, where much of the recent economic success in the city, especially in tourism, has been concentrated.

Surge in Market Rates Worrisome to Policy Makers
Stock and bond prices tumbled as long-term interest rates continued a swift, sharp ascent that is at odds with the Federal Reserve's policy of keeping rates stable. Analysts said the rate surge could endanger the moderate rate of growth expected this year.
The latest rise in interest rates was set off by data released Friday that showed the economy creating jobs at a faster-than-expected clip. The markets' response put upward pressure on mortgage rates and further complicated the economic outlook in a Presidential election year. [Page A1.]
 
The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond rose to 6.87 percent, from 6.82 percent. [D19.]
 
$1 Billion Bid for Cajun Power
Zeigler Coal Holding and a unit of Northern States Power said they had offered $1 billion in cash for the non-nuclear assets of the bankrupt Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, beating out 11 other bidders. [D2.]
 
Web Guides Attract Investors
Nynex and the Tribune Company each announced investments in companies that provide electronic guides to the Internet's World Wide Web. Tribune paid $7 million for an 8 percent stake in Excite of Mountain View, Calif., which produces search software, and Nynex plans to buy 5 percent of privately held Infoseek. [D4.]
 
Raytheon to Buy Chrysler Units
Raytheon agreed to buy most of Chrysler's Texas-based military electronics and aircraft-upgrading business in a deal valued at about $475 million. Raytheon will add the units to E-Systems, which it acquired last year for $2.3 billion. [D2.]
 
Moody's Recalls Retired President
Moody's Investors Service said that William O. Dwyer, its former president who retired from its corporate parent, Dun & Bradstreet, in 1993, would again become its president. Mr. Dwyer, who is 63, replaces John Bohn, 58, who resigned suddenly on April 1. [D4.]
 
Big Board Would Ease Curbs
The New York Stock Exchange is seeking to loosen its two most extreme curbs on sharp market swings. The so-called circuit breakers were designed by the Big Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission after the October 1987 stock market crash. [D4.]
 
Ann Taylor to Salvage Supplier

HEADLINE: Some Cities Flexing Fiscal Muscle To Make Employers Raise Wages

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, April 3

 BODY:
The pay of 4,000 low-wage workers here office clerks, janitors, ticket takers -- has risen sharply since the city forced companies with city contracts to pay their workers well above the minimum wage. Now more than 30 other cities are also seeking ways to use taxpayer money as a lever to raise the pay of the working poor.
The goal of what its advocates call the living-wage movement is legislation that will require any company that benefits from tax dollars -- like tax rebates, supplier contracts, cash grants or the use of city-owned land -- to pay employees at least $6 an hour, and gradually more. The national minimum wage is $4.25 an hour. 
 So far, only Baltimore, Milwaukee and Santa Clara County in California have enacted such ordinances. Each goes only part of the way toward meeting the goal, with Baltimore's the most ambitious. It raised the minimum to $6.10 an hour last July for companies with city contracts, with an increase to $6.60 set for July 1 of this year.
Other city governments, including those in New York, New Orleans, Denver, Chicago and Los Angeles, are considering similar measures. So are a few states. Minnesota is the closest to enacting one, although the Governor there says he will veto it.
"I would rather fight this battle in Congress as an increase in the minimum wage," Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke of Baltimore said in an interview. "But I became convinced that if I did not agree to the living wage, we would end up paying out more in food stamps and welfare, and so far the ordinance is not that costly."
The living-wage movement is in part an effort to fill the void left by Congress's failure to keep the minimum wage moving in step with the cost of living. Even the current effort by the Clinton Administration to raise the minimum to $5.15 would not make up the ground lost since the 1970's. But the movement is also a response to the growing concentration of low-wage jobs in cities, many of them spun off by the hotels, restaurants, convention centers and sports stadiums that have sprung up as a result of publicly subsidized downtown revival projects like Baltimore's Inner Harbor.
The two city ordinances enacted so far cover only companies that do business with the local governments as suppliers. Neither has been broadened to apply to companies that have benefited from public subsidies like tax rebates or the use of public land for hotels or office towers. Santa Clara County requires a $10-an-hour minimum wage for the employees of any company granted a county tax abatement but says nothing about suppliers.
The limited coverage in Baltimore has softened its impact. The Schmoke administration estimates that once the rate rises to $7.70 in 1998, the cost to the city -- in higher prices for goods and services the city buys -- will still be only $3.5 million, or less than 1 percent of the city's current revenues.
But the narrow scope of the Baltimore measure sticks in the throats of officials at the Industrial Areas Foundation, a network of community organizers with roots in the labor movement that is promoting the living-wage issue. With so few people covered, they say, the Baltimore ordinance is hard to enforce, particularly in a city with 9 percent unemployment. "Unless you establish a much broader base, one that reflects all the public spending, then the wage floor will stay at $4.25 an hour," said Jonathan Lange, an organizer with the foundation.
Downtown redevelopment projects have resurrected many cities as centers of commerce and tourism. At the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, the shopping pavilions, restaurants, office towers and hotels bustle with people. An aquarium, convention center and baseball stadium also bring people downtown -- greatly increasing the resolve of Baltimore's major corporations, like T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund operator, to stay in their office towers nearby.
But such commercial centers are sustained through huge public subsidies. Maryland's state government, for example, is spending $200 million to build a football stadium, and the city government must raise $50 million to help pay for a convention center expansion.
The justification for these subsidies has always been the promise of good jobs for the minorities that now populate many American cities. Sixty percent of Baltimore's population is black. And the jobs have indeed come, by the tens of thousands, but they are for maintenance workers, cleaning people, janitors, gardeners, store clerks, restaurant and hotel workers, and ticket takers and hawkers at Orioles games -- all low-wage jobs. That raises the question of whether more downtown redevelopment, so important to American cities over the past 25 years, can be justified.
Another question is whether Baltimore's government, or any city government, should continue to shrink, laying off workers and cutting services so that scarce tax revenue can be channeled in part into subsidies for downtown redevelopment. Indeed, the Baltimore ordinance is aimed in part at helping workers who once earned $8 an hour or more as municipal employees -- serving food in school cafeterias, cleaning municipal buildings or driving city vans -- but who do the same work for half that pay today, as employees of the private contractors that now supply these services to the city.
Mayor Schmoke says such privatization and cutbacks must continue, in part to pay for downtown redevelopment. His administration has eliminated 4,000 jobs since 1987. Baltimore's business community insists that if wages rise by very much, rents and hotel rates will as well, and that businesses will go elsewhere.
"I have a serious doubt," said M. J. Brodie, president of the City of Baltimore Corporation, which oversees redevelopment, "based not on empirical evidence but on talking to business people, that we can make the leap to what is called a living wage and still remain competitive."
The Rev. Vernon B. Dobson, minister of the Union Baptist Church in rundown East Baltimore, heartily disagrees. As the dean of Baltimore's black ministers, he has played a major role in bringing nearly 50 black churches into the new battle over jobs and wages.
"Only as I have gotten older," said Mr. Dobson, a 73-year-old civil rights veteran, "have I realized that an impoverished community lacks the means to lift itself."
Working with the Industrial Areas Foundation, the churches campaigned for the wage ordinance finally enacted in late 1994, with its requirement that companies holding contracts with the city pay employees at least $6.10 an hour. When the wage goes to $7.70 in 1998, it will be what a full-time worker would have to earn to support a family of four at the Labor Department's current poverty line, $15,600 a year.
A similar coalition in New York, also put together by the foundation and involving 350 churches, more than half of them black or Hispanic, is backing a bill before the City Council that would set the pay floor at $7.50 an hour. Its chances of being enacted are uncertain.
The Milwaukee measure, like Baltimore's, sets an eventual minimum wage of $7.70 an hour, but that affects only the companies selling to the schools. For other municipal work, the level is $6.05 an hour. Milwaukee's ordinance covers even fewer workers than Baltimore's.
For Mr. Dobson, championing the living-wage movement is something of a reversal. In 1978, responding to appeals from Baltimore's business community to back the Inner Harbor, he mobilized enough black voters in a referendum to allow the first Inner Harbor buildings to rise on city-owned land.
"Who had thought that so much activity would not produce good jobs," Mr. Dobson said, rubbing his eyes and remembering the optimism.
The optimism faded slowly in Baltimore. This was home until the late 1980's to thousands of high-wage, blue-collar jobs, most of them now gone. The biggest employer was Bethlehem Steel, with its Sparrow Point works, but dozens of small manufacturers also went away. And people like Rene Brown, who once earned $8.50 an hour as a supervisor at a meatpacking plant, found themselves moving down the pay ladder.
For three years, Ms. Brown has been cleaning the 17th floor of the World Trade Center, an office tower in Baltimore's revived downtown. Her pay is $4.25 an hour. Never a raise, no benefits, no overtime. All 36 rooms must be cleaned in four evening hours. But ask her why she does not hunt for a higher-paying job, and she bristles.
"I like where I am," she said. "I like the tenants. They know me and trust me. They leave their belongings around and know they are safe. Tell me why I have to move. Just give me a raise."
Coming to work one day last year, Ms. Brown met Kerry Miciotto, who was serving coffee on a street corner. Ms. Miciotto, 38, is an organizer for Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development, the operating arm of the coalition formed by the black churches and the Industrial Areas Foundation. A friendship developed, and soon Ms. Brown was signing up other cleaning people for the coalition's Solidarity Sponsoring Committee, an experimental effort at organizing a new kind of union for the working poor, particularly people who often change employers. The recruiting lure was the call for a living wage.
So far, only Baltimore has so elaborate a structure for this movement, and the Solidarity Committee, with 350 members, exists only because a traditional union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, is financing the experiment, having already paid out $600,000.
The experiment has worked for Ms. Brown, who is in her 40's. While the World Trade Center's offices are rented to private companies, the building is owned by the state, which subcontracts cleaning services to the company that employs Ms. Brown. She and Ms. Miciotto joined a delegation last month that met with Gov. Parris N. Glendening and appealed to him, in effect, for a raise. Although the state is not bound by the city ordinance, the Governor, in a letter to the two women, said the state would put the contract for cleaning services up for bids again, specifying a $6.60-an-hour minimum wage.
"I felt totally honored to be sitting there with him," Ms. Brown said. "But I am waiting to see it really happen."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
When Pettitte Takes Mound, There Is No Room for Jitters

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
Andy Pettitte pondered the question for a few seconds and could not supply an immediate answer. Asked to remember the last time he was nervous, Pettitte was stumped. He remained silent until someone mentioned his wife giving birth to a son in 1994. Pettitte nodded and called it nerve-racking.
But what about in baseball? Moments later, Pettitte recalled a sunny afternoon two spring trainings ago when he opposed Jimmy Key and the Yankees in an intrasquad game. He was an untested left-hander supposedly destined for Class AAA and he was frightened. 
 "As far as baseball, I've never been scared," Pettitte said. "When I faced our lineup then, I was definitely nervous. I remember shaking out there on the mound."
Do not expect Pettitte to be nervous today when he is scheduled to oppose the Kansas City Royals in the home opener before a sellout crowd of more than 57,000 at Yankee Stadium, that is, if the weather that has already wreaked havoc by forcing the postponement of three games is agreeable.
Maybe Pettitte should be tense. After winning their first two games in Cleveland, the Yankees lost three straight games in Texas while scoring only five runs. Pettitte will be the first starter from a renowned rotation to stroll to the mound in the Bronx in a season filled with sizable expectations and his responsibility is to halt the losing streak.
"I'm excited," said the 23-year-old Pettitte, who will be the youngest Yankee to start a home opener since Jim (Hippo) Vaughn did so at 22 in 1910, when the team was called the Highlanders and home was Hilltop Park on 168th Street and Broadway. "I really didn't realize it was that big a deal."
Everything about the home opener is a big deal. George Steinbrenner, who was noticeably absent from a road trip that started neatly in Cleveland and turned nasty in Texas, will be in the owner's box and Joe DiMaggio will throw out the ceremonial first pitch.
Too bad the DiMaggio of old couldn't join an underachieving lineup that is missing Tony Fernandez more than the team imagined, misses Tim Raines, the leadoff man who still hasn't made his Yankee debut, and misses Pat Kelly, whose replacement, Mariano Duncan, is no defensive stalwart at second and is better suited to being a utility man.
Fernandez (fractured right elbow) might be lost for the season and Kelly (right shoulder tendinitis) cannot even throw a ball, so General Manager Bob Watson said he would meet with Steinbrenner soon to discuss possibly pursuing a starting second baseman.
The switch-hitting Raines (chip fracture of the left thumb) can only swing left-handed, so Dion James, unemployed a week ago, has started the last three games, including two in left field.
"We're a little short right now," is the polite way that David Cone phrased it after he pitched seven superb innings and emerged with a no-decision in a 4-1 loss to Texas during a doubleheader loss Sunday.
Despite the dreary situation, Watson refused to sound an alarm. "I don't see us being that desperate right now," Watson said.
But the G.M. is obviously not thrilled with Duncan at second, the rookie Andy Fox as the utilityman and a spotty bench.
"I'm not going to say I'm happy," Watson said. "Sure, we'd like to improve. But I'm not going to mortgage the future."
Kelly received another cortisone shot yesterday and could either be throwing by the weekend or pondering new treatment and perhaps more surgery. If Steinbrenner gives approval to obtaining a second baseman, Watson said he would ignore the reserve players who have been casually mentioned as possibilities.
"If I'm going to do something, I want to go front line," Watson said. "It's not going to be for a backup. I'd like to talk front line with somebody. But that's going to be tough. Everyone's only played five or six games."
New York's sixth game will feature Pettitte, who was 8-2 with a 2.61 earned run average at the Stadium last year. When Manager Joe Torre told Pettitte that he was starting the home opener after the soggy weather spoiled plans and prevented Key from being available, the never nervous left-hander said, "Oh, O.K."
Even after Pettitte's 12-9 rookie season and snazzy spring, Torre was amazed by his effort in 35-degree weather last Wednesday against the Indians. Holding the defending American League champions to one run in six and two-thirds innings, he guided the Yankees to a 7-2 victory, despite not having a useful change-up. Of course, Pettitte was not uptight.
"He was remarkable," Torre said.
So the legend of Pettitte will continue today, against Chris Haney and the Royals. It will be a big day. It is always a big day, even bigger when the Yankees have lost three in a row.
But for Pettitte, it will not be nerve-racking. "I'm not scared of going out there and messing up," he said. "I know I'm going to give it the best I can. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out."

HEADLINE: Taiwan's Lobbying in U.S.: Mixing Friendship and Hardball

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
Last spring, a representative of Taiwan got himself invited to a reunion in Dallas of the Flying Tigers, American pilots who fought as volunteers for the Chinese Nationalists, and pledged that his Government would erect a monument to Americans killed in China in World War II.
In February, Taiwan donated $100,000 to an environmental group in Connecticut, Friends of Animals, to help curtail poaching of elephants and the rare black rhinoceros and to offset its image as a major trafficker in contraband rhino horn. 
 But when a China scholar at the University of Michigan recently co-signed a dissent at the end of a report commissioned by the Council on Foreign Relations on how to strengthen American ties to Taiwan -- saying that relations with Beijing must take priority -- the retaliation was swift and harsh.
Taiwan accused the scholar, Kenneth Lieberthal, of failing to "promote our national cause" and announced that as a result, a three-year $450,000 grant to the university would not be renewed in the fall for another three years.
When it comes to Taiwan's campaign to win friends, influence people and get its way in the United States, no gesture is too small to make, no potential supporter too insignificant to pursue. Indeed, Taiwan has lobbied hard in this country since 1949, after the Nationalists lost China's civil war to the Communists and retreated to the island of Taiwan.
But rarely has the power of Taiwan's lobby been so strongly felt as last month, when China staged ambitious war games in the Taiwan Strait and the United States sent warships to nearby waters. Taiwan's representatives, lobbyists and friends in Congress went on the offensive in a different way --successfully pressing both houses of Congress to pass unanimous resolutions condemning China's belligerence.
Although the United States and Taiwan officially agree with Beijing that there is only one China, Taiwan's campaign has helped convince many Americans that Taiwan, not the officially recognized People's Republic of China, is the China that should be known and loved.
The campaign seems to ignore two crucial moments in Chinese-American relations: the 1972 Shanghai Communique, in which the Nixon Administration acknowledged Beijing's position that there is but one China and that Taiwan is part of China, and the decision by President Jimmy Carter in December 1978 to establish diplomatic relations with Beijing, and to cut off official ties with Taipei in early 1979.
The tools Taiwan has used in its remarkably successful all-out wooing of America: money, charm, pressure and creativity.
Taiwan has cultivated friendships in places high and low by welcoming hundreds of lawmakers and their staffs, governors and state legislators, even veterans groups and Rotary Club members on first-class junkets to Taipei.
It has gained access to the White House, Congress, Wall Street and editorial pages by spending millions of dollars on some two dozen lobbyists and political consultants.
It has disarmed the heartland with its community spirit, sponsoring cultural events infused with political meaning, like a recent production in Houston of a version of "King Lear" set during the ancient Zhou dynasty -- complete with silk brocade costumes. In exchange, it has urged local governments to fly Taiwan's flag in international displays and to issue diplomatic license plates to the cars of its officials.
And when Taiwan has had to, it has played hardball, punishing institutions when they objected to its rules. "The Taiwanese keep asking for things, they keep knocking on doors," said Richard V. Allen, the national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan who has served as both a paid and unpaid adviser to Taiwan. "They're either tied with or second only to the Israelis in their effectiveness."
To the chagrin of Beijing, Taiwan has never had a more powerful message to sell. Its leaders have transformed their tiny island of 21 million people into America's sixth-largest trading partner, with a full-fledged democracy and higher foreign-currency reserves than any other country except Japan. Taiwan's international stature skyrocketed last month when it held direct presidential elections for the first time, and dozens of American lawmakers are expected to attend President Lee Teng-hui's coming inauguration.
By contrast, China remains an authoritarian Communist state whose relationship with Washington is strained over such issues as the pirating of American movies and music by China, its poor performance on human rights, its weapons-related sales to Pakistan and Iran, and its recent war games near Taiwan. American exports to Taiwan last year were $19.3 billion, as against $11.7 billion to China, even though its population is 60 times bigger than Taiwan's.
"If you want to sell soap, it has to smell good," said James Lilley, a former Ambassador to China who is avidly pro-Taiwan. "And Taiwan has a hell of a good product to sell."
Mr. Lilley, now a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, which has received money from Taiwan in the past, has himself been a beneficiary of Taiwan's generosity.
"They bring me over and pay my way," he said. "They put me up in a hotel. They send over flowers and fruit -- but no women -- to my room. I see the people I want to see."
Taiwan officially operates in Washington from a five-story de facto embassy known as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, which employs about 300 people and loosely administers 13 regional offices around the country.
Because the United States does not recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state, Taiwan's "diplomats" may be warmly welcomed in Congress but are forbidden to enter the White House or State Department. That means they must think creatively when they want to meet senior officials.
Benjamin Lu, Taiwan's "ambassador" here, has had several private meetings with President Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, through the intercession of Peter Rosenblatt, a lawyer and former Johnson Administration official with close ties to the Democrats.
"I do what they ask me to do," said Mr. Rosenblatt, who is on an $8,500-a-month retainer to Taiwan.
But the economic and cultural office has nowhere near the budget of the Taiwan Research Institute, an organization associated with President Lee's Nationalist Party. The institute now pays the lobbying company of Cassidy & Associates $125,000 a month, according to the company's disclosure statements filed with the Justice Department, as required by law.
For that fee, Cassidy employees meet with lawmakers and Administration officials, brief journalists and put pressure on state capitols to adopt pro-Taiwan resolutions "to promote understanding and awareness of the progress made by the democracy movement in Taiwan," the statements say.
Cassidy has claimed credit for helping to persuade Congress last year to vote overwhelmingly to give Mr. Lee a visa so that he could receive an honorary degree from Cornell University, his alma mater, which received a $2.5 million grant from "Friends of Lee Teng-hui" in 1994. The vote prompted the Clinton Administration to overturn 16 years of policy and allow the visit.
Taiwan also made a dramatic offer last year to pay $1 billion to the United Nations in exchange for membership. The offer was turned down; China, a permanent member of the Security Council, would have automatically vetoed such a move.
Undaunted, Taiwan has begun a major effort this year in Congress and in state legislatures to gain support. In recent years, 23 state legislatures have passed pro-Taiwan resolutions, some of them calling for membership in the United Nations.
But Taiwan sometimes is carried away with its desire to get its way, and the experience of the University of Michigan is only the most recent instance of an institution's learning the hard way that money often comes with strings attached.
A few years ago, Taiwan's Government refused to renew a three-year, $440,000-a-year grant to Columbia University because it felt that Taiwan's political opposition had received too much prominence at an academic conference.
And two years ago, the Fairbanks Center for East Asian Research at Harvard University had to return $40,000 to Taiwan's Government after it objected to the choice of Gordon Wu, a Hong Kong business magnate, as the speaker for a major public lecture.
But Taiwan has many other ways to spread its good will.
In one week in February, three separate delegations of lawmakers toured Taiwan, including Representative Matt Salmon, a freshman Republican from Arizona.
Mr. Salmon said he could not recall who paid for his trip, but his office said the visit had been financed by Taiwan's equivalent of the Chamber of Commerce. He said that he has been pro-Taiwan since he was a Mormon missionary there in the 1970's and that the visit had nothing to do with his vote last month in favor of a nonbinding resolution for the United States to defend Taiwan if China attacked.
"They were cordial in every way," Mr. Salmon said. "They were very thoughtful, very nice. The rooms were very nice, I mean very nice. We weren't driven around in limousines. I think they were Buicks."
Taiwan's courtship of the powerful, the not-so-powerful and the potentially powerful has paid off in unexpected ways.
Eleven years ago, on Taiwan's National Day rally and parade through Presidential Square in Taipei, there were two American Governors in the audience: Charles S. Robb of Virginia and Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
"Bill Clinton, Governor of Arkansas, U.S.A., said it was apparent to see from the parade that Chinese people here and abroad support the Government," Taiwan's news service reported that day.
Mr. Clinton understands firsthand the problems of Taiwan: the trip was one of four he made to the island in his years as Governor.
He never stepped foot in China as Governor, and considering the deterioration in relations, he may never visit as President. 
 The article also misspelled the name of a research center at Harvard that had to return $40,000 to Taiwan's Government after Taiwan objected to the choice of a Hong Kong businessman as a lecture speaker. It is the Fairbank Center for East Asian Research, not Fairbanks.

HEADLINE: Nynex and Tribune Company Buy Stakes in Internet Ventures

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The Nynex Corporation and the Tribune Company each announced separate investments yesterday in companies that provide electronic guides to the Internet's World Wide Web, offering the latest evidence of growing investor interest in such services.
The Tribune Company said it had paid $7 million for an 8 percent stake in Excite Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., company that produces search software and operates a site on the World Wide Web that allows people to use its program to locate other sites. 
 Nynex announced that it had spent several million dollars to acquire 5 percent of the privately held Infoseek, which operates a competing Internet search and navigation company based in Santa Clara, Calif. Nynex did not give a specific dollar amount for its investment.
As the number of sites on the World Wide Web has soared over the last year, the need for tools to help people find what they are looking for has become increasingly important. Search sites such as the ones operated by Excite and Infoseek have become gateways to the Internet for many users, making the sites attractive to advertisers.
In a recent study of selected sites by the research firm Simba Information Inc., Infoseek generated the most advertising revenue in January and February.
"The Web has 200,000 sites and no one can find anything," said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a research firm in Bethesda, Md. "It's getting worse, not better."
That has fueled investor interest in the companies. Last week, after Excite and Lycos Inc., another web guide company, held their initial public offerings, their stock prices soared. Yahoo! Inc., which is probably the best-known Internet search company, is scheduled to go public this week.
"There is still no clear winner yet," Mr. Arlen said.
But yesterday's announcement by the Tribune Company, which made its investment in Excite before last week's initial public offering, appeared to dampen some of the enthusiasm. At about $8.70 a share, the price that the Tribune paid for its stake was much less than the offering price of $17 a share Excite was sold at last week. Shares of Excite plunged on news of the Tribune Company deal, closing yesterday at $15.375, down $4.625 in Nasdaq trading. Lycos shares closed at $17.75 yesterday, down 25 cents.
For the Tribune Company, which owns newspapers and television and radio stations, Excite is the latest in a series of minority investments in new media companies. Tribune also has stakes in the on-line service America Online, the electronic payment company Checkfree and Starsight Telecast, which produces an electronic television program guide.
Before yesterday's announcement, Nynex had chosen Infoseek's search software as the backbone for Big Yellow, an electronic yellow pages on the World Wide Web that Nynex said would include every business in the country. In addition to the investment, which was made by Nynex Information Technologies, Infoseek said Mathew J. Stover, president of Nynex Information Resources, had been elected to Infoseek's board.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
A No-Nonsense Teacher Braving the Wilderness

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

A SCHOOLTEACHER
IN OLD ALASKA
The Story of Hannah Breece
Edited by Jane Jacobs
Illustrated. 302 pages. Random House. $24.
 This book, which is in the most-unforgettable-character tradition of the old Reader's Digest, arrives like a manuscript in a bottle. It is the publication, after a delay of more than 50 years, of the story of Hannah Breece, who spent the years between 1904 and 1918 teaching school in various parts of Alaska. Miss Breece's grand-niece, Jane Jacobs, a writer whose books on urban life and architecture have been influential for more than three decades, edited the manuscript, which was written in the 1930's but rejected for publication then. Luckily Miss Breece's story is finally seeing the light, for she is an unforgettable character indeed. We should all have had a great-aunt like Ms. Jacobs's.
Miss Breece, a rugged educational pioneer from Pennsylvania, had taught Indian children in the Western States and was already 45 when she arrived at her first Alaskan post in a village called Afognak in the Kodiak archipelago. An unmarried woman of exceptional energy, fortitude and dedication, she wanted to bring the benefits of civilization to what she commonly called "these primitive people," by which she meant a large number of the 60,000 or so inhabitants who lived in the vastness of Alaska early in this century. 
 Miss Breece traveled by steamer and skin-covered canoe, by dog sled, on horseback and on foot through freezing winter passes. She taught in the most educationally needy and remote places in Alaska that she could persuade her employer, the Department of the Interior, to send her to. She was a benign, prudish autocrat who knew what was right, whether it was forbidding children to come to school until their mothers had cleaned their kitchens, or dumping barrels of "hooch" so village women would not be tempted by demon drink.
"I have always been careful when working among inferior races to convey to them that I have their interests at heart and love and respect them as people," Miss Breece writes in one passage, revealing the mixture of condescension and high expectations that she held toward those among whom she worked, "but that I do not come among them to sink to their level but to uplift them."
Ms. Jacobs, a person of a more relativistic sensibility, is embarrassed by remarks like those. Indeed, we learn in her informative and affectionate editor's preface that the "white man's burden stuff" in her great-aunt's memoir is what first dissuaded her from helping get the book into shape when Miss Breece, retired and living with relatives in Pennsylvania, first wrote it. Ms. Jacobs writes also that Miss Breece's original text was "maddeningly unassembled" and full of gaps, so that "reading it was like contemplating a box of jigsaw puzzle pieces."
Ms. Jacobs did her editor's work very well. Miss Breece, who died in 1940 at the age of 80, is not a literary giant, but she is a good storyteller with an eye for detail, a keen appreciation of Alaska's natural beauty and, despite the white man's burden stuff, an unalloyed admiration for many of the people she encounters. Her descriptions of the hardships of Alaskan life -- and her willingness to share some of them -- make for arresting passages in a book that never fails to hold the reader's interest.
There is, for example, the story of 14-year-old Ephram Derenoff who, because of his age, had no time to lose as far as his schooling was concerned. But Ephram "lived on a small off-shore island by himself, to make hay and tend the family's cattle," Miss Breece writes. "He fed them when it was too stormy or the snow too deep, hunted game for himself and lived in a shack." The Derenoff family's spare economic situation made this necessary. Still, in order to feed the cows and enable the boy to go to school, Miss Breece continues, his mother "left their home in the Russian village to live all winter by herself in the desolate shack." She adds, "Could any mother and father make greater sacrifices to educate a child?"
The Katharine Hepburn character in "The African Queen" has nothing on Hannah Breece, who matter-of-factly tells stories that would bring out a more "wasn't it amazing" quality in somebody less self-controlled. She slept in unheated cabins on Arctic nights, outran a forest fire, hid from foraging bears, fell off a bridge into an icy flume, was grounded on a shifting sandbar on a ramshackle boat in a river coursing between Iliamna Lake and the Bering Sea. She must have been lonely. Occasionally, especially during the sunless Alaskan winter, she admits to melancholy, but she never complains and she certainly never feels sorry for herself, not even when she breaks a leg in a fall in the panhandle city of Douglas.
Even her assumption of cultural superiority only slightly diminishes the admiration one has for this teacher, both intrepid and proper in her long skirts and petticoat. Her smugness was cultural rather than racial, and in this sense she might even have been ahead of her time. "I want to draw a line between 'whitizing' and civilizing them," Miss Breece assures us of the villagers to whom she was bringing the benefits of their still recently acquired Americanness.
She could note that "a white man who married an uneducated native woman did not bring his wife up to his standards but instead almost invariably descended into native ways himself." But in her role as a teacher, she treated everyone alike: the Russians left over from the Czarist possession of Alaska, the Eskimos, the Aleuts, the Athabaskans, the Scots, the Swedes. She believed in education as the route to a better life, and in this she was not wrong. The dignity, intelligence and skills of the indigenous people and the innumerable acts of kindness shown to her by "natives" do not escape her attention.
Ms. Jacobs has done us all a service by bringing out this memoir in unexpurgated form. It is the story of a remarkable woman who lived a heroic life.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
At God's Elbow

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the spring of 1982 I was working in the Business Day section of The New York Times and was befriended by a young editor there named Nathaniel Nash. Nathaniel was a gentle soul and a deeply religious Christian. He liked to come by and talk to me about Israel. In April 1982 The Times assigned me to cover the Lebanese civil war, and at my goodbye party Nathaniel whispered to me: "I'm going to pray for your safety." I always considered his prayers my good luck charm, and when I walked out of Beirut in one piece a few years later, one of the first things I did was thank Nathaniel for keeping watch over me. He liked that a lot.
I only wish I could have returned the protection. Nathaniel Nash, age 44, was the one reporter on Commerce Secretary Ron Brown's airplane when it crashed into a Croatian hillside last week. Newspapers are rightly shy about highlighting their own losses in such a tragedy. In news stories, Nathaniel was listed with 34 others in the paragraph beginning, "Also killed in the crash of Secretary Brown's plane . . ." But Nathaniel deserves to be remembered for more than that, for his life and his death say so much about what the craft of journalism is, or should be, about. 
 Nathaniel was The Times's Frankfurt bureau chief, specializing in economic news. He previously served in Latin America as the Times bureau chief in Buenos Aires. Nathaniel was a species that's being lost in this era of 500 cable channels -- the professional reporter and proud of it.
With today's cacophony of magazine shows, Oprah-style interview sessions and talking-head news commentaries, many people have lost sight of what real journalists do. Journalists do not appear on the McLaughlin show and scream at each other. Journalists don't interview mothers and daughters on daytime confession hours. Journalists don't have their own shock-jock radio shows. Unfortunately, though, these are the people many Americans see most often in quasi-journalist roles and these are the people they think of as journalists today. Journalists are reporters like Nathaniel Nash, who go off to uncomfortable and often dangerous places like Croatia and get on a military plane to chase after a visiting dignitary without giving it a second thought -- all to get a few fresh quotes, maybe a scoop, or even just a paragraph of color that no one else has, for a story about the reconstruction of Bosnia.
Nathaniel also was a living reminder that to be successful, journalists don't have to be cynics. The book on Nathaniel as a reporter was that he was too nice. His colleagues always doubted that anyone that nice could ever succeed in journalism, but somehow he triumphed over this handicap and went from one successful assignment to another. It was because Nathaniel intuitively understood that there was a difference between skepticism and cynicism. This is a lesson a lot of us have forgotten. Skepticism is about asking questions, being dubious, being wary, not being gullible. Cynicism is about already having the answers -- or thinking you do -- about a person or an event. The skeptic says, "I don't think that's true; I'm going to check it out." The cynic says: "I know that's not true. It couldn't be. I'm going to slam him." There is a fine line between the two, but it's a line Nathaniel always respected.
Finally, Nathaniel could always remind his fellow journalists how lucky they were to have the front-row seat to history that comes with being a foreign correspondent. Whether he was covering Europe or Latin America -- which he loved -- Nathaniel always had this endearing "I-can't-believe-they're-actually-paying-me-to-do-this" quality about him. He always conveyed a sense that being a foreign correspondent was a privilege to be cherished.
Nathaniel left us too soon. Journalism needs people like him so badly. But our loss is nothing compared with that of his wife, Elizabeth, their twin 5-year-old daughters and 8-year-old son. While nothing can compensate for the loss of a father, one only hopes that those children will one day know that their daddy represented the very best qualities of his profession.
When I first heard the news about Nathaniel I whispered a prayer for him, but it quickly struck me that that wasn't necessary. For he was such a good soul I know that right now he is sitting at God's elbow -- and probably taking notes.

HEADLINE: Buzzless Buzzword

BYLINE: By Bill McKibben; Bill McKibben, an environmental writer, is author of "Hope, Human and Wild."

DATELINE: JOHNSBURG, N.Y.

 BODY:
The fight against bad English is not frivolous," George Orwell wrote in 1946 -- a conviction that has grown ever truer in the intervening half century. Today, a muddled thought or phrase can send the whole globe marching down a cul de sac. This is why Earth Day, April 22, should be spent with dictionaries and thesauruses.
For nearly a decade, environmentalists have tried to introduce a catchword into the planetary vocabulary. "Sustainability" made its debut in the mid-1980's in United Nations documents, and today it is standard jargon in certain circles. Think tanks and policy analysts use it constantly; just last month, President Clinton's Council on Sustainable Development issued its report, "Sustainable America." 
 But the phrase has never made the leap to lingo -- and never will. It's time to figure out why, and then figure out something else.
"Sustainability" was born partly in an effort to obfuscate, to paper over the tension between the fact that societies are overexploiting the planet's physical resources and the fact that everyone seems reluctant to stop this rapaciousness. Hence, phrases like "sustainable development" and "sustainable growth" are used when the real intent is to put off the day of reckoning for a few more decades.
The President's Council, whose report is powerful in many ways, could not even bring itself to call for less use of energy, only for less use of energy "per unit of industrial output" (say, one less barrel of oil in making each widget while producing ever more widgets).
It's no wonder we want to avoid choosing between economic growth -- between an expanding, interdependent world economy -- and a healthy environment. Helping economies in poor countries grow might reduce some of the environmental damage that comes of desperation; it allows rich countries to alleviate certain kinds of pollution with advanced technology.
But the largest environmental problems -- global warming, destruction of habitat -- are essentially caused by economic and population growth, not by faulty technology.
To deal with such troubles in the next few decades, the world will need not only bicycles and energy-efficient mass transport, it will need a new way of thinking. Our societies will have to voluntarily stabilize, if not reduce, the size of their economies and populations.
 "Sustainability," which Orwell would have disdained, is no help in this situation. In competition with "growth," "sustainability" is doomed, because it does not refer to anything familiar. We understand "growth," because everything that lives grows.
But we do something else, too, if we are lucky. We mature. We stop growing physically, and we start concentrating on moral, spiritual and cultural development. And so "maturity" just might be the right new buzzword. People can imagine mature societies, civilizations, perhaps even economies, even though we may not know yet how to achieve them.
The transition to a world of tighter limits -- by choice now, or necessity later -- would be wrenching. But at least the term fits our frame of reference.
Maturing means restraining oneself -- precisely what environmentalists contend our species must do. Maturity means, at bottom, recognizing that you are not the center of the world but part of something larger. And that is just the point that the ailing planet wants everyone to grasp.

HEADLINE: If Refrigerators Could Speak, The Stories They'd Tell

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
CAROLYN VERWEYST used to think she knew everything about people and their refrigerators: what they crammed into crispers and shoved onto shelves, how long they foraged for midnight snacks, why they preferred doors that opened to the right instead of to the left.
Then she went to the videotapes, and found out there was a lot she didn't know. 
 Yes, the videotapes: hours and hours of people opening their refrigerators, staring at the shelves, taking food out, putting food in. "We mounted video cameras in peoples' houses," said Ms. Verweyst (pronounced VUR-wist), a marketing executive with the Whirlpool Corporation in Benton Harbor, Mich. "Every time they opened their refrigerator, they turned on a video camera."
Whirlpool's videotapes are not exactly material for "Candid Camera." The 75 refrigerator owners in Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles knew they were being watched.
Nor were Mrs. Verweyst's tapes anything like "9 1/2 Weeks," the sexually explicit 1986 film that starred Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger. Ms. Verweyst likes the scene where Mr. Rourke spreads food over Ms. Basinger's body as she lies in front of -- what else? -- a refrigerator.
"That didn't happen in any of our videos," Ms. Verweyst said. "We got excited when we saw people stuffing 12 loaves of bread in the refrigerator."
Supermodels like Elle Macpherson have been known to keep film and champagne in their refrigerators, while some college professors use them as safe-deposit boxes, stowing chapter after chapter of their latest work in the one place in the house they consider fireproof. But the videotapes yielded new answers to the basic question: what do refrigerators contain these days?
The surprise answer is: more beverages and a lot less food.
In fact, based on the videotapes, Ms. Verweyst has concluded that refrigerators in the 1990's are more like beverage coolers. Consumers on the videotapes stored much less meat and fewer raw ingredients than Whirlpool executives had expected 75 typical consumers would. (Whirlpool, which promised the 75 consumers confidentiality, said it did not tabulate the precise breakdown of how much space they gave over to meat, food and beverages.)
Of course, time-pressed Americans have been cooking less and bringing home more packaged and processed foods for years now. But the videotapes also showed Whirlpool that it was time to start building next-generation refrigerators around the packaging people bring home. That means bigger storage spaces.
It may also mean more refrigerators in the kitchen -- but not necessarily more of the standard white boxes.
Sub-Zero of Madison, Wis., introduced a line of small freestanding refrigerators last year. Paul Leuthe, the company's manager of marketing services, said the idea was to put specially designed, limited-capacity appliances in "decentralized, functional places." "If you have a large concentration of vegetables, you can keep the vegetables near a sink," he said. "If you have a lot of pre-packaged foods, you can put one next to a microwave."
Or even, say, in a mud room. "If you have kids coming in and going out, you can put a small base refrigerator by the back door," Mr. Leuthe said. "They're in and back out again."
He concedes that modular refrigerators have been a slow sell. They have been marketed to consumers who are remodeling their kitchens and architects who are planning brand new ones.
Ten years ago, Ms. Verweyst thought that baby boomers would downsize -- trade in their refrigerators for ones with fewer cubic feet -- as they became empty nesters. "The reality finally hit us," she said. "Even if you're an empty nester, you want a refrigerator that's as big or bigger than the one you had when you were raising kids. People say, 'I can't believe we raised four kids and only had a 16-cubic-foot refrigerator,' and go out and buy a 25-footer." Apparently, people think bigger is better.
In the 1980's, the average new refrigerator was an 18-cubic-foot model. Now, it is closer to 22 cubic feet, and models that are 30 cubic feet are not unusual.
Mr. Leuthe said the typical Sub-Zero was a 20-cubic-foot unit, but the company's new modular refrigerators may scatter even more storage space around the kitchen: an under-the-counter unit can hold five cubic feet, and some kitchens are designed to have two or three of them in addition to a larger unit.
Refrigerator manufacturers are also confronting another design issue: with baby boomers moving into an older age bracket, hard-to-reach shelves may have to be moved into more convenient locations.
"You want to be considerate of things that are awkward for older people, like bending and stooping," said Martha Reek, Whirlpool's senior home economist. She has been looking into making shelves more easily adjustable, "so you don't have to bend over if your knees hurt," she added.
Another discomfort-reducing possibility: adding tiny wheels to help crisper drawers slide out without a lot of effort.
Perhaps only in America would such a commonplace appliance be studied in such detail -- there are a total of 99.8 million refrigerators in the United States, the Government says. There are 75 million frost-free models and 24.8million that have to be defrosted manually. Refrigerators are the nation's second-most-common consumer product, after televisions. There are 119 million televisions.
The refrigerator may be the 20th-century's quintessential invention, revolutionizing eating habits and making possible long-distance shipments of foods. The appliance finally did what everyone from Alexander the Great (whose fondness for ice cream is well documented) to Thomas Jefferson (who designed an ice house for Monticello) to Thomas Moore, a 19th-century farmer from Brookeville, Md., had dreamed of.
Moore, after all, invented the first refrigerator, and also the word to describe it. It was no frost-free model, but it had one advantage that latter-day refrigerators do not: it was portable. Moore's device was essentially a wooden box. Inside, he placed a jug loaded with cream, milk or butter that was nestled in ice. Moore headed off to his local market, where customers were so delighted by the freshness of his dairy products that he commanded twice the price of his competitors.
Hungry, thirsty consumers had to wait until fairly late in the Industrial Revolution before manufacturers began turning out mechanical ice boxes. And eventually, marketing executives like Ms. Verweyst began peering inside.
Above all, what the videotapes make clear is that consumers do not see the insides of their refrigerators the way the engineers who designed them do.
Ms. Reek recalled a recent consumer test session in which she gave people a container with removable half-moon indentations to put eggs in but didn't tell them its intended purpose. One woman wanted to take the egg-holders out and use the box for ice cubes.
"It's fine with me if that's what she did with it," Ms. Reek said, "but the person who designed it never considered it for ice cubes, which means from a science point of view we need to test it in freezing conditions."
 
Questionable Contents
 
IF you are what's in your refrigerator, what's in there, anyway?
"Unidentified things wrapped in foil," said G. David Newman of Morris Plains, N.J., who discovered and discarded them when he bought a new refrigerator.
"Very, very primeval oozes of cilantro and watercress," said Nina Shippen, a health-care marketing executive from Newton, Mass. "And chicken wings. They have little white spots on them, but they're only six or seven weeks old."
At least those items were edible originally. In a Whirlpool Corporation survey of 500 consumers last year, answers included a shoe, a cordless telephone, a copy of TV Guide and a remote control.
As for food, 80 percent of the respondents said they had milk in their refrigerators, 37 percent said eggs, 36 percent said juice and soda, 26 percent said butter and 11 percent said cheese. Leftovers were also on the list: 22 percent said they had pasta, 17 percent pizza, 10 percent chicken and 8 percent meatloaf.
Whirlpool conducted the survey by telephone, and said the margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
Chefs do not necessarily keep food in their refrigerators. Christopher Gross, the chef and owner of Christopher's in Phoenix, said he stored two essentials there: caviar and batteries. Jean Joho, the chef at Everest in Chicago, keeps his cigars next to the mustard.
Whirlpool is so committed to well-scrubbed shelves that it promotes "Clean Out Your Refrigerator Day" to induce consumers to throw away outdated items.
"Most of the time, the stories that are told are very logical," said Martha Reek, the senior home economist at Whirlpool.
Which is how she explains another item reported in the survey, car keys in the freezer. "You come home from the grocery and throw things in the freezer so they won't thaw," she said, "and you throw your keys in there."
Whirlpool's survey also found a frozen rat, worms for fish bait and a toaster.
"One lady told me her favorite pet bird had died," Ms. Reek said. "Her spouse was out of town. She froze it, and pulled it out later. I think they were going to take it outside and bury it in a special place."
Clearly a one-time event.
How often do most people clean their refrigerators? The answers in Whirlpool's survey ranged from once a month (42 percent) to once a week (30 percent) to once a year (5 percent).
Ms. Shippen said her refrigerator had been cleaned twice in the two years she has had it: once by a friend who was appalled by what was inside and once -- last Friday, in fact -- by Ms. Shippen herself. JAMES BARRON

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar, Helped by Economy, Rises Against Yen and Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar surged to a 26-month high against the Japanese yen yesterday as traders displayed renewed optimism about the American economy and concern over tensions on the Korean peninsula.
The dollar also rallied to its highest point against the German mark in more than six months and its highest New York finish in more than a year on signs that German interest rates may come down soon. It also rose broadly against other major currencies. 
 The big story for the dollar was a renewed sense of American economic strength. On Friday, the Government reported that 140,000 jobs were created in March, following a gain of more than 500,000 jobs the month before, suggesting that the economy is more buoyant than many had believed.
That data caused a selloff in the Treasury bond market Friday and Monday, but improvement yesterday heartened currency investors who carefully follow bonds as an indication of interest-rate direction.
"Good news on the U.S. economy is in fact good news," said Randolph Donney, director of research at Pegasus Econometric Group.
In late New York trading, the dollar was worth 108.30 yen, up from 107.75 late Monday and its highest late New York rate since February 1994.
The dollar was also quoted at 1.4982 marks in late New York trading, up from 1.4817 on Monday. This was the dollar's best finish against the mark since February 1995, although it was quoted higher in intraday trading in mid-September.
Contributing to the dollar's gains against the mark were comments by the Bundesbank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, that suggested the German central bank was expecting interest rates in European markets to come down.
The dollar also rose against the British pound, which fell to $1.5205 from $1.5290.
The dollar had been making little headway for some time and analysts called the strong gains overdue. Indications of economic strength are seen as positive for a currency as surging profits and prosperous consumers tend to attract investment.
A second factor helping the dollar was a state of heightened tensions between North Korea and South Korea. In times of uncertainty, investors tend to buy dollars, which have been afforded a safe-haven status because of the currency's stability. The Korean troubles particularly helped the dollar against the yen.
"The Asian market is always much more sensitive to instability on their side of the world," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank Leumi Trust Company.

HEADLINE: About Real Estate;
In Virginia, Good Sign For Offices

BYLINE: By JAMES R. HARDCASTLE 

DATELINE: HERNDON, Va.

 BODY:
Two office projects are under construction in Fairfax County, Va., the leading suburban office market in the Washington area, providing the first evidence of a return to speculative office development in the county since the real estate recession of 1989.
At one project, along the Dulles Toll Road two miles east of Dulles International Airport, the steel is already in place for a four-story building of 103,000 square feet in which Airbus Industrie of North America has signed a lease for just under half the space. The rest is being built with no tenant commitments and is being marketed for occupancy this fall. The project is called Presidents Plaza II. 
 Speculative space is also part of another project, in Tysons Corner, the largest commercial center in Fairfax County. KPMG Peat Marwick will be the major tenant. The international accounting and consulting firm has entered into an agreement with Westmark Realty Advisers of Los Angeles, a development arm of the CB Commercial Real Estate Group, to build a 278,000-square-foot structure called the 1616 International Drive Building. KPMG Peat Marwick will occupy 178,000 square feet and the rest will be leased out. Occupancy will start in the spring of 1998.
Despite the speculative space, real estate brokers categorize both these buildings as ones essentially built to specifications by large tenants willing to commit to leases of 10 to 15 years for big portions of the buildings.
Construction is under way on at least three other large office buildings in the county. But all of those buildings were designed to be occupied by a single tenant who agreed to lease all the space within them.
Fairfax County wraps around the the southern boundary of Washington and three close-in northern Virginia regions. Last year, organizations moving to or expanding in the county accounted for 57 percent of the net office space absorbed in the Washington metropolitan area, or 2.45 million square feet out of 4.24 million square feet, according to the Washington office of Faison Associates, a commercial real estate service company based in Charlotte, N.C. Net absorption is the difference between the amount of space leased and the amount given up through move-outs or shrinkage.
Presidents Plaza II is being developed on a seven-acre site by Schroder Real Estate Associates of New York as an investment for a TRW Inc. pension fund. It will be the twin of an existing occupied building. Schroder bought the 100,000-square-foot Presidents Plaza I, with land for the twin building, from a General Electric Investment Corporation fund last year for $13 million. The corporation is an adviser to General Electric pension funds. Airbus Industrie, a consortium of European aircraft manufacturers, is moving from a nearby building in Herndon.
Brokers say the market for office space is drum tight. The office vacancy rate in northern Virginia has declined from a high of 22 percent at the end of 1990 to less than 6 percent, CB Commercial said in a spring regional market review. "As a result, office building owners are looking forward to 1996 with more enthusiasm than they have had in 15 years," the report said.
Stephen H. Spencer, a CB Commercial broker who negotiated the 15-year KPMG Peat Marwick deal, said that class A, or prime, space in the Tysons Corner area was currently leasing for $20 to $23 a square foot a year, with relatively minimal concessions for preparation of existing space, and to $20 to $22 a foot in Reston, the other major office center in the county.
"The landlords are in a situation where they control the space and demand is growing," Mr. Spencer said. As a result, he predicted, "We'll see rents in class A buildings in the high $20's in the next two years."
Helping demand is strong growth in the information, telecommunications and military-related industries that last year helped generate a net increase of 23,000 jobs in northern Virginia.

HEADLINE: Preventing Portable Nukes

BYLINE: By Jessica Stern; Jessica Stern, who is writing a book on terrorism, is a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.

DATELINE: ALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
What if the bomb that killed 168 people and blasted the Federal building in Oklahoma City a year ago this month had been nuclear?
It's not a far-fetched scenario. Nuclear materials -- once extremely difficult to find outside of controlled, government facilities -- are increasingly making their way to the international black market. 
 Theoretically, it is possible to make a well-designed nuclear bomb from a lump of plutonium the size of a soda can. A crude nuclear bomb -- which requires less expertise but more fissile material -- would be deliverable by van.
Even a crude one-kiloton atomic explosion -- tiny by nuclear standards -- would be hundreds of times more powerful than the Oklahoma blast. (In America, it might also permanently alter the balance between security and civil liberties: There would be much more support for widespread domestic F.B.I. and C.I.A. surveillance and for chips that monitor electronic conversations.)
Next week in Moscow, President Clinton and the heads of the other Group of Seven industrial nations will meet with President Boris Yeltsin at a nuclear summit meeting to discuss such worries.
The chaotic breakup of the Soviet Union has increased the risk of nuclear terrorism. Cash-strapped Russian Army troops are selling their weapons abroad, often through Russian mafia middlemen. Hardware from missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads has made its way from the former Soviet Union to Iraq. And in November, Chechen terrorists placed a container of radioactive material in a Moscow park. (Officials removed it after the perpetrators told reporters where it was.)
Despite these problems, the Russian Government has found 80 percent of its nuclear facilities to have no "portal monitors" -- exit doors with built-in radiation detectors -- to prevent insider theft.
Russian officials have repeatedly denied that any nuclear smuggling has involved weapons-grade material. But terrorists and would-be nuclear nations aren't that picky. They would probably be satisfied with lower-grade uranium or the kind of plutonium found in spent nuclear reactor fuel rods.
Seven confirmed cases of theft from the former Soviet Union involve such "weapons-usable" materials -- ingredients that could make a nuclear device capable of killing hundreds of thousands.
Since 1991 -- under legislation proposed by Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, and Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana -- Congress has appropriated a total of $1.5 billion to help former Soviet states protect and dismantle nuclear warheads and create safe storage for weapons-grade nuclear materials.
But the program applies only to Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan -- even though other former Soviet republics also possess nuclear materials and expertise.
And the $1.5 billion total -- an appropriation that barely squeaked through Congress -- isn't much. (Compare it to the $346 billion America spends annually on other forms of national defense.)
To protect ourselves, we should urge President Clinton and Congress to take the following action:
* Expand Nunn-Lugar to embrace all former Soviet states.
* Regularize meetings with the Group of Seven nations and Russia on nuclear smuggling.
 * Intensify intelligence efforts in all former Soviet countries, especially in Central Asia and the Caucasus, which are likely export routes for illicit nuclear components.
 * Expand training in the former Soviet Union in law enforcement, customs and forensics.
These steps carry a low cost. And anything less is irresponsible.
