HEADLINE: NUCLEAR SECRETS: POLITICS;
Legislators Ask Pause in Relations With China

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER with FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
Members of Congress from both parties pressed today for a pause in relations with China and a reversal of years of liberalized high-technology sales to Beijing, arguing that evidence of Chinese espionage undercuts the Clinton Administration's policy of engagement.
In a letter to President Clinton, four influential members of Congress asked him to "set aside negotiations" with China over its admission to the World Trade Organization, the main diplomatic and economic initiative under way between Beijing and Washington. The signers included two members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who rarely agree: the committee's Republican chairman, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, and Russell D. Feingold, the Wisconsin Democrat. 
 Meanwhile, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, introduced a package of measures as an amendment to a defense authorization bill that would give the F.B.I. greater authority over security checks at the national laboratories and require the Administration to notify Congress of any investigations into possible violations of export-control laws.
Nonetheless, the Clinton Administration, while embracing some of the recommendations in the declassified version of the Cox Commission's report, tried on two fronts to limit the political and diplomatic recriminations against the Chinese.
In Paris, the United States Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, held a brief meeting with China's Trade Minister, Long Yongtu, in the first effort to rekindle talks about getting China into the World Trade Organization this year.
"We did not really engage in the substance of the issues," Ms. Barshefsky said today in a telephone interview. She and others in the Administration argue that it would be foolish for the United States to walk away from market openings and other concessions China has made in years of negotiations that stopped just short of completion during Prime Minister Zhu Ronji's visit here last month.
But Ms. Barshefsky said that she was a realist, and "clearly the accidental bombing of the embassy and the Cox report have engendered a degree of friction that will take some time to dissipate."
Meanwhile, the State Department is trying to assemble a high-level delegation to visit Beijing in the next week or two, to offer apologies for NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy on May 7 and an explanation of how the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency misidentified the embassy and then hit it with a satellite-guided bomb.
The very idea of the mea culpa mission, to be led by Thomas R. Pickering, the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, has angered many conservative members of Congress. But it has been delayed, officials say, for another reason: The intelligence agencies, the Pentagon and the State Department are bogged down by internal disputes about how much detail to provide to the Chinese.
"If we go and give them the same stuff that's already been said in public, they won't be satisfied, and there is the risk of an even bigger breach," one senior official said today. Inside the C.I.A. and the military, he continued, "There is a reluctance to name names and affix punishments, as the Chinese have demanded."
In public the Clinton Administration is still talking about keeping the three issues -- China the spy, China the aggrieved, China the trading partner -- on separate tracks. But it became increasingly clear today that they all converge on Capitol Hill. The House and the Senate will have to vote in the next two months on a temporary extension of China's trading status, and if a trade organization accord is signed later this year it would have to vote to permanently extend that status to Beijing.
For both parties, calibrating the correct political response to the Cox Report this week has been a delicate matter. Republicans clearly want to stoke as much public outrage as possible, as a way of vilifying President Clinton and blemishing the Presidential aspirant Al Gore.
But, at the same time, many Republicans clearly do not want the fallout over this to be a chill in trade relations with China -- especially members from agricultural states that count on the Chinese as customers. So they are doing a careful two-step, condemning what happened in the strongest terms on the one hand but then cautioning that this should not in any way be held against China when it comes to trade.
Mr. Lott, for example, has excoriated the Clinton Administration in recent days for ignoring evidence of the breach of national security -- while in the next breath cautioning against overreacting in the area of trade. His package of reforms introduced today would only affect events within American borders, tightening security at nuclear labs, control exports of sensitive technology and put the F.B.I. in charge of performing security checks on employees at nuclear labs. A vote on the amendment was expected late tonight.
Mr. Lott's approach is attractive to many members because it gives them a chance to respond to the Cox Report without abandoning the engagement strategy -- which was the Bush Administration's strategy.
Meanwhile, Representative Christopher Cox, who led the select committee that issued the report on Chinese espionage, appeared before a House subcommittee today to answer more questions. Pressed about whether evidence of espionage supports the report's conclusions that China's information about nuclear weapons designs is now on a par with that of the United States, Mr. Cox said the Chinese did get design information "on a par with us."
Even with mounting concerns over the findings of Mr. Cox's committee, it still seems unlikely, several members of Congress and lobbyists for American companies said today, that the annual extension of what used to be called "most-favored nation" status -- it is now called "normal trade relations" -- will be derailed. A permanent extension, which would deprive members of Congress of the chance to vent their anger each year, is more doubtful.
But the letter to Mr. Clinton, also signed by Representative Benjamin Gilman, the New York Republican, and Representative Tom Lantos, the California Democrat, argued that "the Chinese Government's sanctioning of the attack on our embassy in Beijing, the torching of the consulate, and the attacks on American businesses demonstrate clearly that our engagement policy and the delinking of trade from other issues such as human rights have not fostered the deep, stable and meaningful relationship between the United States and China that had been promised." It said that "the most responsible and appropriate step is to set aside negotiations."
The White House quickly responded. "We respectfully disagree," said Gene Sperling, head of the National Economic Council. "A strong China-W.T.O. agreement is exclusively about opening China's market to our businesses and workers, and we think if there is a good agreement there will still be a bipartisan majority for it."

HEADLINE: U.N. Presses Wealthy Countries for More Aid to Third World

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 26

 BODY:
Reflecting concern that the war in Kosovo is diverting political energy and scarce resources from other conflicts, Secretary General Kofi Annan appealed today to world leaders to do more next month at the meeting of major industrialized nations to help the developing world.
In a letter to the heads of the Group of Seven industrialized countries and Russia, Mr. Annan pressed for increased development aid and greater debt relief for debt-ridden third-world countries and additional steps to shore up the international financial system, whose stability he said is key to preventing global recession. 
 Meanwhile, diplomats are quietly complaining that the international community, preoccupied with Kosovo, is paying too little attention to conflicts in Angola, Ethiopia and elsewhere. This morning, for instance, the Security Council expressed "deep concern" at the deteriorating situation in Angola, where up until a few months ago, the United Nations thought it had settled a long, bloody civil war only to see fighting erupt again this year.
After hearing a description of the conflict and an impassioned plea for emergency assistance from Francesco Strippoli, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Angola, the Council expressed "particular concern" about the relief groups' lack of access to hundreds of thousands of refugees. They have been displaced within Angola by the fighting between the Government and Unita, its rebel opponents who control many of the roads leading to the now besieged provincial cities to which thousands have fled.
In an interview, Mr. Strippoli said that $110 million in food and other assistance was desperately needed just to sustain the 1.6 million internally displaced Angolans.
There was little doubt, he said, that the crisis in Kosovo was preoccupying the international community. While refusing to "compare human misery" and acknowledging that the situation in the Balkans was also horrendous, he said that the conflict in the Balkans was making it even harder for diplomats and donors to focus on the plight of Angolans.
Another war that seems to be escalating is that between Ethiopia and Eritrea, now Africa's, and perhaps the world's, largest. "The Security Council is doing practically nothing," Fesseha A. Tessema, Ethiopia's Minister Counselor, said in an interview.
The Security Council took no action last Wednesday after hearing a briefing on United Nations efforts to end a conflict that has killed thousands and, according to Unicef, displaced more than 550,000 people.
A United Nations special envoy has been trying to mediate an end to the conflict, but the Council decided to wait for further action by the Organization of African Unity, which has brokered a peace agreement, before taking any formal action.
Mr. Tessema blamed what he called a lack of concern about a conflict in poor, remote Africa for the lack of response. "If this war were in Europe, or close to the United States, there would more Council intervention," he said.
Louise Frechette, the Deputy Secretary General, disagreed that the Council or the United Nations was focusing solely on Kosovo at the expense of other conflicts. The United Nations, she said in an interview, was "extremely active" in trying to alleviate human misery and find political solutions to numerous conflicts throughout the world.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR SECRETS: RELATIONS;
On Unofficial Level, at Least, Chinese Value Ties to the U.S.

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL and ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 26

 BODY:
One recent afternoon, as the Chinese press continued to rage against "American imperialism," a 36-year-old lawyer named Wang darted from the newly opened Starbucks back into the law conference he was attending -- in place of an American delegate who felt uneasy about traveling to Beijing.
Mr. Wang, who wears cartoon neckties and loafers, went to college in Portland, Ore. At his Chinese law firm he works closely with American clients, and he still keeps in touch with dozens of friends in the United States. 
 He shares the anger of his compatriots about the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and finds it hard to believe that it was purely a mistake.
But like many Chinese today, he also cannot imagine China getting by without the United States.
"There are so many different types of interactions now: economic, cultural and educational," he said. "I think much would be lost on both sides if those ties were sacrificed."
Because of the current anti-American atmosphere here, Mr. Wang, like many other Chinese approached on the streets in recent days, spoke on condition that his full name not be used.
Political relations between China and the United States have entered a tense new phase, battered by China's outrage over the attack on its embassy and by a Congressional committee's charges of extensive Chinese military espionage.
But even as geopolitics and the prospect of a strategic rivalry drive the two countries apart, millions of on-the-ground personal and business relationships form a thick social glue that binds them together. Since China began to open up some 20 years ago, those ties have multiplied with speed and gusto, long ago eclipsing the wary political relationship.
These diverse links tend to work against any severe estrangement, many political experts and others in both countries say, especially since American ties are strongest among China's most influential groups.
China's top three Communist Party leaders all have children who were educated in the United States, just one symbol of a relationship that is vastly more complicated than the cold war standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union.
"The glue is very deep," said Ezra Vogel, head of Harvard University's Asia Center and a former national security official. "Given the depth of contacts, openness and interdependence we have now, it's hard for me to imagine that it could become unstuck."
Nearly every better-off family in Beijing seems to have relatives studying or working in the United States, or working in American joint ventures in China. The personal links are strongest among the country's Communist elite, starting right at the top.
A son of Jiang Zemin, the President and head of the Communist Party, studied at Drexel University in Philadelphia from 1986 to 1991, earning a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. The son, Jiang Mianheng, is now a corporate executive in Shanghai and often makes business trips to the United States.
Li Xiaolin, the 38-year-old daughter of Li Peng -- No. 2 in the Communist Party hierarchy and believed to be a hard-line, anti-American voice in the leadership -- did graduate work in engineering at M.I.T. Now an executive with a Chinese Government power company, she visits the United States several times a year developing bond offerings for power projects.
Zhu Yunlai, the son of Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, spent a decade in the United States, where he did graduate studies in business and worked at Credit Suisse First Boston. Today he is a senior official of the first Chinese investment bank, a joint venture between a state-owned bank and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Close to 50,000 Chinese students are now attending American universities, mainly in graduate schools. Many of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese who studied in America stayed on to work there, but a growing share of those who have studied abroad are returning to work in China.
Alumni clubs from universities like Harvard and Stanford thrive in Beijing. And thousands of extended families here brag about the grandchild with an American passport, born while the parents were studying abroad.
In business, American companies' direct investment in China now surpasses $21 billion. A few companies, including Motorola and I.B.M., are believed to sell more than $1 billion worth of goods here each year. A new Kodak film developing counter opens in China nearly every day.
Equally striking, though, are the multitudes of smaller private exchanges and activities, which have mushroomed far beyond the ability of either government to track. Each year, more that 700,000 Americans travel to China.
A group run by Ned Graham, a son of the Rev. Billy Graham, is allowed to distribute Bibles to "underground" churches in the Chinese countryside. A Hong Kong millionaire has paid for Chinese Army colonels to attend the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, while Gloria's Place of Hope, a small New Jersey foundation, has a waiting list of almost 600 Chinese children who want to go the United States for heart surgery.
The weeks since the bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade on May 7 have been an awkward time for millions of people in both countries as they wait to see how their personal, professional and business ties will be affected.
Many have sought to insulate their most precious relationships with colleagues and friends from the hostile politics -- as well as from their own anger over a bombing that many Chinese think was probably intentional or at the least extremely reckless.
The Chinese Government has suspended official collaboration in areas like military cooperation and human rights. Some private contacts, too, have at least temporarily followed suit. A reception for a Chinese version of Cosmopolitan magazine was canceled. A party to kick off a new master of business administration program offered by Beijing University in conjunction with a consortium of United States colleges was postponed.
"Last week we were going to host a delegation of American insurance managers, but they canceled," said Yang Qi, a 27-year-old woman in a denim jacket emblazoned with a small American flag, who works for a Chinese insurance company. "There has been tremendous outrage about the bombing, and of course it has created some bad feelings. I myself have stopped eating at McDonald's. But the outrage is directed at the American Government and not at the American people, and I think it will pass."
Many employees at joint venture companies said normal after-hours socializing -- the dinners and the badminton games -- had ground to a halt. "Everyone sits and does their work and nothing is said openly, but there's an extremely awkward feeling in the air," said a man wearing black jeans and aviator sunglasses who would give only his surname, Hou.
But in other cases the eruption of hostile politics barely intruded on plans.
The week that the American Embassy in Beijing was pelted with stones, angry Chinese were waiting outside the closed consulate in Guangzhou -- for visas. That same week, as the official press attacked American "barbarism," Li Peng's daughter called American officials here with an urgent request to get documents notarized.
Ten days after the embassy bombing in Belgrade, a 176-member delegation from Jiangsu Province arrived in California looking for investment and trade opportunities.
The Chinese leaders hope, perhaps unrealistically, that the economic ties they have cultivated to aid China's modernization can be insulated from political conflict. American business executives, now with millions at stake, tend to share that wish.
Many educated Chinese are likewise trying to wall off international politics from their own self-interest and their personal lives.
Guo Haobin, an affable 22-year-old who works for an international trading company, said he was "very angry and agitated about the bombing, like all Chinese." But he said he continued to treat American clients well, and when asked if he had been to the United States, he answered, "I haven't, but as soon as I have the opportunity, I really want to go."
Indeed, when the visa section of the American Embassy reopened on Monday, many of its shattered windows still covered with boards, there were hundreds of applicants, mostly students wanting to get back to American universities or parents eager to visit children in the United States.
"People have very contradictory points of view right now," said Shi Tao, a book editor who did graduate studies in Ohio. "Personally, they want their sons and daughters to go to the U.S. to get educated and have a better life. Or they have prospered and for that reason want to keep beneficial contacts going. At the same time, they think we should fight against the American imperialists.
"They think they can separate their personal needs from the national point of view. But I worry that it will make some people feel more angry and confused."
Chinese with their feet in both worlds insist that the social and economic relations are too strong to destroy and hope that the politics will ultimately be dragged along.
"I don't think the political tensions will affect all the other ties," said Xu Xiaonian, chief of research at China International Capital Corporation, the investment bank that is a joint venture with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
"The relationship between these two countries has never been easy, and I don't expect it to be smooth in the future," said Mr. Xu, who received a Ph.D. from the University of California at Davis, then taught at Amherst College in Massachusetts for many years. "But I believe that it will move in a direction that will benefit both countries."
Late last year, after spending 12 years in the United States, Mr. Xu returned to Beijing to take his current job. "I could have stayed in Amherst and led the good life," Mr Xu said. "But the other part of my life belongs in China."
Mr. Xu's wife and daughter have remained behind in Amherst, where his wife works in the public library. "It was just too beautiful for them to leave," he said.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: BELGRADE;
Word of Indictment Stuns Serbs and Blights Hopes

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, May 26

 BODY:
Word that President Slobodan Milosevic may be indicted for war crimes on Thursday, the day a Russian envoy is due here to discuss a peace settlement for Kosovo, stunned Serbs tonight, dampening hopes for an end to the war.
As the Government cracked down on antiwar dissent, charging an elected official with treason, a former confidant of Mr. Milosevic suggested that the Yugoslav leader might intensify the conflict by carrying it to Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic. 
 Its leader, Milo Djukanovic, has given shelter to democrats from Serbia. He is opposed to the ethnic purges in Kosovo and poses the greatest domestic challenge to Mr. Milosevic.
If Mr. Milosevic is indicted on Thursday by the tribunal in The Hague, it will greatly complicate the efforts of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Russian special envoy who is expected here for talks.
"If the report is true, this will change everything," said a Serbian analyst. An indictment would confirm the suspicion of most Serbs that the tribunal, which operates under the United Nations, is prejudiced against them and is not an independent court. Serbs will conclude that NATO is not interested in peace, making Mr. Chernomyrdin's efforts all the more difficult.
Tonight, the Yugoslav delegate to the United Nations, Vladislav Jovanovic, attacked the pending indictment and its timing. "It is a politically motivated decision that renders the tribunal an accomplice to NATO as an aggressor," he told the BBC. "This is motivated to help turn the population against our President and Government."
Mr. Milosevic has always been suspicious of NATO's desire to introduce troops into Kosovo, fearing that the troops would arrest him for war crimes. He may now suspect that the indictment is a way to spurn any initiatives he makes toward a Kosovo settlement.
Mr. Milosevic is making clear that he will not tolerate antiwar dissent while the NATO bombing lasts, and may even intensify the conflict in the Balkans by mobilizing the general population to defend Kosovo and oust Mr. Djukanovic.
The elected Mayor of the southern town of Cacak, Velimir Ilic, a member of the opposition Democratic Party, is the latest to flee to Montenegro, according to residents of Cacak. Officially, Mr. Ilic is on vacation, but he is now thought to have joined the head of the Democratic Party, Zoran Djindjic, there. The army has issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Ilic for treason
Six prominent democrats in Cacak, including a journalist, have been fined a total of $2,800 for taking part in unsanctioned and thus illegal gatherings of a "civic parliament" that has called on Mr. Milosevic to negotiate a rapid settlement to the Kosovo conflict.
The army and police have also cracked down in Krusevac, where mothers have been demonstrating for their soldier sons to return from Kosovo. All roads into the town are being monitored, and there are police checks on anyone going in or out.
And in Belgrade today, the trial of two Australian aid workers for CARE and a Yugoslav colleague, imprisoned since March 31, on charges of espionage opened. The trial, after its ceremonial start, was closed on security grounds to all outsiders, including the Australian Ambassador to Belgrade and the mother of the Yugoslav on trial.
Thus far, there have been few severe punishments meted out to dissenters, even in Krusevac, where up to 3,000 people, many of them the mothers of conscripts, demonstrated for days and the soldiers themselves were allowed to return home, at least for a time.
In Cacak, a statement by the local branch of Mr. Milosevic's political party accused Mr. Ilic of giving interviews to Radio Free Europe, which was described as "under the direct patronage of the C.I.A."
"The present local authorities in Cacak have not shown even the minimum of patriotism, even after two months of war," the statement said.
The reported indictment of Mr. Milosevic complicates peace efforts. In the past the Clinton Administration refused to negotiate with people indicted for war crimes in Bosnia, including the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, while it did negotiate with Mr. Milosevic.
NATO is not negotiating with Mr. Milosevic now, doing it through Mr. Chernomyrdin and the Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, who is expected to accompany Mr. Chernomyrdin to Belgrade. Finland is not a member of NATO.
But even negotiations through intermediaries deal ultimately with Mr. Milosevic, who decides Belgrade's policy.
The trial of the aid workers before a military court took place despite protests from the United Nations and other international agencies. Those on trial are Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace of Australia and Branko Jelen, a Yugoslav.
On April 12, Yugoslavia displayed Mr. Pratt on television, apparently confessing to collecting information on Kosovo and the effects of the NATO bombing, but the confession, which Mr. Pratt's lawyer has said was made under duress, is not admissible.
Sergio Vieira de Mello, the United Nations Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief, said he had appealed to Belgrade to "balance any evidence that might exist" against "the interest we all have in fostering support, sympathy, involvement and engagement" of international organizations and donors.
Mr. Vieira de Mello, ending an 11-day tour of Yugoslavia, including three days in Kosovo, also told the Government that no arguments could justify the magnitude of the displacement of people in Kosovo. "The extent of the damage is deeply disturbing," he said. "People were forced to leave with various degrees of coercion, intimidation or force."
Mr. Vieira de Mello also spoke of the suffering of civilians. Unemployment has reached crisis proportions, he said, and health, water, transport and heating have suffered.
"It is a combination of anxiety, humiliation, the lack of understanding of what is happening, and immense stress of a distant and powerful enemy that can strike at any moment," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Shares End Their4-Day Slump as the Dow Advances 171.07 Points

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks rebounded from a four-day slump yesterday, as the banking and Internet shares that faltered earlier this week roared back.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 171.07 points, or 1.62 percent, to close at 10,702.16. 
 In a single, volatile session, the index of blue-chip stocks wiped out more than half its losses since Friday. Four straight losses had pushed the Dow 5 percent below its May 13 record of 11,107.19. After yesterday's rally, the Dow is 3.6 percent off the all-time high.
Broader indicators rose, recovering early losses. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 20.36, or 1.59 percent, to 1,304.76, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 46.28, or 1.94 percent, to 2,427.18.
Analysts said the market was ready for a bounce, as the nation's economy remained strong and the outlook for corporate profits remained rosy, at least for the next quarter.
"Conditions are quite good," said Tony Dwyer, chief equity strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann & Company. "I.B.M. is solid, and the financials are very strong."
I.B.M. contributed heavily to the Dow's gains, soaring 15 1/16 , to 236 1/4. The computer giant drew attention as a 2-for-1 split took effect after the market closed yesterday. Stock splits often prompt a rally, as investors expect the lower price to entice more buyers, but analysts were reluctant to pin I.B.M.'s gains solely on the split.
Instead, market watchers said, I.B.M.'s stock was unfairly battered in recent sessions, as the entire technology sector faltered.
Technology stocks were hit hard as concerns about potentially higher interest rates drew investors away from the high-priced shares. Through Tuesday, the Nasdaq index had tumbled 10 percent from its record of 2,652.05, set on April 26, meeting the conventional definition of a market correction.
Several industry leaders continued to languish yesterday. Intel, which unveiled a new chip design, fell 1 3/16 , to 51 11/16 .
But many Internet-related shares resumed their dizzying gains. Yahoo surged 13 15/16 , to 140 7/8, and America Online jumped 5 15/16 , to 120 1/4.
Banking and financial stocks, which have been hit by concerns over interest rates and the Year 2000 computer problem, surged as old merger rumors hit the market. Merrill Lynch, often mentioned as a takeover target, climbed 10 5/16 , to 78 11/16 . Chase Manhattan, the rumored suitor, rose 1 9/16 , to 75 3/8. Both companies denied the rumors.
A. Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said investors were merely revisiting the stocks that fed market gains earlier this year.
Yesterday's market took a measure of support from a Commerce Department report that factory orders for big-ticket manufactured goods fell an unexpectedly sharp 2.3 percent last month. The figure offered new evidence that the economy is not overheated.
Yet analysts were far from enthusiastic about the rally on Wall Street. Most Dow components were fairly flat. "It's not the healthiest of rallies," Mr. Acuff said.

Treasury Prices Fall
 (By Bloomberg News)
 Bond prices fell for the first time in four sessions because of lackluster demand at an auction of $15 billion of two-year notes.
Investors balked at the notes, among the most sensitive to Federal Reserve policy, because the central bank said last week that it was prepared to raise interest rates to slow growth and quell inflation.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 24/32 , to 92 8/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.80 percent from 5.74 percent. Yields on two-year notes rose to 5.33 percent from 5.26 percent.
Investors are concerned the central bank may soon raise rates after it warned last week that it was leaning in that direction. A report today is expected to show the economy grew at a 4.3 percent annual rate in the first quarter.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price . . . 99.878
High Yield . . . 5.315%
Low Yield . . . 5.234%

HEADLINE: Good News on Jobs, Or Just Good Times?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The longest post-World War II recovery with declining unemployment rates and skilled labor shortages is finally benefiting those at the bottom of the economic ladder. Black male unemployment is declining (front page, May 23), and real wages are finally increasing after almost three decades of stagnation. 
 What is the response of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to this good news? Concern over barely discernible inflation and hints that the Fed should raise interest rates.
Tight monetary policy has been a major contributor to employment and wage gaps among the races. A pre-emptive strike against the possibility of inflation would undermine recent gains by African-American men and lead to a growth in inequality.

HEADLINE: End of Commuter Tax May Cost Us All

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Gov. George E. Pataki, in his defense of eliminating New York City's commuter tax, writes that cutting taxes is good for the economy (Op-Ed, May 22). 
 But there is a difference between cutting taxes and eliminating them entirely, which, as conservative economists like to point out, is just as bad as overtaxation.
Let us not forget that the commuter tax was a central element in the state's regionalized tax structure, which allowed New Yorkers not residing or working in New York City to benefit from a lower tax rate.
Now that this part of our social compact has been broken, what will the State Legislature have to do when good economic times turn to bad? Simply impose a higher unified state income tax on all New Yorkers?

HEADLINE: U.S. LETS NEW YORK SHIFT MOST POOR TO MANAGED CARE

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 26

 BODY:
Federal officials said today that New York can begin moving more than one million poor people in New York City into managed care health plans as early as July in one of the most ambitious efforts of its kind in the nation, according to state and Federal officials.
The state and the city have been seeking approval from Washington for two years to begin the mandatory managed care program in New York City, where most people on Medicaid receive medical coverage under the traditional fee-for-service approach in which medical providers are paid every time a patient is treated. 
 Under a waiver approved today by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the state would be allowed to place as many as 1.1 million Medicaid recipients in New York City into managed care programs during the next two years, according to state and Federal officials. The Federal Government has approved similar waivers from the current Medicaid payment system in about a dozen other states.
People with chronic illnesses like AIDS or diabetes would be exempt from the mandatory program.
The administrations of both Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have repeatedly praised managed care as a way to save taxpayer dollars, largely because managed care companies are paid a set rate for each patient and, in turn, hold down costs by limiting access to specialists and emphasizing preventive care. They also say care would be improved for the poor because they would be assigned a regular doctor and would rely less on emergency room visits for basic care.
But the effort has faced resistance by advocates for the poor and Democratic lawmakers who are concerned that it would reduce services to welfare recipients. Hospitals have also expressed concerns that the program could shortchange them on the cost of services because health maintenance organizations will try to negotiate low rates.
The cost of Medicaid in New York State has grown to about $28 billion a year, the most expensive Medicaid program in the nation. The state and local governments, primarily New York City, pay roughly half of the program's cost, with the rest covered by the Federal Government.
The Federal Government two years ago gave the state the authority to begin placing Medicaid recipients into manage care programs, but has required it to do so gradually. Today's ruling affects only New York City. The state has already been requiring Medicaid recipients in a dozen upstate counties to enroll in managed care plans.
In New York City, where the bulk of the state's Medicaid population resides, poor people have, until now, been given the option of enrolling in managed care plans.
There are 650,000 Medicaid recipients in managed care plans throughout the state, with nearly 400,000 of them residing in New York City, according to state officials.
The mandatory program in New York City will be phased in beginning in July, starting with lower Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and all of Staten Island, affecting nearly 400,000 recipients. The program will be phased in in the rest of the city sometime later.
The decision by the Federal Government was warmly praised today by officials in both the Giuliani and the Pataki administrations, which have made managed care for Medicaid recipients one of the keys to their health care initiatives.
"This is a great victory for the Governor and for New York City," said Dennis P. Whalen, the Acting State Health Commissioner. "This waiver will give millions of medically needy New Yorkers the medical homes and the quality health care they need to live long healthy lives."
City and state officials said, however, that they needed to review some of the conditions that the Federal Government included in the approval. Federal officials said they would allow the state to move ahead with the managed care program in the city only after it established certain protections for recipients, like establishing an appeals process for decisions made by their managed care plans. Medicaid recipients will have a choice of managed care plans in which they can enroll.
The Federal Government is also requiring the state and the city to undertake an extensive public information campaign intended to alert people with AIDS or chronic illnesses that they are exempt from being placed into managed care because of the gravity of their illnesses.
Today's decision came after Federal investigators spent months reviewing whether the city had a sufficiently extensive network of health plans and doctors to absorb the hundreds of thousands of Medicaid recipients who will be sent into managed care. The extensive Federal review was in part prompted by concerns among advocates for the poor and the disabled, who worried that many managed care companies would try to cut corners and reduce services, particularly given the high cost of treating Medicaid patients, who on average are sicker than others.
Advocates for the poor and the disabled said today they were pleased that the Federal Government had placed conditions on the program. "The Federal Government isn't taking an 'anything goes' attitude," said Michael Kink, legislative counsel for Housing Works, a group serving people with AIDS. "They are being careful. And there are plenty of good reasons to be careful when the health care of more than a million poor and disabled New Yorkers is at stake."
The Government's decision comes as many of the city's economically beleaguered hospitals are raising concerns that the advent of managed care among the state's Medicaid population, particularly in New York City, will cause them greater financial distress and potential ruin.
Many hospital officials contend they are already facing huge financial headaches as they find themselves caught between increasingly powerful H.M.O.'s that demand reduced rates for their private customers, and state and Federal and state officials who are cutting billions of dollars in hospital payments.
The hospitals are concerned that health maintenance plans will also demand reduced rates for their Medicaid customers, particularly since the plans themselves have been complaining that the state is not adequately reimbursing them.
Some managed care companies have in recent years either scaled back their participation in the state's existing, voluntary Medicaid managed care program or dropped out because they were sustaining huge losses as a result of the state's relatively low reimbursements rates for Medicaid recipients.

HEADLINE: Bette Midler Was Here: A Park Gets a Second Act

BYLINE: By PETER HELLMAN 

 BODY:
What I'm smelling on a May afternoon, as I stand on an overlook in Highbridge Park at 179th Street, is not the noxious fumes from compacted traffic on the Alexander Hamilton and Washington Bridges looming overhead. It's a heady floral scent, as intriguing as it is unlikely. Just above on the slope is a grove of locust trees in full white blossom. Even on their best day, they would never smell as good as this. Walking beyond the locusts, I come upon a field where the secret is revealed. Here, where less than two years ago carcasses of stolen cars were heaped, are dozens of low-lying lilac bushes in pale purple flower. Bette Midler had struck again.
Actually, Ms. Midler's stealth campaign to resuscitate the 19th-century Highbridge Park began in November 1997, long before her much-publicized rescue of 51 community gardens this month. The lilac bushes were planted without fanfare by workers from her New York Restoration Project. Here at the midpoint of Highbridge Park, they symbolize the renewal of what had been, in Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern's estimation, the city's "most damaged, most cluttered" major park. And yet under all that debris the spectacular contours of the park remained. Now, in a dramatic turnaround, it's ready again for visitors. Regular tours are being sponsored by the New York City Parks Department and the Urban Park Rangers. 
 The park runs a full two and a half miles from 155th to Dyckman Streets along the steep Harlem River bluff, also called the Manhattan Palisades. Though little known, Highbridge is nearly as long as Central Park, but narrower and steeper.
It is the ruggedness of this terrain that saved it from development but also provided seclusion for the car strippers, drug users and prostitutes who overran the park from its crest in Washington Heights as it deteriorated in the wake of the city's mid-1970's financial crisis. Highbridge had become so degraded that in an all-hands cleanup in 1986, 250 tons of garbage and 25 auto wrecks were hauled out. Within days, new wrecks littered the slopes.
"It was such a shock to have a newly cleaned park dumped on," Mr. Stern said back then, when he was in his first stint as Parks Commissioner, under Mayor Edward I. Koch.
Only the most intrepid or foolhardy visitors dared to explore Highbridge when Ms. Midler first threaded her way up a decrepit, poison ivy-choked stairway from the Harlem River Drive into the park in 1996. She was guided by Joseph Pupello, director of the New York Restoration Project, which she founded. Instead of lilacs, the 179th Street overlook smelled of fetid mattresses and rank pools of motor oil. Fragments of the overlook's original elegant wrought iron railing were strewn about. But the drama of the spot could not be denied.
Not that the Restoration Project does anything alone; it is a complement to the Parks Department. "They can come in with heavy equipment and pull out car wrecks, which is beyond our abilities," explains Amy Gavaris, the project's landscape architect. "But after the parks people leave, we're there with our own staff and Americorps volunteers to do hand cleaning and planting. And we stay on."
Over the last year, the project spent just over $1 million in Highbridge Park, about a quarter of its total budget. One of the easiest places to see its handiwork is at the approach to the Washington Bridge at 181st Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Here a path leads into the park, passing under an car access ramp that local residents once called "the tunnel of death." Now the area has been restored, its formerly overgrown outcroppings of grey schist exposed. The ground is alive with eight species of new plantings, from Montauk daisies to catmint.
As this path wends down toward the Harlem River, you'll come across Ms. Midler's sea of plantings. Farther along, hugging a giant stone arch of the Washington Bridge, is a once-ruined hillside that was covered with daffodils in April.
Highbridge Park, designed in 1888 by Samuel Parsons Jr. and Calvert Vaux, begins in a thin spit called Coogan's Bluff that rises abruptly at West 155th Street and Edgecombe Avenue. In the swamps below, abutting the Harlem River, were the Polo Grounds, once home to the baseball and football Giants. Children who didn't have the price of admission could perch on the bluff and see part of the field.
In Jeff Kisseloff's 1989 book "You Must Remember This," Lewis Michels, father of City Councilman Stanley Michels, reminisces that when he was a boy, "if a ball was hit over the fence and you retrieved it, you could bring it to the gatekeeper, and in exchange for the ball, he would let you in."
The southern zone of the park, stretching roughly 20 blocks uptown to the grand old High Bridge itself, was long impassable. But two years ago, as the Restoration Project was beginning work in the middle of the park, the Parks Department began the arduous work of opening a trail along the route of the buried Croton Aqueduct, paralleling Edgecombe Avenue. On a recent Thursday, I hiked this recovered trail with Jane Schachat, chief of northern Manhattan parks, and the department's senior naturalist, Michael Feller.
Mr. Feller quickly spotted examples of healthy woodland: fine high oak, tulip, hickory, black birch, American sycamore and maple trees with "a nice sapling layer" beneath. Ground cover stalwarts included Solomon's seal and plume, woodland goldenrod, maple leaf viburnum, and even a species that he hadn't spotted in city parks: zigzag goldenrod.
Around 162d Street we came upon a thin-soiled, rocky meadow overlooking the Harlem River. "This is how Central Park probably looked before it was engineered," Mr. Feller said.
Heading on, we came to a deep forest valley, or clove, dropping away from the trail. Down its center a tiny brook burbled over rocks, all but hidden by a sea of delicate, damp-loving jewelweed. So complete was the overhead leaf canopy that the late morning light was filtered to softness amid echoing bird sounds.
Ms. Schachat pointed out that despite the steepness of the valley, thick ground cover and an apparent absence of any fires had prevented erosion. "A good hunk of forest," she said. Only yards away, traffic rushed along the Harlem River Drive.
Back on the trail we suddenly saw, poking above the trees, one of the city's most prominent landmarks: the 200-foot-high, campanile-style stone tower rising from the promontory at the western end of the equally magnificent High Bridge. Both tower and bridge were elements of the Croton aqueduct system, which first brought drinking water to New York City from Westchester County in 1848. The origins of Highbridge Park are here, where promenaders who had crossed the bridge stopped to rest and gaze at the Harlem River valley vista.
While the High Bridge walkway has long been closed off, the tower is occasionally opened to visitors. The full-circle view from the top of the tower is exhilarating, but be prepared for a long climb up the tower's intricately patterned cast-iron stairway. A small reservoir had been behind High Bridge tower. In the 1930's, Robert Moses made it into one of the city's largest municipal swimming pools, which is still operating.
Remarkably, three bridges -- the Washington, the Hamilton and the pedestrian High Bridge -- traverse the midpoint of Highbridge Park within seven blocks -- one of the densest bridge massings in the city. Rather than being a fatal incursion, however, the spans with their warren of access ramps lend to this stretch of park beneath them an extra dimension of drama.
For years, the very grand double stairway into Highbridge Park from the little-known Laurel Hill Terrace at West 184th Street descended into a thicket of weeds battling for dominance with garbage pitched over the park walls, which bear an unmistakable familial resemblance to Vaux's perimeter walls in Central Park. Now, in a joint effort by the Restoration Project and the Parks Department, the charming path below Laurel Hill Terrace has been restored.
Ms. Midler's hand is evident here in the elaborate plantings around the stairway: compact holly, climbing hydrangea, two kinds of roses, cinquefoil, spirea, raspberry bushes, daffodils and flowering apple trees. What can't be changed, however, is Yeshiva University's egregiously bulky science tower, whose loading platforms are positioned directly in front of the grand stairway.
A bit farther on, at 190th Street, where the Raoul Wallenberg Playground has been newly landscaped, a paved path descends into the northern end of the park. The steep slope is contoured here by rugged rock terraces, apparently a W.P.A. project from the 1930's. Specimen fruit trees abound, along with pheasants in full throat.
The northern end of Highbridge is at Dyckman Street, where Mr. Stern, who grew up nearby on Post Avenue, fondly remembers finding a spring, one of many in the park.
While Highbridge is ready for visitors, word is not yet out. On the day I explored the park with Mr. Feller and Ms. Schachat, from 8 A.M. until almost noon, we saw not one other person on the trails.
If you have built up an appetite during a Highbridge hike, a dining opportunity beckons at the south end of the park, below Coogan's Bluff on the Harlem River Drive at 158th Street: Guagua Amarilla, or Yellow Bus, a school bus transformed into a roadside restaurant specializing in down-home Dominican fare. Car service drivers flock to it. Inside, the bus is startlingly clean, given the constant cooking, and multiple skylights let the heat out. A full range of meat stews, roast chicken, seafood and vegetarian dishes are available. With excellent lemonade, two can eat for under $10. Just ask for what you want; there is no menu and no place to eat on the bus. But the shade of the park is just outside the door.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 7.
 
Now Playing
 
* "BESIEGED," starring Thandie Newton and David Thewlis. Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci (R, 92 minutes). Like all Bertolucci's films, the love story of an expatriate African woman (Ms. Newton) fleeing an oppressive military regime and the reclusive British pianist (Mr. Thewlis) for whom she works as a housekeeper in Rome is a visual jewel. Based on a short story by James Lasdun, "Besieged" is a film of few words and powerful images. (Especially of a military coup in an impoverished African country.) The love is sealed through an extraordinary act of self-sacrifice and a deepening appreciation of each other's tastes in music. If this elliptical movie leaves too much unsaid, it has strong understated performances by its two stars (Stephen Holden). 

* "COOKIE'S FORTUNE," starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close, Patricia Neal, Julianne Moore and Liv Tyler. Directed by Robert Altman (PG-13, 118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet assurance and guerrilla wit of Mr. Altman's vintage ensemble films make a copacetic return with a Southern small-town black comedy. Seamlessly made and completely enveloping, it tells of the machinations set off when a wealthy old woman (Ms. Neal) outrages her diabolically genteel niece (Ms. Close) by committing suicide. As the old woman's dearest friend and the niece's unwitting nemesis, Mr. Dutton is rock solid and appealing. The entire cast works on a single wavelength as Mr. Altman makes the most of a well-woven screenplay by Anne Rapp (Janet Maslin).
* "THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS," starring Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French with English subtitles). In this very special French film about two freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she views as imminent disaster. In the process, Mr. Zonca shows astonishing acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
* "EDGE OF 17," starring Chris Stafford and Tina Holmes. Directed by David Moreton (not rated, 100 minutes). It's 1984 in Sandusky, Ohio, and Eric (Chris Stafford), a skinny, fresh-faced high school student who worships the Eurythmics and Culture Club, has his first homosexual experiences. This is not boy-meets-boy (Romeo meets Romeo and they fall madly in love) but boy is used and confused and tries to go straight by sleeping with his former girlfriend. The teen-age coming-out story is realistic but warmhearted, the best among the recent gay coming-out films (Holden).
* "ELECTION," starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the acerbically funny director of "Citizen Ruth" comes this caustic satire of the American electoral process in a high school setting. Its leading candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms. Witherspoon, has a mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from Connie Chung and Elizabeth Dole. Mr. Broderick plays the hapless good-guy teacher who thinks this wicked little front-runner needs to be stopped. And the hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's reluctant opponent in a style best described as early Keanu. With a lovely ear for hypocritical conversation, the screenplay specializes in keeping all the characters a few beats off what they actually mean (Maslin).
"ENTRAPMENT," starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Jon Amiel (PG-13, 105 minutes). This glossy caper summons the days when being a thief was the profession of choice among debonair movie heroes. And heroines: as the great-looking insurance investigator who is supposedly investigating Mr. Connery's glamorous super-burglar, Ms. Zeta-Jones makes a smashing gymnast and heist expert in her own right. No need to believe the outlandish details of the story; there's enough verve and charisma to the stars to make the escapade easy on the eyes. The action sequence, in which the stars hang off the side of the world's largest skyscraper, is a vertiginous show stopper. And here's a nice bonus: nobody gets killed (Maslin).
"THE LOVE LETTER," starring Kate Capshaw, Blythe Danner, Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Everett Scott and Tom Selleck. Directed by Peter No-sun Chan (R, 88 minutes). Cathleen Schine's whimsical romantic novel about a summer affair between a divorced bookstore owner (Ms. Capshaw) and a college student half her age (Mr. Scott) bleaches out pungent ruminations on May-September love in favor of a bland cuteness. The teeny-weeny story revolves around an unaddressed, unsigned love letter that floats into people's lives and recharges their romantic fantasies. The dialogue is flat, the level of the acting grade-B sitcom (Holden).
"THE MATRIX," starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120 minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will be all but incomprehensible to anyone but techno freaks. And the film borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a big debt to "The X-Files" in the paranoia department. But the storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special effects are indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a gravity-defying gusto. And Mr. Reeves shows that you can look like a Prada model while behaving like an action hero. One of the main stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the Wachowskis provide a couch-potato epiphany: while the characters seem to be performing marvelous feats, they're often lying stock-still in the grip of virtual reality (Maslin).
"A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM," starring Rupert Everett, Calista Flockhart, Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer and Stanley Tucci. Directed by Michael Hoffman (PG-13, 115 minutes). This is potluck Shakespeare, with a wildly uneven range of performances and no clear style holding them together. Rather than wonder why the actors are wrestling with bicycles in 19th-century Tuscany (a setting used much less enchantingly than it might have been), it's best to focus on the most comfortably Shakespearean performances and not wonder what Ms. Flockhart is doing here. Mr. Kline makes a perfect Bottom, Mr. Everett slinks seductively through Oberon's role and Ms. Pfeiffer makes an appropriately gorgeous fairy queen. The younger cast members are largely used as window dressing for the Leo-Does-Romeo set (Maslin).
"THE MUMMY," starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah. Directed by Stephen Sommers (PG-13, 134 minutes). More like a video game than a movie, this incoherent spoof (very loosely based on the 1932 Boris Karloff horror classic), overloaded with cheesy special effects, suggests an unwieldy hybrid of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy" via "Night of the Living Dead." The intrepid adventurers who disturb an ancient Egyptian crypt that carries a fearful curse are Mr. Fraser (playing a swashbuckling American in the Foreign Legion), Ms. Weisz (as a plucky, wide-eyed English librarian) and John Hannah (as her twitty older brother). It's all played for laughs. The only scary moments involve swarming scarabs who burrow under the skin and do awful "Alien"-like things (Holden).
* "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE" (the Oscar winner for best film, best original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best comedy score). Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the best-actress winner) and Judi Dench (best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of "Romeo and Juliet," glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
* "STAR WARS: EPISODE I -- THE PHANTOM MENACE," starring Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and breathless expectations, Mr. Lucas's first installment offers a happy surprise: it's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of "Jurassic Park." While the human stars here are indeed reduced to playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in Mr. Lucas is given free rein. The "Star Wars" franchise was funnier and scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this (Maslin).
"TEA WITH MUSSOLINI," starring Cher, Dame Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Dame Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli (PG, 117 minutes). The screen divas (especially Dame Maggie) who give "Tea With Mussolini" a patina of class obviously relish chewing the scenery in this sudsy historical drama (adapted from a chapter of Mr. Zeffirelli's autobiography) about a circle of English expatriate women living in Florence on the eve of World War II. Dame Maggie, a quintessential British snob, is the leader of the pack, nicknamed the Scorpioni, whose comfortable lives are shattered when the Fascists rise to power and they find themselves carted off to another city where they are held under house arrest. Cher is her usual likable self as a free-spending, free-loving wealthy American heiress and art collector who befriends the group (Holden).
"THIS IS MY FATHER," starring Aidan Quinn, Moya Farrelly and James Caan. Directed by Paul Quinn (R, 120 minutes). Made with obvious sincerity, this story of a glum Chicago schoolteacher (Mr. Caan) in search of his more interesting Irish forebears (Mr. Quinn) involves a third Quinn brother as well. And Declan Quinn's cinematography adds warmth to an atmospheric, sentimental tale featuring stellar Irish actors (Stephen Rea, Brendan Gleeson, Colm Meaney) in cameo roles. Aidan Quinn's sturdy performance, as a lonely farmer in love with a fiery young lass from a prosperous family, does a lot to help the film override its hackneyed elements and keep it moving (Maslin).
* "THE WINSLOW BOY," starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon and Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G, 110 minutes). Terence Rattigan's play about the 1910 schoolboy's trial that created a furor in England has been artfully pared down to its essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation. Played with unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous cast, it works as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family of a cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the consequences of that accusation. Benoit Delhomme's cinematography is beautifully lucid and painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch acting style sets the film's tone and gives her suffragist character a sharp edge (Maslin).
 
Film Series
 
"COMING TIMES: NEW IRISH CINEMA." Six films by Neil Jordan serve as the centerpiece of this series opening today at the Walter Reade Theater. The series carries forward the Film Society of Lincoln Center's comprehensive survey of Irish cinema, which began five years ago with a series that spanned the years from 1916 to 1994. The Jordan films include "The Crying Game" (1992), "Michael Collins" (1996), "Angel" a k a "Danny Boy" (1982), "The Miracle" (1991), "The Company of Wolves" (1984) and "The Butcher Boy" (1998). The series consists of more than 20 feature films as well as shorts, and brims with outstanding Irish actors like Stephen Rea, Liam Neeson, Aidan Quinn, Brendan Gleason, Gabriel Byrne, Donal Donnelly, Richard Harris, Brenda Fricker and John Lynch. Opening day's attractions include two United States premieres, Mark Staunton's romantic comedy, "Separation Anxiety" (1997) at 2 P.M., and Colm Villa's post-millennial combination of parable and horror movie, "Sunset Heights" (1998) at 6:15 P.M. The series continues through June 10 at the Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street. Admission, $8.50; $5 for Film Society members; $4.50 for the elderly at weekday matinees. Information: (212) 875-5600 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

HEADLINE: OPERA REVIEW;
Two Familiar Tales in Unfamiliar Settings

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
Since 1982 the Center for Contemporary Opera, founded by the conductor Richard Marshall, has presented productions of 37 new or recent operas. No company large or small has a better record of service to the cause. On Tuesday night in Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College, Mr. Marshall and his forces presented two more, each in one act, each by an American: the world premiere of Jack Beeson's "Sorry, Wrong Number" and Elie Siegmeister's "Angel Levine," which received its premiere at the 92d Street Y in 1985 and has languished since.
Mr. Beeson prepared the libretto for "Sorry, Wrong Number" himself, basing it on the original radio play by Lucille Fletcher, not the 1948 film adaptation that starred Barbara Stanwyck. For this thriller to work, the audience must accept an improbable and hideous coincidence. An Upper East Side woman, confined to a wheelchair, tries frantically to call her wealthy husband, who told her he was working late at the office. Telephone lines accidentally cross, and she overhears two criminals plotting a contract murder for that night. Shaken, she tries to alert an operator, then the police. She herself, it winds up, is the intended victim, and her husband is party to the plot. 
 Mr. Beeson's most notable opera, "Lizzie Borden," was a popular success at the New York City Opera this season. And at 77 he is still at it. The dramatic pacing of this new 40-minute work is economical and sure; the orchestra of 17 players provides color and imaginative evocations of dial tones and busy signals.
That said, Mr. Beeson may be overly deferential to his conversational text. The music, grounded in tonality but spiked with dissonance, paces the story and highlights interchanges, but it only skirts the surface of the drama. Aspiring opera composers could learn much by studying the natural way he sets text, though in this he was helped by the strong cast, especially the soprano Patricia Dell, who was compelling and pitiable as the unwitting victim.
Bernard Malamud's story "The Angel Levine" was the basis for a 1970 film starring Zero Mostel as Nathan Manischevitz, a poor, elderly tailor in New York of the 1950's, coping with the fatal illness of his wife, and Harry Belafonte as the unlikely answer to his prayers: a black Jewish Harlem hipster who claims to be an angel. Siegmeister, who died in 1991, often composed in a rigorous, thickly chromatic language touched by 12-tone elements. Yet he was also versed in musical theater and loved indigenous American musical styles. These dimensions of his music come together, sometimes oddly, in "Angel Levine." The stern, atonal music gives some of the exchanges, like that between Nathan and his wife, a gritty intensity, though it was sometimes hard for the singers to project over the brassy, busy chamber orchestra.
When Nathan wanders into a Harlem nightclub searching for the angel, Siegmeister takes us there with jazzy music for sultry blues singer, though the lyrics are embarrassing. ("I'm gonna fry my man some chitlins.") The stage director, Charles Maryan, did not try to soften the stereotypes. Three black Jews intoning Hebrew prayers in a Harlem temple break into a soul-daddy dance, complete with palms outstretched to heaven, and one character with Coke-bottle-thick glasses blows like Gabriel on an imaginary trumpet.
Yet "Angel Levine" essentially works. The story is wistful and oddly affecting, and Siegmeister's eclectic score is always interesting. The performers were winning, too, especially Richard Frisch as Nathan and Sam McKelton as Angel.
Mr. Marshall conducted both works ably.

HEADLINE: The Military's Myopia

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "America's Promise, Found in the Army" (news article, May 23):
It only seems right that many of our new immigrants are taking advantage of the economic opportunities that the United States armed forces offer in exchange for a recruit's commitment to defend our country. 
 A young man or woman facing a life of limited earning power can turn his or her life around with the college tuition and vocational training provided by the military.
What a shame it is, then, that the armed forces and Congress have joined ranks to deny this economic opportunity to gay American citizens, while aggressively seeking to recruit immigrants, many of whom are not yet citizens. At a time of dangerously low enlistment rates, the military's anti-gay policy is inexcusable as well as morally bankrupt.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Rental Complex Is Bronxville's First in 30 Years

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
The first new rental complex in Bronxville, N.Y., in 30 years opened this week, with rents ranging from $2,100 to $8,000 a month. The 110-apartment complex has been built on a 1.7-acre site that had eluded development for nearly a decade, replacing a gas station and a small commercial building.
The $25 million project, called the Avalon, is being developed by Collins Enterprises, L.L.C., of Old Greenwich, Conn., and Avalon Bay Communities, a real estate investment trust based in Alexandria, Va. Its apartments have one to three bedrooms and range from 740 to 2,066 square feet. The apartments are in two buildings -- one has three stories and the other has five -- flanking an interior landscaped courtyard on the site at Parkway Road and Milburn Street across the street from a Metro-North train station. There is also underground parking for 166 cars. 
 Monthly rents for the smaller apartments, which predominate, are $2,100 to $4,200, while the 10 three-bedroom units rent for $6,000 to $8,000. The project is designed to appeal to prosperous empty-nesters and professional couples in the area who want to sell their homes and rent either for the maintenance-free life style or until they buy another home.
The developers said they also hoped to attract local renters looking to trade up, corporate nomads who know they will be moving in a few years and renters from Manhattan, including Wall Street executives, seeking a convenient, if not necessarily less-expensive, alternative.
In the two weeks since leasing began, tenants have signed leases for 21 of the apartments, the developers said. Initial occupancy begins next month.
Collins Enterprises got involved with the project in 1995, just over a decade after local developers had spent most of the 1980's obtaining preliminary approvals from the village for a condominium building. But by the time the approvals were granted in 1991, the real estate market had fallen into a deep recession, halting that project and forcing the developers to file for bankruptcy.
From 1995 to 1997, Collins, as part of a bankruptcy reorganization plan, took over the development site, obtained local approvals for its rental complex and joined with Avalon Bay to develop it. Construction started early last year.
"The market moved in our direction in the last three years and this is an exclusive site that can't be duplicated and is well suited for rental housing," said Arthur Collins 2d, president of Collins Enterprises.
Susan R. Bresler, development director at the Manhattan office of Avalon Bay, said that the project was "an opportunity to enter a high-quality area where there is a high shortage of rentals."
Avalon Bay, which builds only rentals, provided the financing for and will manage the Bronxville project, its seventh, together totaling 2,000 units, in the immediate New York, New Jersey and Connecticut area. Six other projects, including 2,500 more apartments, are under way or planned in the area.
Village officials wanted to see development on the site, which William T. Regan, Bronxville's administrator, said had become an eyesore. But he said there were community concerns over traffic and parking and overburdening municipal resources, especially schools.
To address those issues, the developers designed the Avalon to have 55 one-bedroom units and included a provision in the leases that sets a limit of two people per bedroom in each apartment. The project's garage is also large enough to accommodate tenants' parking needs.
Mr. Regan said the developers, as part of securing their approvals, were also required to make more than $100,000 worth of improvements to a nearby traffic circle to enhance pedestrian safety, as well as upgrade sidewalks and install new lighting in front of their project. That work, he added, is part of a larger improvement program by the village to make similar upgrades to Parkway Road and Palmer Avenue, a mixed commercial and residential area on the west side of the railroad tracks.
The rental buildings are faced with brick and stucco and have been designed in a Tudor style to blend with the character of the village. And though the complex is close to the train station, the use of two-inch-thick insulation behind the brick facade and double-pane windows "work as the best buffer against noise," Ms. Bresler said.
The project's design and convenience appealed to Sarah J. McCann, who with her husband, Wayne G. Bartlett, will move from a two-bedroom rental on Manhattan's Upper West Side to a one-bedroom unit with a den at the Avalon. The couple, both Australians, relocated to Manhattan one and a half years ago because of their jobs but may return to their native country by the end of next year.
"We looked at Bronxville when we first moved to Manhattan, but the apartments available then didn't appeal to us," Ms. McCann said. "At the Avalon, we're getting a new kitchen and bath."
Ms. McCann said that their new apartment was similar in size to their current one and that their rent would be slightly less than what they paid in Manhattan. "But," she added, "we are gaining because we have suburban living and access to the city as well as to upstate New York and Connecticut." She said the move would not add much time to her commute to her job in midtown Manhattan or to her husband's.
Ms. Bresler said rents at the Avalon were comparable to some of the condominium and cooperative apartments in prewar buildings in the village that are rented. And, she added, they are 25 percent lower than those in Manhattan, where apartments are smaller.

HEADLINE: Suspected North Korean Atom Site Is Empty, U.S. Finds

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
American investigators in North Korea have discovered that an underground site that Washington suspects could be used to revive that nation's nuclear weapons program is a huge, empty tunnel, the Clinton Administration said today.
The preliminary report by an inspection team should ease recent tensions between the United States and North Korea that had threatened the collapse of a five-year-old agreement meant to freeze North Korea's nuclear program. 
 The American inspections beganlast week under an agreement that required modest commitments by the United States to continue food aid to North Korea and to begin a pilot project to help it grow potatoes.
Administration officials cautioned that while the tunnel is now empty, it could still be used someday to hide the equipment needed to build nuclear weapons. And they also noted that material inside the tunnel could have been moved out in recent weeks in anticipation of the American inspection, although the movement of any major piece of equipment would probably have been detected by American spy satellites.
An Administration official said initial reports from the inspection team suggested that, apart from digging a huge hole in the ground, the North Koreans had made no obvious preparations for construction of a nuclear reactor in the tunnel.
In a statement today outlining the work of the investigators, James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said the American team began the inspection last Thursday and ended its work on Monday, earlier then expected. He said the team credited North Korea's "cooperation for its unhampered access and the rapid completion of the work plan."
"The team found an unfinished site, the underground portion of which was an extensive, empty tunnel complex," he said. "A careful technical analysis of the team's work will now take place before further judgments can be made and reported."
Under an agreement reached with North Korea in March, the United States will be allowed repeated and regular visits to the remote mountainous site at Kumchangri, about 25 miles northwest of Yongbyon, a nuclear research center that has been under inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency for five years. The next American inspection is scheduled for May of next year.
A separate White House delegation led by former Defense Secretary William J. Perry continued its visit to North Korea today, with no clear indication that he would be permitted to meet the nation's shadowy leader, Kim Jong Il, to offer an American proposal to lift economic sanctions in exchange for North Korea's agreement to scrap its long-range missile program.
On Wednesday, Mr. Perry, the first Presidential envoy ever sent to North Korea, presented Government officials there with a letter from President Clinton for President Kim outlining the American proposal. Reports from the official North Korea news agency said Mr. Perry toured Pyongyang today and visited a collective farm, where he watched farmers transplant rice seedlings.
North Korea has repeatedly denied that the underground site at Kumchangri is intended for nuclear research or production, although the Government has acknowledged that it was designed for "a sensitive military purpose."
Some type of construction at the site had been easily detected by American satellites. Thousands of North Korean military workers had swarmed over the site every day, excavating a huge area under a mountain. The shape of the excavation led experts to conclude that the North's intention was to recreate the installations at Yongbyon, which are under intensive inspection by the Atomic Energy Agency.
The underground site had alarmed the Administration and had threatened to undermine the 1994 agreement that was supposed to end North Korea's efforts to build a nuclear arsenal.
Under the so-called Agreed Framework, the North Koreans were promised billions of dollars in energy assistance, including two new nuclear reactors, in return for a promise by North Korea to shut down its nuclear weapons program.
The Administration's threat to break the agreement unless an American team was allowed to inspect the underground site led to warnings from the North Koreans last year that the situation was moving "to the brink of war."
The White House hopes that the accord allowing inspections of the site will quiet a rising movement in Congress to cut off fuel-oil shipments to the North, a key provision of the 1994 pact. The Pentagon feared that a fuel cutoff would lead North Korea to resume production of plutonium.
The North Koreans had initially demanded a payment of $300 million from the United States for the right to a one-time inspection of the tunnel. But they dropped the demand after the United States offered new promises of food aid, which the State Department insists is for relief purposes unrelated to the nuclear agreement.

HEADLINE: Commerce Department Sees Corporate ProfitRecovery

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
After more than a year of weak growth, corporate profits rebounded in the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The giant tobacco industry settlement distorted the figures, temporarily fattening the first-quarter number. But the rebound also suggested that the squeeze on profits evident last year may have lifted a bit.
The profit report, the first for the January-through-March period, appeared in the Commerce Department's latest estimate of first-quarter economic growth. The gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 4.1 percent, the report said, down somewhat from the 4.5 percent rate reported last month and well below the 6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1998. 
 Consumer spending and investment rose strongly, or as Robert Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig Group, put it, "The front end of the economy remains strong."
But there were drags. Exports were lower than the Commerce Department originally estimated for the quarter. That was also the case for Federal spending and for inventory accumulation, which is the stockpiling of newly manufactured merchandise in anticipation of sales.
"The economy is not weakening, but there is a kind of bending off in the growth rate," said Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic Advisers Inc. The G.D.P. grew by 3.9 percent for the year that ended with the first quarter, down from 4.3 percent for the year that ended with the fourth quarter.
The corporate-profits number produced by the Commerce Department is hard to interpret. Yet many economists consider it perhaps the most realistic measure of how much American companies actually make.
Each quarter, the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis calculates profits before taxes, and adjusted so that the value of inventories and capital reflect their actual replacement costs. Profits figured in this way rose by 3.9 percent in the first quarter, to an annual rate of $853.5 billion. That was the biggest quarterly jump in more than a year, and it followed a string of quarters in which profits either declined or grew by less than 1 percent.
The tobacco settlement, in which the companies reimbursed states that had sued them for health costs, turned out to be the biggest single factor in the first-quarter jump. The companies had paid out $13.5 billion at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, but only $900 million in the first quarter. The swing cut into fourth-quarter profits and produced a jump in the first-quarter number.
For the nation's nonfinancial companies -- that is, companies other than banks, brokerage firms, investment houses and the like -- the swing represented more than 60 percent of the profit growth. But other factors were also in evidence.
Wages rose, but so did productivity, or the amount that a worker produces each hour on the job. And that extra output for the same labor cost helped to improve profits, economists said. Nonlabor costs, including raw materials, also eased off.
"Putting the tobacco stuff aside," Mr. Varvares said, "profits still seem to be in some sort of a rebound."
As part of the G.D.P. report, the Commerce Department also produces an inflation indicator that is broader than the Consumer Price Index. Commerce's "implicit price deflator" rose 1.4 percent in the first quarter, the same estimate published last month.
In another report yesterday, the Labor Department said that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment benefits was 300,000 last week, unchanged from the week before. The number has held to 300,000 or less for 12 of the last 21 weeks, a sign that the demand for workers remains robust.

HEADLINE: Capitol Hill Memo;
Democrats Leave Stamp On the G.O.P. Congress

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
On the Capitol lawn today, gleefully defiant Democrats announced a petition drive to force the House to consider a bill to regulate health maintenance organizations. In another corner of Capitol Hill, Vice President Al Gore demanded that House Republicans enact even more restrictions on guns than the Senate reluctantly did.
And at midday, the House left early for the Memorial Day recess when Republicans could not gather the votes needed to start debate on a $289 billion military bill they had planned as a showcase of their support for strong national defense. 
 It was all a grand partisan paroxysm on the eve of a Memorial Day vacation. But the confluence of events did illustrate the developing dynamic of a Republican-controlled Congress largely shaped by a Democratic agenda.
On issue after issue, Republicans are taking a defensive stance. They are trying to slow down Democratic initiatives, defuse other popular issues long associated with the Democrats, or draft their own, milder versions of Democratic bills.
"It doesn't appear to me as though they have anything to put on the agenda themselves," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan.
The result -- intentional or not -- is that this Congress so far is looking more moderate than the Republican Congresses that came before it. Republicans are taking some surprising stands, if only because they are constantly being caught in an inactive or reactive posture.
So if gun control once was anathema to the Republicans, today the party's senior leadership has endorsed some limited measures.
If Republicans once fought hard against increases in the minimum wage, today some House Republicans are working to draft their own minimum wage plan, coupled with a business tax cut package. Their goal is to keep the Democrats from gaining a popular campaign issue with their call for a $1 increase in the minimum wage over two years.
And where the Republicans once wanted to abolish the Department of Education, now they are rallying around some education spending measures to call their own.
"Even the most adamant conservative Republican understands -- just like the most liberal Democrat -- that the country likes moderate evolutionary changes," said Representative Brian P. Bilbray, a California Republican.
There are many reasons for this shift, ranging from the public mood to the Republicans' small majority in the House and to the tactical skill of the Democratic minority. In part the times have left the Republicans without their traditional issues: the economy and the battle against Communism, welfare and crime.
But the extraordinary economy has dimmed the public's enthusiasm for tax cuts. President Clinton took steps that cured his party's vulnerability on welfare and crime. And until the air war against Yugoslavia, the end of the cold war had diminished public attention to foreign policy.
By contrast, the issues that have risen to the top of the public agenda, like education, Social Security, Medicare and health care, are ones that are historically more associated with the Democrats.
"The problem for the Republicans is that nearly all the issues that hit home with the voters are issues the Democrats have cultivated and built real credibility on," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. "The one possible exception is the reemergence of foreign policy as an issue."
So the Republicans have worked hard to try to neutralize these issues. On Social Security, for example, they have backed away from Republican legislation to remake the Social Security program into a system of private investment accounts. Instead, they are intent on trying to look more committed than the Democrats to protecting Social Security tax receipts from being used for other programs or tax cuts.
Another problem for the Republicans is that even if they wanted to go on the offensive, their House majority is so small that it is unlikely they can do so. The difficulty of doing anything in the House when a five-vote shift can doom any legislation was on display this week when Republicans lost control of the floor and could not pass either an agriculture bill or a military measure.
Finally, the Democrats have become skilled at pressing tactical advantages. They outmaneuvered the Senate Republicans on gun control, leaving some Republicans complaining that their leaders need to do more than stall.
"We do need to get out on front of a number of these issues," said Representative Marge Roukema of New Jersey. "We know they are going to come down the line, and we might as well do it in an orderly manner instead of looking as though we're only reacting to negative Democratic tactics."
It is still far from clear whether Republican moderation means that anything more will get done this year than in more ideological years.
For one thing, even small differences on an issue can be difficult to surmount. Take the minimum wage. If Republicans come up with a package that provides only small increases and couples them with large tax breaks, the Democrats could very well vote against such a bill. On the other hand, conservative Republicans would probably remain opposed to any increase.
The Democrats relish pointing to Congressional inactivity. And particularly in the House, there is a tension between those Democrats who want to pass legislation and those who think they would be better off running against a "do-nothing Congress" next year.
So today, even as they demanded action on legislation to regulate health maintenance organizations, Democrats could not resist ribbing the Republicans for their inactivity. Joked Representative Robert E. Andrews of New Jersey, "It's hard to tell whether we are in recess or not."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Plummets 235.23 as Investors React to Rising Interest Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stock prices resumed their losing ways yesterday as rising long-term interest rates prompted many investors to cash in profits on the approach of a long holiday weekend.
It was the fifth decline in the last six sessions and except for the Nasdaq market, where losses were relatively modest, the drop more than wiped out the lone recent advance on Wednesday.
The Dow Jones industrial average, the hardest-hit gauge, tumbled 235.23 points, or 2.2 percent, to 10,466.93, its biggest skid of the year in terms of points and the third time this week that its loss surpassed 100 points. Over the latest six sessions, the blue-chip index has lost 420 points, or 3.9 percent. 
 "Stocks seem to be the tail tied to the interest-rate kite," said Timothy E. O'Grady, senior portfolio manager at the First Capital Group in Philadelphia. Yields jumped by nearly one-tenth of a percentage point on two-year notes.
Two Government reports, as well as desultory bidding at the Treasury's note auction on Wednesday, may have contributed to the further unease over rates and caused investors to focus again on the Federal Reserve's stated inclination to increase rates if the economy shows no signs of slowing.
One report disclosed revised figures on first-quarter economic output showing that personal consumption grew at a 6.8 percent annual pace, even faster than first estimated. The other, suggesting a continued taut labor market, recorded no rise last week in first-time claims for jobless benefits.
"Rising long-term bond yields create valuation issues," said Richard B. Hoey, director of equity research at the Dreyfus Corporation, referring to the appeal of stocks relative to fixed-income securities.
The Dow's drop was not much greater than that of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which fell 23.35 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,281.41. The latter, however, had 85 rising components, paced by Intel, while only Johnson & Johnson among the Dow's 30 stocks managed an advance.
The Nasdaq composite index, which is laden with high-technology stocks, fell 8.03 points, or three-tenths of a percent, to 2,419.15.
Analysts were at a loss to explain why most of the technology sector resisted the decline other than it has already been badly battered, especially Internet issues. The index is down 8.8 percent from its record on April 26 and was down 10.2 percent on Tuesday, enough to technically qualify as a correction.
"People have raised a lot of cash," said Matthew W. Johnson, head of Nasdaq trading at Lehman Brothers. But he said whether they were putting this money aside to buy new issues "or taking money off the table, is not clear."
Volume was moderate again yesterday, with 830 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange and 834 million on Nasdaq.
Despite the fact that the market was concerned with economic growth, cyclical stocks were the main casualties among the Dow components.
Exxon lost 3 1/8, to 78 13/16 ; Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing fell 2 13/16 , to 86; United Technologies was down 2 9/16 , to 62 3/16 ; Allied Signal fell 2 9/16 , to 56 3/4, and Caterpillar slumped 2 7/16 , to 55 3/8.
The other top losers were financial stocks -- J. P. Morgan lost 3 3/4, to 135 1/8, and American Express fell 2 11/16 , to 116 7/8.
Morgan Stanley's cyclical index slumped 2.5 percent, its biggest loss of the year.
"The market is again concerned about the Fed tightening," said John Kattar, director of United States equities at Boston Company Asset Management.
Some drug stocks bucked the downward trend, with Pfizer gaining 2 7/8, to 103 7/8, after naming a new president and chief operating officer, and Lilly, recommended by Credit Lyonnais, gaining 2, to 69.
I.B.M., which soared on Wednesday, fell 2 1/8, to 116, after a 2-for-1 split took effect, while Merrill Lynch added 4 5/16 , to 83, continuing its run-up on rumors it will be acquired by Chase Manhattan.
Texaco, whose merger talks with Chevron seem to have stalled, fell 2 3/8, to 62 7/8.
In technology, computer and Internet stocks were mostly lower while chip-makers were mixed. Star Media Network, which went public on Wednesday at 15, surged 19 7/16 , to 45 1/2, while DLJ Direct jumped 8, to 38, in its second day of trading.
Ebay lost 5 5/16 , to 169. and Amazon.com declined 6 3/8, to 114 9/16 .
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the New York Stock Exchange by nearly two to one, with 39 making new 52-week lows and 25 new highs.
The Wilshire 5000, the most inclusive gauge of domestic stocks, declined by 1.4 percent.

Treasury Prices Fall
 By Bloomberg News
The prices of notes and bonds fell yesterday, pushing two-year yields to their highest level in more than nine months, as evidence pointing to continued economic strength increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.
Treasury notes -- among securities most sensitive to Federal Reserve policy -- were hardest hit yesterday as the prospect of higher interest rates soured investors. Yields on two-year notes rose to 5.42 percent from 5.33 percent.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 20/32 , to 91 20/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.84 percent from 5.80 percent.
The selling of two-year notes intensified after Medley Global Advisors told its clients the Fed would raise rates at its June meeting if the economy does not show signs of slowing before then, traders said.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS;
The Charges: 'An Unknown Number of Kosovo Albanians Have Been Killed'

 BODY:
Following are key sections of the indictment issued yesterday by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia:
During the peace negotiations in France, the violence in Kosovo continued. In late February and early March, forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia launched a series of offensives against dozens of predominantly Kosovo Albanian villages and towns. The F.R.Y. military forces were comprised of elements of the Third Army, specifically the 52d Corps, also known as the Pristina Corps, and several brigades and regiments under the command of the Pristina Corps. The Chief of the General Staff of the V.J., with command responsibilities over the Third Army and ultimately over the Pristina Corps, is Colonel General Dragoljub Ojdanic. The Supreme Commander of the V.J. is Slobodan Milosevic. 
 The police forces taking part in the actions in Kosovo are members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia in addition to some units from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the F.R.Y. All police forces employed by or working under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia are commanded by Vlajko Stojiljkovic, Minister of Internal Affairs of Serbia. Under the F.R.Y. Act on the Armed Forces, those police forces engaged in military operations during a state of war or imminent threat of war are subordinated to the command of the V.J. whose commanders are Colonel General Dragoljub Ojdanic and Slobodan Milosevic. . . .
During their offensives, forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia acting in concert have engaged in a well-planned and coordinated campaign of destruction of property owned by Kosovo Albanian civilians. Towns and villages have been shelled, homes, farms, and businesses burned, and personal property destroyed. As a result of these orchestrated actions, towns, villages, and entire regions have been made uninhabitable for Kosovo Albanians. Additionally, forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia have harassed, humiliated, and degraded Kosovo Albanian civilians through physical and verbal abuse. The Kosovo Albanians have also been persistently subjected to insults, racial slurs, degrading acts based on ethnicity and religion, beatings, and other forms of physical mistreatment.
The unlawful deportation and forcible transfer of thousands of Kosovo Albanians from their homes in Kosovo involved well-planned and coordinated efforts by the leaders of the F.R.Y. and Serbia, and forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia, all acting in concert. Actions similar in nature took place during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1995. During those wars, Serbian military, paramilitary and police forces forcibly expelled and deported non-Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina from areas under Serbian control utilizing the same method of operations as have been used in Kosovo in 1999: heavy shelling and armed attacks on villages; widespread killings; destruction of non-Serbian residential areas and cultural and religious sites; and forced transfer and deportation of non-Serbian populations.
On 24 March 1999, NATO began launching air strikes against targets in the F.R.Y. The F.R.Y. issued decrees of an imminent threat of war on 23 March 1999 and a state of war on 24 March 1999. Since the air strikes commenced, forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia have intensified their systematic campaign and have forcibly expelled hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians.
In addition to the forced expulsions of Kosovo Albanians, forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia have also engaged in a number of killings of Kosovo Albanians since 24 March 1999. Such killings occurred at numerous locations, including but not limited to, Bela Crkva, Mali Krusa/Krushe e Vogel -- Velika Krusa/Krushe e Mahde, Djakovica/Gjakov, Crkovez/Padalishte and Izbica.
The planning, preparation and execution of the campaign undertaken by forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia in Kosovo, was planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted by Slobodan Milosevic, the President of the F.R.Y.; Milan Milutinovic, the President of Serbia; Nikola Sainovic, the Deputy Prime Minister of the F.R.Y.; Colonel General Dragoljub Ojdanic, the Chief of the General Staff of the V.J.; and Vlajko Stojiljkovic, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Serbia.
By 20 May 1999, over 740,000 Kosovo Albanians, approximately one-third of the entire Kosovo Albanian population, were expelled from Kosovo. Thousands more are believed to be internally displaced. An unknown number of Kosovo Albanians have been killed in the operations by forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia. . . .
 
SUPERIOR AUTHORITY
Slobodan Milosevic was elected President of the F.R.Y. on 15 July 1997, assumed office on 23 July 1997, and remains President as of the date of this indictment.
As President of the F.R.Y., Slobodan Milosevic functions as President of the Supreme Defense Council of the F.R.Y. The Supreme Defense Council consists of the President of the F.R.Y. and the Presidents of the member republics, Serbia and Montenegro. The Supreme Defense Council decides on the National Defense Plan and issues decisions concerning the V.J.. As President of the F.R.Y., Slobodan Milosevic has the power to "order implementation of the National Defense Plan" and commands the V.J. in war and peace in compliance with decisions made by the Supreme Defense Council. Slobodan Milosevic, as Supreme Commander of the V.J., performs these duties through "commands, orders and decisions."
Under the F.R.Y. Act on the Armed Forces of Yugoslavia, as Supreme Commander of the V.J., Slobodan Milosevic also exercises command authority over republican and federal police units subordinated to the V.J. during a state of imminent threat of war or a state of war. A declaration of imminent threat of war was proclaimed on 23 March 1999, and a state of war on 24 March 1999.
In addition to his de jure powers, Slobodan Milosevic exercises extensive de facto control over numerous institutions essential to, or involved in, the conduct of the offenses alleged herein. Slobodan Milosevic exercises extensive de facto control over federal institutions nominally under the competence of the Assembly or the Government of the F.R.Y. Slobodan Milosevic also exercises de facto control over functions and institutions nominally under the competence of Serbia and its autonomous provinces, including the Serbian police force. Slobodan Milosevic further exercises de facto control over numerous aspects of the F.R.Y.'s political and economic life, particularly the media. Between 1986 and the early 1990's, Slobodan Milosevic progressively acquired de facto control over these federal, republican, provincial and other institutions. He continues to exercise this de facto control to this day.
Slobodan Milosevic's de facto control over Serbian, S.F.R.Y., F.R.Y. and other state organs has stemmed, in part, from his leadership of the two principal political parties that have ruled in Serbia since 1986, and in the F.R.Y. since 1992. From 1986 until 1990, he was Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the League of Communists in Serbia, then the ruling party in Serbia. In 1990, he was elected President of the Socialist Party of Serbia, the successor party to the League of Communists of Serbia and the Socialist Alliance of the Working People of Serbia. The S.P.S. has been the principal ruling party in Serbia and the F.R.Y. ever since. Throughout the period of his Presidency of Serbia, from 1990 to 1997, and as the President of the F.R.Y., from 1997 to the present, Slobodan Milosevic has also been the leader of the S.P.S.
Beginning no later than October 1988, Slobodan Milosevic has exercised de facto control over the ruling and governing institutions of Serbia, including its police force. Beginning no later than October 1988, he has exercised de facto control over Serbia's two autonomous provinces -- Kosovo and Vojvodina -- and their representation in federal organs of the S.F.R.Y. and the F.R.Y. From no later than October 1988 until mid-1998, Slobodan Milosevic also exercised de facto control over the ruling and governing institutions of the Montenegro, including its representation in all federal organs of the S.F.R.Y. and the F.R.Y.
In significant international negotiations, meetings and conferences since 1989, Slobodan Milosevic has been the primary interlocutor with whom the international community has negotiated. He has negotiated international agreements that have subsequently been implemented within Serbia, the S.F.R.Y., the F.R.Y., and elsewhere on the territory of the former S.F.R.Y. . . .
As the President of the F.R.Y., the Supreme Commander of the V.J., and the President of the Supreme Defense Council, and pursuant to his de facto authority, Slobodan Milosevic is responsible for the actions of his subordinates within the V.J. and any police forces, both federal and republican, who have committed the crimes alleged in this indictment since January 1999 in the province of Kosovo.

During a declared state of war or state of imminent threat of war, Milan Milutinovic, as President of Serbia, may enact measures normally under the competence of the Assembly, including the passage of laws; these measures may include the reorganization of the Government and its ministries, as well as the restriction of certain rights and freedoms.
In addition to his de jure powers, Milan Milutinovic exercises extensive de facto influence or control over numerous institutions essential to, or involved in, the conduct of the crimes alleged herein. Milan Milutinovic exercises de facto influence or control over functions and institutions nominally under the competence of the Government and Assembly of Serbia and its autonomous provinces, including but not limited to the Serbian police force. In significant international negotiations, meetings and conferences since 1995, Milan Milutinovic has been a principal interlocutor with whom the international community has negotiated. . . .
As the President of Serbia, and a member of the Supreme Defense Council, and pursuant to his de facto authority, Milan Milutinovic is responsible for the actions of any of his subordinates within the V.J. and within any police forces who have committed the crimes alleged in this indictment since January 1999 within the province of Kosovo.

CHARGES
Beginning in January 1999 and continuing to the date of this indictment, Slobodan Milosevic, Milan Milutinovic, Nikola Sainovic, Dragoljub Ojdanic, and Vlajko Stojiljkovic planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted in a campaign of terror and violence directed at Kosovo Albanian civilians living in Kosovo in the F.R.Y.
The campaign of terror and violence directed at the Kosovo Albanian population was executed by forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia acting at the direction, with the encouragement, or with the support of Slobodan Milosevic, Milan Milutinovic, Nikola Sainovic, Dragoljub Ojdanic, and Vlajko Stojiljkovic. The operations targeting the Kosovo Albanians were undertaken with the objective of removing a substantial portion of the Kosovo Albanian population from Kosovo in an effort to ensure continued Serbian control over the province. To achieve this objective, the forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia, acting in concert, have engaged in well-planned and coordinated operations as described in paragraphs 92 through 98 below.
The forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia, have in a systematic manner, forcibly expelled and internally displaced hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians from their homes across the entire province of Kosovo. To facilitate these expulsions and displacements, the forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia have intentionally created an atmosphere of fear and oppression through the use of force, threats of force, and acts of violence.
Throughout Kosovo, the forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia have looted and pillaged the personal and commercial property belonging to Kosovo Albanians forced from their homes. Policemen, soldiers, and military officers have used wholesale searches, threats of force, and acts of violence to rob Kosovo Albanians of money and valuables, and in a systematic manner, authorities at F.R.Y. border posts have stolen personal vehicles and other property from Kosovo Albanians being deported from the province.
Throughout Kosovo, the forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia have engaged in a systematic campaign of destruction of property owned by Kosovo Albanian civilians. This has been accomplished through the widespread shelling of towns and villages; the burning of homes, farms, and businesses; and the destruction of personal property. As a result of these orchestrated actions, villages, towns, and entire regions have been made uninhabitable for Kosovo Albanians.
Throughout Kosovo, the forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia have harassed, humiliated, and degraded Kosovo Albanian civilians through physical and verbal abuse. Policemen, soldiers, and military officers have persistently subjected Kosovo Albanians to insults, racial slurs, degrading acts, beatings, and other forms of physical mistreatment based on their racial, religious, and political identification.
Throughout Kosovo, the forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia have systematically seized and destroyed the personal identity documents and licenses of vehicles belonging to Kosovo Albanian civilians. As Kosovo Albanians have been forced from their homes and directed towards Kosovo's borders, they have been subjected to demands to surrender identity documents at selected points en route to border crossings and at border crossings into Albania and Macedonia. These actions have been undertaken in order to erase any record of the deported Kosovo Albanians' presence in Kosovo and to deny them the right to return to their homes.
Beginning on or about Jan. 1, 1999, and continuing until the date of this indictment, the forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia, acting at the direction, with the encouragement, or with the support of Slobodan Milosevic, Milan Milutinovic, Nikola Sainovic, Dragoljub Ojdanic, and Vlajko Stojiljkovic have perpetrated the actions set forth in paragraphs 92 through 96, which have resulted in the forced deportation of approximately 740,000 Kosovo Albanian civilians. These actions have been undertaken in all areas of Kosovo, and these means and methods were used throughout the province, including the following municipalities:
Djakovica/Gjakov: On or about April 2, 1999, forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia began forcing residents of the town of Djakovica/Gjakov to leave. Forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia spread out through the town and went house to house ordering Kosovo Albanians from their homes. In some instances, people were killed, and most persons were threatened with death. Many of the houses and shops belonging to Kosovo Albanians were set on fire, while those belonging to Serbs were protected. During the period from 2 to 4 April 1999, thousands of Kosovo Albanians living in Djakovica/Gjakov and neighboring villages joined a large convoy, either on foot or driving in cars, trucks and tractors, and moved to the border with Albania. Forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia directed those fleeing along prearranged routes, and at police checkpoints along the way most Kosovo Albanians had their identification papers and license plates seized. In some instances, Yugoslav Army trucks were used to transport persons to the border with Albania. . . .
Kosovska Mitrovica/Mitrovic: In late March 1999, forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia began moving systematically through the town of Kosovska Mitrovica/Mitrovic. They entered the homes of Kosovo Albanians and ordered the residents to leave their houses at once and to go to the bus station. Some houses were set on fire forcing the residents to flee to other parts of the town. Over a two week period the forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia continued to expel the Kosovo Albanian residents of the town. During this period, properties belonging to Kosovo Albanians were destroyed and Kosovo Albanians were robbed of money, vehicles, and other valuables. A similar pattern was repeated in other villages in the Kosovska Mitrovica/Mitrovic municipality, where Kosovo Albanians were forced from their homes, followed by the destruction of their villages by forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia. The Kosovo Albanian residents of the municipality were forced to join convoys going to the Albanian border. En route to the border, Serb soldiers, policemen, and military officers robbed them of valuables and seized their identity documents. . . .
Pec/Pej: On 27 and 28 March 1999, in the city of Pec/Pej, forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia went from house to house forcing Kosovo Albanians to leave. Some houses were set on fire and a number of people were shot. Soldiers and police were stationed along every street directing the Kosovo Albanians toward the town center. Once the people reached the center of town, those without cars or vehicles were forced to get on buses or trucks and were driven to the town of Prizren. Outside Prizren, the Kosovo Albanians were forced to get off the buses and walk approximately 40 kilometers to the Albanian border where they were ordered to turn their identification papers over to Serb policemen. . . .
Prizren: On 25 March 1999 the village of Pirana was surrounded by forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia, tanks and various military vehicles. The village was shelled and a number of the residents were killed. Thereafter, police entered the village and burned the house of Kosovo Albanians. After the attack, the remaining villagers left Pirana and went to surrounding villages. Some of the Kosovo Albanians fleeing toward Srbica were killed or wounded by snipers. Serb forces then launched an offensive in the area of Srbica and shelled the villages of Reti e Utlet, Reti and Randobrava. Kosovo Albanian villagers were forced from their homes and sent to the Albanian border. From 28 March 1999, in the city of Prizren itself, Serb policemen went from house to house, ordering Kosovo Albanian residents to leave. They were forced to join convoys of vehicles and persons traveling on foot to the Albanian border. At the border all personal documents were taken away by Serb policemen.
Srbica/Skenderaj: On or about 25 March 1999, the villages of Vojnik, Lecina, Klladernica, Turiqevc Broje and Izbica were destroyed by shelling and burning. A group of approximately 4,500 Kosovo Albanians from these villages gathered outside the village of Izbica where members of the forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia demanded money from the group and separated the men from the women and children. A large number of the men were then killed. The surviving women and children were moved as a group towards Vojnik and then on to the Albanian border. . . .
Beginning on or about 1 January 1999 and continuing until the date of this indictment, forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia, acting at the direction, with the encouragement, or with the support of Slobodan Milosevic, Milan Milutinovic, Nikola Sainovic, Dragoljub Ojdanic, and Vlajko Stojiljkovic, have murdered hundreds of Kosovo Albanian civilians. These killings have occurred in a widespread or systematic manner throughout the province of Kosovo and have resulted in the deaths of numerous men, women, and children. Included among the incidents of mass killings are the following:
On or about 15 January 1999, in the early morning hours, the village of Racak (Stimlje/Shtime municipality) was attacked by forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia. After shelling by the V.J. units, the Serb police entered the village later in the morning and began conducting house-to-house searches. Villagers, who attempted to flee from the Serb police, were shot throughout the village. A group of approximately 25 men attempted to hide in a building, but were discovered by the Serb police. They were beaten and then were removed to a nearby hill, where the policemen shot and killed them. Altogether, the forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia killed approximately 45 Kosovo Albanians in and around Racak. (Those persons killed who are known by name are set forth in Schedule A, which is attached as an appendix to this indictment.) . . .
On or about 27 March 1999, in the morning hours, forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia attacked the village of Crkolez/Padalishte (Istok/Istog municipality). As the forces entered the village, they fired on houses and on villagers who attempted to flee. Eight members of the Beke IMERAJ family were forced from their home and were killed in front of their house. Other residents of Crkolez/Padalishte were killed at their homes and in a stream bed near the village. Altogether, forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia killed approximately 20 Kosovo Albanians from Crkolez/Padalishte. (Those persons killed who are known by name are set forth in Schedule E which is attached as an appendix to this indictment.)
On or about 27 March 1999, F.R.Y. and Republic of Serbia forces attacked the village of Izbica (Srbica/Skenderaj municipality). Several thousand village residents took refuge in a meadow outside the village. On or about 28 March 1999, forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia surrounded the villagers and then approached them, demanding money. After valuables were stolen by the soldiers and policemen, the men were separated from the women and small children. The men were then further divided into two groups, one of which was sent to a nearby hill, and the other of which was sent to a nearby stream bed. Both groups of men were then fired upon by the forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia, and approximately 130 Kosovo Albanian men were killed. (Those persons killed who are known by name are set forth in Schedule F which is attached as an appendix to this indictment.) . . .
Beginning on or about 1 January 1999 and continuing until the date of this indictment, the forces of the F.R.Y. and Serbia, acting at the direction, with the encouragement, or with the support of Slobodan Milosevic, Milan Milutinovic, Nikola Sainovic, Dragoljub Ojdanic, and Vlajko Stojiljkovic, have utilized the means and methods set forth in paragraphs 92 through 98 to execute a campaign of persecution against the Kosovo Albanian civilian population based on political, racial, or religious grounds.
By these actions Slobodan Milosevic, Milan Milutinovic, Nikola Sainovic, Dragoljub Ojdanic, and Vlajko Stojiljkovic planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation or execution of:

SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC, 58
President of Yugoslavia since 1997, has effectively been the strongman of Belgrade since 1987. Then the Communist Party Chief, he staged a coup against his former mentor in the party, Ivan Stambolic, and was subsequently elected Serbian President for two terms, from 1989 to 1997. As President of the rump Yugoslavia, elected by members of the federal parliament, he is also Supreme Commander of the Yugoslav Army. A Communist Party apparatchik all his life and a lawyer, he served as general manager of Tehnogas, a gas pipeline manufacturing company, and general manager of Yugoslavia's largest bank, Beobanka. He rose to power over the issue of Kosovo, a region held dear by Serbs but largely populated by ethnic Albanians, and whipped up nationalism and visions of a Greater Serbia in which all Serbs would live united. He has been largely blamed for the wars that have torn Yugoslavia apart since 1991.
 
MILAN MILUTINOVIC, 57
President of Serbia since December 1997. A trusted aide and longtime friend of Mr. Milosevic since the two were law students at Belgrade University. Born in Belgrade, Mr. Milutinovic was proposed for the post of Serbian president by Mr. Milosevic, and ran as the candidate for his Socialist Party (S.P.S.). He served as Yugoslav Foreign Minister from 1995 to 1997, and was for five years Yugoslav ambassador to Greece. Also served as a member of federal parliament and Serbian Minister of Education. He has emerged as Mr. Milosevic's main negotiator and interlocutor with the outside world, was present at Dayton, Ohio, to negotiate the end to the Bosnian war, and led the Serb delegation to peace talks on Kosovo in Rambouillet, France, in February. While indisputably loyal, he has some weight as a politician in his own right.
 
NIKOLA SAINOVIC, 51
Yugoslav deputy prime minister with special responsibility for Kosovo for the last year, and a close aide to Mr. Milosevic. Born in Bor, a large copper mining center in southeastern Serbia, he is a technical engineer. He was a provincial Communist Party chief from 1978 to 1982, then Minister for Mining. Since 1991 he has filled top level posts in the Serbian and federal Governments, including as Serbian Prime Minister. Since last year he has had special responsibility for Kosovo, and has spent many weeks in the province, where he was the key liaison with the international observers. A trusted lieutenant of Mr. Milosevic, he took part in the peace talks at Rambouillet. Foreign intelligence reportedly intercepted a telephone call between Mr. Sainovic and the Serb chief of police in Kosovo, allegedly discussing how to cover up evidence of the killings of ethnic Albanians in Racak.
 
VLAJKO STOJILJKOVIC, 62
Serbia's Minister of Internal Affairs, comes from Pozarevac, Mr. Milosevic's home town.

HEADLINE: Watchdog Group Finds Cuts in Bus Service

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Despite a three-year surge in bus ridership, New York City Transit has cut service on about 20 percent of its routes, including some of the most popular, according to a report released yesterday by the Straphangers Campaign, a transit watchdog group.
The group, basing its analysis on New York City Transit's own records, found that fewer buses are running along 41 of the 201 routes served by the transit agency, including such heavily traveled Manhattan routes as the M1, M2 and M3 along Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue, and the M104 on Broadway. 
 A New York City Transit spokesman, Al O'Leary, said yesterday that the report contained a "kernel of truth" and reflected the difficulties faced by the agency in accommodating a rapidly growing ridership.
But he said that the Straphangers Campaign had not taken into account the complex logistics involved in managing New York City's huge grid of bus routes. The system is trying to adjust as quickly as possible to changing ridership patterns, Mr. O'Leary said.
He said that he did not know the specifics of those 41 routes. But Mr. O'Leary said that, as a general rule, New York City Transit has some routes with more buses than are needed, and these routes are candidates for reductions.
In its report, the Straphangers Campaign examined ridership data on all New York City Transit bus routes for the two-year period that ended in January, and compared that information to changes in service levels during a slightly longer period, beginning in September 1996.
The cuts on several bus routes have led to "elbow-in-the-ribs crowding and more bus bunching," said Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign. Bus bunching is when several buses arrive at a stop at the same time, after a long period in which none come.
Bus ridership in neighborhoods across the city has increased sharply, and the rise is attributed largely to the robust economy and tourism, which began pushing up demand for all forms of public transportation in 1996, and to the advent of free transfers between subways and buses in July 1997.
Information provided yesterday by New York City Transit, a unit of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, showed that a daily average of 2.2 million people were riding its buses during the first three months of this year, up from slightly more than 2 million a day for all of 1998.
Bus ridership has increased steadily since 1996, when the daily average sank to 1.6 million after several years of declines.
Although executives of New York City Transit have applauded the turnaround in ridership and said they intend to add many buses to their fleet over the next two years, Mr. O'Leary said yesterday that the expansion of service cannot be carried out immediately.
"We have to do this in a systematic way," he said, adding that the transit agency must conduct a detailed analysis to determine which of its bus routes are attracting the most new riders and avoid adding buses where they are not needed.
The agency has been expanding its bus fleet, adding 600 buses during weekday peak service hours, to a total of 3,700, since mid-1996, he said.
Mr. O'Leary said another installment of its bus service expansion is due this summer, with $7.3 million budgeted by New York City Transit for new buses that will be put into service over the next three months.
He declined to say how many buses would be added, or where they would be deployed, but said that service would be expanded on at least 10 of the 41 routes identified as having sustained service cuts.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: PENTAGON;
Kosovo Rebels, Once Weak, Start Taking a Toll on Serbs

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters, led by more experienced commanders and buoyed by NATO's escalating air campaign, are waging increasingly effective hit-and-run attacks against Yugoslav troops in Kosovo, Pentagon officials said today.
"They appear to be a resurgent group which has taken advantage of NATO air strikes, general Western sympathy, and the groundswell of volunteer fighters in Albania," said Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson, director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
 The assessment on the Kosovo fighters came as allied warplanes bombed the two main power transmission stations supplying Belgrade with electricity late today, plunging most of the capital into darkness.
As NATO continues to pummel Yugoslav forces in Kosovo and strategic targets like electricity distribution systems, with no signs of surrender from the Yugoslav President, Sloboban Milosevic, Pentagon officials say a subtle shift is beginning to emerge on the ground.
A broken, demoralized force of roughly 3,000 fighters just two months ago, the Kosovo Liberation Army has swelled to between 15,000 and 17,000 soldiers in Kosovo, with another 5,000 training in Albania, American officials estimated today.
New commanders, including an ethnic Albanian from the Croatian army, are executing better tactical operations, the officials said. In addition, new recruits and improved supply lines from Albania have revitalized a rebel force that had been routed by Yugoslavia's Third Army before and shortly after the air war started on March 24.
The rebels are still outgunned by the heavily armed Yugoslav forces, which are equipped with tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers, Admiral Wilson said. But the growing number of Kosovo fighters, coupled with the air war's forcing many of the 40,000 Yugoslav army troops and police to dig into defensive positions, have started to equalize parts of the battlefield.
"Because of the relative immobility of the Serb armored mechanized forces, the playing field is somewhat more level," Admiral Wilson told reporters today.
Despite the intensifying bombing, NATO and Pentagon officials conceded that there are no signs that Yugoslav troops in Kosovo are beginning to withdraw, one of NATO's main conditions for halting the bombardment.
"We obviously have not destroyed their will to conduct what they're doing in Kosovo yet," Admiral Wilson said.
NATO officials today reported heavy fighting in southwest Kosovo, with the rebels launching a major offensive in the Mount Pastrik area, pinning down Serbian forces there. Last week, the rebels scored one of their biggest victories in the past two months, overrunning a Yugoslav weapons depot in Jablanica, capturing mortars, artillery and a large cache of ammunition.
Yugoslav forces continued their shelling overnight of Albanian villages just across the Kosovo border, which Belgrade believes are being used as staging areas for the rebel forces.
Major clashes were also reported in and around Drenica, where, Pentagon and NATO officials said, Yugoslav troops were continuing to expel Albanians from Kosovo.
As Yugoslav forces and rebel fighters battled, NATO warplanes seized on clear skies to launch 308 bombing runs overnight against command bunkers, anti-aircraft radars, radio relay stations and heavy weaponry, including at least five tanks, six armored personnel carriers, and 10 artillery pieces.
Yugoslav gunners launched more than 30 surface-to-air missiles and withering anti-aircraft fire, NATO officials said.
"The good weather that is helping our pilots to see their targets more easily is in turn helping them to detect our aircraft and guide their missiles visually," Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, a NATO military spokesman in Brussels, said of the Yugoslav forces.
In recent weeks, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's military commander, has stepped up attacks on electrical transmission stations, knocking out power throughout most of Serbia and shutting off the pumping stations that provide water to most Yugoslav citizens.
On Wednesday, the North Atlantic Council, NATO's political arm, authorized General Clark to broaden his bombing campaign to a variety of political and economic targets, including civilian telephone networks that link the military's computer systems. Within hours of the approval, allied fighter-bombers hit the first of several telephone networks on the target list, a senior Pentagon official said.
"Every day or every week he gains authority to strike a wider range of targets," Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said today, without disclosing details of NATO's expanded target list.
Striking civilian phone systems will play havoc with the Yugoslav military's computer networks and force commanders to speak on cellular phones, whose transmissions can be intercepted by eavesdropping satellites and Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft.
Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a senior planner for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that as of Wednesday, in the air war's first 64 days, United States warplanes had conducted 52 percent of the 6,950 bombing runs and 70 percent of the 20,300 reconnaissance, refueling and other support missions.

HEADLINE: ON THE RECORD: Governor Bush and Education;
Turnaround in Texas Schools Looks Good for Bush in 2000

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

DATELINE: BROWNSVILLE, Tex.

 BODY:
On a rundown road in this sprawling border city, the Castaneda Elementary School, built in 1965 for the children of Mexican migrant workers, is still housed in its original portable buildings. All of its 360 pupils are Mexican-American; a majority arrive not knowing English and a quarter spend several months a year on the road with their working parents.
Yet last year, 90 percent of Castaneda's third graders passed the state's standardized test of academic skills, putting it among the state's top schools. Many other schools are not far behind. In 1998, 76 percent of third graders in Texas passed the test, up from 58 percent in 1994. 
 And on national examinations, Texan schoolchildren have begun to show up their peers in other states. The trend has become so consistent that Texas' public school system, long among the nation's most troubled, is viewed today by educators as an emerging model of equity, progress and accountability.
It is a remarkable turnaround for a school system that is more than half black and Hispanic, and the causes and effects are being debated around the country. Few would dispute that children are the chief beneficiaries. But with a Presidential election next year, there will very likely be another beneficiary, Gov. George W. Bush, at the moment the Republicans' best hope for taking control of the White House.
While Mr. Bush cannot take full credit for the turnaround -- and he does not try to -- his record on education in Texas shows that some credit will rightfully accrue to him.
He readily acknowledges that the improvements in the system were well under way when he came into office in 1995. But he and others point to his enhancement of the system -- his firm support for accountability, his nonideological approach, his initiative on early reading -- as evidence of his ability to lead, manage and unite disparate factions at a time when education is emerging as the most significant domestic political issue in the nation.
The Texas school system is not without detractors. Some educators complain that it puts too much emphasis on standardized tests; others assert that the tests are too easy, and still others say that the system permits too much state control. But for now most educators offer praise.
"People from outside come to me and say, 'He represents the big money interests of Republicans everywhere,' " said Susana Navarro, executive director of the El Paso Collaborative for Academic Excellence, a nonprofit group in El Paso. "But all I can say is that in Texas with regard to education, George Bush has managed to maintain the sort of system that insures attention, support and achievement for minority and poor kids. While he has been Governor, the gap between minorities and whites has closed rather remarkably."
This has stemmed partly from a unique accountability system that predates Mr. Bush's tenure and requires all Texas schools to give an array of standardized tests and record the results for each subgroup -- white, black, Hispanic and economically disadvantaged. The schools are judged on the performance of each group separately. Other states give tests but no other uses the performance of subgroups separately to determine success.
 
Building on System Already in Place
When Mr. Bush was elected in November 1994, the accountability system, an initiative of the Education Commissioner of his Democratic predecessor, Ann W. Richards, was still new. Some feared that he would dismantle the system. Instead, they say, he has strengthened it.
"In a relatively short period of time, the whole culture of education has changed in Texas," said Prof. Richard F. Elmore of the Graduate School of Education at Harvard University. "Today, kids of color and poor kids there are fully expected to learn."
On the last nationally administered mathematics test for fourth graders, the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress, black Texans ranked first among all black fourth graders in the country, white Texans ranked first among white fourth graders and Hispanic Texans ranked sixth.
This was in marked contrast to states with similar populations: California's black fourth graders ranked 36th, and New York's Hispanic fourth graders ranked 30th.
National reading tests in 1998 again showed Texas ahead of the pack. Black fourth graders in Texas were ranked 9th nationally and white fourth graders were 2d.
And a report last November by the National Education Goals Panel, a group that tracks education across the country, cited Texas and North Carolina for their rapid gains.
Texas' test gains do not follow any notable increase in investment in the education system, though its teacher/pupil ratio, 15.3 to 1, puts it ahead of the national average of 17.3. The state's other vital education statistics, such as spending per pupil, are slightly below the national average.
In an interview in his office in Austin -- glass cases of signed baseballs against one wall recall his recent ownership of the Texas Rangers -- Mr. Bush emphasized his new legislative proposals intended to have every third grader reading at grade level. He said research showed that after third grade, catching up was much harder for pupils who fell behind.
Among the proposals, most of which have been approved by the Legislature, is one calling for five days of training for every teacher in kindergarten through third grade. The Legislature has already approved $18.8 million to carry out the training this summer, with $30.8 million more expected to be allocated for it next summer.
If, as expected, the Legislature passes the rest of Mr. Bush's plan in the current session, all third graders would be required to pass a reading test to move to fourth grade starting in 2003. Many states are talking about ending the practice of advancing children to the next grade irrespective of their academic skills, but Texas would be among the first to accompany that policy with a program of early intervention.
"I came from the ultimate results-oriented world, which is major league baseball," Mr. Bush said. "Every day we saw the score. Texas has a very good accountability system that began to develop thanks to others who preceded me. I have worked hard to strengthen it, to continue to raise the bar."
The implications for education of a Bush Presidency are vague. The Governor has so far declined to lay out any specific ideas for a national education policy, advocating state and local control. That puts some distance between him and Vice President Al Gore, who recently called for an ambitious Federal policy that would make preschool universally available and offer grants of $10,000 to college graduates willing to spend four years teaching in troubled schools.
Mr. Bush says he is not sure what role a President or the Federal Government should play in education. He mentions the "bully pulpit" and the need to press for sound research and accountability systems that rely on testing and clear goals. He says, when asked, that he may be open to the use of Federal money as a means of persuasion, something President Clinton also advocates.
Mr. Bush has upset liberals with his support of using public money to send children to private schools, but that support has not been especially vigorous , and Texas has not instituted a system of vouchers for private schools.
The key to the Texas accountability system since it was instituted in 1991 has been the relentless focus on testing. Every year, from third through eighth grade and once again in high school, virtually every Texas public school pupil takes a version of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, known to all in the state as TAAS. The results, along with school attendance figures, determine a school's rating in the state.
In some districts, the administration of the skills test is viewed as the end of an annual campaign, rather like the homecoming football game, in which every pupil is a player. Students train with pep rallies and inspirational speeches; posters plaster the walls; those who pass are rewarded with parties and full days at amusement parks.
 
Critics Question All the Testing
The approach is not universally admired. It is opposed by the religious right because it is seen as a centralized curriculum, and by some on the left for the fact that minority children do less well than whites and by other parents and educators who say "teaching to the test" distorts the learning process.
"In many years, all my daughters' teachers have done is drill them for TAAS instead of giving creative writing or interesting projects," said Susan Monsees, an Austin dental hygienist, whose two daughters are in the ninth and fifth grades.
"The system may look good on paper, but I feel my daughters are getting ripped off," Ms. Monsees said.
A few advocates of minority rights worry about reliance on standardized tests because black and Hispanic students historically do less well on them. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund is suing the State of Texas over the high school skills test, which students must pass to graduate.
"Some say governments shouldn't measure because that is too much government control," Mr. Bush said. "Some say it is racist to test. I strongly say it is racist not to test because by not testing we don't know and by not knowing we are just moving children through the system."
Mr. Bush argues that the success is the result of "the simple application of principles" that could apply to running a business: clear, easy-to-understand and measurable goals, staying focused on a few things and doing them well.
His analogy to business is significant. Texas' success, most analysts agree, stems from a sustained interest in education by the state's business leaders, which began in 1983 when a panel headed by Ross Perot made recommendations. Many were passed by the Legislature, setting the stage for the improvements to come. These included reducing class sizes in first through fourth grades and reallocating state education money so that poorer districts received a larger share.
 
Making Sure Minorities Succeeded
To make sure the minority pupils were part of the advance, superintendents, principals and teachers were allowed to pursue the goal of having their pupils pass the skills test as they saw fit, a management approach that Mr. Bush considers vital to the improved test scores.
At the Roosevelt Elementary School in north Houston, where only 8 percent of the children are white, Charlotte Parker, the principal, requires each child to hand in a writing sample every two weeks. Ninety percent of Ms. Parker's pupils, many of them in bilingual education, now pass the skills test.
In fact, the use of bilingual education is noteworthy, another example of Mr. Bush's avoiding traditional Republican education politics. Last June, California banned the use of bilingual education, a move applauded by many Republican leaders.
Texas not only permits bilingual education, many of its schools are planning to increase its use so that students who leave classes taught in Spanish for those taught in English maintain their fluency and literacy as they get into the upper elementary grades. Mr. Bush said he favored "what works" and as long as children learned English and proved, through their test scores, their English proficiency, he had no objection to the use of bilingual education.
It has worked in border cities like Brownsville. Superintendent Wallace Jackson said that six years ago, based on the skills test, the Brownsville school district had 11 low-performing schools out of 43. Today there are none.
At Lopez High School in Brownsville, Sylvia Senteno, the dean of instruction, said that "for 30 years, no one cared how many kids dropped out." Today, since school ratings depend partly on attendance and reducing dropout rates, Ms. Senteno said, "we do everything we can to keep kids in school so as to avoid lowering our rating."
"We visit their homes," she said. "We have improved the food. We greet the kids when they arrive, even hand out free pencils if we get them, anything to show them we miss them when they are not here."
This year, Ms. Senteno said, only 5 seniors failed the skills test. Three years ago, there were 70.

HEADLINE: Drug Abuse Is An Insurer's Problem

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A May 26 news article about the death of Robert Payton, a Manhattan lawyer, from a drug overdose after his insurer refused to pay for in-patient drug rehabilitation highlights the decline in coverage for addiction treatment under managed care. This despite estimates showing the economic cost of addiction far exceeds what we invest in treatment. 
 A study our organization just completed shows that since 1988 there has been a 74.5 percent decline in the value of coverage for addiction treatment by private insurers. Moreover, rehabilitation for substance abuse has been all but eliminated from insurance plans, leaving patients vulnerable to relapse even if they receive acute detoxification. Thus it is likely that Mr. Payton's insurer would have denied him the aftercare needed to avoid a relapse, even if he had received initial treatment. This is not only bad medicine, but also bad economics.

Despite Holes, Good Enough For a City Plan

BYLINE: By Clyde Haberman 

 BODY:
LIFE is enriched by its little mysteries, like who first looked at a lobster and said, "Mmm, I want to eat that," and what was the greatest thing before sliced bread.
Municipal government is not nearly as compelling, but it does have mysteries of its own. One has come to the fore with a much-disputed plan for a rail link to Kennedy International Airport: 
 How is it that city agencies can study one of the most important public works projects in decades, conclude it has more holes than a harmonica and still tell its backers to go ahead?
That is essentially what happened early this month when the City Planning Commission helped clear the way for a so-called Airtrain to Kennedy, despite having almost nothing good to say about it. Next week, the City Council will take its turn, and few would be shocked if the same thing happened.
Council staff members have also studied this project, a $1.5 billion baby nurtured by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. They, too, have nothing but doubt, with a capital D. Mostly it is focused on the Port Authority's plans for an elevated light-rail line above the Van Wyck Expressway, running 3.1 miles from Kennedy to Jamaica, Queens. At Jamaica, travelers would switch to the Long Island Rail Road or to the E, J or Z subway lines, in most cases to continue the journey to mid-Manhattan.
In other words, New York would not get what other international cities have: a seamless "one seat" ride from the airport to the heart of the city.
Given that basic fact, and using the Port Authority's own projections, the planning commission strongly doubted that more than a few thousand travelers would use the Airtrain each day -- not nearly enough, most commissioners said with open disdain, to make it a success.
Even so, they held their noses and gave their approval, focusing on narrow land-use concerns. In large measure, they acted because the Mayor had already lent his support, however unenthusiastically. The desire to see something -- anything -- get built runs high in a city where grand public works programs are remembered only by citizens with the grayest hair.
Now, the question is whether the City Council will go the same route; it is effectively the Airtrain's final municipal stop. Ultimately, everything depends on Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker, who says through a spokesman that he is neutral for now.
You'd be hard pressed to find a room big enough to contain the many high-priced lobbyists, consultants and political musclemen hired by all parties to this highly contentious issue.
People living by the Van Wyck don't want the noise, traffic and air pollution that train construction would bring. They have an unusual ally in the Air Transport Association, an airline trade group unhappy that the project will be financed largely through airport passenger fees. It wants all that money to be spent only at Kennedy itself.
On the other side are politically powerful contractors and trade unions, salivating at the prospect of 4,000-plus construction jobs. With them are businesses and political leaders in southeast Queens who see an economic development offer they can't refuse. "If we lose this opportunity, we're not going to see it again in my lifetime or yours," warned Archie Spigner, a senior Councilman from Queens.
Y OU would have to look far and wide to find a city planner opposed to the concept of a train to the plane. New York is close to being strangled by traffic jams on the highways leading to its airports. Salvation, the consensus holds, lies in a train ride that is swift and reliable.
The question is whether the Port Authority plan does the trick.
Absolutely not, critics say. They cannot imagine many tourists or business travelers taking the subway in Manhattan, getting off at Jamaica and then lugging their bags up and down stairs, or handing them to planned airline check-in counters there. The word "schlep" comes up a lot.
The Port Authority replies that this is, by far, the best that can be done because tunnels under the East River rule out a one-seat ride for now. Some day that ride will come, the authority promises.
Who will win this critical fight? Stay tuned. About the only thing not a mystery, said Walter L. McCaffrey, another Queens Councilman, is that no lobbyist or consultant is about to go hungry.

HEADLINE: An Eastern Alternative to Blockbusterwood

BYLINE: By Neal Gabler; Neal Gabler is the author, most recently, of "Life the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality."

DATELINE: AMAGANSETT, N.Y.

 BODY:
Call it Brooklyn's revenge for decades of indignities suffered at the hands of Hollywood. That is one thing that came to mind when Robert De Niro and Miramax Films announced a tentative agreement with New York City on a $150 million plan to develop the abandoned Brooklyn Navy Yard as a film-making complex.
Given the financial and political obstacles still to be hurdled, no one knows if the project will ever be built -- but whatever happens, there may be something more at work here than economics, civic pride or the desire of New York-based actors for a production complex closer to home. There is a recognition that America's movie culture is changing -- a change that is reflected in the difference between Hollywood and Brooklyn. 
 For two decades, Hollywood has been relying primarily on special-effects-driven blockbusters. Not only are they the pictures most likely to appeal to young males (still the largest demographic cohort among filmgoers); they are also most likely to appeal to viewers overseas, a more profitable venue now than the domestic market.
Yes, there have been big-budget disasters like "Waterworld" and "Godzilla," and some low-budget films like "The Full Monty" and "Shakespeare in Love" have become modest hits. But Hollywood is like a casino. To win really big you have to wager really big. "Shakespeare in Love" has grossed roughly $100 million domestically. "Star Wars: Part One -- The Phantom Menace" exceeded that in its first five days.
While the Hollywood blockbuster still rules the box office, its esthetic hegemony faces a new challenge. The competitors are smaller, less bombastic films often called independents even though they are likely to have been made or distributed by divisions of major studios. They tend to emphasize words over action, nuance over size, emotion over sensation. These emphases don't necessarily make independent films better than the Hollywood blockbusters. But they do make them different.
The Hollywood blockbuster testifies to the tyranny of the young over popular culture -- television shows, music, magazines and advertising. The independent film testifies to a backlash by baby boomers hoping to retake a small portion of what they had ceded.
Still, if the big money is elsewhere, why does Hollywood care about boomers? Because in an industry racked by an overwhelming sense of intellectual inferiority, the "indies" provide prestige: one film can instantly turn a producer from a mercenary into an esthete. As the critic Richard Schickel once summed it up to me, "In Hollywood, pictures are either made for teen-agers or for Oscars."
Which brings us back to Brooklyn. Where a movie is made may not seem to be of much consequence, yet it can actually make all the difference in the world.
Early in this century New York City was the center of the film industry, and many films had a certain New Yorkishness about them, which usually manifested itself as either urban or urbane. Urban films dealt with the struggles of city life: immigrant assimilation, labor strife, disease, crime and delinquency, prostitution. Urbane films dealt with the problems of the wealthy and sophisticated: infidelity, passion, ennui, social climbing. It is a tradition that survives in the urban films of Martin Scorsese and Sidney Lumet and the urbane films of Woody Allen.
The shift to Hollywood changed all that. From the time the first movie moguls decamped from the East around 1910 and arrived in California, they found a tabula rasa on which they could write their dreams.
Inevitably, the movies were cast in the expansive image of the place. Everything in Hollywood, from the swashbucklers of Douglas Fairbanks to the Biblical spectacles of Cecil B. DeMille to the science fiction epics of George Lucas, suggests escape. Escapism worked: by 1922 only 12 percent of American films were being produced in New York; 84 percent were being produced in Hollywood.
The recent surge in independent production, however, may redress things a bit. Just as New York could never have sustained the fantasies promulgated by the Hollywood film, Hollywood may not be able to sustain the maturity of the so-called independent film. The hyperkinetic Hollywood ethos just isn't congenial to that kind of picture. It needs a new venue -- an anti-Hollywood.
England and other outposts across North America have been performing that function, but there may be no better candidate for the job than Brooklyn. In old Hollywood movies, Brooklynites -- always ferret-faced, with their nasal accents, their fractured syntax of "dese, dems and dose," and their hands flapping like semaphore flags -- were aliens.
Set them down in the small-town, middle-class domain of those films, say, as an Army buddy, and the locals were in absolute wonderment that anyone actually behaved this way. It was the difference between the Brooklyn Dodgers, with No. 1 fan Hilda Chester rattling her cowbell, and the Los Angeles Dodgers, cheered on by Frank Sinatra and Cary Grant.
Yes, it's difficult to imagine prosaic Brooklyn as a Hollywood East. But with American film and American film audiences increasingly divided between the blockbuster, which reaps the bulk of profits, and the mature film, which has been reaping the bulk of the Oscars, one can hope that American film making may someday be divided between Hollywood and Brooklyn.
As they say in Flatbush, "Who wudda thunk it?"

HEADLINE: What Murder Says About the Society It Exists In

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
At the heart of the analysis of the killings last month at Columbine High School in Colorado has been a deceptively simple question: Were the killers chillingly aberrant monsters or were they a part, however perverse, of something in the culture as a whole?
But long before Columbine, this question and others were being asked by professors as homicide became an increasingly conspicuous slice of American scholarship.
Recent books have surveyed murder in the United States and the world, explored the meaning of murder narratives and unearthed vast detail and sociological significance in celebrated 19th-century cases. There is a three-year-old journal, "Homicide Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal." These and other projects suggest that just as "true crime" has become a permanent fixture in publishing, murder may be establishing itself as a valid course of study in academia. 
 "Homicide has always been the backbone of history -- 'legitimate' homicide, which is war," said Roger Lane, a Haverford College historian and author of "Murder in America" (Ohio State University Press, 1998). "It has only been in the past generation that social historians have discovered how much homicide has to tell us about the society in which it exists."
Historians have been drawn to celebrated murder cases in the past, and criminologists and sociologists have long studied the incidence of homicide and how to reduce it.
But only recently have scholars begun to focus so intensely on murder as a window on society and a revealing subject for social or intellectual historians. Dr. Lane's book, for example, tracks the incidence of murder and the culture's response to it from medieval England to modern times, using murder -- and which murders are deemed to matter -- as a way of taking the social temperature on issues of race and class and attitudes toward children and the sexes.
Patricia Cline Cohen of the University of California at Santa Barbara and Amy Gilman Srebnick of Montclair State University each examined different 19th-century cases of murdered women in New York to analyze attitudes about women, sexuality and class.
"Murder Most Foul: The Killer and the American Gothic Imagination" (Harvard University Press, 1998) by Karen Halttunen of the University of California at Davis tracks the way the culture has imagined and portrayed murder. She argues that the depictions of murder reveal a shift from values based in the Puritan religion to secular ones. In the first case, murderers are seen as sinners in a community of sinners, whose fall is a warning to everyone. In the second, the killer is seen as an alien monster whose crimes reflect his separation from the rest of society. She calls this the Gothic homicide narrative.
M. Dwayne Smith, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and editor of the Journal of Homicide Studies, said that it was natural for scholars to be drawn to murder.
"There's a joke that if a total alien came and did a content analysis of American literature and pop culture, he'd conclude that we kill one another and we fall in love," he said. "The culture has such a tremendous fascination with homicide, you would expect to find academic interest as well."
But until recently homicide was largely left to the criminologists and sociologists, whose research tends toward the pieces in Homicide Studies on topics like "Suicide Following Homicide in Canada" or "Murder as Self-Help: Women and Intimate Partner Homicide."
Daniel A. Cohen, a historian at Florida International University who wrote a survey of crime literature, cited two developments that made homicide more appealing to historians and other scholars.
The first, he said, was the development of the new social history in the 1970's, which argued for depictions of the poor, minorities, women, religious and ethnic minorities and others who had been often overlooked in histories oriented toward the rich and powerful. The second was a renewed respect for narrative rather than quantitative or technical analysis in recent years.
Thus "The Murder of Helen Jewett" (Knopf, 1998) by Ms. Cohen and "The Mysterious Death of Mary Rogers" (Oxford University Press, 1997) by Ms. Srebnick take murders of women, the first a prostitute killed in 1836, the second a 20-year-old descendant of prominent New England settlers, killed in 1841, and combine compelling storytelling with bottom-up social analysis. (Edgar Allan Poe based "The Mystery of Marie Roget" on the Rogers case.) Ms. Cohen said newspaper accounts and trial transcripts -- usually kept unofficially by reporters rather than by the courts -- provide much material about the lives of ordinary and marginalized groups that would otherwise be extremely hard to find.
"It's one of the best ways to hear from people who don't normally publish books or get their words written down," she said. "There were 20 different court reporters putting out transcripts in the Helen Jewett trial. Normally you would not hear about the life of a prostitute except through the eyes of moral reformers."
For some scholars homicide is most interesting not as a reflection of cultural forces but as a subject in itself, particularly given the consistently high murder rates in the United States.
Eric Monkkonen, a historian at the University of California at Los Angeles, has spent nearly 12 years studying 200 years' worth of homicide in New York City. Mr. Monkkonen is part of a loosely knit group of about 250 researchers from various disciplines called the Homicide Research Working Group.
"We don't usually get much of a long view of homicide," he said. "We're always thinking of the past 10 years and very seldom looking at the past 200. If someone were to say to me: 'Why 200 years? It's not enough. It should be 300?" I'd say, 'I agree.' "
Mr. Monkkonen said his research more than anything convinces him that the shifts in homicide rates reflect a web of social, economic and technological factors ranging from changes in policing and weapons to shifts in employment that may take a generation to take hold, rather than any single government policy. That leads him to be wary of attributing credit for a current decline in the city's homicide rate or expecting lower crime levels to be permanent.
Some aspects of homicide seem eternal, experts say.
Cases that get the most attention, like those of O. J. Simpson and JonBenet Ramsey now or those of Mary Rogers and Helen Jewett, often include salacious elements of passion and mystery that also cross into the tense territory of race or sexuality.
And despite widespread worries about the toxic effects of tabloid news coverage, murder has always sold. The sensational murders of the 19th century were perhaps the greatest sales tools for fledgling newspapers of the time reaching for a mass audience. Before there was Geraldo Rivera pumping up ratings with daily coverage of the Simpson case, there was Cotton Mather, the famous preacher of Colonial America.
"As early as the 1680's you had ministers who realized that murder cases provided them with a much larger audience than they normally had," Mr. Cohen said. "Usually sermons were reprinted with maybe 200 or 300 copies. Cotton Mather used to brag how he could print 1,200 or 1,500 copies of execution sermons, and they would sell out."
An element that seems new to many scholars, however, is the nation's wave of school shootings. The age of the killers and the way they strike at schools and schoolchildren defy most of the common conventions of American homicide.
Ms. Halttunen's book argues that some recent murder accounts, like the book and film "Dead Man Walking," veer back toward the earlier Puritan sense of the killer who reflected society's sins rather than an alien ogre. Yet she admits that the recent school killings have elements of both.
"We're very torn in the way we view them," she said. "Something about these school shootings may be pushing us through a wall. It's almost as if we are searching for a new language with which to discuss them."
Mr. Cohen says that this has always been the case. In his 1993 book, "Pillars of Salt, Monuments of Grace: New England Crime Literature and the Origins of American Popular Culture," he argues that accounts of reactions to homicide show that killers have traditionally been seen as insiders and outsiders simultaneously.
Much of the increase in scholarship began when murder rates were soaring. Though they are plummeting, Mr. Lane said homicide was unlikely to disappear, either as a crime or a subject of scholarship.
"I gave a talk to the Mystery Writers of America in January, and I told them not to worry, murder isn't going away," he said. "The factors that appear to be driving down homicide, I think, are short-term with clear downside boundaries, and homicide is going to rebound.
"Sex and violence have always sold. The interest in murder doesn't flag. We academics are finally catching up with it."

HEADLINE: Voting at Long Last, Nigeria Pinches Itself

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: ABUJA, Nigeria, May 28

 BODY:
At the U-Fine Barbers Shop in the slum of Nyanya here, Nigeria's final day under military rule registered with a mixture of great hope for the future and last-minute jitters about a return to civilian government -- long promised, yet often postponed.
"It is a day we have been looking forward to," said Thomas Idoko, a 29-year-old teacher, who was getting a trim. "We thought it would never take place, but now I am expecting great changes both in the economy and society." 
 The barber, John Agbo, 21, wished that the long-awaited day would bring a more personal change. "I pray to God that I can get a richer shop," he said, mentioning air conditioning, sharper clippers, a bigger waiting area. He said he would settle, though, for reliable electricity from the Government so that his old clippers would not stop working in mid-hum.
Nigeria, whose 122 million people make it Africa's most populous nation, changes governments on Saturday; the generals who have ruled it since 1983 are giving way to a civilian Government elected in February. Since the departing President, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, announced last July that a civilian government would take over on May 29, the date has loomed before Nigerians as the finishing line of a political marathon.
And only 24 hours before the day, there were doubts in Nyanya, amid the expressions of optimism, that the line would be crossed.
"I'm highly elated that the handover will take place," said Friday Nathaniel, 18, who was waiting for his turn at the barbershop. "We are praying that it should happen as it has been promised. I expect the incoming administration will do something in the area of job opportunities. I am now just like a beggar with no choice."
Nyanya is on the outskirts of this capital's center, a world away from the five-star international hotels, where Nigerian and foreign lobbyists were furiously slapping backs this week, and a dinner was held to honor Stella Obasanjo, the wife of the President-elect, Olusegun Obasanjo, the retired general and onetime military ruler.
Nigeria, ruled by the military for all but 10 years since independence from Britain in 1960, teetered on the edge of collapse under the extremely repressive and corrupt Government of Gen. Sani Abacha. But after five years in power, General Abacha died suddenly last June, setting off a series of political reforms that is culminating in the inauguration on Saturday. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's special envoy to Africa, is to lead the American delegation at the inauguration.
This morning, the dirt road outside U-Fine Barbers was flooded after a night of heavy rains. A block away, in a heap of uncollected garbage, a baby goat could be seen butting a rooster over an apparently tasty morsel.
Nyanya came into existence in the 1980's after Nigeria, its coffers flush from the oil boom, decided to move its capital to Abuja from Lagos. Over the years, Nigerians from seemingly every corner of this country gravitated to Nyanya, divided by religion and ethnicity but seemingly united in their concept of a better life.
"I want the new Government to increase the salaries of the workers and to help the poor," said Ezekiel Oyeleru, 13, who was milling around with other children outside the barbershop. The children have not attended school in months, since unpaid teachers began striking.
"To repair our roads," said Charles Jeremiah, 17.
"Our homes," Ezekiel said.
"To repair our schools and to reduce our school fees," Charles said.
Lazarus Mohammed, 26, struggled to push his wheelbarrow around water-filled potholes in front of the barbershop. It was laden with plastic containers that he had filled with water from a tap and that he was going to sell in a remote corner of Nyanya for 5 cents each.
"Mai ruwa!" a woman cried to him in Hausa, the dominant language and ethnic group in northern Nigeria. "Water boy! Your jerrycans are leaking."
The water boy stopped. "Nigeria will be great a year from now," he said before going on. "We are suffering now. But after suffering is enjoyment."
Elegant Ukpong, 35, was not ready to celebrate yet. Mr. Ukpong was one of the hundreds of men in Nyanya, called okada-men, who ferry passengers on their motorcycles for a living.
"People still have doubts that the handover will take place," the okada-man said. "They are afraid of all the rumors."
"Last week we heard that Obasanjo was killed," he said, referring to rumors that suddenly swept the country and caused riots in Lagos. "So we still have doubts. Until I see the new Government here -- 24 hours from now -- I will not go out and jubilate."
But then, the okada-man said, he will party. "Anything my hand can reach," he said, "I will eat to make my mind happy."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Friday Rally Can't Reverse Rough Week

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
After rising relentlessly for more than two months, the Dow Jones industrial average has given up a portion of its gains the last three weeks as investors begin to worry that cyclical stocks that seemed underpriced at the end of winter might be heading into the summer having risen too far or too fast.
The prospect that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates in a pre-emptory move against an overheating economy, and the inflation that it might bring, has also put a crimp in some investors' hopes for industrial companies like Alcoa, International Paper and Caterpillar. 
 Despite a gain of 92.81 points yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 2.5 percent of its value this week, finishing at 10,559.74. That was the steepest one-week decline in the Dow since mid-January, and it left the industrial average roughly 5 percent below its peak of 11,107.19, reached on May 13.
Even after those declines, however, the bellwether market index was still 15 percent ahead of where it started the year. Trading was relatively slow yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, with 657.8 million shares changing hands, among the lowest totals this year.
Other market indexes, which did not benefit as much from investors' spring obsession with cyclical stocks, also fell this week. The Nasdaq composite index, which gained 51.37, to 2,470.52 yesterday, nevertheless dropped 2 percent of its value this week as Internet-related stocks continued their recent declines. The Nasdaq index is up 12.67 percent so far this year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 20.43, to 1,301.84, yesterday but also lost 2.1 percent for the week. And the Russell 2000 index, which gained 5.76 points, to 438.68 yesterday and which had risen 14 percent the previous two months, fell 2.3 percent this week. Those indexes have gained 5.9 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, since Dec. 31.
"We've had a fairly remarkable run over the last eight months," said Michael Clark, head of United States equity trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. "I always find it a little peculiar when people then try to search for an answer when we're off 5 percent. The market has been very efficient over the last three to four years at backing off when things got a little too far ahead of themselves."
Mr. Clark acknowledged that several factors seemed to be weighing heavily enough on investors that they were not eager to go into the three-day Memorial Day weekend without some hedges against potential losses. Among them is continued uncertainty about the progress of the battles in Yugoslavia, including the possibility of a ground war involving American troops.
In addition, a plentiful supply of new stock offerings has continued to come to market, tipping the balance for some investors to an oversupply of shares and not enough buyers, Mr. Clark said.
The recent declines in the Dow industrials and most other indexes retrace only a portion of recent gains. After rising in 9 of 10 weeks from the end of February through mid-May, the Dow industrial average has fallen in each of the last three weeks. Those declines date to the May 13 announcement that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin would resign and include last week's announcement by the Federal Reserve that it might raise interest rates if it continues to see signs of inflation.
The list of Dow stocks that gained the most this spring almost perfectly matches the list of losers in the last three weeks. Alcoa, for example, rose from $40.50 to $63.875 from Feb. 28 through May 7, a gain of more than 57 percent; in the last three weeks, the shares have fallen back to $55, a 14 percent decline. Shares of Allied Signal, DuPont and Goodyear Tire and Rubber have followed similar trajectories.
Interest rates, which have generally been climbing since the beginning of the year, have risen more sharply in recent weeks. Yesterday, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32 , to 91 29/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell slightly, to 5.82 percent from 5.84 percent on Thursday.
Among the most active stocks on American markets yesterday, Microsoft gained 2 5/16 , to 80 11/16 , making it the single biggest contributor to the day's gain in the S.& P. 500.
Yahoo gained 14 5/8, to 148, with most of the gain coming after the company announced that in completing its purchase of Geocities, it had dismissed about 200 of that company's employees, or 63 percent of the Geocities total. Yahoo will take a $68 million pretax charge in the second quarter related to the acquisition.
Paine Webber, which will become part of the S.& P. 500 index after the close of trading next Friday, rose 2 9/16 , to 47. Paine Webber will replace Bankers Trust, which is being acquired by Deutsche Bank, in the index. The announcement of its addition to the popular index usually bolsters a company's stock price, as buyers and speculators rush to buy the shares in the hope that more buying will come from large investors who track the index.
The hottest stock in American markets continued to be Starmedia, which gained 13 3/8, to 58 7/8, yesterday. Starmedia, an on-line network with content aimed at Spanish and Portuguese speakers in Latin America, completed an initial public offering of seven million shares on Wednesday. The shares, offered at $15, finished the first day at just over $26. On Thursday, the shares gained another 75 percent, to $45.50.

HEADLINE: Tenuous Trickle-Down

BYLINE: By Glenn C. Loury; Glenn C. Loury is an economics professor and director of the Institute on Race and Social Division at Boston University.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Certainly it is good news that the benefits of a vigorous economy have started to trickle down toward young black men in the inner cities. According to a recent study by the economists Richard Freeman and William Rodgers, even black males ages 16 to 24 are working more often, earning better wages and committing fewer crimes than was the case during the recession of the early 1990's.
But before concluding that a booming economy has succeeded where government job training and affirmative action programs have failed, we should recall some elementary facts of economic history. 
 We have been here before. The most recent data, for April 1999, show an unemployment rate of 17.6 percent for black men ages 20 to 24. Believe it or not, this is quite low by historical standards, though the rate for white men of the same age is only 6.2 percent.
Exactly one decade ago, in the boom year of 1989, unemployment among 20- to 24-year-old black men was 17.9 percent, about the same as today. And yet, the onset of the early 1990's recession saw the jobless rate climb steeply for young black men, reaching 24.6 percent during 1992.
There is good reason to think that a similar reversal will happen again once the current expansion ends.
Two laws of economic nature are at work here, neither of which can we safely presume has been repealed. The first holds that, in good times and bad, unemployment among young black men is two to three times as great as it is among whites. The second law is that expansions cannot last forever, and when they end, unemployment rates rise across the board.
The unfortunate reality is that race-based barriers to job access are a seemingly permanent feature of the economy. Sociologists and anthropologists studying labor markets in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles have consistently found young African-Americans to rank behind nonwhite immigrants as well as whites in the urban job queue.
One thing is certain. When Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and his colleagues sit down to gauge whether the risk of renewed inflation requires them to slow an overheating economy, the job prospects of poor urban youth will not weigh heavily in their calculations.
So, with the benefit of a strong economy at hand, now is the time to invest in the education and job skills of the urban poor. And with crime rates at historic lows, we should look for ways to ratchet down the rates of incarceration that have so severely affected urban black men.
By all means, let's celebrate the fruits of our economic success. And let's keep it going as long as we can. But we would do well to remember that even a fast-rising tide won't lift the sunken boats. The only way to keep them afloat is to do the hard work of rebuilding them.

HEADLINE: Rise in Chicago Manufacturing Index Slows

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 28

 BODY:
Manufacturing in the Chicago region expanded at a slower-than-expected pace in May, held down by smaller gains in new orders and production. Prices rose at a more subdued pace in May.
The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said today that its monthly index of regional manufacturing fell to 57.9 in May from 63.3. Analysts expected a reading of 60.1. Index readings above 50 mean the number of manufacturers saying business had improved was greater than the number saying it had deteriorated. 
 The index of prices paid fell to 52.5 from 56.7 in April. That halted five consecutive months of increases in this inflation-related index.
"It doesn't necessarily signal a slowdown," Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson Inc. of Chicago, said before the report. "Two factors led to the big jump in April: increased steel production and increased auto production, which impact the Midwest area dramatically."
The Chicago purchasers index of new orders fell to 59.6 in May from 68.7 in April.
In another report, the Government said personal income rose half a percent in April, up from a gain of three-tenths of a percent in March, and spending rose four-tenths of a percent on top of an increase of half a percent in March. That suggests consumers are not pulling back in the second quarter after the first quarter had the fastest rate of spending in 11 years.
In another report, the University of Michigan said today that its final index of consumer sentiment for May rose to 106.8 from 104.6 in April. The index measuring expectations for future economic growth also rose, to 97.6 from 97.4, suggesting consumers will continue spending.
Backing up that point, the Commerce Department said the formula it used to calculate the savings rate showed that it was a minus seven-tenths of a percent in April, the lowest on record and the same as for the two previous months.
While the Chicago purchasing managers report measures only activity in the Chicago area, investors watch it because in the past it has foreshadowed the National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index, which measures conditions nationwide.
The Chicago manufacturing report follows several recent reports that suggest if the American economy is slowing, it is not doing so by much.
Production at factories, mines and utilities rose a stronger-than-expected six-tenths of a percent in April, the biggest increase since last August, when the General Motors Corporation resumed production after a labor strike.
Rising mortgage rates did not dissuade consumers from buying homes in April, as sales of existing homes rose at a faster-than-expected annual rate of 5.24 million.
Orders for big-ticket factory goods unexpectedly dropped 2.3 percent in April, though the declines reflected falling orders for aircraft and other transportation equipment. There was a 3.5 percent gain in orders for industrial machinery and a 1.3 percent gain in primary metals.

HEADLINE: Clean Cars Get Real;
Makers of Hybrid Vehicles Add Fuel to Electric Mix

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 27

 BODY:
The annual showcase for electric cars, the Tour de Sol race, was so crowded this year that organizers were forced to turn some entrants away. But the crowded field was not so much a result of electric vehicles finally catching on as it was the new emphasis on another class of vehicles invited to join. These cars, known as hybrids, use batteries and electric motors, but also depend on gasoline or diesel engines as well.
In a change that might have horrified the purists who ran in the first race 11 years ago -- when there were only five participants and not all of them could finish the course -- the event was held in conjunction with a conference on hybrid vehicles, organized with the Society of Automotive Engineers. 
 Hybrids are now the subject of intense efforts by almost every leading auto maker. Toyota and Honda even plan to begin selling them from dealer showrooms in this country within the next 12 months.
While electric cars have so far failed to catch on, burdened by high cost and weak performance, a genuine market is about to emerge for clean, peppy hybrids that can go twice as far as a conventional car on a gallon of gasoline.
Bill Van Amburg, a spokesman for Calstart, a private nonprofit group that is trying to develop a clean-vehicle industry, contrasted the choice facing buyers interested in helping clean up the environment: The Toyota Motor Company's Prius, a hybrid already available in Japan and scheduled to go on sale in the United States next year versus the General Motors Corporation's battery-electric model, the EV-1, which is available in California.
"Toyota is selling a hybrid for $16,000 in Japan, a four-seater with an 800-mile range, or you can buy a two-seat EV-1 for $32,000, with a 60-mile range," Mr. Van Amburg said in a telephone interview. "That's an easy choice for most consumers, I think."
As a result, electric car advocates are going through something of a reality check. Nancy Hazard, organizer of the Tour de Sol, told an audience of more than 200 experts gathered here that during the first race 11 years ago, "we debated which electric technologies would be the first to receive market acceptance."
"Hybrids," she said, "were not at the top of the list. They seemed too complex and too costly."
Now, she said, people who have refined electric drivetrains, including motor controllers and charging systems, "need to embrace the hybrid at this point," because it will give them a mass market for their components. "We are on the brink of an automotive revolution," she said.
Electric cars have always been hand-built, often by hobbyists, and expensive. But Toyota is selling 2,000 of its assembly-line-produced Prius model every month in Japan, with a gasoline engine that turns the wheels and charges the batteries for an electric motor, which also turns the wheels. Moreover, when the driver wants to slow down, the motor absorbs energy from the wheels and puts it back into the battery. The car drew plenty of stares running through the streets of Albany.
So did DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s slick-looking Dodge Intrepid ESX 2, with a three-cylinder diesel engine, 133 pounds of lead-acid batteries and an electric motor. Chrysler has not committed itself to selling that car, but has other hybrids in the works, as do nearly all the big manufacturers.
Last month, the Honda Motor Company said it was giving up production of its EV Plus, a battery-powered electric, after selling only a few hundred. But from the same factory in Japan, it plans to build a two-seat, 70-mile-per-gallon hybrid for sale later this year; it hopes to sell 5,000 a year in the United States.
The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, meanwhile, is running six diesel-electric hybrid buses on city streets and is contemplating the purchase of hundreds more, because they seem better suited than straight diesel models for stop-and-go traffic. Plus, they are a lot cleaner; the diesel-electric bus has an engine that runs at a nearly steady state, with none of the moments familiar to every pedestrian near a traffic intersection, when straining diesel engines dump clouds of soot.
Officials of Allison Transmission, a G.M. division that makes one of the buses now in use in the city, told experts at a conference in Indianapolis recently that preliminary tests on that bus, which is equipped with a trap to capture soot, showed no measurable release of the smelly and dirty substance.
The New York agency is "very, very near" to being comfortable enough with the vehicles for a large order, Millard L. Seay, the Transit Authority vice president for buses, said. "We believe hybrids are very close to being a production-available bus," he said.
This is not unalloyed good news for the people who have championed electric vehicles. Among their customers, the small group of affluent environmentalists and "early adopters" who like to have the newest gizmo first, hybrids loom large. Consequently, they are holding off buying electric cars.
"Boy, has it been frustrating," said James D. Worden, president of the Solectria Corporation, a Wilmington, Mass., company that for several years bought Geo Metros, junked their engines, and converted them to electricity. Now the company has a deal with G.M. to buy the cars without engines at substantial cost savings, but the potential buyers, he said, are sitting on their hands waiting for the Toyota and Honda hybrids.
Mr. Worden said Solectria now did as much business selling electric drive-trains for hybrid buses, trucks and cars as selling pure electric cars.
Mr. Worden is a perennial winner of the Tour de Sol, but this year, for the first time, he sent others to drive his company's entries. Instead, he attended the conference on hybrids.
Still, engineers are far from a consensus about the best hybrid design. DaimlerChrysler's have big conventional engines with small electric motors that help on acceleration, giving a modest increase in fuel economy. Their plus is acceleration that resembles that of a sports car. Another design has the gasoline engine run the back wheels and an electric motor turn the front wheels, giving four-wheel-drive as a bonus.
The more experimental models in the race are far more fuel efficient, using big electric motors and small gasoline engines to gradually recharge a battery pack. One entrant, the New Jersey Venturer, used a combination of a hydrogen fuel cell and batteries instead of an engine and batteries. And while the major auto makers are leaning toward diesel, environmentalists -- who comprise the backbone of the racers -- say diesel will never be clean enough.
Cleanliness is a big motivator. California dropped its 1998 requirement that 2 percent of new cars sold in the state should produce zero emissions. But it still has a 10 percent quota on the books for 2003. The California Air Resources Board's chief deputy executive officer, Thomas A. Cackette, told conference attendees that the state would give partial credit toward the electric car quota for hybrids.
But the benefits of hybrids to the environment could be small, warned James A. McCargar, a senior policy adviser at the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
The auto industry, he said, is "caught up in a size-and-performance arms race."
"Will hybrid technology prompt manufacturers to downsize engines and translate that into fuel-efficiency gains," Mr. McCargar said, "or will they use the hybrid technology to get even more performance than we've had in the past?"
The range of options was clear during the race, which is run in stages by managers with clipboards and stopwatches. Organized by the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association, of Greenfield, Mass., with a variety of corporate and government sponsors, race results are available at www.nesea.org.
This year, it was run along a 250-mile route on streets, highways and country roads from Waterbury, Conn., to Lake George, N.Y. Everything from single-seat solar vehicles to two New York City buses, 46 vehicles in all, participated. They competed on many factors, including performance and energy use. Some zoomed, some cruised, but organizers insisted on no speeding beyond the limit.
During the race, high school and college teams rubbed shoulders with corporate entrants. Some vehicles were home built and others were extensively modified production models. All were covered with decals advertising component manufacturers and other sponsors.
Race teams carried conventional car tools but the device of choice for monitoring their vehicles and making last-minute tweaks was the laptop computer, jacked into a port on the dashboard or under the hood.
In the next few years, it could become a more frequent sight in the garages of America.

From Montenegro to the N.B.A., Radojevic Has High Hopes

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA 

 BODY:
There is just one more month left in Aleksandar Radojevic's hurried odyssey to the National Basketball Association -- a month filled with tryouts in one city after another, with four-hour training sessions and with thousands of calories in protein shakes. And the pace of the final push is wearing on the gangly 22-year-old, who did not start playing basketball in his native Montenegro until he was 16, and who did not take the sport seriously until he sprouted to nearly 7 feet by 19.
Now, when the 7-foot-3-inch Radojevic lopes into a room, shoulders hunched, he looks weary. This week alone, Radojevic, with just two years of junior college experience to his credit, has worked out in front of officials of the Knicks and Nets, and there are at least seven more auditions to go, including one this weekend for the Chicago Bulls. 
 But the effort, Radojevic said, is more than worth it, for there is much within his grasp and much to at last put behind him. Radojevic's skills are rated so highly that he is expected to be selected in the first round of the N.B.A. draft June 30, and he may well become the highest-drafted Yugoslav player. And with the riches that will come, Radojevic will be able to pluck his family from a part of the world that is once again convulsed by war.
"His skill level is off the charts," said Leo Papile, the director of scouting for the Boston Celtics. Papile, figuring it to be a thin year for big men, said Radojevic, who weighs 244 pounds, could be one of the first two centers taken. "He has a high basketball I.Q. He can move all the way up to the top half-dozen. He is no secret."
Still, his availability in the draft is a surprise, to Radojevic as much as anyone. As one of the nation's top junior college prospects after averaging 15.4 points and blocking 153 shots last season at Barton County Community College in Kansas, Radojevic had signed a letter of intent to play for Ohio State next season. But on May 11, the National Collegiate Athletic Association ruled that because Radojevic received $13,000 for playing a total of 19 minutes for a Yugoslav club team two years ago, he was ineligible to play at Ohio State.
While speculation had swirled even before the ruling that Radojevic's draft status was climbing so high he would forgo the rest of his college eligibility, Radojevic says he was disappointed by the decision.
"If I was eligible for Ohio State, I wouldn't have entered the draft," Radojevic said. "In your life, you've got your goal. You don't jump from one step to the last step."
Radojevic has taken many steps very quickly over the last several years. He did not give up his first passion, water polo, until he was 16 and stood 6-5. And while the Balkans have long produced outstanding basketball players -- Vlade Divac, Drazen Petrovic and Toni Kukoc -- Radojevic didn't take his prospects seriously until he grew another five inches by the time he was 19.
By then, Semi Pajovic, a family friend and a former Yugoslav national team player who helps other Yugoslavs find places to play in the United States, had sized up Radojevic's potential. For someone who had begun playing the game so late, Radojevic displayed natural gifts.
"He was one tall, big kid," said Pajovic, who lives on Long Island and is the host for Radojevic while he prepares for the draft. "He's unbelievably agile."
And as he advanced, coming to play for a club team, Radojevic managed to avoid being drafted into the military. Montenegro is a republic of Yugoslavia, and Pajovic suspects a sympathetic basketball coach helped Radojevic stay out of the Yugoslav Army until he could go to the United States. The decision to leave, in the end, was simple.
After nearly a decade of war in the Balkans, Montenegro's economy is a shambles. Radojevic's late father was a security guard, and his mother worked in the fields. Together, they earned about $2,400 a year.
Radojevic, who was 20 when he left Montenegro, spoke no English, making junior college his only option. Barton County, one of the nation's premier junior college teams, already had a Yugoslav player who had transferred from Connecticut. That player, Predrag Materic, introduced Steve Forbes, then Barton's coach, to Pajovic. Pajovic told Forbes he wanted to bring a 7-3 player over. Forbes offered Radojevic a scholarship without even having met him.
"He comes walking into this airport in Kansas and says, 'Hello, how are you?' and that's all he could say," Forbes recalled. "We drive to Burger King, and he just pointed to chicken sandwiches and orange juice. You could talk to him and he could understand it, but there was no way he could talk to you.
"He was just a tall, tall skinny kid with a great demeanor. We're having a barbecue and he's out in the backyard chasing my son, who's probably 2, playing cowboys and Indians. I have a picture of him holding my son straight up in the air, and my son is dunking on a 10-foot hoop and Alek is standing flat-footed."
The former St. John's coach Fran Fraschilla was one of the first coaches to see Radojevic in the United States when the center briefly stayed with Pajovic before leaving for Kansas. Now, Fraschilla predicts he will be taken around 15th but won't make an immediate impact because of his slight build.
"I was amazed that a kid that big and that young had such a good skill level," Fraschilla said.
Because of the war in the Balkans, Radojevic has not gone home since coming to the United States, and he stayed in Kansas even when his father died last season. When the N.C.A.A. ruled him ineligible, the draft was the only viable option because a return home would have surely meant being conscripted into the army and perhaps being sent to fight in Kosovo.
"I would probably be the first on the front to be shot," he said, alluding to his height. "Going there would be jeopardizing everything I built here. I'm focusing on something I'm going to be doing for the next 15 years."
The war has left his small hometown on the Adriatic, Herceg Novi, intact, but Radojevic, who learned his now-flawless English from classes and television, worries that the scene of the conflict could shift at any moment. He tries his best to block out reports of bombings, and their attendant misery. As long as his mother keeps assuring him that his family is fine, he said, he will continue to focus on basketball. But as soon as he can after the draft, he will move his mother, his twin brother and sister here.
Where Radojevic will be drafted is still a question. Jeff Bower, the Charlotte Hornets' scouting director, is less certain than Papile of the Celtics. He said Radojevic is still something of an unknown because he has faced only junior college competition, which infrequently features the play of anyone over 6-8.
Radojevic, for his part, does not like to discuss his own talent, saying he will let the scouts decide. There are seven tryouts and a pre-draft camp in Chicago before this last, hectic chapter in his journey ends.
"I never thought it would be this close," he said of his shot at the N.B.A. "My friends told me, 'You're tall, you have to bend over to take your money.' "

Which Side Are We On?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
The indictment of Slobodan Milosevic by the International War Crimes Tribunal told us nothing new about his character or his record. He has been carrying out crimes against humanity since 1991, when his forces leveled the Croatian city of Vukovar and executed 260 men in a Vukovar hospital.
But the indictment does make a difference, a profound one. It clarifies the nature of NATO's war against Mr. Milosevic over Kosovo. And it requires those who have been critical of that war to think again about which side they are on. 
 Just as Mr. Milosevic is the first serving head of state to be charged with war crimes, so this war is a first. The reason was eloquently stated by President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic last month in a speech to the Canadian Parliament, reprinted in The New York Review of Books.
"This is probably the first war that has not been waged in the name of 'national interests,' " President Havel said, "but rather in the name of principles and values. . . .
"Kosovo has no oilfields to be coveted; no member nation in the alliance NATO has any territorial demands on Kosovo. . . . It is fighting out of concern for the fate of others. It is fighting because no decent person can stand by and watch the systematic state-directed murder of other people."
NATO air attacks have killed Serbian civilians. That is regrettable. But it is a price that has to be paid when a nation falls in behind a criminal leader. It happened in Germany. And it has happened again in Serbia.
How can a young man, a Serbian paramilitary, demand money from an Albanian family for a child's life -- and, when they have none to give, knife the child? That, and other savageries, could take place only because an evil leader had infected his people with the notion that others are less human -- are untermenschen.
Even Serbs distant from the atrocities have been affected. Reports from Belgrade say most people see themselves as victims. They are oblivious to what Serbian forces have done to other human beings over the last eight years -- oblivious to Vukovar, to the rape camps and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, to the massacres in Kosovo.
In 1992 the Serbian commander in Bosnia, Ratko Mladic, told his gunners in the hills around Sarajevo, "Burn it all." And they did: hospitals, universities, mosques, homes. That should be remembered when Serbs today describe themselves as victims.
That NATO's purpose is just does not, of course, mean that it has fought the war wisely. It has not. Serious military analysts are agreed that the alliance should not have forsworn the use of ground troops at the start of its campaign, and should not have begun the air war so tepidly.
Nor was the war inevitable. American diplomacy went in fits and starts before the final crisis, seeming to lose its way in dealing with Mr. Milosevic's broken promises on Kosovo. In the critical months beginning in January 1998 President Clinton was persistently distracted by a special prosecutor obsessed by sex. And Mr. Milosevic well knew that.
But we are in the war now, and for the most urgent political as well as moral reasons we must win. Even achieving NATO's declared objectives in Kosovo will not necessarily end the menace of Slobodan Milosevic. Unless he is captured, he will no doubt make more trouble in Montenegro and elsewhere. But victory, limited though it be, is essential.
The indictment of Mr. Milosevic may change the politics of the war in this country. Many Republicans have tried to use the war politically. That was the strategy of Representative Tom DeLay, the G.O.P. whip, when a motion to support the war came before the House. He urged Republicans to vote no, making it Bill Clinton's war -- an astonishing position for a party that usually touts its patriotism. The motion lost on a tie vote.
The President should go to the country now, on the strength of the Milosevic indictment, to tell people what this war is about. He needs stronger public support as a moment of truth approaches.
A summit meeting of the seven leading economic powers and Russia will be held in Cologne on June 18. If the air war has not brought Mr. Milosevic to accept NATO's demands by then, the prospect of winter means that the unthinkable will have to be confronted: a ground war.

Consumer Spending in April Adds 0.4% to March Rise
Consumer spending on goods and services rose four-tenths of a percent in April on top of an increase of half a percent in March, the Commerce Department reported. And, personal income rose half a percent in April, up from a gain of three-tenths of a percent in March. 
 In another report, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of regional manufacturing fell to 57.9 in May from 63.3. Analysts expected a reading of 60.1. Index readings above 50 mean the number of manufacturers saying business had improved was greater than the number saying it had deteriorated. Page C15.
 
NEC Lost $1.3 Billion in Fiscal Year
NEC, one of the world's largest makers of semiconductors, lost 157.9 billion yen, or $1.3 billion at current exchange rates, in the fiscal year that ended March 31, compared with a profit of 41.3 billion yen the year before. C2.
 
Hackers Disrupt 2 U.S. Web Sites
Hackers disrupted the Internet sites of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Senate this week, forcing them to shut down. The sites serve a public relations function, so no classified, confidential or personal material was compromised. A1.
 
KPMG Accused in Medicare Lawsuit
The accounting firm KPMG was accused in a Federal whistle-blower lawsuit unsealed yesterday of aiding some hospitals in Florida in a scheme to defraud Medicare through the use of bogus expense claims. C5.
 
A Pact With Sweepstakes Promoter
American Family Publishers, one of the two largest sweepstakes promotion companies, agreed to changes in its practices. It also agreed to a $4 million settlement with four states that accused it of deception. A9.
 
Italian Banks Find Mergers Difficult
Italian banks, like those across Europe, are struggling to merge, to cut costs and create the larger capital bases they will need to finance customers on the euro market. Yet recent efforts have failed. Earlier this month, Banca Commerciale Italiana, the No. 4 bank in Italy, rejected a $14 billion takeover offer from Unicredito Italiano, the No. 3 bank, after having concluded that the nation's central bank would block the bid. It did so because the central bank's president, Antonio Fazio, said he would not approve hostile bids for banks. C2.
 
A Microsoft Defender Is Questioned
Gordon Eubanks, a longtime software developer, was questioned by the Justice Department's chief trial lawyer in the Government's antitrust suit against Microsoft about whether he had benefited as a result of his decision to defend the software publisher and to testify in its behalf. The Microsoft trial is expected to resume Tuesday in Washington. C5.

To the Editor:
Re "Thin Support and Red Tape Mar New York City Development Zone" (front page, May 24): I am president of a small South Bronx apparel manufacturing company that grew out of a defunct contract shop, developed a designer line and now sells to 700 retailers. 
 Having mortgaged ourselves to the hilt and maxed out our credit cards, my associates and I needed financial assistance to take advantage of our fast growth, which had in turn created badly needed jobs. We had numerous promising-sounding meetings with South Bronx development people, Bronx Borough President people, city economic development people, industrial assistance people, New York State people and people from banks supposedly ready to assist development zone companies.
In the end it boiled down to the usual bank credit criteria: if you have enough money not to need us, we will gladly lend to you, but if you don't, forget it. The entire process was a waste of time.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his criticism of John Gray's "False Dawn" (April 25), Fareed Zakaria dazzles us with handpicked statistics while ignoring the bigger picture. Missing are the glaring reminders of economic imperialism. 
 Yes, we've controlled infectious diseases with modern medicine, but we're replacing them with chronic degenerative diseases of polluted air, water and soil. Subsistence farmers are not commuting to filthy, overcrowded, crime-ridden cities for the good life, but they are trying to survive the intrusion of modern agribusiness and its pressure on global prices for crops.
In the long run, the most insidious damage to poorer countries may come from stealing their human resources. Congress recently passed a rider making the issuance of permanent visas for high-tech workers more expedient. We should be training high-tech people in other countries. Instead, the "free global market" is taking away their best minds.

Away Games
 The Life and Times
 of a Latin Baseball Player.
 By Marcos Breton
 and Jose Luis Villegas.
 Illustrated. 272 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $23. 
 ON rutted baseball diamonds in the shantytowns of the Dominican Republic, burros graze in the outfield and lithe little boys fight to stand in the stretches of dust between second and third base. That is the shortstop's territory. Over the past 20 years, an unusual number of Dominicans have eluded the sugar cane fields, the textile mills and the enervating poverty of their small Caribbean island by coming north to the United States to play shortstop in the major leagues. Yet for every Alfredo Griffin or Julio Franco or Tony Fernandez who makes it to las grandes ligas, there are tens of thousands who will fail, who will end up like men Marcos Breton and Jose Luis Villegas describe in their book "Away Games": "half-drunk, unemployed," bragging about "how good they once were."
"Away Games" is the story of one of the nominally lucky ones. Miguel Tejada grew up in Los Barrancones, a barrio outside the city of Bani. By the time he was 13, his mother had died and he had long since quit school to shine shoes. At day's end he came home to a shack where the toilet was a hole in the ground, the wall to his room was a soiled curtain and his bed was a mattress with such a large hole in the center that he was completely obscured while he slept. But Tejada had natural riches. His legs were sturdy, his wiry body could propel a baseball bat with stunning aggression, and his will was strong, too. Soon baseball men began to notice him.
From this point, "Away Games" becomes the breathless story of Tejada's rise from life as a wild kid from a defeated place to a poised, acrobatic athlete. There are a series of wonderful, almost filmic scenes, including the practice sessions he attends run by a local sandlot youth coach, Enrique Soto, who imposes discipline upon his young charges by shrugging when they misbehave and saying: "To hell with you. I'll see you out begging on the street." Tejada attracts the attention of the Oakland Athletics and is sent to their baseball development complex in the Dominican jungle.
Eventually he shows enough promise to receive a minor league contract. Breton and Villegas consider Tejada to be a person of rare character, and we hope for him as he learns English (and how to use a toilet), suffers injuries, avoids seductive women, adjusts to minor league towns like Medford, Ore., and Modesto, Calif., and meets up with young American ballplayers, including Ben Grieve, an outfielder who was the Athletics' top prospect. At the end of a season, Grieve and Tejada are talking about how it will be to spend the winter as incipient baseball stars. "You know, when I go home, I'm going to have all these people asking me for balls or autographs," Grieve complains.
"Yeah," Tejada replies, "but Ben, when I go home, I'm going to have all these people saying, 'Miguel, can I have some money? Miguel, can I have some shoes? Miguel, can I have some food?' "
As long as "Away Games" concentrates on Tejada, it is truly engrossing. But Breton, a senior writer at The Sacramento Bee, and Villegas, a photographer at the same newspaper, have broader ambitions. They also want to use Tejada's story as a means of reflecting upon the more general plight of Latin ballplayers in the United States. It's a worthy subject, an important and, in many ways, bitter story. Generations of Latin ballplayers have left behind unspeakable poverty and arrived in this country only to be subjected to racism and exploitation. To this day, teams like the Athletics save money by filling out their minor league rosters with young Dominicans who can be had for a meager wage that a young American would never accept. (Tejada signed for $2,000. The average American signing bonus is $50,000.) It's a throw-back-the-little-ones approach; within a year or two, most of these players have either been shipped back to the Dominican or, if they manage to escape their handlers, are roaming the streets of cities like New York as illegal immigrants.
Unfortunately, Breton and Villegas make very little effort to weave this broader story into Tejada's particular narrative, with the result that the book sputters and drags every time the protagonist leaves the scene. And, alas, he sometimes vanishes for entire chapters or more. Breton and Villegas's prose is potholed with cliches ("pint-sized," "blank slate," "broke the mold"), with peculiar images -- what is a "blistering rain"? -- and with wooden sentences. These can be ignored when we're absorbed in all the fascinating things they have to tell us about Tejada. On a tangent, they are less tolerable.
It's a familiar story in many ways, the intersection of poverty, athletics and capitalism. "Away Games," like its subject, Miguel Tejada, is very raw. Still, it's not exactly a missed opportunity. For, like Tejada as well, it's also powerful and, at times, it really moves.

HEADLINE: The Next Clinton

BYLINE: By James Bennet; James Bennet, until recently a Times White House correspondent, is a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
On the windy Friday in February that the Senate acquitted her husband of perjury and obstruction of justice, Hillary Rodham Clinton turned her attention to her life after his Presidency. From before the first vote that day until long after the last, she met with her friend Harold Ickes on the second floor of the White House, in the family quarters, to weigh whether for the first time to promote herself rather than Bill Clinton for public office. Hillary Clinton felt flattered that Democrats were begging her to run for the Senate from New York, an idea she had laughed off when Representative Charles Rangel, the mischievous Manhattan Democrat, first suggested it in a Chicago church last October. She was delighted with the shift under way in her public image, from passive victim to political heavyweight. After all her policy work and speechifying, it had galled her to watch her popularity spike upward in the past year as she turned her lapidary smile to the world and suffered through the revelations of her husband's affair with that woman.
Now, for four hours, as she and Ickes -- a scarred veteran of New York politics and a former aide to her husband -- moved from the living room to lunch in the family dining room and back to the living room, she plumbed the risks of a race for the Senate seat that Daniel Patrick Moynihan had decided to vacate.Would she really want to be one of a hundred Senators? Could she survive a street fight with a nasty opponent? Could she stand the pawing of New York City's feral reporters?
The backing and forthing with Ickes had fitting precedent. Half a century ago, a woman Clinton regards as a role model, Eleanor Roosevelt, mulled running for the Senate from New York at the prompting of a former adviser to her husband. He was also named Harold Ickes; he was the father of Hillary Clinton's friend. But like so many parallels between the century's two most compelling first ladies, this one illuminates as many differences as similarities. Hillary had summoned her Harold, while Eleanor was importuned by hers. Pulled between her lofty aims and her cautious nature, Hillary was embarking on months of painstaking cogitation -- at the White House, on a trip through North Africa and in visits to New York. Eleanor almost immediately turned her Harold down.
"I feel very strongly that running for office is not the way in which I can be most useful," she wrote him on May 26, 1945, just days after he raised the idea. She did not want to burden her children with another office-holding parent. She also did not want to burden herself with having to follow what she called "the party line."
"I hope to continue to work with the Democrats and for them," Eleanor continued briskly, "but I think the knowledge that I will be free of any obligation may at times be very healthy."
Free of any obligation. It is an expression lustrous with meaning for political spouses, and particularly for First Ladies of the United States. Since Martha Washington likened herself to a state prisoner, First Ladies have felt oppressed by arranging flowers or delivering speeches, by wielding influence or not enough of it, by the private compromises and the planetary humiliations. Eleanor Roosevelt feared continued limitation in winning office for herself. Hillary Clinton glimpses freedom, or so her friends and advisers say -- freedom to participate in politics fully, with her own constituents, on her own terms, for her own purposes.
Hillary Clinton is about to become a liberated woman. Come January 2001, for the first time since she moved to Arkansas as a 26-year-old lawyer in 1974, she will be able to walk her own path regardless of her husband's political career. While most people provided such an opening might be fantasizing about anonymity and a long break, Clinton is methodically exploring her options for staying in the spotlight. If she does not pull out of the New York race in the next couple of weeks, she is likely to announce an exploratory committee in July, knowing that that will be regarded as throwing her hat in the ring. With that announcement, the Clintons would neatly reverse roles, at least regarding New York: she would step forward to present herself as a leader, while he would be relegated to behind-the-scenes, supporting chores.
Yet when I asked Hillary Clinton earlier this month how it felt to weigh a career decision without having to consider her husband's political prospects, she started talking not about herself but about him and her role as supportive spouse. "It has been such a part of our life together for the 28 years we've known each other," she said. Slowing down, she reverted to choosing her words like tomatoes in a shabby supermarket. "And I've been very glad to be part of his particular political aspirations, because I've thought they've represented larger goals that he and I and many other people shared."
She mused that she had never "known him when he wasn't very interested in elected political life," and then made the kind of gentle joke at his expense that she loves. "We'll just have to see how that -- how that works," she said, her words blending into her raucous laugh. "You know, I'd be interested in what the odds are about how long it'll take before he runs for something else!"
I had met her minutes before in the third-floor solarium, a glassed-in den on the south side of the White House. Here, a veneer of family life spreads over the stolid symbol of Presidential authority. The walls leading to the solarium are tiled with framed pictures of the Clintons at work and at play -- lounging together in an Arkansas hammock, gathered at a picnic table with Chelsea. On the coffee table sat a dog-eared box of the word game Boggle. But there were reminders everywhere of the weirdness of this life. A family's collection of Russian nesting dolls -- near its collection of Beanie Babies -- does not usually include dolls of the family itself, alongside the Reagans and Bushes. The view outside the windows, over the pink geraniums on the terrace, is not usually of the top of the Washington Monument. The glass is not usually thick enough to be slightly distorting.
"I haven't been outside in sooo long," Clinton said, compressing her lips in a mock pout, as she asked if we might talk on the terrace. There, she spoke about growing tomatoes and peppers in pots aIt's very hard, I've found, to get good, fresh tomatoes, 'cause I don't get to go to farm stands or anything" -- after she politely asked a steward to wipe off her patio chair to avoid dirtying her robin's-egg blue suit. She requested a glass of iced tea along with her Diet Coke, to get what she called "a double load of caffeine."
I tried again: But what will this change mean for her, as she thinks about what she wants to do?
"But I've always thought about what I want to do," she said. And then she started talking about her husband again, and the library he is building in Arkansas. "We will continue to work together on issues and causes that we share in common, and the library, which I hope will be a vital and dynamic place for exploring public service in the future."
Again: How about the prospect of having her own constituents and platform? She talked about her work as a lawyer, and then made with the husband one more time. "I've chaired the commissions that my husband asked me to chair. I've been actively involved in politics both on behalf of him and on behalf of so many others."
For years we have heard about the two Hillary Clintons, the self-sufficient crusader and the stand-by-her man helpmate. For Washington insiders, as for many Americans elsewhere, the assumption has long been that the latter is a facade, a painted nesting doll within which the real Hillary smolders. That assumption has always been lazy, and it has usually been wrong. Hillary Clinton is both, but she has been more at ease, and most effective, in the helpmate role -- watching his back, stiffening his spine, advocating their policies and defending their record. And after years of playing the part, she has become, de facto, a pretty traditional wife by modern standards, although she does not like to think of herself that way any more than her conservative critics do. Now, even as she was drawn to the idea of disentangling her political career from her husband's, she was struggling with whether she could put herself on the line, as he has done so many times.
Once more I tried: Isn't it at least "different" to contemplate having your own direct constituents? "It is," she conceded at last, nodding, perhaps out of pity. Then she adopted the second person, distancing herself even as she identified the difference she would feel. "Because you would be the person with ultimate responsibility and authority."
After years of counseling her husband and others to run for office and urging young people to have faith in the political system, she said, "I'm trying to listen to my own advice." The firestorm over her husband's affair and impeachment would not deter her from running, she insisted. "Last year was a painful time, for not only my family but my country," she said. Speaking now in the solarium after a spring storm chased us inside, she came as close as she would to discussing the humiliation that finally made her a hero to many Americans. "But I feel, you know, that we all, we all got through that."
There would be a Rip Van Winkle quality to Clinton's Senate campaign. Since she graduated from Yale Law School and opted for Bill Clinton and Arkansas, it has become unremarkable for women to compete for higher office. As she pondered the Senate race, Clinton was standing in the way of another woman, Representative Nita Lowey of Westchester County, and an older but far less traditional political spouse, Elizabeth Dole, was running for President. Clinton's race would be path-breaking, but only because she would be undertaking it while her husband was still in office. In that sense, it would certainly be pioneering for Clinton and for First Ladies, but not for women generally. She is too late for that.
But so what? Clinton did not sacrifice her ambition to her husband's so much as yoke them together. As a result of that decision, it has been her fate to be judged more for how she has stood by her man than for what she has accomplished with him and more for what she represents as a woman than for what she has done as First Lady. As it happens, she has done quite a bit. And the flip side of the loyal role she has played is that she regards his accomplishments as hers too. When she was saving his Presidency last year -- condemning unnamed conspirators and then sticking with him after he admitted they were right about his affair -- she was also saving her own.
As much as Bill Clinton has pursued his own ends at his wife's expense, he has depended on her to achieve power, keep it and figure out how to use it. As much as Hillary Clinton has sought out ways to express her independence, she has depended on him for her influence and served as his assistant. She left it to her husband to run, but she has always known what she wanted the two of them to do with his offices. Anyone who expects a new Hillary Clinton to burst from her White House cocoon has not studied her record or her relationship.
Aides and friends of the Clintons are consistent in listing their relative strengths and weaknesses. Both love politics and policy, but he is more fascinated by the former and she by the latter. His is the superior mind; hers, the superior work ethic. He looks for compromise; she cements his resolve -- sometimes, as in the Whitewater investigation, disastrously. Both like to talk, but she also listens. He is quick to forgive his antagonists; she, as one of their friends put it, "keeps the book." He searches to concede what is right in an opponent's position to win a larger argument; she -- the professional attorney her husband never was -- sees the world in black and white. Hillary Clinton's politics require villains, be they the entrenched interests of Washington, the insurance companies or right-wing conspirators. In that respect, she is like the lawyer she may run against, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York.
The President's temper scares their advisers, but hers -- like a blowtorch, in the words of one -- terrifies them. While Bill Clinton is the warm one in public, he is often aloof in private; Hillary Clinton can seem chilly in public, but she remembers birthdays, sends gifts to spouses, asks after ailing parents. On that Friday in February, after the acquittal votes and her own meeting with Ickes, it was Hillary Clinton who turned up in the West Wing with an immense box of Valentine's Day chocolates for the staff. "Thank you, Mrs. Clinton," said Doug Sosnik, the President's senior adviser, as he thought back to his miserable year and declined. "I want to save my room for tequila." Clinton looked startled for a moment, Sosnik recalled, and then broke into an ear-to-ear grin. "That's a good idea!" she said.
It is perhaps cruel to compare any politician to Bill Clinton, but that is the burden of his wife no less than Al Gore. And she does not have his ability to read a crowd or his joy for burrowing into one until his hands ache. That said, Hillary Clinton is operating under the presumption that she will run for the Senate, and she is looking for a house in Westchester County. Her goals remain rather vague, but her ambition for service and confidence in herself remain intact and vaulting. It is just that Bill Clinton is no longer the best vehicle.
But that does not mean that she will run, and that points up another difference between the Clintons. When it comes to politics, he works from the gut as well as from his beloved polls, while she is more cerebral. The risks and challenges of a race excite him. They scare her. This is a defining life decision for her, perhaps the biggest she has made since her marriage, and in the end she may decide not to gamble her popularity and political clout.
She does not want to lose. Horse-race polls don't mean much now, but the ones that showed her running away with victory have been replaced by others showing at best that she might squeak by Giuliani. And some of her advisers are more worried about a possible challenge from Representative Rick Lazio, the Long Island Republican, or even Gov. George Pataki. "One of the lures of being Senator is you're out on your own," one of her advisers told me. "One of the liabilities is you lose on your own."
Hillary Clinton believes in the power of stories. She builds her speeches around anecdotes -- One single story can pierce through and make it clear that we are all in the same story," she said at the United Nations in March -- and she also believes that politicians can build and maintain support by constructing running stories about themselves and their policies. During the early days of Bill Clinton's first term, she urged his aides to think in terms of a "story" or "journey" for the Administration. "Her vision of the journey was that these guys are solid, idealistic Democrats who are coming in to take on entrenched special interests for the sake of the common good," recalls George Stephanopoulos, the former Clinton aide.
But that narrative, if ever real, was rudely elbowed aside by others: Whitewater, the health care debacle, the Gingrich revolution, Monica. For New York liberals, however, Hillary Clinton still embodies the idealism of '92. The adoring women -- and men -- who flock to her speeches talk less about what she has accomplished than what they are convinced she is capable of doing. And they talk not at all about how essentially Clintonian she is; they simply don't believe that. You sense, talking with them, that she has not yet proved to be the role model they want -- as Senator Chuck Schumer put it, "sort of a latter-day Eleanor Roosevelt."
"I think she has the potential, I really do," said Jennifer Ballard, a graduate student. "Given the opportunity, she would make many changes. She hasn't really been given the opportunity yet. I don't think she's had the ability to do what she'd like to do, and that young women like me would like to see her do."
It was late April, and Ballard, 25, was musing about her hopes for Clinton at the back of a Columbia Teachers College auditorium, a packed room with folding wood chairs polished by generations of restless students. On the first day of a two-day swing through New York, Clinton was stopping by to talk about education, an issue she expects to be a winner for her should she run.
Clinton was here on the taxpayer dime and officially on First Lady business, though her advisers privately acknowledged that she was testing the waters. By now, the idea of running for Senate had grown on her, to the amazement of senior White House officials who scoffed at the notion when it surfaced. After Moynihan announced on Nov. 6 that he would not run again, Rangel, who had previously joked with her about a race, called Clinton to press the issue -- and to his surprise, was met with a flurry of questions about how much support she would get. Rangel thinks that Clinton was already weighing the idea. But her advisers insist that she did not start thinking seriously about it until Senator Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, to her annoyance, told Tim Russert of NBC one Sunday in early January that she would probably run, wishing to make it so. She was astonished by the furor in the news media and called Ickes the next day for advice.
Was she prepared to issue a "Sherman-esque" denial of any interest in running? Ickes asked. She wasn't. Then don't say anything, he said. With the impeachment trial under way, no one would expect her to give an answer immediately.
But with the trial over and her husband rescued -- again -- she wanted to start thinking about her future. New York Democrats, desperate to hold onto Moynihan's seat, were clamoring for her. New York had a residency "requirement" so lax that it was more of a suggestion, and it had a tradition of embracing celebrity carpetbaggers. The President was entranced with the idea. Particularly after last year, his friends say, Clinton wanted to do anything he could to elect her, if only in hopes of getting out of the doghouse.
On this day at Columbia, Clinton sat on stage as dozens of uniformed first and second graders serenaded her. Bill Clinton is the master of this kind of event, able to take a staged piece of political theater and find a human connection to make it real, or to make it seem real. And no one has studied Bill Clinton like his wife. She rose as the children filed off, walking to stage right to pat their shoulders as they went by. One tiny girl paused and rested her head against the First Lady's waist, throwing her arms around her as Clinton, beaming, bent to reciprocate. The girl's skinny white sleeves formed a bright line around Clinton's chocolate-brown suit. And now every girl was stopping for a hug, some going on tiptoe and turning their smiling faces up to be kissed, as the audience laughed and clapped and the cameras drank it in. It was hard, and rather amusing, to imagine Rudy Giuliani trying to pull this off.
Clinton's speech was also calibrated to give the reporters what they needed. The money line was buried pretty deep -- 48 minutes into a 52-minute address -- but it was obvious enough that every idle pen began to scribble. "We need to fix our public schools, not abandon them," Clinton said as she decried the vouchers to subsidize private education that Giuliani has adopted as a cherished cause. Her position gave the news stories an edge.
Not much of an edge, though. Clinton would really have made news if she had said she supported vouchers, since Bill Clinton opposes them. It is impossible to find a single issue on which she and her husband disagree, and if cracks appear during a race, they are more likely to be over matters of pothole politics than high principle. (For example, Schumer has protested that the President's budget plan would cut $400 million in Medicare payments to New York hospitals over five years.)
In our conversation, Clinton said she would have no problem contradicting her husband. "If I were to do this race, I would feel very strongly that I owed my first duty to the people of New York, whom I would be asking to trust me and support me," she said.
As most of her Columbia speech showed, however, running would bind her further to the President overall. It is his record she would campaign on. As she recounted for the students her credentials as an education reformer, she described going door to door for the Children's Defense Fund to determine why so many children were not enrolled in school.
But someone else kept entering the picture. She recalled how "my husband asked me to chair a committee in Arkansas aimed at improving the educational system there" and how that committee succeeded "because of the hard work of a lot of people and the leadership that my husband gave." She moved on to the White House years, as she lauded "the President's, and certainly the Administration's, proudest achievements." And when it came time to look ahead, she declared, "The President has laid out a bold strategy for the future."
But, tentatively, she stepped out on her own as she turned to early child development, a subject she has labored, often behind the scenes, to keep on her husband's agenda. She talked about the need for "better preschool opportunities." Then she stopped talking about what the President wants, what the Administration wants or even what "we" want, and said, "That is why I have supported increased Federal support for programs such as home visiting, for Head Start, for child care, for early Head Start."
A First Lady's support for her husband's policies is assumed. Here, Clinton was presenting herself as an independent voice on policy in the Administration, an image she had tried to avoid since the disaster of her health care proposal. And then she went further, saying that the Administration had not accomplished enough. "I'm pleased that we've made some progress," she said, "but we still have a long way to go."
Clinton's record in her husband's office is clearest where it is least relevant to the voters who might elect her. Far more than in the United States, Hillary Clinton has found her own voice overseas. Abroad, she conducts a sort of shadow Presidency, with advisers borrowed from assorted agencies and an aging 707 whose port engine periodically bursts into flames. She does it with what amounts to her own foreign policy, promoting issues of women's rights, health care and development that her husband addresses rarely, and almost always with her at his side. In her speeches abroad, she seldom even mentions the President, not wanting to muddy her message of female empowerment by acknowledging that her influence derives from his power.
Yet Clinton's passion for that role could be a problem in New York, where it plays into what her advisers view as her chief liability: the suspicion that she would have her eye on concerns far from Binghamton or the Bronx. It has probably not helped her that in her remarks about a possible race, she has tended to dwell on why New York is big enough for her, rather than vice versa. "New York is truly a microcosm of America," she recently told reporters in Manhattan. Chuck Schumer has advised Clinton that if she decides to run, she will have to devote herself completely to the race. "You can't be both First Lady and candidate," he says.
Clinton has spent more days this year in North Africa than in New York. I went along with her to North Africa earlier this spring and stood nearby in a Moroccan village called Tasselmante as, calling across an empty chicken coop, she questioned one of the locals: "How many chickens do you have?" Ten. "And they are healthier than your chickens used to be?" Clinton inquired.
Yes, the woman said through an interpreter, crediting the coop. A nonprofit group, the Near East Foundation, has been promoting its use among the village women. Clinton's solo international trips -- to Africa, Asia, the former Soviet republics, Latin America -- seldom generate much attention in the United States, but they are front-page news in the nations she visits. Knowing that, Clinton aims her spotlight at programs that are giving women power, attempting a very gentle advocacy-by-exhibit.
To the chicken farmer's left stood a woman showcasing a new clay oven favored by the nonprofit. Clinton also viewed the village's biggest improvement, a system of potable water courtesy of the Japanese Government. It was driven by a diesel engine, which coughed loudly to life as its tender, a village man, turned its key to demonstrate. "That's huge," Clinton exclaimed when told that 36 homes now had running water.
New York has a rich tradition of internationally minded leaders, and for some voters Clinton's work abroad has great appeal. But those are people who would vote for her anyway. Among swing voters she hopes to woo, particularly in the suburbs, globe-trotting even in a worthy cause may not go over well. It is almost as if they want to pick a state senator rather than a United States senator, said one of her advisers, who has viewed union polling data on the state. "They're not looking for a Jacob Javits or even a Pat Moynihan," this adviser told me. "They want someone who's going to come talk to them about their school system in Syosset or Bayside."
Clinton has recently been drawing connections between her foreign travels and New Yorkers' lives, but some of her efforts have shown the strain. A few weeks after her trip to North Africa, she condensed her visit to Tasselmante into the kind of story she loves, one with an unmistakable lesson for the women's organization she was addressing in Woodbury, Long Island. In her telling of the tale, the village women became considerably more self-sufficient than they actually were.
"As they walked me through this village that was in the desert, I was being proudly shown how for the first time because the women came together they had potable water," Clinton recalled, without mentioning the Japanese diesel or the man who held the key.
Before reaching Woodbury on that rainy spring day, Clinton told another story. Speaking to a symposium on health care at Hofstra University, Clinton took as her text the need to restore trust in the health care system; her subtext was that she could be trusted to help do it.
After noting that 43 million Americans lack health insurance -- including 3.1 million in New York alone" -- Clinton dragged the subtext to the surface with a rare acknowledgment of failure. "Some of you may recall that I had an idea or two about this topic back in 1993," she began, as a chuckle ran through the darkened hall. "Now clearly that approach did not work, and we're not going to try that again, rest assured." But though she was discouraged, she said, she learned, and she could not give up.
Clinton's voice softened, and she sounded almost humble. "So I come from the school of smaller steps now, the belief that making smaller changes, incremental changes that will help some people, is better than walking away" -- her voice rose in mockery and her hands came off the lectern as she spread her arms wide -- and saying it's an insoluble problem and there's nothing we can do about it."
That is the story that Clinton's advisers believe she can use to convert the health care disaster into a selling point for a Senate race. It is about a woman who may have overstepped, but who did so because she cared so much about uninsured Americans. And while she has never stopped caring, she has learned her lesson about means. Sound familiar? You may recall that Bill Clinton has more than a few times presented himself as chastened and improved by failure.
The health care story is largely true, though it elides the shock Hillary Clinton felt over the implosion of her plan. And it highlights only one lesson she learned, by attributing the outcome to how she handled health care reform rather than the fact that she handled it at all. Eleanor Roosevelt learned that lesson when she tried to serve in the Office of Civilian Defense. "I could not take a Government position, even without salary or paid expenses," she wrote later, "without giving ample opportunity for faultfinding to some members of the opposition in Congress and even to some of our own party people who disagreed with certain policies."
To her dismay, Clinton came to believe that too. She concluded that the national press and the Washington political establishment were less accepting of an open role for her as her husband's adviser and advocate than their counterparts in Arkansas had been. In taking on health care, she had wanted to present herself as a nontraditional First Lady who wielded her influence in the open, not behind the scenes. She loved to be in the thick of policy debate, but she also saw herself as candidly serving her husband's interests. Literally, she thought of herself as acting as a lawyer for her client. And she failed him.
"I think it had a fundamental effect on their relationship," one of Hillary's friends says. "She was like his good luck charm, and suddenly she wasn't good luck. And that was the role Dick played."
Dick Morris, of course. Hillary Clinton reached out to Morris to salvage her husband's career after the 1994 elections, just as she had after he lost the governorship of Arkansas in 1980. Among Morris's first tasks the second time was to deliver some delicate news to the President about his wife.
In his first polling for Clinton in late 1994, Morris recalls, he discovered that two-thirds of voters did not like aspects of him. They divided into two groups: the first group found him immoral; the other found him wishy-washy. That second group viewed Hillary Clinton as tremendously powerful. "In effect, they believed that she was Example A of how weak he was," Morris says, "and that their marriage was a zero-sum game, where the 100 points of power would be divided 60-40, 70-30, 50-50. But they didn't understand the idea that in a strong marriage between two strong people, their strength augments one another rather than robs one another. They just saw it as who wears the pants in the family."
Morris showed the President the data and argued that voters wanted his wife to be not a policy maker but an advocate. The more she was seen in that role, Morris says he told the President, the less people would suspect she was privately running the show.
First Advocate is essentially the path Hillary Clinton took. Although she was a key strategist throughout the 1992 campaign, she withdrew from the President's weekly political meetings during 1996. Like others in the White House, Leon Panetta, the chief of staff from 1994 to early 1997, concluded that she was going directly to the top, since the President would sometimes refer to his wife's thinking. Some senior White House officials in the second term could not recall being in a single policy discussion with her.
"I continued to work on all the issues I'd always worked on, including health care," Hillary Clinton told me. "But I did not assume an additional title and a specific responsibility for an overall policy as I had before."
To her, the shift in role made no sense, if what the public and pundits cared about was her accountability. When she was running the health care initiative, everyone knew what she was up to. Now, it seemed to her, nobody did.
Invoking Eleanor Roosevelt's example, Morris urged Clinton to begin writing a weekly newspaper column, and she did. (Morris always used Eleanor to try to get Hillary to do what he wanted.) She also began writing a book.
When it was published in 1996, while her husband was preoccupied with getting re-elected, "It Takes a Village" was viewed as a political makeover. For good reason. Clinton presents a gloriously sunny view of their family life and dwells on her role as a mother. But for all the image-polishing, it is a strikingly candid book, a manifesto that presents Clinton's worldview.
"Everywhere we look, children are under assault." That apocalyptic opinion is at the heart of "It Takes A Village," and it is the animating belief behind most of her public work. It helps explain what is often seen as paradoxical and even hypocritical in Hillary Clinton: her peculiar blend of big-government liberalism and family-values traditionalism. Clinton scorns "casual attitudes about divorce" and suggests a mandatory "cooling off" period with "education and counseling for partners." She writes that children should postpone sex until after 21 and that parents should "reassert adult authority" and also push prayer at home. And she argues that "every society requires a critical mass of families that fit the traditional ideal." Those views are quite sincere for Clinton, who was reared in a cozy Chicago suburb, never rejected the Methodism she learned at Sunday school and passed on to her daughter and never rebelled against parents she adored.
The book displays Clinton's liberal and interventionist impulses just as openly. She does not retreat from the willingness, even eagerness, to exert control that she displayed in drafting her 1,364-page health care proposal. She tells readers everything from what type of baby mattress to buy (firm and flat) to how much they should eat ("a sensible meat serving, for example, is about the size of a deck of cards"). She advocates universal health care and gun control, complains about the content of television news and violent video games, bemoans income inequality and approvingly quotes Alan Ehrenhalt's view that "the unfettered free market has been the most radically disruptive force in American life in the last generation."
If one accepts her dubious premise that American children are facing the greatest crisis in history and so need all available help, her conservative and interventionist appeals can be reconciled. "At a time when the well-being of children is under unprecedented threat," she writes, "the balance of power is weighted heavily against them."
Clinton told me, extending this theme beyond the issue of children: "We have to remain vigilant always against oppressive or abusive power, whether it comes from government or any other large unaccountable institution. And that's why I keep going back to my favorite word, which is balance. There has to be this balance that the founders were very smart to incorporate into our founding documents and our principles of self-government, but it has to be constantly revisited and revised, because we can so easily get out of balance."
She does use the word "balance" an awful lot. She has for years. But while one can get her gist in the abstract, it is hard to tell what she means concretely, because Clinton has not tested her politics in campaign debate or legislative struggle. As First Lady, as in her book, she has had two luxuries that will vanish if she presents herself as a candidate: picking and choosing what issues she wants to address and falling back on exhortation rather than specific proposals to solve the problems she raises.
Her record of passionate concern for children would surely give her great credibility on issues like gun violence in the schools, which after Littleton she is turning into a crusade. ("I have not stopped thinking about it," she told me.) But voters overall will expect precision that she has not had to display except about health care. When I asked her what specifically she hopes to accomplish as a senator or citizen, she began by replying, "Well, you know, I'm concerned about a broad range of issues." Then she gathered speed. "You know, much of what I care about falls into the broad categories of creating conditions for children to grow up and be healthy and well educated and productive citizens. And so that means I'm interested in everything from economic policy to education policy to adoption and foster care and welfare policy to health care." She laced her fingers together as she added, "I think that all of these social, political, economic, cultural issues intersect."
Clinton is widely viewed as more liberal than her husband, but there is not much evidence to support that. In Arkansas, it was Hillary who persuaded Bill to advocate the testing of public-school teachers. The efficacy of the test is debatable, but there is no question it angered some of their staunchest liberal supporters.
"The biggest mistake of the American press is thinking they know her," says Maggie Williams, Clinton's former chief of staff and one of her closest friends. "You know, people think she's such a big lib. I think she's extremely conservative. I think she has more in common with people in upstate New York than in New York City, in a lot of ways." Williams calls Clinton "patriotic and practical. She thinks it's important to spend money on social programs, but she wants to know that they work."
Maybe so. But until she stands on her own politically, none of us can know. Morris says Hillary Clinton recognized long before her husband the effectiveness of a campaign based on bite-size "values" issues like school uniforms. She supports the death penalty, as the President does. She supports abortion rights, as he does, but she has not made the issue a priority as First Lady. For all her heated warnings about children, she has been ginger in using her influence to tilt the balance of power in their favor. On arguably the most important women's and children's legislation the President has endorsed -- welfare reform -- the First Lady was invisible. She says she was advising the President every step of the way and agreed with his decisions.
On less dangerous subjects, Clinton has played her advocate's role more openly within the Administration. She surprised the President's men, for example, by urging them to consider the effect on child-support payments of bankruptcy legislation now before Congress. Without drawing attention to herself, she has lobbied Congress on issues like adoption.
She made herself a driving force behind one of the biggest-ticket proposals of Clinton's second term, a $21.7 billion child-care initiative that has yet to win Congressional support. And, as she said at Hofstra, she never walked away from health care, but instead has doggedly coaxed along the President's incremental changes, including a $24 billion children's health insurance initiative.
When it comes to children and health care, President Clinton goes out of his way to acknowledge his dependence on his wife. "I'd also like to thank the First Lady, without whom I probably would not know very much about these issues," he said in the East Room recently, in a ceremony highlighting the new health care program. "When I met her in 1971, she was already obsessed with them." Like the words, the body language emphasized her helpmate role. As the audience applauded, Hillary Clinton, seated on the podium to the President's right, stared down at the floor, seemingly abashed at all the attention. Then she looked back up at her husband.
After Clinton stuck by her husband through the Lewinsky scandal, she came to present a fat target for those who found her wanting as a feminist. And it is hard not to wince these days over some things she says, at times so self-righteously. "We can point to many problems around our world today where women -- for reasons of history, culture, discrimination, prejudice -- are used to lift up patriarchy, are used really as objects in order for others to exercise power," she said in commemorating International Women's Day this year.
Clinton makes no apologies for her decisions last year. In the interview, she said at first that "people have to make their own judgments about that," but then went on to suggest they had no business doing so. A bit paradoxically, she presented her actions as evidence of her independence and self-sufficiency.
"I would hope that young women -- women of all ages -- understand how important it is to live your own life according to your own values," she said, unspooling one of those lengthy sentences characteristic of either Clinton, "and not be constantly looking over your shoulder to think what anybody else is thinking about you or saying about you, because ultimately, at the end of the day, you have to live with yourself and you have to do what you think is right. And again, my choices may not be someone else's choices."
When it comes to the Clintons, it is hard to separate the personal and the political. Regardless of her feelings for him, leaving her husband last year would have brought down a Presidency she believes in to her bones. Some of the Clintons' closest associates have regarded their relationship for years as a partnership with staged shows of affection -- what they had to for the moment," as one of them put it to me. Even some of Hillary Clinton's friends wonder if she will stay with him after they leave the White House.
But politics did not keep the Clintons together, according to other, closer friends of Hillary. She considered leaving him last year, they say, but her daughter and her marriage vows stopped her. Most important, they insist, she still loves him. "She loves him, and she doesn't have to, but she does," one said. Part of the reason, this friend said, is their intellectual bond: "Whether you think they're changing things for better or worse, they're always going to have something to say to each other about it."
The scandal reversed the dynamic between them that prevailed after the health care fiasco. He had never needed her more, and she was never more potent as his loyal advocate. She was able to draw clear battle lines, with Kenneth Starr as her foe, and she relished going on the campaign trial for Democrats last fall.
The Clintons still have bad days, their friends say. But privately, she speaks of him with deep admiration for his intelligence and political skills. While signs remain of iciness in their public appearances -- there are times when they barely exchange a glance on a shared podium -- the old patterns have reasserted themselves. At recent White House events, they have resumed finishing each other's sentences, and she has made her affectionate jokes at his expense.
But maybe it is simply time to stop caring so much. Maybe it is time to leave wondering if the Clintons truly love each other to the historians and to focus on the accomplishments, failures and ideas that define his Presidency and would define her Senate race.
If Clinton runs, she is likely to limit her husband's role, though he will try to meddle. Indeed, it has not escaped some of her friends that being forced onto the sidelines would be excruciating punishment for him, as, without a campaign of his own, he watches his wife and his Vice President run. But Hillary Clinton wants to find out what she can do on her own, they say. Further, having her husband front and center would make her look weak.
And therein lies a delightful switch. For years, White House aides have praised Hillary Clinton's ability and contributions while in the next breath minimizing her influence in order to build up the President. Now, Hillary's allies are unself-consciously treating her husband the same way. "She'd be a fool not to work with him very closely on this," one of them told me. "It will, however, be Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign. It'll be her voice, and it'll be her persona. I see him playing very much a behind-the-scenes role."
Hillary Clinton has developed a team of zealously loyal aides and outside advisers, some of whom have begun sounding out possible staff members in New York. Not surprisingly, the core members of Hillary Clinton's team are consultants that Clinton & Clinton have relied on in the past. They include Ickes, who ran Bill Clinton's campaign in New York in 1992; Mandy Grunwald, a former Clinton media strategist who worked on three Moynihan Senate races; Mark Penn, the President's pollster, and Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton friend and the party's pre-eminent finance man, who would help raise the $15 to $20 million Clinton would need. Others, including Hillary Clinton's friend Maggie Williams and the political strategist Michael Berman, are likely to play at least advisory roles.
Some of Clinton's friends and advisers worry she may not have the physical strength for a Senate race. They wonder if her clothes are too muted, if she is too Midwestern and how she can possibly run behind velvet ropes and Secret Service guards. Most of all, they wonder if she can relax and handle the press with her humor rather than her hard edge. At a recent Clinton speech in Buffalo, I was yanked back when I tried to approach Clinton's rope line by an event organizer who apologetically explained that she was under White House orders to repel reporters.
"It has crossed my mind," Clinton said wryly, when I asked if she was worried about being attacked by her opponents and scrutinized by the press. "But the possibility of partisan or political attacks does not serve as a deterrent. That is not anything that would prevent me" -- and here she started laughing -- after having been through what we've been through, from deciding to run for office."
Like a star quarterback at a pep rally, Hillary Clinton burst through the gym door at Buffalo State College to the shouts and whistles of 600 enraptured fans, most of them women. Wearing her usual uniform -- a dark pants suit and the blond helmet that ended her hair-style quest -- she strode to the center of the court with her usual grin, cheekbones soaring. "Ask a Working Woman," read the purple and yellow sign over her left shoulder as she took her seat among five women who had been asked, Clinton explained, to come today in "the clothes that they wear on the job." This town-hall meeting, earlier this month, provided a look at how Clinton would run for senator. It is a familiar look to anyone who has watched that other Clinton in action.
For an hour, with a remote microphone and no notes, Clinton led the audience through a thicket of public-policy issues. She did not do boxers or briefs, but she went to similar lengths to relate to her crowd. When one woman said that not enough was being done to support two-parent families, Clinton tangentially recalled what she had written about the horror of divorce. "I know that there are problems," she said. "I mean, marriage is hard" -- she began to grin as the crowd got it and started laughing -- it is hard work, and I'd be the first to tell ya." When the cheering stopped, she added, "But when you have a child, you have a special obligation."
The observation lightly reinforced a lesson Clinton's advisers believe Americans learned about the First Lady last year: she is a human being after all, one they can identify with. Another nightmare has become a tidy tale of personal growth and a selling point.
For almost every speaker's problem, Clinton had a government solution, though they fell into a pattern: "The policy that the President has proposed" or "Among the many proposals that the President has sent to Congress. . . ." Summing up, she suggested that she would look to her husband to address issues discussed today. Then she began construction on one of her trademark transcontinental sentences, pounding together clause after clause down which, miraculously, subject, verb and object rattled to their point. The result was a kind of mission statement for Hillary Clinton.
"Now," she commenced, "I think it would be a very good thing, not only for Buffalo or Erie County or New York but our whole country, for each of us to take a deep breath and think, You know, there but for the grace of God go I, and how can I try to help somebody else, how can I be an advocate for the kinds of things that working women and particularly single working moms or even stay-at-home moms or health care providers -- whatever -- how can I try to think of a way to make this community work as well as it can work?"
It is the all-encompassing "whatever" that captures the blurry scope of Hillary Clinton's waking dreams. And it is the next sentence -- a concluding, classically Clintonian pander -- that suggests how, and where, she wants to realize them: "You know, ever since I first came to Buffalo when I was a young girl. . . ."

HEADLINE: FILM;
A Poetic Director Becomes a Cause To Champion

BYLINE: By PETER BRUNETTE; Peter Brunette is a contributing editor at Film.com. His latest books are "The Films of Michelangelo Antonioni" and "Martin Scorsese: Interviews."

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH his 10 highly regarded films, stretching over two decades, are often compared with those of the Italian master filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni, the Greek director Theo Angelopoulos is largely unknown in the United States.
But the American release of his newest film, "Eternity and a Day," which opened Friday, is intended to change all that. 
 The film, which won the top honor, the Palme d'Or, at last year's Cannes International Film Festival, stars the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz as a widowed Greek poet who is terminally ill. Alienated from his own daughter, he rescues an 8-year-old Albanian refugee and returns with him to Albania to search for the boy's fractured family. The film's pacing is deliberate, some might say ponderous, in a way that even art-house audiences are no longer very accustomed to. Its language is unabashedly poetic, and the actors' movements are pregnant with seemingly inexpressible meaning. Past and present merge in suggestive but sometimes confusing ways, and, as in all his films, Mr. Angelopoulos seeks to capture the symbolic truth of an image or a gesture rather than tell a rousing tale. There is more than a little of the stateliness and solemnity of ancient Greek tragedy in his work.
Though his previous films have starred such well-known actors as Marcello Mastroianni and Harvey Keitel, they have not been distributed widely in the United States, if at all. But this time, Ismail Merchant, the co-founder of Merchant Ivory Productions, has become Mr. Angelopoulos's champion, distributing the movie along with Artistic License Films.
"We have to fight for it," Mr. Merchant said. "Angelopoulos is a very personal filmmaker who has a vision and a powerful visual language. I have enormous faith in the American public, and enormous faith in cinema as art. But I'm not aiming to become rich this way and start counting box-office grosses on Monday morning." And with cable television and video pre-sales, he added, releasing difficult films like "Eternity and a Day" is not as risky as it once was.
Mr. Merchant and his partners are also convinced that this Angelopoulous film is more accessible than the earlier ones. What's more, having an adorable little boy (Achilleas Skevis) in the movie doesn't hurt.
Attending the Palm Springs Film Festival in January, Mr. Angelopoulos, 64, was relaxed and laughed often. But insofar as his films represent the very antithesis of Hollywood, it seemed odd to behold him in Southern California, in the belly of the beast. Curiosity drove him, he said.
Andrew Horton, a professor of film and video at Oklahoma University and the author of a book on Mr. Angelopoulos, believes that the intellectual side of his work has been overemphasized. "These films connect on an emotional level," Professor Horton said. "In the MTV age, he demands that we slow down and watch the image, that's all. He's also very much in the Greek tradition, and so a lot of action happens off camera.
" 'Landscape in the Mist,' " he continued, referring to a 1988 film by Mr. Angelopoulos, "contains the cruelest rape scene I've ever experienced, precisely because you see nothing when the young girl is raped in the back of the truck, just her looking at her bloody hands afterward. So it's emotional rather than intellectual, but because you can't see it, you have to think about it."
Richard Pena, director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, has invited only one of Mr. Angelopoulos' films to the New York Film Festival, "The Suspended Step of the Stork" (1991), about a television journalist's search for a missing Greek politician. "The problem for me is that too often there is great techical flourish and detailed control, but the final product is not that moving," Mr. Pena said. "Take the scene in 'Ulysses' Gaze' when we see the bust of Lenin floating down the river. At first it's very powerful and beautiful, and even five minutes later it's still powerful and beautiful, but then when we keep seeing it, you want to say, 'O.K., we got it, Theo, now turn it off!' "
Mr. Angelopoulos, who was also the co-writer of "Eternity and a Day," traces the genesis of the film to the sudden death of the Italian actor Gian Maria Volonte from a heart attack in 1994 during the shooting of "Ulysses' Gaze." "It was even more shocking because we had spent the entire day together the day before his death," he recalled. "Afterward, I thought: What would one do if one had only one more day to live? And so the theme of death, of death as a border or frontier, arose. And since all my most recent films are about the subject of frontiers and limits, it fit right in."
Mr. Angelopoulos says that his new film "speaks of the difficulty of being, of the human condition, of birth, death, nostalgia, hope, old age, youth, love, all those things that every human being has in common. But it also speaks of the passage of time," he said. "That's why there's that little conversation between two kids at the beginning: 'What is time?' asks one. And the response is that of Heraclitus: 'Time is a young child playing with stones at the edge of the sea.' But I would have rather used the definition of Parmenides, another ancient Greek: 'Time doesn't exist.' Now that I'm getting older, I would like that to be the case."
AFTER studying law as a young man in Greece, Mr. Angelopoulos left the university on the eve of his final exams to perform his military service. After his release, penniless, he headed straight to Paris to study film. "When I was very young, around 16, I wrote poetry and even had some of it published in literary reviews," he said. "Then came the cinema, and it took me over completely, because it gives you the poetry and the image at the same time, and also because the cinema is an extraordinary adventure. Making a film, you live things that you couldn't live otherwise. And then it's also a microsociety, because I work always with the same team, the same cameraman, often the same actors, even the same machinists. So it's something familial." He lives in Athens with Phoebe Economopoulos, his producer and companion of many years, and their two daughters.
He confesses that his plans remain hazy: "Right now, there's nothing. I call the period before a film the humility period. You feel the humility, but you see nothing else clearly. But you know it will come, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow; it doesn't matter."
The financing is not usually a problem, because the budgets are very small. "That way I have my liberty," Mr. Angelopoulos said. "I do have an audience, not a huge one, but a steady one. This film has been sold to 42 countries. So I don't complain.
"I know that my work is difficult for the mainstream public, but I make these films anyway, because it's the best that I can do. Every director in the world would like to have the largest possible audience. You get there or you don't. You have to be content with your own audience, whatever it is."

HEADLINE: In Boston Neighborhood, a Reach for Office Space

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
THANKS to a strong downtown office market, thousands of new white-collar jobs will be created in the outlying Fenway neighborhood, four miles west of the central business district.
The area embraces a section of the city's rambling park network that is also known as the Fenway, whose prominent institutional residents include the Fenway Park baseball stadium, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, several colleges and some hospitals affiliated with Harvard. 
 Facing the Frederick Law Olmsted-designed parkland is the former Sears Roebuck & Company retail and warehouse complex on Brookline Avenue, which the company closed in 1989. The 1.5-million-square-foot Art Moderne structure stood empty until 1997 when Sears sold it.
Reaching the point of sale was no easy task. From 1986 through 1996, three developers tried to remake the nine-acre site into a medical research center and retail mall. None of them took title. Finally, Sears sold the property for $15 million to a new developer, the Boston-based Abbey Group, which is now refashioning the hulking eight-story building and its 11-story tower into an office/retail complex.
Abbey began its $110-million project, called Landmark Center, last fall, and expects to complete next spring. The developer has gutted the complex, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, and is renovating it to create about 630,000 square feet of offices, 305,000 square feet of retail space and an 1,800-car garage.
While occupancy is still a year away, 70 percent of the space is already leased. The sole office tenant so far, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, has taken 417,000 square feet for 15 years at a rent of about $25 a square foot. Leases have also been signed by several retailers and by the General Cinema Corporation for a 16-screen multiplex theater.
A number of developers had tried unsuccessfully to redevelop the Sears site in the late 80's and early 90's, among them the Chicago-based JMB Urban Development; the developer Abraham D. Gosman, based in Needham, Mass., and New England Development, of Newton, Mass. The office market was weak during much of that time, and the Abbey Group's development undertaking was therefore considered risky at best.
"We saw a vast quantity of structurally superior masonry construction at an attractive price, which I suspect dropped with each developer," said David Epstein, who with his brother, Robert, and John Svenson are partners in the 21-year-old development firm.
"The difference with our plan is that it doesn't call for any new buildings, which dramatically lowers the cost," Mr. Epstein explained. Indeed, in 1989, JMB Urban Development proposed a $270-million project that called for construction of two new mid-rises -- an office building and a hotel -- parking for 1,155 cars and renovation of the historic building, a 71-year-old mainstay of the neighborhood.
ONCE the Abbey Group had put the building under contract, in mid-1996, it then won approval from the city and neighborhood associations to use the handsome brick-and-limestone structure for offices rather than medical research.
Early in 1997, it secured $85 million in financing from a consortium of lenders led by CIBC Oppenheimer. Abbey put up $13 million of its own funds and raised an additional $12 million in equity from investor purchases of tax credits available for the restoration of a historic structure. It closed on the building in March, 1997.
The Abbey Group has had an eye for languishing properties with turnaround potential.
In the late 1970's, it started its real estate business in the Back Bay neighborhood where gracious town houses had been chopped up into rooming houses. It renovated the buildings and has since sold hundreds of units as condominiums.
Abbey has also done commercial renovations such as the conversion of a 200,000-square-foot Cambridge office building into Riverside Technology Center, a biotechnology research facility.
Now it's also building a new 132-apartment luxury rental project across the street from the former Sears site in the 975-acre Fenway district.
The eclectic Fenway neighborhood lies on the city's border with the leafy streetcar suburb of Brookline and is just a brief ride from downtown by subway, bus or the electric trolley on Huntington Avenue.
In the mid- to late 19th century, as Boston built up its fashionable residential districts, Back Bay and South End, the Fenway was simply rustic marshlands. As the 20th century dawned, Olmsted started to tame them by extending his park system, known as The Emerald Necklace, into the fens.
Also in that era came the construction of the baseball stadium, the Museum of Fine Arts and the development of the Longwood Medical Area, which houses Harvard Medical School and several affiliated hospitals and research centers. The development of modest apartment houses followed.
For decades now, however, the Fenway has also been known for its feisty mix of sports bars, undistinguished restaurants, and low- to moderately priced housing that caters to students.
Although the neighborhood is only a few miles from downtown, not many Boston office tenants would have considered leasing space in the Fenway in the past, said William McCall, president of McCall & Allmy, a real estate services firm. But with Landmark Center coming on the market when office space is scarce "it is going to be a viable office submarket," Mr. McCall said. The Abbey Group says that about 3,500 office workers are likely to be employed there.
In the last six years, the downtown office vacancy rate has fallen to 4.5 percent citywide and about 2 percent in the best space, from a high of about 17 percent in 1992. Annual rents have risen by as much as 100 percent since and for top-quality space they are now in the $50-a-square-foot range or even higher in a few cases.
"The danger for us is losing employers who can't find large blocks of space for less than $35 a square foot," said Thomas O'Brien, director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the city planning agency. "With information technology changing the way businesses operate, not everyone has to be downtown anymore, but we don't want them to go too far away."
Blue Cross Blue Shield could have moved to neighboring Cambridge or Waltham, Boston officials say, but the city lobbied hard to keep the company. The tight office market also made the timing favorable for the sale of the company's office tower in the Financial District, which it developed in the 1970's and had occupied since then. The Landmark Center space will soon be ready, while it could have taken up to three years for Blue Cross to build new space here and 18 months in the suburbs.
"With the profit, Blue Cross was able to recapitalize its health insurance business, which had been losing money, sign a lease on the Fenway space and still bank a profit," said Jay Doherty, president of Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, a development company here.
WHILE the building retains its historic facade, the interior has been redesigned by the architects Bruner Cott & Associates, of Cambridge. The floorplates, once three to five acres in size, have been broken up by the creation of two seven-story atriums which, along with new windows, will bring light into the offices. They will be served by all new mechanical, electrical and telecommunications systems.
For the ground-floor retail space, new storefront windows, sidewalks and lighting are planned. The only new structure will be built for the multiplex cinema.
So far, the retail leases have been signed by large chains -- Staples, Filene's Basement and Bed, Bath & Beyond, which use big floors and often have trouble finding affordable yet profitable urban locations.
Earlier this month the management of the Red Sox baseball team unveiled its plan to build a new $545 million stadium about a block from the old one.
But according to Mr. Epstein, the main attraction for office tenants is the real estate equivalent of the grand slam home run. "We're offering first class space at half the cost of the central business district," he said.

Feminism's Unlikely Heroine

BYLINE: By PETER M. NICHOLS 

 BODY:
AUDITIONING for a soap commercial, the aspiring actress Ann Marie, played by Marlo Thomas, is told by an executive that she has the look of "every mother's child." That's enough to wipe the well-scrubbed, firmly fixed smile off the face of a young woman trying her hardest to be anything but.
What, she wonders to herself, happened to sex appeal? Sex, it seems, is the last thing the man wants associated with his product, though later he forces his attentions on her after inviting himself into her apartment. Ann was forever enmeshed in that kind of situation in "That Girl," the ABC comedy that from 1966 to 1971 ever so judiciously entertained the notion that an unattached woman in her 20's might have the urge and the right to lead a life of her own. 
 As is apparent in nine episodes of the show now on video from Anchor Bay, those were deep waters in 1966.
"If women were single, they were 'Our Miss Brooks,' " Ms. Thomas said the other day, referring to the 1950's series in which Eve Arden played a wisecracking high school English teacher (who rented a room in an elderly woman's house, rather than really living on her own). "That Girl" was Ms. Thomas's idea.
"I wanted to do a show about a young woman who lived in her own apartment, trying to make it, not divorced from her family, but who, like most young girls at that time and today, still was related to her parents but not programmed by them."
As reasonable as that sounds, this was a show that truly had to watch its step. "The networks were terrified of it," Ms. Thomas said. Eventually ABC bought the idea, but, she added, "they wanted Ann to be the daughter of someone or the secretary of someone, ideas I didn't like."
"I said, 'Isn't there a show where I can just be the somebody, not an offshoot of the other person?' "
In the series, Ann lives alone in New York and supports herself with a variety of jobs while trying out for parts that with the exception of gigs as dancing chickens and the like in commercials always elude her. In the meantime she tries to stay on loving but equal footing with men.
Her fretful parents, watching from their suburban lair, seemingly bear the burden of a nation reluctantly embarked on a great social experiment. Ann, in fact, is very much someone's daughter. Lou Marie (Lew Parker), a well-meaning father but a dithering worrywart, is forever descending on his little girl to monitor her affairs. Needless to say, Lou is on especially high alert when Ann's boyfriend, Donald (Ted Bessell, who died at 57 in 1996), is around and is practically apoplectic anytime Donald is detected actually alone with Ann in her apartment.
"The biggest constraint was sexual," Ms. Thomas said. "I got away with the feminist view that I didn't want to get married; I must have said that 27 times on that show. I could have a boyfriend. I could have him home for dinner. But you couldn't have any sexual contact. It must never appear that Donald spent the night."
Kept on tenterhooks as to just how he was supposed to behave, Donald stays every inch the cheerful, buttoned-down, fully clothed paragon. But then this was Ann's show. For all her thoughts of freedom, though, the leash was short. If she was to be allowed her little foibles, she could at least stay well dressed, bouncy and upbeat.
Ms. Thomas said that for her, some of the show's best moments were off camera. "The amazing thing is that the first night we went on the air we were a huge hit with the public," she said. "We got a phenomenal amount of mail. Every young girl in America wanted to be 'that girl.' They'd write in and say: 'I'm 17 and pregnant and I can't tell my parents. Where do I go?' Married women in their 20's who were unhappy would say, 'Don't marry Donald.' Women would write and say: 'My husband beats me up. Where do I go?' "
Ms. Thomas and her assistants tried to help. "What I kept finding was that there was nowhere for them to go," she said. "It totally politicized me as a feminist." She met Gloria Steinem and began traveling the country for the cause.
Beyond the show, of course, the real world was exploding in political and sexual revolt. The Vietnam War worsened; the Democratic Convention erupted in Chicago; students fell at Kent State. But on the air, Ann Marie bore up as perkily as ever.
"We stuck to the life of a young woman trying to make it on her own," said Ms. Thomas, who is 55 and still acts occasionally in films. "We were an Audrey Hepburn movie, not a Jane Fonda movie."

Once Rivals, Two Jazz Impresarios Agree to Disagree

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF 

 BODY:
GEORGE WEIN and Michael Dorf -- impresarios of this year's JVC Jazz Festival and the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival respectively -- have been butting heads for 11 years. In 1954 Mr. Wein started the Newport Jazz Festival, which became the paradigm for outdoor music events. After moving through several different sponsors, it became the JVC festival in 1984. Mr. Dorf put on his first jazz festival (called "What Is Jazz?") at the Knitting Factory, his club in lower Manhattan, in 1988, scheduling it to compete with the JVC concerts uptown. A cordial relationship developed, but it broke down in 1997, when Mr. Dorf expanded, found a major sponsor (Texaco), and called his giant festival the New York Jazz Festival. This was the student rather stridently pulling rank on the teacher, and a period of bad blood followed.
Jazz is too small for a brand war like this, and detente was probably inevitable. Friendly again, they're both committed to making New York a city overrun with jazz each June, resolving that too much at once is the best way to draw fans to the concerts. This year, Bell Atlantic Jazz (the festival has a new sponsor) runs from June 3 to 13 and JVC Jazz from June 14 to 27. 
 As the head of Festival Productions, Mr. Wein, 73, produced 37 music festivals around the world in 1998, including the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival; he almost sold the company to Black Entertainment Television last year, but the deal did not go through. As the C.E.O. of Knit Media, Mr. Dorf, 37, runs a club and a record label, and plans to open new branches of the Knitting Factory in Los Angeles and Berlin. In a joint interview, at The New York Times, the first they had ever done, they discussed a range of issues, including their different theories on how to reach the current jazz audience. Following are excerpts from their conversation.
 BEN RATLIFF
BEN RATLIFF. George, you've been a concert producer for nearly 50 years. Is there anything you could possibly have learned from the ascension of Michael Dorf?
GEORGE WEIN. There are things happening every day and every year that I cannot keep up with it for many reasons. I can't understand the new technology and things like that, and I watch what he's done with the Internet. I've given instructions now to my people about getting sponsors for a festival, tell them we will get the artist to sign for an appearance on the Internet as part of the deal. And give them a national image. I mean, that's something I never did before.
MICHAEL DORF. Jazz is perfectly suited for the Internet because it is a little more intelligent. It's not a mass-pop type of music. The Internet allows us to find those niches, and when you can aggregate all those audiences together, 75 people in Memphis and 32 of them in Stuttgart and 100 in Singapore, now you start building up a really large audience that can come to jazz.
WEIN. But I would never put a whole concert on the Internet. Because, conceivably, it would get economically unfeasible with programs that I do. If I ask Herbie Hancock to give me an Internet program, he's going to want to be paid double, but we can't afford that unless you got a sponsor paying for the whole thing. The basic difference between what Michael and I do is economics. He has a place where he can put people in; he uses -- and I don't mean this as derogatory -- non-union musicians, young musicians. Every time I present something I have to rent a hall. That affects the total economic structure, and when I'm using Carnegie and Avery Fisher, I have no freedom. I have to charge $40, $50, $60 for tickets because the costs of hall and advertising is $50,000 before you pay your artist. But last year was one of the best years we've had. This year we're way ahead of last year. Ticket sales took off.
Q. How do you account for that?
WEIN. I think there's a lot of money around. People are making money in the market. We broke all records at New Orleans this year. There's an economic spirit in the air with the middle upper class. They're spending money and going out. Restaurants are packed. Everybody's doing more business.
Q. In theory, your festivals reflect different attitudes about what jazz is. People in general think of JVC as the mainstream jazz festival and Bell Atlantic as the alternative. Is that still a fair assumption?
DORF. We certainly have had a much more open definition of what jazz is. Most of that is about trying to expand the audience. When a band like Medeski, Martin and Wood or any of that "Grateful Jazz" genre is able to turn people on to Ornette Coleman or Sonny Rollins -- because they cover a particular song or they invite those older musicians on stage the way the Grateful Dead used to have Ornette or David Murray come on to the stage -- to me that's accomplishing a really great objective, which is turning a lot of young people on to the music.
WEIN. See, newness is something I don't think you can create. New things happen in spite of everything. The minute you say I have to be different, you have a problem. You are different if you are a great artist.
Q. And yet, Michael, your only concert at Town Hall this year is Grover Washington Jr., who is more mainstream than mainstream. How do you square that with any sort of alternative profile?
DORF. Opening up for Grover is Bill Ware, a great downtown vibraphone player who never will have an opportunity, unless we provided this one, to play in front of 1,000 or 1,400 more conservative jazz fans. So, getting the Grover fans turned on to some of the stuff that we're doing downtown fits our objective. We want to have both ends of the spectrum. All this stuff will go into a jazz bin at Tower Records.
WEIN. I went down to see John Zorn and Dave Douglas, and they said, "Well, what do you think -- isn't it something different?" I said, "It's nothing different, it's music." I said, "What is different about music?" I wanted to play them this year, uptown.
Q. George, you've said that The New York Times made Michael Dorf -- and that the paper made him at your expense. But a lot of musicians feel that they made Michael Dorf, or at least that they made what's widely regarded as a "Knitting Factory esthetic." In 1997, a gathering of musicians, under the banner of the Noise Action Coalition, voiced their concern that they weren't being paid enough in the festival. So, Michael, you negotiated with the N.A.C., and last year the fee went up to $100 per musician for a group of up to six players; this year it's $200 per musician. This is a great victory for musicians; does it make it harder to put on a festival?
DORF. Yes, it does. It makes it harder to put on as much music as we used to. We have a budget, we have a realistic pie to work from, and you can only cut the pie so many ways.
WEIN. I can't accept that. Because I'm a musician, and I know what it is to go out and earn a living playing music. I don't set a price for the musicians when I pay them. I negotiate with each musician on each individual deal. If I can't pay him and he wants ridiculous money, I don't pay him.
DORF. We had a difficult situation. The Knitting Factory has a very symbiotic relationship with the music community. They all use it as a place to improve their profile. And we always had a deal in which the artist made 75 percent of the money that came in the door. It was a relationship that worked very well and continues to work well at the club. If 10 people come and pay 10 bucks, it's $100 at the door, they get $75. And they understand I shouldn't be going into my pocket to pay them $1,000.
WEIN. Michael, it was the best thing that could happen.
Q. That the musicians complained?
WEIN. Yeah, it was the best thing. It brought you into a reality of a situation that you're going to have to live with the rest of your life. Because that's the reality: musicians have to make a living, have to get paid.
DORF. I don't think we're going to have the financial complaints from the musicians anymore. I think that was a hiccup in our growth. In terms of having this community problem, I don't think we'll see that. It is a partnership, and if there's not pure open communication, whether it's a one-on-one relationship with your wife or significant other or in this case a partnership with the whole community --
WEIN. Michael, you are not a partner with the musicians. You are the enemy. You are the exploiter. As you grow, that is the image you will have with musicians. You are the Man. And the Man can never be a partner.
Q. You both have extremely difficult tasks: trying to sell tickets to New York jazz audiences, who have seen everything and regularly get a chance to see most jazz groups. Even though this is the jazz capital of the world, is it harder to put on a successful jazz festival in New York than in Montreal and Umbria, to name two particularly good ones?
WEIN. You know our problem? Not that the New York audience has seen everything. You've seen everything. How many times can you review Sonny Rollins? But the only time people won't come to see Sonny Rollins is when they read that he's not doing anything new.
DORF. I see it as a challenge for us. To put on something that the critics haven't seen before.
Q. Leaving the question of innovation aside, because it's so hard to define, should jazz festivals offer a reflection of the current state of jazz?
WEIN. I think they should offer a reflection of jazz, which includes the current, which includes the past. Why should my people, who are 50, 60, 70 years old, be denied hearing Benny Goodman's music and things like that because they don't reflect the current state of jazz?
Q. Every year you're competing with each other to book artists.
WEIN. The only competition Michael gives me is in the press. I've no feeling of competition with him for my concert stuff.
DORF. But there's overlap on some programming.
Q. Cassandra Wilson or Medeski, Martin and Wood, these are acts that you could both play successfully.
WEIN. I think we will get closer as we go along. For instance, last year, I didn't want my artists appearing on his award program the Jazz Awards, produced by Knit Media . This year, I don't care.
Q. As I remember, part of the problem was that you were going to receive one of the awards, and you didn't want to receive an award from Michael.
WEIN. I didn't think Michael was in the position to give me an award. I should be giving Michael an award. I still don't think Knit Media's sponsorship of the Jazz Awards is right. You know, I'll go along with it because you're doing it. But I think it should be done by an institution of some sort, the Smithsonian or something.
DORF. And I wouldn't disagree with that. The only reason we decided to do it was because no one else was doing it.
Q. Michael, the message I've been hearing from you is that unless jazz can combine with other forms of music, it's not really going to find an audience.
DORF. No, I think you need to bring new people into the room to listen to it. We have to somehow figure out what that 13-year-old or 12-year-old is listening to and how can they make a connection between Chuck D and Ornette Coleman or Don Byron or what Steve Coleman or Greg Osby's been doing with hip-hop.
WEIN. I agree with Michael in this respect. I have always believed that you must put on more than just pure jazz. And the only way jazz will ever die is if the musicians stop playing jazz. Jazz can never be more than a minority music. Everybody cannot like the highest quality things. But if we cultivate that minority -- we're a country of 250 million people. If you have 2 percent of them that like jazz, you've got 5 million jazz fans. You've got to cultivate those 5 million jazz fans. You can't look for the 98 percent. Forget them, they're going to go out for the Rolling Stones or the Beatles, or whatever it is. But we need a Miles Davis. We need a Dave Brubeck. We need somebody that sells records.
Q. Is there anybody on the horizon that could do that?
WEIN. That I don't know. I tell all groups, all musicians: Stop making a different record every time you play. Get a group and work on a sound. It's all about a sound that people remember, not how great you blow. And that's the way you must establish identity. The Modern Jazz Quartet stayed selling out concerts, right until the time they quit. That group sound is what sells jazz; the greatness of the music has to be within the structure of a group.
DORF. There were 35,000 new CD's released in 1998, and that was not the case four years ago, so there's limited shelf space in retail. There's limited air space to play these on the radio. Why I'm pushing on-line is that you now have virtual shelf space. You have virtual dials, and you can program your jazz to your computer and listen to whatever you want. And if you look at the sales on Amazon.com or CD Now, you'll see jazz is now represented by about 10 percent of sales. So when you really can democratize the ability of people to listen to the music that they want to, jazz is going to have a much higher market share than it currently does.
WEIN. He's absolutely right. I don't know what he's talking about, but he's right. If I knew what he was talking about, he might be wrong.
Q. Michael, George has criticized certain aspects of your festival.
WEIN. I haven't criticized; I've commented on it.
Q. Is there anything about George's festival that you would do differently?
DORF. The only suggestion I've made in the past was to have more unknown opening acts on the stage.
WEIN. It keeps people away.
DORF. It's hard, it's a lot easier to say it than it is to actually implement it. And I see that in my own event. But I really force that. I try and have one unknown name on every big bill, and give that artist an opportunity for exposure.
WEIN. There is no question that he would take a lot of things I do and keep them and take a lot of things I do and change them. Because he is what he is. And that's why he and I have built up an affinity. Because I recognize that this kid doesn't stop. Look, I think Michael and I are going to be doing a lot of things together in the future if I last long enough. We understand each other.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: $62 Million for 57th Street Structure and Lease on Land;
Steinway Buys Its Building

 BODY:
Since 1925, Steinway & Sons has sold pianos and played host to great pianists in its elegant store at Steinway Hall, at 111 West 57th Street, between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue.
But for 40 years, as a result of a 1958 decision to sell the land and the building, the company had been only a tenant in the building it put up. 
 Now, however, Steinway & Sons has reacquired the structure, paying $62 million to a group of investors including Wexford Management and Bear Stearns for the 217,000-square-foot building and a 99-year lease on the land under it.
"Steinway Hall has set the tone for the company's revenue growth by producing record-breaking sales results for the last several years," said Bruce A. Stevens, the president of Steinway & Sons. "We can now enter the new millennium with this valuable asset safely where it belongs -- at Steinway."
The building is also home to the American operations of The Economist magazine and the architectural firm of Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates.
Francis A. Coco, a director of Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate services company that advised Steinway, said that the purchase, which was completed earlier this month, had been designed to assist the company financially.
"The time was right and the market was right for Steinway to regain ownership of this renowned building," Mr. Coco said. "We are extremely pleased with the results, as we were able to structure the transaction to increase Steinway's cash flow and produce an attractive rate of return on their investment."
Dennis Hanson, the chief financial officer of Steinway, said the decision to lease rather than purchase the land under the building reduced the purchase price and eased the financial impact on the company.

HEADLINE: Help Wanted: Low Salary, No Benefits, Little Respect

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
THE labor shortage created by the strong economy has done more than send Connecticut companies searching for skilled workers. It has also created a labor squeeze in classrooms, forcing schools around the state to scramble for substitute teachers, who can often make more money doing just about anything else.
In Norwich, the school system typically had to hire about 15 substitutes a day, but still fell one or two short. So principals or other school staff members took over classes. In Waterford, the schools have needed substitutes 2,725 times this year, but were able to fill only 2,484 positions. New Haven schools needed from 100 to 150 substitutes a day, but often fell 25 to 50 short. The situation has gotten so bad that schools have had to become creative. 
 Some districts are recruiting parents and recalling retired teachers. New Haven got about 20 graduate students to sign on as substitutes by agreeing to pay some of their college tuition. The city has even called on firefighters and police officers to teach during their off-duty hours.
"We're trying every technique, method and strategy we can think of," said Starlet Wilder, director of personnel and labor relations for the New Haven schools.
Kyle Daniels, 24, who finished almost four years of college, is a New Haven firefighter and substitutes at one of the city's schools. The job pays him $50 per day, and although he would like to find a second job that pays more, he enjoys the students and said teaching fits well with his rotating shifts as a firefighter.
"I enjoy what I'm doing, although I wish I could get more money," he said.
The low pay forced Terrence Rountree, 25, of New Haven, to stop substitute teaching for the city in January after six years. Instead, he took a better-paying job running a job-training program.
"Any job you get will pay more than substitute teaching does," he said. "When you're a substitute teacher, you're treated like a substitute. The kids automatically think it's a free day. It's almost babysitting."
Substitute teachers usually earn between $50 and $70 per day and that's with no benefits. That's not much of an incentive in a state that has an unemployment rate hovering around 3 percent and that recently was one of only five states in the nation to report a dramatic drop in unemployment claims. Worsening the shortage is the competition among schools for capable substitutes, many of whom register to work with several school systems. The shortage of substitutes has forced schools to cancel special classes like art or music, combine other classes and call upon principals to teach.
A bill in Hartford that addressed the substitute shortage by lowering the qualifications for the job failed this year in the Legislature's Education Committee.
"A concern among many members of the Education Committee was that we not lower the standards for substitute teachers," said State Representative Cameron Staples, the House chairman of the committee.
He said some committee members felt the shortage of substitutes was due more to the low pay than a shortage of qualified people. A proposal to offset some costs, like health insurance for retired teachers who substitute, was still something the committee was interested in. The committee plans to study the substitute issue this summer, and Mr. Staples said he expects a revised bill to be introduced in the Legislature's next session.
 The state Department of Education said it is against lowering substitute standards. Currently, schools are required to follow the following selection process in descending order: Substitutes should be certified in the subject area they teach. If the school cannot get someone to meet that standard, it should seek a teacher with certification in any subject. If not that, the minimum standard is a bachelor's degree.
Thomas Murphy, the department spokesman, said the proposed bill is unnecessary because the department already grants waivers of the bachelor's degree requirement on a case-by-case basis for people with experience in the classroom, such as a teacher's aide. The department has granted 635 waivers this year.
Some schools have been hiring permanent substitutes and paying them more than casual ones. "More and more, we hear schools talking about hiring certified teachers as permanent substitutes," said Daria Plummer, president of the Connecticut Education Association, the union that represents teachers. "It worked well in the past, and it's an idea whose usefulness has come back."
The Waterford Board of Education approved hiring five permanent substitutes at $80 per day. If no substitutes are needed in the classroom, they will be assigned other duties in the schools.
Waterford also raised the pay for substitutes this year from $60 to $70 per day and adjusted the schedules of full-time teachers to reduce the need for substitutes.
"We stopped calling in substitutes for half a day," said Randall Collins, the Waterford School Superintendent. "We were losing people to towns that could hire them for a full day."
The one thing Mr. Collins said he does not want to do is lower the standards for substitutes. "We're hoping these measures will make the job more attractive," he said. "We should maintain the requirement of at least a college degree as long as we can."
Virginia Seccombe, director of Learn, the education service center in Southeastern Connecticut, said school districts are considering banding together and contracting with a temporary employment agency that would hire full-time teachers, provide benefits and place teachers in the school districts. Substitutes who were not needed in one district would be assigned to another. "Districts that struggle to hire substitutes would have help," she said. "The full-time work and benefits would be the attractions." .
Mr. Collins said he doubts that the plan will save money, although the precise costs have not been worked out. "It will cost more than doing it on our own," he said. "Right now, I'm not on board. But if every town joins, Waterford may be forced into it."
Gary Gelmini, the principal of Buckingham School in Norwich, recruits substitutes for the school from Sacred Heart University in Lisbon, where he teaches education courses. Mr. Gelmini said he supports the proposed bill allowing undergraduates to work as substitutes. "I have some wonderful undergraduates who are going to make excellent teachers," he said.
Mr. Gelmini added that there are people in the community who, with some training, would also be able to handle substitute teaching. "There's a wealth of people out there, like parents, who have associate's degrees and experience with kids," he said. "I think they could do a really good job."
Students from the University of New Haven and Quinnipiac College in Hamden make up a portion of the substitute force in the New Haven schools. Seventeen students, most of whom are in master's degree programs, work in New Haven's classrooms. The school district pays part of the students' tuition plus a stipend, Ms. Wilder said. Parents and people who have worked or volunteered in the community are also hired upon completion of 20 hours of training in substitute teaching.
"To tell you the truth, they are better prepared than some of the people with degrees," said Ms. Wilder, who had obtained state Department of Education waivers for the parents and students. "They have a realistic view of what a teacher needs.
"We're trying to be very careful that we get good people," she said.
Some may be reluctant to make a commitment to substitute teaching, but once they hear that they will receive training and support, they are more apt to be interested, Ms. Wilder said. And although only eight people attended a recent orientation session for prospective substitutes in New Haven, there were two certified special education teachers in the group.
Bruce Royce, 58, of Montville is a retired teacher who returned to his old school, Teachers' Memorial Middle School in Norwich, to teach an eighth-grade American history class after its regular teacher went on maternity leave. The assignment will last for four months.
"I was starting to get itchy," Mr. Royce said. "I enjoy being back in the classroom, and I know I'll be through in June. I can look forward to time off again."
Mr. Royce said he prefers long-term assignments to working in a different classroom every day.
"It's not like going into a different class every day, where the kids say, 'Oh, boy! A day off. Let's give the teacher a hard time" ' he said. "I don't run into that. The kids know I'll be there the next day."

HEADLINE: Q & A/Marge Hiller;
Group Uses Grants To Inspire Teachers

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
THE Bridgeport Public Education Fund makes education mountains out of cash molehills. The fund awards modest grants to Bridgeport teachers for classroom projects and provides seed money for other innovative school projects. The founding executive director is an energetic former librarian, Marge Hiller. "There isn't a community in the country that couldn't use an education fund," she said, "a partnership between people who care about education and educators." "The principle of bringing people together around education issues is very sound, very valuable. It makes the system stronger."
Recently Ms. Hiller discussed some of the accomplishments and plans for the fund in her office, in a stately blue Victorian house in a quiet University of Bridgeport neighborhood. Following are excerpts from that conversation: 
 Q. What are public education funds?
A. There are a bunch of ed funds, around 50, in the United States. They were created in 1983 by the Ford Foundation, which provided seed money to replicate something they had seen in Pennsylvania that was a partnership among county government, school districts and parents. They thought if public education was to move forward, the community should come together in urban and rural areas where there was a preponderance of really poor children. They started an organization called the Public Education Fund. Their mission was to take this money from the Ford Foundation and create local education funds around the country.
Q. How did the fund get started in Bridgeport?
A. In the case of Bridgeport, the head of the school volunteers association came back with the idea 15 years ago. They were just about to start an Adopt-A-School program. This was a nice fit. Superintendent Jim Connelly assigned someone to pull together a group of people to see if there was interest in the business community; there was. This happened rather quickly.
David Carson had just been hired by People's Bank and he had a history of being involved in public education by serving on the West Hartford school board. He agreed to spearhead this movement. He's been our chairman for 15 years.
Q. Where does the money come from?
A. Our money comes to us from local sources. We raise all our money from small businesses, corporations, individuals. One of our biggest donor bases is our teachers. They contribute through payroll deductions. We get no Federal money and no state money.
We have a very small endowment, $80,000, started by some of the original founders. It's at the Greater Bridgeport Community Foundation. Q. What kinds of programs do you support?
A. The whole premise of this organization is to build community support for public education, where people understand that everybody is responsible for what happens in the schools. Education isn't just about school buildings and teachers and what happens in those six hours. It is about pre-natal care, economics, where children live, how their families live, air quality, what the economic plan for the city is, how that impacts on children. Part of our mission is to bring people into the schools to see firsthand what's happening.
We've used our grant program as a way for people to meet teachers personally and to see what goes on in their classrooms, to travel around the city and see what's happening in the schools, where the schools are and what the neighborhoods look like. These are community people. The biggest draw for getting people into the schools is our mini-grants for teachers program.
Q. What is the mini-grants program?
A. Teachers apply for money for classroom projects, innovative things that they would like to do for classrooms that they normally pay for out of their own pockets. They can apply for $500. We get anywhere from 150 to 200 teachers applying for that money. We have about 80 people from the community who make up our allocations committee. They are assigned one or two grants from one or two teachers. They go to the schools and talk about their project. They become the authority on whether the project is going to be funded or not. The hard part here is that they want to fund everything because they never meet someone who doesn't have a good idea or isn't going to be good at what they do. The hard part is deciding how we're going to split up our $45,000.
Q. What do you do for high school students?
A. We have a college bound mentoring program called Maccs, Motivation for Academic Achievement in College Study. It was started by a board member. He gave money for an assessment which found a definite need for kids with college potential to have more support. We found that guidance counselors and career counselors were busy doing critical work and didn't have the time.
Our program was designed to hire work-study students paid by a Federal aid program. We use students from the University of Bridgeport, Fairfield University and Sacred Heart University.
Q. Do you have something focused on younger students?
A. Another board member brought a reading program called "First Day." We give a brand new book to each first-grade student on the first day of school. We have a hundred volunteers who go into the classrooms to hand them out. They have a little nameplate with their name on it.
We hoped that it would help families get their kids to school on the first day of school, not the second day, but the first day. We distribute fliers. Last year there were 2,300 first-grade students.
Q. Do you support teachers?
A. Some teachers are kind of tired. They have been in the system a long time. They have lost their enthusiasm for teaching. All over the country there are huge numbers of teachers retiring.
We want the people who are coming out of education schools to be highly qualified to teach in urban areas. We want them to like kids and want to be in our schools.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property /Lexington and Third Avenues, 42d and 43d Streets;
The Making of the Chrysler Center

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
WHEN Tishman Speyer Properties acquired the landmarked Chrysler Building, with its stainless steel peak, gargoyles and elaborate lobby, it also took possession of a far less glamorous structure at the other end of the block on 42d Street, an office building with the address of 666 Third Avenue.
Unlike the Chrysler building, which was built as a prestige project from the start (and was part of a race in the early 30's to build the world's tallest building), 666 Third Avenue was relentlessly average, with a tiny lobby, plain brick walls and an inefficient layout. 
 Named the Kent Building after its former owner, the late Jack Kent Cooke, the structure was generally seen as an annex to the Chrysler Building. Indeed some tenants occupied space in both buildings at lower levels on the 43d Street side, although the floor levels do not match.
Although most attention focused on the Chrysler Building, the purchase included the entire block between Lexington and Third Avenues and 42d and 43d Streets, with some smaller buildings occupying the mid-block area on 42d Street.
The new owners decided that with suitable alterations they could brand the entire block as the Chrysler Center, and promptly put up signs proclaiming the new name.
"We thought we could create a new neighborhood there, an eastern anchor for the new 42d Street," said Valerie Peltier, an official of Tishman Speyer who is the project manager for the Chrysler Center. Tishman Speyer officials say the budget for the entire Chrysler Center project is on the order of $100 million.
Working with the architect Philip Johnson, company executives decided to demolish the small mid-block buildings, use some of the air rights to add 130,000 square feet to the west side of what is now being called the Chrysler East building, expand and embellish the lobby and clad the entire building with a new metal and glass facade.
The remaining midblock space will be occupied by 85-foot-tall triangular glass structures that Mr. Johnson calls trylons, that are meant to evoke the distinctive shape of the top of the Chrysler Building. Tishman Speyer officials say they expect to sign up a first-class restaurant to occupy the space under the trylons. The addition to the east building was critical, said Ms. Peltier. "It was a side core building and it didn't work," she said, referring to the section of a building that contains the elevators, stairs and basic utilities that serve the adjacent office space.
By adding on to the western side of the building the core area is now in the middle and occupants of offices there can walk easily from one side of a floor to another without bumping into the core. Existing tenants have inquired about leasing space in the new section of the building to unify their operations, said Ms. Peltier, who is a daughter of Tishman Speyer's chief executive, Jerry I. Speyer.
The new space is column free, so operations that require open space, such as financial trading floors, can be accommodated.
Although the project is far from complete, Tishman Speyer has got an important vote of confidence. Credit Agricole Indosuez, a French-based bank that is the product of the merger two years ago of Credit Agricole and Banque Indosuez is leaving two other locations to occupy 130,000 square feet at Chrysler East.
AS a result they get to hang their name on the building, which will become the Credit Agricole Indosuez building, its third name in just a few years.
Mitchell S. Steir, a broker at Julien J. Studley who represented the bank, said the decision to move to the Third Avenue site from locations on the Avenue of the Amercas and Madison Avenue was made after an extensive study of real estate options, including the possibility of moving out of the city.
Because operating in two locations made daily operations and post-merger integration difficult, the bank wanted to consolidate its operations in one location. And by moving the a new location, the bank avoided the problems that might arise if one company was to move into the other's home office.
"You could see this as a trail blazing location for an international bank," Mr. Steir said. "But when you examine the quality of the renovation, the efficiency of the 32,000-square-foot floorplates and the ability to expand over time and the economics, the deal makes sense."
By moving to that location, brokers said, the bank can save as much as $10 a square foot in rent compared with prime locations in the upper 40's and mid-50's. The bank will initially occupy the seventh through 10th floors with expansion rights for the fifth and sixth floors available for growth.
And by signing up while the project is under way, the bank was able to exert influence over the design and save money by avoiding a duplication of efforts.
Like most financial institutions with elaborate-record keeping systems and trading operations, the bank wanted to install back up generators to insure a continued supply of electrical power in case of a blackout. Since the building owners wanted generators for other sections of the building, the prospective tenant and landlord worked together on the installation.
"You have to open the sidewalk to lower in the generators, so you don't want to have to do that twice," Mr. Steir said. "They can also share some things, like air shafts for the exhaust pipes. In general, a tenant can significantly lower the cost of installing power and telecommunications if it is done before the renovation is finished."
The bank expects to move in next April. Its move was delayed over complications involved with converting to the new European currency, the euro, and preparations for dealing with the year 2000 computer problem.
Credit Agricole Indosuez's metal sign will hang over a greatly revised and enlarged lobby. "There really wasn't a lobby there before, just three hallways from street entrances to the elevators," Ms. Peltier said.
The enlarged lobby will be faced with white granite and graced with art works and other Class A building touches. "It is going to look like a Park Avenue office building," she said.
The building's other systems, the heating and ventilating, the power and telecommunications are all being improved, she said, but the elevators turned out not to be a problem. "They had been redone in the 90's," she said.
Although the most obvious changes are being made to the east building, there is plenty of work to on the Chrysler Building itself.
Much of it involves the facade which, though protected as a landmark, must be brought into compliance with city regulations intended to prevent pieces from falling off buildings.
"We had to replace bricks in the facade due to deterioration," Ms. Peltier said. "So we had some bricks made up and took them to landmarks for permission to use them on the building. The bricks that were in storage were useless." In addition to replacing bricks, contractors are replacing lintels and repointing the mortar on much of the building.
Mistakes of the past are being repaired in the lobby of the Chrysler Building, where temporary lights now help illuminate a mural on the ceiling.
The mural had been hard to view, both because it had been poorly coated in the past and because holes had been cut in it in the past to accept recessed light fixtures. "We had to spend a couple of hundred thousand dollars repairing the holes in the ceiling that had been cut for light cans," Ms. Peltier said. She said the temporary lighting would eventually be replaced by fixtures that produce subdued, but adequate light, similar to the lighting at Rockefeller Center, which Tishman Speyer also manages.
One issue still under discussion is how to actually build Mr. Johnson's trylons, which will tilt at odd angles to each other. "It has taken months to do the engineering for them,"she said. "The concept is cool, but the trick is to figure out how to make them stand up."

HEADLINE: For Class of '99, A Real-Life 'Rent'

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL 

 BODY:
WITH all the scarcity, hysteria, back-stabbing and astronomical prices in the real estate market, it would hardly seem possible for young people just out of college to find apartments.
But while apartments go quickly, they can be found, even for those more interested in what they do than in what they earn. Regardless of whether they are making $20,000 a year as editorial assistants or $45,000 (before bonuses) as starting investment bankers, this year's class of graduates will find ways to live in New York, even in Manhattan. But they have to be flexible about where they will live and ruthlessly efficient in their approach. There is no time to think things over, or to get to the bank for a certified check. 
 "I tell people to bring a briefcase with cash," said John P. Burke Jr., a realtor at John P. Burke Realty on Seventh Avenue in Brooklyn who specializes in Park Slope and neighboring areas.
Although brokers say the first or second person to see an apartment nearly always takes it, they also say new places are continually coming on the market, and that any new college graduate with a job -- and without a dog -- who is also relatively presentable as well as realistic about prices can find an apartment. The market has even loosened a bit, because of new buildings going up and people leaving rentals for co-ops and condos, making it slightly easier than last year.
"It isn't quite as hysterical this year," said Soozy Katzen, director of relocation services for Fox Residential Group. "If somebody is looking for a one-bedroom, you can actually keep them busy for a day, show them eight to 10 properties." Although it has never been easy or cheap to find places in New York, it was only 12 years ago, she said, that there was a surplus of apartments and clients could be offered dozens in every part of Manhattan.
Although brokers say that many young people want to live on the Upper West Side or in the West Village, those are among the most expensive areas. And while they probably associate the Upper East Side with the un-young and the un-hip, it is the neighborhood with the largest supply of bargains. They tend to be rent-stabilized places in old walkup buildings around York and First and Second Avenues.
A few weeks ago, agreeing to a request to show his best picks in Manhattan for less-expensive apartments, Gordon Golub, a manager at Citi Habitats, showed a small but sunny one-bedroom apartment in the 70's near York Avenue, for $1,015; a one-bedroom in the same neighborhood on the sixth floor of a walkup building for $1,400 that could be shared by two people; a basement studio apartment on 32d Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues for $1,250 in an elevator building; a minuscule apartment with no kitchen and a shared bath, at Broadway in the 20's, for $595 a month, and a large and airy studio apartment on West 34th Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues, in a doorman building with elevator, for $1,200.
That neighborhood, he said, has some relative bargains, just like the Upper East Side. He said he had nothing he considered well-priced for typical new graduates either downtown or on the Upper West Side.
The Hecht Group, a brokerage company that specializes in rent-stabilized apartments on the Upper East and Upper West Sides, recently could list a number of apartments available on the Upper East Side, including a studio at Lexington Avenue and 96th Street for $899, a one-bedroom that could be shared for $1,350 at 91st Street and Second Avenue, and a two-bedroom at York Avenue and 84th Street for $1,550.
Amnon Hecht, an immigrant from Israel who started the company three years ago with his brother Oded, said the company has access to 300 apartments on any given day. Deciding who gets them, he said, often involves a lot of intuition. "When I'm sitting with a person," he said, "I see if they're a nice human being."
In Manhattan, brokers say, people get the most modern apartments for the least money in the financial district, where a number of buildings have been converted from commercial to residential use. A two-bedroom apartment that would be $4,000 on the Upper West Side might rent for $2,600 in the financial district.
Most new graduates share apartments with friends from college or home. Studios, brokers say, are more likely to be rented to people in their mid to late 20's. One-bedroom apartments in Manhattan newly occupied by only one person have become the province of the well-heeled, of a single person making more than $100,000 a year.
The sharing of apartments never meant to be shared has spawned its own language, including the elegant and totally mystifying "one-bedroom convertible." What that means is that a temporary wall costing about $800 can be used to divide the living room, creating another bedroom. It's really a continuation of dorm life, because the living room almost disappears and becomes a place holding little more than a couch and a television.
Judy Kekesi, a Corcoran Group broker, recently rented an apartment in the financial district to three men who will divide a two-bedroom renting for $2,600. "They would rather sacrifice space than location," Ms. Kekesi said. "I had somebody who was willing to put bunk beds into a one-bedroom."
DORIAN THOMPSON, who works at Macy's as an assistant buyer, found a temporary sublet when she moved here last year after graduating from Pennsylvania State University with a major in marketing. Recently, she and a friend found a one-bedroom apartment at 63d Street and First Avenue and put up a wall in the living room. Each woman pays $800 a month. Although she considers herself a downtown kind of person, Ms. Thompson likes the neighborhood.
"It's really pretty and there's a lot of young people in my building," she said. She never seriously considered living in Queens or Brooklyn, in part because she figured any savings on rent would be wiped out by the cost of cabs. Although Astoria is only 15 minutes away on the subway, it's a big psychological distance, and she couldn't imagine that she would visit people living there. "At this age," she said, "you want to be in New York. I guess I'm a Manhattan snob in that way."
Christine Ball, who just graduated from Trinity College in Hartford and is starting work as a publicist in the book business, was able to rent in one day, through the Hecht Group, a two-bedroom apartment in the 90's near York Avenue that she will share with a friend from college, for $1,350 a month.
She said she had dealt with some other brokers who tried to push her into paying a higher rent. Hecht showed her several apartments, but there was only one she could afford. She liked it and took it immediately, using her parents to guarantee the rent.
Landlords usually require either that the tenant's weekly pretax salary be equal to or greater than the monthly rent, or that the monthly rent amount to one-fortieth of the annual salary. So, depending on the landlord's requirements, a person renting an apartment for $900 a month would have to have an income of either at least $36,000 or $46,800.
For the many college graduates who are lured by far less lucrative jobs in publishing, media, retail and the arts, rent needs to be about $600 a month, or they need to find a landlord who will accept their parents as guarantors who will pay the rent if necessary.
But that system helps only the children of the affluent who live in the tristate region, because most landlords will not accept guarantors unless the guarantors live in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut and have sizable incomes of their own. Very few will accept guarantors who live in, say, Missouri, where distance makes it too hard to collect any money due.
Although some graduating seniors have already started looking for apartments, the real rush comes in July and August, brokers say. Wanting to get settled early, Bing Tien and Torun Mathias, undergraduate majors in economics who are both moving here for jobs in investment banking after they graduate from the University of Chicago, came here recently for two days to look for an apartment. They had already contacted a Citi Habitats broker and studied the company's Web site, printing out listings of apartments that seemed suitable. They had also answered ads for "no fee" apartments but never managed to find one that wasn't already taken.
They also contacted Mr. Tien's father, an engineer who lives in Cherry Hill, N.J., and he agreed to meet them here and serve as a guarantor if necessary. The group met with a broker from Citi Habitats, and from a list of a few dozen possibilities chose three. After looking at two, they knew that the third, a one-bedroom duplex apartment on 32d Street between Park and Madison, was the right one.
The rent, $2,000, meant they would pay $1,000 each, an amount higher than their salaries justified by the landlord's calculation. So, despite being among the best paid of new graduates, they needed Mr. Tien's father as a guarantor. The senior Mr. Tien had arrived with his income-tax and bank statements. And it was a good thing, because they had to move quickly.
"Every time we looked at a place, an agent from the same firm or another firm was showing the place," the younger Mr. Tien said. When he and his roommate agreed they wanted that apartment, their agent called the landlord and said they would be over immediately. The students were also prepared with their bank statements, letters certifying employment, and photo identification. And, Mr. Tien's father had brought some money orders.
"Time is everything," the younger Mr. Tien said. If his father hadn't come, and the paperwork had taken time, he is certain that someone else would have got the apartment. "It's a gorgeous apartment with a lot of space," he said.
Young people who can't afford Manhattan rents, or who prefer low-rise neighborhoods, go to Brooklyn, Queens, Jersey City and Hoboken. Although some obviously choose to live in the Bronx, or Staten Island, the majority go where their peers go, to Park Slope, to Astoria, to Williamsburg, to Greenpoint.
Mr. Burke, the broker in Park Slope, said that the "overflow" who cannot find or afford apartments in Park Slope, where there are dozens of shops, restaurants and bars, go to Kensington or Windsor Terrace, nearby neighborhoods that are another stop or two on the subway.
"Usually what I tell people is you can get 10 percent more apartment for 10 percent less money," he said. The least expensive one-bedroom he can show in Park Slope is $1,100, which few young people can afford on their own.
However, on Prospect Avenue in Windsor Terrace, which is near the Fort Hamilton stop on the F train, he has available a two-bedroom apartment in a small building for $1,400, soon to be vacated by several young men in the insurance business. And, while apartments go quickly, he says he is "loaded" with listings right now.
In Kensington, he could offer a one-bedroom apartment in a house for $900. In addition to urging that aspiring renters arrive with cash so they can immediately pay the first month's rent and security deposit, he suggests they have a letter verifying their employment date and salary, a copy of their drivers' license, and a copy of their credit report if possible.
"It's like the old West," he said. "You're either quick, or you're dead in the street."
He also suggests bringing postal money orders and an ATM card, as alternatives to cash. "For a hot apartment, it could make all the difference," he said. "I've seen people lose apartments if they have to go to the bank."
While it is his job to provide landlords with cooperative tenants who can pay the rent, there are two categories of people who have a lot of trouble no matter how wonderful or how rich they are: lawyers, and people with dogs. Mr. Burke said he had been trying for six months to get an apartment for a young woman with a dog, and even has mug shots of the dog from various angles to show potential landlords.
"I tell people to bring pictures of the dog lying down," he said. "Half asleep is good. Docile, fat, old and half asleep is really good."
Lawyers have a difficult time because landlords tend to find them combative and litigious.
Less expensive than Park Slope and very attractive at the moment to people in their 20's are Williamsburg and Greenpoint, which are both less than 30 minutes from Manhattan on the subway. In Greenpoint, an apartment with four rooms and hardwood floors can be found for $1,200; a spacious two-bedroom that can easily be shared, without putting up any walls can be found for $1,400, and a three-bedroom would be $1,800.
"People from all over the country are moving here," said Ursula Doukhowetzky, the owner of Ula's Real Estate in Greenpoint. "They hear about it in Texas," she added, with a touch of amazement.
For the longtime Polish residents of Greenpoint, the invasion is welcome if they are property owners, but not so welcome if they are renters. "Local people cannot afford this rent," she said, and so they are moving farther out, to Queens.
Mrs. Doukhowetzky said that the minute she gets a listing, she rents it. The first person who sees it, she said, usually takes it. "They just say, 'Wow,' " she said. "They are surprised by what they are getting. And they go straight to the bank." Greenpoint seems particularly popular now, she said, with young fashion designers.
In Queens, young professionals are moving in droves to Astoria, which has long been a Greek-American stronghold. It's a working class neighborhood, like Greenpoint, with a number of old walkup apartment buildings and apartments in two- and three-family houses.
Grace O'Sullivan, a manager at Aamen Realty on Broadway in Astoria, said that many young people arrive having heard of Astoria but knowing little about it. They sometimes come with unrealistic expectations, she said, thinking they can find elevator buildings with health clubs.
They can't. But they can find very sunny apartments that have been cleanly renovated, often with great views of the Manhattan skyline, about two or three blocks from the Broadway stop on the N train, about 15 minutes from Manhattan.
She can show one-bedroom apartments with big eat-in kitchens for $900, or a two-bedroom apartment for $1,200 that could be shared. Most of the apartments in the larger buildings are rent-stabilized.
Although there is enormous demand in Astoria, she said, she can always find something for someone "when I commit to working with them." She said her exclusive listings with landlords rest on her ability to find responsible tenants, a process that many brokers mention. They use their instincts to figure out whether a prospective client will be a good tenant.
"We try to get a good feeling from them," she said. "We really observe their behavior in the office." A young man who was snooping around her desk would be in for some deeper than usual scrutiny, she said. What turns off landlords, she added, is someone who comes in and starts asking too many questions in a negative way, about things like cockroaches.
And some landlords care deeply about appearances, she said, so sometimes she has to tell a potential tenant to leave the nose rings at home.
Recently, two men aspiring to be Astorians walked in looking for help: Ben Stillman, who recently graduated from the University of Virginia and is planning to start graduate school in social work at Columbia University in December, and Hans Dempsey, who is graduating from Mary Washington College in Virginia with a major in French and planning to find work with an international company.
They had decided on Astoria after looking at the cost of apartments in Manhattan. "We looked at Manhattan and realized we can live far more lavishly if we live 10 minutes away," said Mr. Dempsey. Apparently judging them good prospects, despite their lack of jobs, an agent in the office, Monique Peron, led them away to see a two-bedroom apartment in a two-family house.
Although they didn't take that apartment, after leaving New York they agreed to take a place in Astoria sight unseen because their broker assured them they would like it.
Brokers, of course, are too expensive for many people, but working without them can be arduous. There are a few other alternatives. Megan Dineen, who graduated from college a year ago and moved to Hoboken, would prefer to be in Manhattan, and recently paid $150 to use a Web site, www.mlx.com, that provides lists of available apartments. She said it seems to offer useful information, although she hasn't yet found a place she likes.
Although some college graduates arrive with roommates, others look for them when they get here. Holly Policy, who graduated in December from the University of Florida, came to New York with a friend and $1,200. Just as she was down to her last $20, she found an entry level job in a media company. Since her arrival, she has been living in the attic of a house in Jamaica, Queens, with a friend for $200 a month, and making a one-hour commute.
So recently she paid $265 to sign up with Roommate Finders, which gives her names of people who might be good matches. Miss Policy never even tried going through brokers to find a place because their fees, 10 to 15 percent of a year's rent, are too high.
MOST of the places she has seen through Roommate Finders have not appealed to her, but recently she found a place, and a person, she liked, in a railroad flat on the Upper West Side. Her share would be $615 a month, and she would get her own bedroom, although her roommate would have to pass through it to get to her bedroom. So far, they are in the questioning stage, finding out about each other, and considering the match.
Although some about-to-be-graduates have already started looking, the rush really begins in June and accelerates from there. Some apartment seekers who have been arriving in the last week or so have learned that they are too early. Lauren Levitt, who just graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and is planning to share a place with Boris Bogatin and David Cotterman, fellow Penn graduates, was looking at apartments recently with a Citi Habitats broker.
Because they don't need the apartment until July, she will have to come back in mid-June, when her roommates will be out of the country, and try to find a place for the three of them.
Ms. Katzen of Fox Real Estate, who deals with a lot of bankers and lawyers, said that July and August are so busy "I never see my house in the country."
After graduation, she said, they all "take their last exotic trip around the world." And then they come to her, looking for a place. Sometimes, she tells them not to worry so much about what their apartments look like. "I tell them, you'll never be there," she said. "You're going to go home to sleep and send out for Chinese. They're really worked to death."
Indeed. Alan Kelly, who is moving to New York after he graduates from Williams College in Massachusetts, will share an apartment with two friends, and they will all work in investment banking. He said he knows he'll be working "80 or 90" hours a week, but the three men have decided that the West Village is the place for them, because it's so convenient.
The other day, they were on their way to New York to look at a place on West 10th Street with a doorman and three bedrooms for $3,500 a month. And the broker told them to hurry, because three guys were coming down from Yale to see the same place.
"Basically, it's entirely a scare tactic, I'm sure," said Larsen Fusco, who will share the apartment with Mr. Kelly. But nevertheless, they were planning to give it a look, before going off to Hilton Head on vacation.

HEADLINE: In the Region / New Jersey;
Jersey City Seeing Riverfronts Activity

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
TWO speculative office buildings now rising on Jersey City's Hudson River waterfront have been or will soon be fully leased in less than a year, prompting their developers to start new office towers and other developers to start their own projects.
The buildings, one with 434,000 square feet at Newport Center and the other with 422,000 square feet at 90 Hudson Street, will be completed this fall. 
The additional office buildings on which work is now under way or about to begin total almost 1.7 million square feet of new or renovated space, much of it to be built on speculation.
In this round of construction developers are betting lightning will strike twice, given what they say is an unmet demand for new space at the water's edge. Indeed, there are users in the market, including PricewaterhouseCoopers and Thompson Financial, known to be shopping for more than 2 million square feet of space, commercial brokers report.
Last week plans were announced to add a three-story, 185,000-square-foot office building atop a seven-story, 1,100-car parking garage as well as a 350-room hotel at the Harborside Financial Center. The office building and garage are to be developed by the center's owner, the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation; the hotel is a joint venture with the Hyatt Hotels Corporation. The office building is being designed to the requirements of Waterhouse Securities, a discount brokerage concern, which will be its sole occupant.
With the dearth of new construction in Manhattan as well as in the other boroughs of New York City and in its suburbs, brokers and developers add, Jersey City's waterfront is well positioned to continue to draw tenants from across the river in search of larger and less expensive space.
Earlier this month, after having successfully wooed PaineWebber, Cigna and U.S Trust to its Newport Office Center III building, which is now nearing completion, the Lefrak Organization of Rego Park, Queens, broke ground for an 800,000-square-foot, 22-story speculative tower.
"This market is developing because there not only is a need for space now but a need for space at an affordable price," said Richard S. LeFrak, the company's president.
Lefrak is using its own money to finance the new building, known as Newport Office Center IV, which is expected to cost more than $100 million. It will rise north of Newport Office Center III, which has been renamed the PaineWebber building after its principal tenant.
The office towers are within the 600-acre Newport mixed-use development at the northern end of the city's waterfront, which will be connected to other riverfront developments by the light-rail system now under construction. The first phase, from Bayonne to Hoboken and including Newport, is expected to be completed by mid-2001.
About a mile south, Hartz Mountain Industries, of Secaucus has signed on Lord, Abbett & Company and National Discount Brokers Group as tenants at 90 Hudson Street, its 422,000-square-foot speculative building. And commercial brokers report that American Express is expected to sign on for the building's remaining 176,000 square feet as soon as next month.
Emanuel Stern, president of Hartz, would neither confirm or deny the interest of American Express in the building. But he did say that once the first building is leased his company will move forward with a second building, 70 Hudson Street, which will be similar in size to the first one and could also be built on speculation. It will rise next to the first building on the 20-acre site that once held Colgate Palmolive's toothpaste factory, which Hartz now controls.
AT the same time SJP Properties of Parsippany plans by early next year to transform into modern office space a 300,000-square-foot former manufacturing building at 74 Grand Street, behind the former Colgate site and inland from the river.
The rapid pace of leasing at the two speculative riverfront buildings, and the plans for more projects, testify to the strength of the office market along Jersey City's waterfront. Like Manhattan, the waterfront continues to be driven by financial services firms, said Robert Rudin, an executive managing director at the Saddle Brook office of Insignia/ESG, the national commercial brokerage firm. As long as Wall Street remains healthy, the next round of waterfront office construction should do well, he said.
There has been tremendous leasing activity in Manhattan in the last year," added Kenneth Krasnow, director of business development at Cushman & Wakefield, another national commercial brokerage. "That has pushed midtown firms downtown, and now that that space is filling the next natural progression" is the waterfront on the New Jersey side of the Hudson, which he called "an extension of downtown."
In today's tight employment market large companies tied to Manhattan can move part of their operations across the river and "still be close enough not to lose their workforce," said Mr. Krasnow.
Robert Freedman, vice chairman of the board at GVA Williams, a commercial brokerage in Manhattan, noted that downtown Manhattan executives also can actually see buildings on the New Jersey waterfront from their windows, which is a psychological benefit. Added to that, he said, is the fact that in the last two and a half years "Jersey City's waterfront has emerged as the low-cost provider of space."
As New York rents increase Jersey City's economic advantages have become more attractive. There is no corporate occupancy tax and while asking rents in the best building have inched up to an average of $33 a square foot a year they are still lower than those in Manhattan, which average $47 a square foot, but climb to $61 in prime midtown locations.
In addition, operating costs and real estate taxes are well below those in New York and the waterfront area is in a state-designated Urban Enterprise zone, where most corporate tenants pay no sales tax.
Some brokers said that an added factor was that while New York has provided tax incentives to retain major companies, primarily in Manhattan, little has been done to lure tenants to the other boroughs. On the other hand, New Jersey has helped developers with a state program that offers financial incentives to companies relocating or expanding anywhere in the state.
UNDER that program, initiated two and a half years ago, up to 80 percent of the personal income tax revenue generated by each new employee brought on the tax rolls can be returned to the companies for up to 10 years.
"It's a compelling program because it could shave an additional $3 to $5 a square foot per year off rents," Mr. Freedman said. As a result, he added, rents on the waterfront could be 25 to 40 percent lower than those for comparable space in Manhattan.
Along with accessibility and affordability Jersey City's waterfront is now also a mature market. Over the last two and a half years some 1,500 new riverside residential units have been added to the thousands that already exist, bolstering the office sector by providing housing to employees and bringing life to the area after the offices close. And the two office towers started last year increased the amount of offices built there to 7.4 million square feet, with a vacancy rate of just 2.3 percent.
"There is a greater critical mass and people like go where there are people," said Edwin H. Cohen, an executive director at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield, who is handling the leasing at the Newport buildings. "Most of the users we are talking to are not reluctant brides."
With the two speculative buildings now rising basically spoken for, available space is shrinking elsewhere along the waterfront.
At the same time, space is tightening along the entire Hudson County portion of the riverfront, which had a vacancy rate of 5.9 percent as of the first quarter of this year. The same is true for midtown and downtown Manhattan, which registered overall vacancy rates 8.3 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively, in the first quarter, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
Just as Manhattan's space squeeze is a boost for Jersey City's waterfront so is the lack of new speculative construction anywhere is the region. While financing to start new buildings is available it is still dependent on finding a tenant. "This is one of those markets in which cash is king," said Mr. Krasnow.
"There are no alternatives, and we have the wherewithal to start a building without tenants," said Mr. LeFrak of the Lefrak Organization. "Jersey City, is a little bit of a field of dreams in that our philosophy is 'build it and they will come.' "
The market is strong enough to fill another 800,000-square-foot building, he said, adding: "We're building into an established community and providing a very good mousetrap."
Asking rents at the Newport Center IV are $30 a square foot a year, plus utilities. Occupancy is scheduled for September 2000.
"Speculative construction is a game of musical chairs," said Mr. Stern of Hartz. "It has to be done at the right time of the real estate cycle and right now we're in the middle of a good cycle." He said construction of 70 Hudson Street was expected to begin well before the end of the year.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: WASHINGTON HEIGHTS;
Bodegas Closed. Owners Cry Foul.

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
The Dume-Checo Grocery on the southeast corner of 162d Street and Fort Washington Avenue is boarded up and padlocked. The bodega had been operating on the ground floor of a residential building for 12 years before the city's Department of Buildings shut it down last month, said the president of the Dominican-Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Jose D. Marte.
Across the street, another bodega has also been shuttered. That one, Mr. Marte said, had been operating for eight years. 
 The city has been closing down businesses illegally operating out of residential buildings as it steps up enforcement of zoning laws, said a Buildings Department spokesman, Paul Wein. But because many of the businesses are in upper Manhattan and are owned by Dominican shopkeepers, Dominican political and business leaders say they are concerned that the city is unfairly singling out their neighborhoods to pave the way for future development.
The Consul General of the Dominican Republic, Bienvenido Perez, said he was worried that the closings will create unemployment and that people will lose services. "Most of these owners who are being closed out have invested most of their resources into these businesses," he said. "The closures will affect their families and all the Dominicans in the surrounding neighborhood."
The Buildings Department has shut seven illegal stores in Manhattan this year, Mr. Wein said. He said he did not know how many were in Washington Heights. All were shut in response to complaints from neighborhood residents, he said.
Mr. Marte estimated that 15 stores had been been closed or given notice in the last five months. On Post Avenue near 204th Street, a meat market, a grocery and an international money transfer office are padlocked on one side of the block. Mr. Marte said the owners of a travel agency, a grocery and a barbershop across the street told him that the city had told them to close. He said shop owners usually leased their spaces and were unaware that operating a business in a residential building is illegal.
Mr. Marte is an accountant who worked in a bodega when he first came to the United States in 1969 from the Dominican Republic, and later opened his own bodega on 170th Street. "When Spanish people buy a store like that, you get your mother, your sister, everyone gives you a little money so you can open the store," he said. "At least the city should give them a couple of years so they can relocate."
The president of the Federation of Dominico-Hispano Chambers of Commerce, Agustin Garcia, said the city should re-evaluate its zoning to accommodate the businesses. "We took areas that were dilapidated and falling apart and made this into a vibrant neighborhood," he said. "That type of contribution makes you entitled to some support." NINA SIEGAL

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
A New Kind of Fed Watch: The Changing of the Guard

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DURING a House Banking Committee hearing earlier this month, Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama, warmly praised Robert E. Rubin, the outgoing Treasury Secretary. Then he turned to Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who was sitting beside Mr. Rubin at the witness table.
"We ought to put you under protective custody," Mr. Bachus told Mr. Greenspan. "I hope you're well guarded and have good doctors advising you." 
 Now, Mr. Greenspan does not have many enemies these days, and at 73 he is apparently healthy and shows no signs of decamping to a retirement condo. But Mr. Bachus had a point.
Especially with Mr. Rubin's resignation, Mr. Greenspan is the embodiment of economic policy in the United States. His departure, under any circumstances, would create a crisis of confidence. And it is hard to see an obvious replacement waiting in the wings.
Mr. Greenspan's third four-year term as Fed chairman will expire in just over a year. He has not given any public hint about his plans. The betting in Washington is that he will choose to stay for another term, that President Clinton will be happy to nominate him and that the Senate will confirm him expeditiously.
But Mr. Greenspan could still prove to be less out of the Cal Ripken mold -- an Iron Man soldiering on, but at risk of playing past his prime -- and more of a Michael Jordan, choosing to retire while on top of his game. For an economic policy maker, on top might be defined as next year, when the current expansion will become the longest in the nation's history.
IN any case, since Mr. Greenspan's willingness and ability to serve another term are not sure things, speculation has begun about who will be tapped to succeed him, whenever he goes. Here is a handicapper's guide to likely entries in the race. (The list would look very different if that moment comes after a new President is elected, especially a Republican President.)
* William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is on nearly everyone's list. He is the leading candidate from within the Federal Reserve, if only because of the key role the New York Fed plays in monitoring the financial system at home and abroad. A former banker and diplomat, he played an important part in orchestrating the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management last year and is active in efforts to strengthen global banking standards. But while he is well known on Wall Street, he is little known in Washington. And although he votes loyally with Mr. Greenspan on interest rate policy, he has never established a strong public reputation as an inflation fighter. Early line: 4-1.
* As vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alice M. Rivlin is an obvious candidate, and within the White House the notion of appointing a woman to the post has some appeal. But while she is a well-respected economist, she is viewed with some suspicion on Wall Street, and she may have diminished her influence within the Fed by spending much of her time helping the District of Columbia clean up its finances.
Early line: 10-1.
* Janet L. Yellen, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, is also seen by Administration insiders as a viable candidate. A former Fed governor, she has a strong reputation among academic economists as well as Washington experience. But some analysts question whether she has the leadership qualities a Fed chief needs.
Early line: 15-1.
* Other long shot candidates include Laurence H. Meyer, who was appointed a Fed governor by Mr. Clinton and is the board's most outspoken proponent of orthodox inflation fighting (20-1). Outside of the Fed, Mr. Clinton could turn to a corps of executives who move between the worlds of Washington and finance. Among them is Franklin D. Raines, the former White House budget chief, who is now chief executive at Fannie Mae (25-1).
* Of course, Mr. Clinton has two other candidates he can call on in a pinch. One is Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary and Mr. Clinton's nominee to succeed Mr. Rubin. A brilliant economist and a forceful personality, Mr. Summers has all the gravitas the Fed job requires and seems to be learning the art of keeping his mouth closed when circumstances dictate, a requirement for any Fed chairman. Among his fans is Mr. Greenspan, who publicly endorsed his nomination for Treasury Secretary. Should Mr. Clinton need him more at the Fed than at Treasury, Mr. Summers would be the clear favorite (2-1).
* Then there is Bob Rubin. The outgoing Treasury Secretary shows no signs of wanting to come back to Washington. Moreover, he is not an economist and could find the intricacies of monetary policy heavy going. But his reputation on Wall Street is second only to that of Mr. Greenspan. And if there were a crisis, and the President called . . . .
(A lead-pipe cinch, but only under those unlikely circumstances).
In the meantime, is there a second to that motion for protective custody?

HEADLINE: PRIVATE SECTOR;
From Brazil to Wall St. and Back

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO

 BODY:
THE United States has had only two central bank chiefs in the last two decades, but boom-and-bust Brazil has had 20, an average of one a year.
Now, three months into the term of the newest head of Brazil's central bank, Arminio Fraga Neto, a soft-spoken former hedge fund manager for the billionaire investor George Soros, Brazilians hope that the roller-coaster ride is smoothing out. They also hope that Mr. Fraga, like the United States' departing Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, can use his experience in the high echelons of finance to advance his government's goals. 
 "The market was in need of a respected trader, and Fraga filled this gap," said Fernao Bracher, a former president of the central bank who is now the head of Banco BBA Creditanstalt, an investment bank here.
But Mr. Fraga, who is 41, brings more than trading experience to his new post. While overseeing emerging-markets investments for Mr. Soros, he also taught part-time at Columbia University. Now, back in Brazil, he has been credited as the driving force in restoring Brazil's credibility with foreign investors in the wake of a currency crisis earlier this year.
Mr. Fraga's course in bringing the country back from the economic brink was relatively straightforward:
Knowing that the devaluation of Brazil's currency would make imports more expensive, he sought to pare consumer demand by raising interest rates to 45 percent. The high rates also helped attract foreign capital. Mr. Fraga, who holds both Brazilian and American citizenship, then traveled to the United States, where he convinced large banks to renew credit lines to Brazil. Since then, interest rates have declined rapidly, to 23.5 percent, and Mr. Fraga has signaled that they have further to fall. But after a 10.9 percent stock market tumble in the last two weeks, more work may be needed first.
"Arminio was very bright and very tough, and he had a hard time choosing between university and the private sector," said Winston Fritsch, his former colleague on the faculty of Pontifical Catholic University here and now president of the Brazilian operations of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, an investment bank.
In fact, Mr. Fraga has kept a foot in both camps since receiving a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in 1985. Before working for Mr. Soros, he was at Salomon Brothers and Banco Garantia, a leading Brazilian investment bank now owned by Credit Suisse First Boston. In 1984, he worked for the Federal Reserve's research division in Washington.
The international finance course Mr. Fraga taught at Columbia illustrates how his varied experience helped him prepare for leading the central bank, where he worked in a lower-level job in the early 1990's. Students wrote a a hypothetical memo to the finance minister of a country of their choice, diagnosing the country's problems and proposing solutions. Next, they wrote an investment report about a country.
"Factoring in this whole globalization thing helped people to think of how markets would react," Mr. Fraga said in an interview at the central bank's branch here, his relaxed manner and careful choice of words seeming more suitable to a professor than a power broker.
"Approaching problems from both sides of the fence is necessary," he added. In Brazil, Mr. Fraga hopes to continue teaching, with a similar course planned for later this year at the Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a prestigious local economics institute.
Although Mr. Fraga has captured the public imagination in a way his 19 recent predecessors never did, he has also faced challenges. When he appeared before a congressional committee considering his nomination, an issue was made of his dual citizenship. Mr. Fraga, who grew up in Rio in a family of doctors, responded that it was because his mother was an American, which had little relevance to his ability to protect Brazil's economic interests.
More troubling, an opposition politician compared him to a fox guarding the chicken coop, because of his previous work for the type of hedge fund that can wreak havoc on emerging-market currencies. During later testimony, he often appeared tired while explaining the workings of the central bank to senators with little knowledge of the institution. "I'm not used to the public speaking and the politics and all that," he said.
And last week, his aides were denying a critical report in the nation's leading news magazine, Veja, that he had been dismissed by Mr. Soros because of bad bets on Asia. They said there were bad bets, but no dismissal.
In another congressional appearance, Mr. Fraga had to rebut accusations that the central bank, under his predecessor Francisco Lopes, acted improperly during the sharp shift in exchange-rate policy in January. Nevertheless, his greatest political strength may well be that he was not involved in that change.
Politics notwithstanding, Mr. Fraga is settling back into life in Brazil. Like many high-ranking officials, he chose to live away from Brasilia, the capital city deep in the interior.
Instead, he moved his family to Rio and takes an hour-and-a-half flight each Monday and Friday. In Brasilia, he stays in an apartment and tries to take walks before work -- an activity that he says helps him think and sleep better.
During weekends in Rio, he has become a fixture at the Gavea Golf Club, where he plays golf with his 13-year-old son, Sylvio. As for his staying power at the central bank, Mr. Fraga remains cautious. "We're playing the third hole in a 72-hole tourney," he said. "It's a good start, but that's all it is."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Silverado;
The Cover Is Familiar But the Book Is All New

BYLINE: By JAMES G. COBB 

DATELINE: HOLTON, Kan.

 BODY:
HOW important are General Motors' full-size pickups? Check out Wall Street's numbers or Main Street's traffic. These are the company's most popular products, with some 700,000 sold annually. They are lucrative, returning several thousand dollars in profit for each one sold. They also serve as the basis for a fleet of big sport utilities that account for another 400,000 even more profitable sales.
Furthermore, with demand exceeding supply, G.M. hopes to ramp up production this year to build an additional 300,000 trucks and sport utilities. If it succeeds, it could end up with $30 billion in annual sales from this platform -- enough to rank in the top 35 of the Fortune 500, exceeding the value of all the microchips from Intel, all the drugs from Merck, all the sodas and snacks from Pepsico. G.M. can use a runaway hit, particularly as it has lost its ranking as the world's largest industrial company. Ford claimed that title on Friday when G.M. spun off its huge Delphi parts operation. 
 Or, if you prefer anecdotal evidence to raw numbers, look at the streets of Middle America. In this town of 4,000 a half-hour from Topeka, where the economic focus shifted long ago from farming to commuting, one thing has not changed. A lot of folks here, where I grew up, like Chevy pickups. You see them in many of the parking spaces around the monumental county courthouse, and they are lined up at the Dairy Queen drive-through. Along some roads there seems to be a pickup wearing a Chevy bow tie in almost every driveway.
Trucks account for 6 of every 10 sales at Clark Chevrolet Oldsmobile Pontiac Buick, said Bernie Clark, co-owner of the dealership with his two brothers, and 90 percent of those trucks are full-sized Silverados. Once relegated to the farm or job site, they now routinely provide family transportation.
Like most truck owners, Mr. Clark's customers are stubbornly loyal; about 80 percent are repeat buyers. Over the years -- the family's ties to the dealership date to 1947 -- some customers have driven away in as many as 15 trucks.
Such loyalty helps to explain why G.M. has changed everything about its full-size pickups except the essential way they look. The styling is new, yes, but even a trained eye must look twice to tell a '99 from a '98. G.M. says this is by design, and it marshals surveys indicating that many truck shoppers find the Ford F-Series too cute and the Dodge Ram too brutish -- never mind that the F-Series still outsells Chevy's truck, and that the latest Ram has grabbed a much bigger market share. But one has to believe that other buyers, after plunking down as much as $33,000, want the neighbors to know they've sprung for something new.
And under the skin, the Silverado certainly is new. After a 10-year run for the C/K series, G.M. put all its might into making the replacements a success. It came up with new engines, a new frame, new brakes. The crowning touch is a classy cabin that makes the competition's look, well, truck-like.
The Silverado isn't perfect -- it lacks the fourth door that many buyers now consider essential -- but it is genuinely pleasant in other important ways. Not that the C/K is bad -- it remains, despite its dated design, one of the easiest-driving pickups -- but the Silverado handles more securely, accelerates more briskly, consumes less fuel and provides far more comfort and convenience. (The C/K is still built in two plants, alongside Silverados, to fill fleet orders.)
There are five engine choices: The 4.3-liter V6 is carried over, but the 4.8- and 5.3-liter V8's are new, though based on the aluminum Corvette engine. There is also a new 6-liter V8 for three-quarter-ton trucks. And, for those who want to move mountains, there is a 6.5-liter turbo-diesel V8 producing 440 foot-pounds of peak torque.
 Prices start around $16,000 for a plain two-wheel-drive model. The truck I drove in Kansas, a two-wheel-drive LS 1500 extended cab, had a list price of $26,692; in New York, I had a four-wheel-drive LS priced at $32,203. I also tested an extended-cab GMC Sierra SLT -- except for its nose, the Sierra is much the same -- with a flared Sportside bed; its sticker was just over $33,000.
 All three test vehicles were equipped the way most of these trucks will be, with the 5.3-liter V8. It is a honey, another example of how G.M. has put new life in old pushrod designs. Ford, meanwhile, has added more modern overhead-cam V8's that will allow it to cut truck emissions next year to the stricter level required of cars.
The Chevy engine is smooth and gutsy, with 270 horsepower and 315 foot-pounds of torque, and it ought to please everyone from hockey mom to cattle hauler. The torque curve is flatter for more pull over a wider speed range. The four-speed automatic transmission (a five-speed manual is standard) felt rugged and workmanlike. It offers a towing mode that shifts at higher speeds.
Four-wheel-drive pickups are available with a transfer case that engages all four wheels automatically when it senses a loss of traction, along with a standard four-wheel setting and a low range for serious muck.
Silverados now come with either of two types of steering. Lightweight two-wheel-drive models get a nimble rack-and-pinion system, while four-wheel-drive trucks have a conventional recirculating ball that can stand up to heavy use. The latter system can seem numb at times, but I prefer it to the nervous feel of the Ford.
The Silverado still handles like a pickup, but it is honest and balanced. The chassis keeps you aware of its limits, giving you confidence in how it will behave in any maneuver. A dignified highway cruiser, it is maneuverable enough in town and unruffled on back roads. Some cars should do so well.
 And so it is with the brakes, never before anything to brag about. There are disks front and back, and the pads are 40 percent larger. A four-wheel anti-lock function is standard. Stops are sure and straight and the pedal is firm now, not spongy.
 The ride, too, is car-like, refined and quiet on all but the worst roads. The optional firm-ride suspension indeed stiffens the ride, but it adds little to the handling.
Of all the improvements, the cabin stands out; a lot of thought went into the needs of pickup owners. The outside mirrors are large and handsome and the inside door handles are big and easy to grip. The glove box is split into compartments. (Even the cargo box can be divided by thirds.) The gauges are large and legible, and there is an information center that relays up to 18 messages, from "cargo lamp on" to "transmission fluid hot." The knobs are durable and the buttons are big and chunky. Window and lock controls are lighted at night, just like those in a nice sedan. Power is retained after the key is switched off, letting you roll up the windows or catch the end of a song.
 There are sour notes, but they are minor. The dash and console comprise so many pieces that there seems to be seams everywhere; imagine trying to clean up a spilled Coke! The optional CD player is down near the console, far from the radio. The ashtray, lighter and two auxiliary outlets reside under a top-hinged lid that hides them even when open. As usual, the G.M. cruise-control switches on the turn signal stalk are clunky.
One design oddity: The most prominent place on the overhead console is a blank panel. Buttons for G.M.'s Onstar driver service may eventually go there; meanwhile, it is a waste of prime real estate.
And, while I'm at it, some more gripes: The door locks engage as the truck moves, but when you stop you have to unlock them manually; once parked, a handle pull should suffice. The console box is big and deep, but the lid won't stay open. And, as usual with G.M. vehicles, the combination of daytime running lights -- I'm not a fan -- and an automatic light control can be baffling: Are the headlights on, or just the driving lights? Do I need to switch the lights off, or will they go out on their own? Why do the lights have to be on if I want to idle inconspicuously?
My favorite thing about the Silverado may be the optional six-way power seats, which just could be the best G.M. has ever put in an American vehicle. Accommodating for anyone up to World Wrestling Federation size, they are highly adjustable and attractive. The headrests are good and the lumbar adjustments are great, taking the lower backrest from pillow-soft to rock-hard. Safety belts are mounted to the seats, aiding access to the rear.
Until now, the back seats in extended cabs have ranged from unpleasant to ridiculous. But here finally is a rear seat where adults can sit in reasonable comfort. The bottom cushion is 2.4 inches longer, and there are four more inches of leg room. The backrest is slanted, not bolt-upright, and there are even two headrests, a cup holder and ventilation ducts. There is a price to pay for this spaciousness, though; the cab's longer roofline looks a bit ungainly.
If the Silverado sets new standards for pickups, as I think it does, is there anything about it to give one pause? Well, aside from the conservative styling, there's that lack of a fourth door, which will arrive in the fall. This is no small oversight: Buyers of extended-cab pickups have expressed a clear preference for two small rear-hinged doors. The Silverado's third door, on the passenger side, always seemed to be where the cargo and passengers were not.
The company says it wanted to be sure it had a safe, solid design for a four-door Silverado. That is commendable. But after Dodge brought out its Ram Quad Cab, Ford quickly matched it, then offered four doors for all its trucks. G.M.'s tardiness points up, again, how slow reaction times force the company to keep playing catch-up.
Still, G.M. has done a remarkable job of fundamentally remaking the full-size truck. But it rests at its peril; Toyota is just out with its full-size Tundra. It replaces the T-100, an uncharacteristic disappointment from a company that doesn't make the same mistakes twice. And by the time Ford and Dodge remake their big trucks in a few years, you can bet they'll have dissected the Silverado down to the last screw.
 
INSIDE TRACK: A truck just one door short of stardom.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Even up front, styling differences between the '98 C/K, left, and Silverado are subtle. With more room and better controls, the Silverado's cabin sets new truck standards. The Pontiac-GMC Division is intent on carving out and upscape niche distinct from Chevy trucks, but differences between the Sierra, shown as a Sportside 4WD extended cab, remain mostly cosmetic. The sheetmetal is different from the windshiels forward.

For Ad AgencyGiants, The Weather Is Just Right

BYLINE: By JOANNE LEGOMSKY 

 BODY:
BENEATH the patina of economic abundance, business competition is intensifying. Hard-pressed to fatten profits by cutting costs or raising prices, companies are pursuing a time-honored alternative -- trying to bolster sales by shoveling money into advertising.
"Businesses hate sinking money into advertising," said Mark Greenberg, manager of the Invesco Leisure fund, which counts some big ad agency companies among its core holdings. "But they can't afford to underspend the other guy." 
 Last year was the fifth in a row that the growth in advertising spending in the United States outpaced the growth of the economy, rising 7.1 percent, to $200.8 billion, against a 3.9 percent increase in the gross domestic product.
That story has not eluded the stock market: The average total return of the Big Four global agency holding companies -- Omnicom Group, Interpublic Group, Young & Rubicam and WPP Group -- was 37.7 percent for the 12 months ending Friday, versus 18.6 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Analysts say there is reason to believe that the stocks haven't finished their climb. "Ad stocks have a consistent record of expanded earnings outperformance late in the economic cycle," said William Bird, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
Mr. Bird attributes the outperformance to several factors, including the big agencies' global scope, which limits exposure to any single country's economy. He also cites flexible cost structures -- meaning that with staff representing about 60 percent of costs, the big companies can readily economize by trimming their work forces -- and their ability to grow through acquisitions.
Indeed, he thinks some of the stocks are relatively cheap, as illustrated by their P.E.G. ratios -- the projected price-to-earnings multiple for 2000, divided by longer-term projected earnings growth rates. Interpublic, Omnicom and Young & Rubicam have P.E.G. ratios of 1.8, 2.0 and 1.2, respectively, versus 5.4 for the S. & P. 500, Mr. Bird said -- much greater discounts than usual. He expects Omnicom, which closed on Friday at $70, to rise to $83 in 12 to 18 months; Interpublic, now at $75.75, to hit $88, and Y. & R., now at $38.25, to hit $50.
There are worries, certainly. Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that any weakening of the global economy could pose a big risk to ad agency stocks, because corporate advertising budgets are tied to sales forecasts.
But what some investors do not realize, she added, is that more agency revenue is coming from recession-resistant services like public relations and direct marketing. Those businesses now account for $200 billion of the $417 billion in industry revenue worldwide, she said.
The economic downturn of 1990-91, which contributed to the worst advertising recession ever, was an aberration, according to Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at McCann-Erickson U.S.A., which is owned by Interpublic. "Companies abandoned marginal brands and waged a no-win strategy of slashing prices to move inventory," he said.
Ms. Fine is especially bullish on Omnicom. Excluding its growing portfolio of Internet agencies, she expects the company's earnings to keep rising 15 to 20 percent a year.
Mr. Greenberg, the Invesco manager, also expects agency stocks to keep generating double-digit earnings growth for the foreseeable future. Omnicom represents 4 percent of his fund's assets; WPP, 3.3 percent, and Y. & R., 1 percent.
Whether marketers favor cable, billboards or the Internet, he said, "advertising will always be important."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Charles Albers;
Oppenheimer Main Street Growth and Income Fund

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN 

 BODY:
IN April 1998, Charles E. Albers moved his computer models from Park Avenue to Main Street. Or, to be more exact, from the Guardian Park Avenue fund, where he had been manager for 26 years, to Main Street Income and Growth, managed by the Oppenheimer Funds.
Having beaten the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by an average of 3.7 percentage points a year at Guardian, where he was a pioneer among fund managers in using quantitative methods to pick stocks, Mr. Albers was hired by Oppenheimer to turn around Income and Growth, which had fallen on hard times. 
 How is he doing? So far, the results from his Oppenheimer office in the World Trade Center in Manhattan are encouraging, if not overwhelming. In the 13 months since he and his associate, Nikolaos Monoyios, have been in charge, the fund is up 18.2 percent, substantially ahead of the 13.9 percent average for its peer group of large-company blend funds.
But the fund -- whose name has been reconfigured to Main Street Growth and Income, to reflect the managers' emphasis on total return, not just income -- has trailed the S. & P. by 1.4 percentage points. Performance has weakened in 1999; the fund is up 6.3 percent through May 21, versus 7.2 percent for its peers and 8.7 percent for the S. & P 500.
Mr. Albers said the gains slowed because he had positioned the fund to take advantage of the historically strong first-quarter performance of value-oriented stocks, a phenomenon that failed to develop this year. "Although our models are good, they are not infallible," he said.
When Mr. Albers started managing money in the 1960's, most stock pickers had no data-based system, he said. But after studying econometrics at Columbia University and working at Value Line, he developed a ranking system that, while primitive, imposed a logic on his moves.
"I felt like a one-eyed man in the land of the blind," the professorial-looking manager told a recent Morningstar conference in Chicago.
That initial model ranked stocks on three factors; he now considers 15 to 20, from price and earnings momentum to valuation and special events like stock buybacks. In 1990, when Guardian Park Avenue was floundering because it was tilted toward small-cap and value stocks, Mr. Albers started using some broad, macroeconomic factors in his system, to help choose stocks both by market capitalization and their growth or value bias.
He is still updating his method. "We're making midcourse corrections every week," he said. "It's a combination of science and art." The Main Street fund's turnover is 81 percent, versus 63 percent for the average large-cap blend fund.
His recent trimming of his position in Microsoft illustrates how the system works. Through the end of April, Microsoft was the fund's biggest holding, at more than 5 percent of the portfolio. Since then, he has cut it to 3.6 percent, roughly equal to Microsoft's weighting in the S. & P. 500.
He made the change for various reasons: Microsoft is no longer scoring in the top 10 percent in his screens for likely outperformers. And his model indicates that a genuine market sea change may be in the works, finally giving value stocks an advantage over growth. "We have to try to align ourselves with the way of the universe," he said, using a phrase he often repeats.
Among the signals, he said, are an improved picture for corporate profits; a steepening of the yield curve, which indicates stronger business conditions ahead, and the very high valuations on growth stocks like Microsoft, which has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 50.
Mr. Albers also thinks that the outcome of the Government's antitrust case against Microsoft will be a negative for the stock.
It is too early to tell whether the outperformance of value stocks over the last month and a half will last, so, Mr. Monoyios said, he and Mr. Albers are not making major changes to the fund. "We want to see a persistence of factors over the long term," Mr. Monoyios explained.
Technology remains a major focus of the fund; I.B.M. is the biggest holding, at about 4 percent of the portfolio. Mr. Albers also finds Hewlett-Packard attractive. He first bought it in March at $71.35 a share, and at $94.3125, where it now trades, he still considers it cheap.
ANOTHER big part of the portfolio is in consumer cyclicals, primarily retailers. Demand remains strong, while many retailers' costs for labor and goods are flat or falling, he said, resulting in wider profit margins. Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot, both of which had positive earnings surprises recently, are among his top 10 holdings.
Other stocks that he finds attractive in his favorite sectors are BellSouth in telecommunications and Merck in pharmaceuticals.
As Main Street's returns indicate, the big challenge for Mr. Albers and Mr. Monoyios will be lifting this leviathan -- with $15 billion in assets, counting all share classes -- above market averages.
"This fund is not going to be the No. 1 fund in any one year, because we don't take those kinds of risks," Mr. Monoyios said. Still, he added, "being consistently good in the short run makes you excellent in the long run."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Pop! Goes the Bubble

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
HAS E-phoria ended? Highflying Internet stocks look mighty weak. Even on Friday, when other Nasdaq stocks were strong, many Internet shares couldn't muster their typical big moves up. As the week ended, shares of Internet concerns were well off their mid-April peaks. The Interactive Week index of 50 stocks is down 17 percent from its highs, while Thestreet.com index of 20 Net companies has fallen 26 percent since April 12.
Battered E-investors are wondering whether the recent action is simply a pause in an upward trend or the beginning of the end of a glorious ride in these stocks. 
 While no one is certain, there is a host of reasons why the downturn may continue. Broadly speaking, investing in Internet shares has changed. And investors who don't realize that are vulnerable.
The factors working against these stocks are both macro and micro.
One of the big-picture problems is rising interest rates -- bad for almost all equities, but especially damaging to stocks of Internet companies, which rely heavily on debt to finance their money-losing operations. As interest rates rise, these companies' debt costs do, too.
Recent figures on Web use are also worrisome. Merrill Lynch's estimates of the total number of Internet users declined from 61.6 million in March to 61.1 million in April. While Merrill's resident Internet bull, Henry Blodget, cautions that one month may not make a trend, he points out that April's drop was only the second such decline in the last 12 months.
Perhaps more significant than either interest rates or Web use, however, is the shift in supply and demand that has changed the way these shares trade. Simply put, there are many more E-sellers than there were before -- a change, almost imperceptible, that is weighing on many Internet stocks today.
Start with the throngs of companies taking their shares to market. According to Commscan L.L.C., an investment banking research company in New York, there have been 69 initial public offerings of Internet-related shares so far this year. During all of 1998, there were only 42 such offerings. And while E-commerce companies accounted for 11.5 percent of all new issues last year, excluding closed-end funds and American depository receipts, Internet I.P.O.'s have accounted for 44 percent of new stock issues in 1999.
Also adding to supply is the fact that as newly public Internet concerns age, more stock hits the market from executives and insiders. These individuals are generally prohibited from selling any shares until several months after the I.P.O.'s.
Even as extra Internet shares flood the market, demand is drying up. One measure: The money going into Internet-related mutual funds has dropped from $470 million in the week ended April 14 to $34 million last week.
Complicating matters is a small-picture issue: a dearth of natural buyers -- the short-sellers -- waiting to step in even if these stocks keep falling. Investors willing to risk their money selling stocks short must buy them back later to close their positions. As a result, short-sellers represent future buyers. But since so many who bought this way lost their shirts betting against Internet stocks, few remain standing or solvent.
At the height of the craze, Internet buyers were many while the sellers were few. Now the tables have turned. Ah, well. It was fun while it lasted.

Hey, Allies, Follow Me. I've Got All the New Toys.

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

 BODY:
NATO's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia has exposed more than policy differences between the European and American alliance partners. As never before, it has revealed the vast technological gulf that separates American military capabilities from those of Britain, France and the others. And that, in turn, shows just how much the Europeans remain militarily dependent on the United States for their own defense -- dependent, and resentful.
For Europe these days, the word defense means the ability to deal with problems like Kosovo on their own continent. But that, more and more, means the ability to bring technology to bear. And since the Americans have most of the technology, the Americans call most of the shots on strategy and tactics. 
 Take the way the air war has developed.
From the beginning, all the allies hoped a ground war would be unnecessary. But nobody except the United States had enough sophisticated F-14, F-15, F-16 and F-18 fighters and fighter-bombers to launch the kind of campaign that might avoid a ground war.
And nobody but the United States had the "stealth" F-117 fighters and B-2 bombers whose strange shapes and composite materials make it hard for Yugoslavia's sophisticated air defenses to shoot them down.
So the allies agreed on an air war but had to accept American ideas about how it should be fought.
The primary American concern was to minimize allied losses, and the allied losses have been negligible. But the bombing campaign has not prevented continued ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and now this is widening fissures that were probably there from the start.
Consider one reason the B-2's fly their missions all the way from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri: The United States does not want even most of its European friends to get a close look at the planes. And among all its allies, the United States has judged only Britain trustworthy enough to acquire any of the satellite-guided American-developed Tomahawk cruise missiles, which can carry out precision attacks from ships hundreds of miles away. Even the British got only 65, while the United States has hundreds.
Having to deal with Kosovo the American way, with bombing instead of ground troops, had advantages for the Europeans, but also drawbacks. The longer the bombing drags on inconclusively, the greater the frustration and resentment in both Europe and America.
Now, as some military thinkers are beginning to say a ground campaign may become necessary before autumn, all that the allies have been able to agree on is a plan to put 50,000 troops in Kosovo as peacekeepers if Yugoslavia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, finally backs down and lets international troops escort Kosovo's refugees back home. But even that plan, calling for perhaps 7,000 American ground troops, would not dull the edge that technology gives the Americans.
If tens of thousands of fresh troops must be flown in quickly as peacekeepers, only the United States has enough giant C-5, C-141 and C-17 air transports to do the job. And if the allies decide this summer that air power alone is not enough to make Mr. Milosevic back down -- which might or might not be more likely now that he has been indicted as a war criminal by the international tribunal in The Hague -- only the United States could quickly fly in or provide the 100,000 or more troops required to drive Yugoslav forces out of Kosovo.
Europe's ability to move around huge numbers of troops is "deplorably slow," in the words of NATO's recently retired senior military officer, Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany.
For now, the United States continues to dominate the skies over Kosovo, with up to 815 aircraft (including Apache anti-tank helicopters still waiting for combat and KC-135 refueling planes). All 18 other allies together provide 277, with more than half of those coming from France (102 Mirage, Jaguar, Super-Etendards and other planes), and Britain (38 Harrier GR-7 and Tornado GR-1 fighter-bombers and support aircraft).
ONE result is that Europeans are talking again, as they have been doing for years, about a need to fix the imbalance.
And as flaws in the American air-war strategy emerge, some Europeans are blaming its failures on the Clinton Administration's reluctance to expose air crews to danger. Most allied pilots fly only above 15,000 feet, beyond the reach of conventional Yugoslav anti-aircraft artillery. But they are far less effective against Serbian armor than they would be if they flew lower.
"Military pilots are paid to risk their lives, and most of ours feel frustrated a lot of the time," a French official said. "But the United States has a zero-deaths policy, and the United States is running the show."
A reluctance to take casualties is only one factor. The availability of an alternative is another. As General Naumann pointed out, most European countries lack the Americans' ability to launch laser- and satellite-guided bombs at a safe distance from ground fire. "Most European planes," he said, "have to fly more or less over the targets, which is the most stupid thing you can do, since you expose yourself to the enemy air defense."
Britain and France agreed late last year that one lesson of previous wars in the Balkans was that Europe needed to build up autonomous defense capabilities within the alliance. The day would come, the French argued, when the United States might tire of entanglements and the Europeans would have to act alone. Paradoxically, it is American involvement in Kosovo, rather than withdrawal, that has revived the issue now.
But in order to achieve real change, Europeans would have to spend billions of dollars to catch up with the technological revolution that the American military achieved in the 1970's and 1980's.
The United States, General Naumann said, spends $36 billion a year on defense research and development, while all the European allies and Canada together have been spending only $10 billion. Last year, according to NATO figures, the United States spent the equivalent of 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, 27 percent of it on equipment and infrastructure; the European allies averaged 2.1 percent.
"You can't want a European military organization that can get along without the Americans and reduce military budgets," a retired French general, Pierre M. Gallois, said. And the United States is increasing military spending, while the Europeans are continually cutting back.
Instead of spending, they vow at NATO summit meetings like the one in Washington in April to build a stronger European security and defense identity within the alliance. They will probably make another one at a summit meeting of the European Union in Cologne at the end of this week, now that NATO has agreed to let European countries use NATO facilities for future operations that the United States doesn't join.
But, as General Naumann commented, these arrangements exist only on paper. "What we now need to see are deeds, and it is urgent that something is done," he said. Kosovo might finally make the allies actually do something.

HEADLINE: The China Agenda

 BODY:
Washington's battered relations with Beijing suffered serious new damage last week from the Cox committee report on Chinese theft of American nuclear and missile secrets. Working ties will have to be rebuilt, but on more realistic foundations than before. While it still makes sense to encourage China to open its economy and play a constructive role in international affairs, Washington must give clear priority to protecting American security.
The report showed that for the past 20 years Beijing has exploited its commercial and scientific exchanges with the United States -- and lax security at American nuclear labs -- to learn how to increase the power and range of its nuclear arsenal. During those same years, Washington unwisely relaxed controls over militarily sensitive exports to increase opportunities for commercial gain, a tendency that grew during the Clinton Administration. Congress and the White House must move quickly to restore better balance to American policy. 
 That does not require freezing discussions with China on every subject from trade to Kosovo, as some in Congress now propose. It is in America's interest to complete talks on Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization as soon as possible. Meanwhile, China's favorable trade status under American law should be renewed for another year.
But changes are urgently needed in other areas to address the specific security problems uncovered by the Cox report. The Senate made a promising start on this last week. A bipartisan majority approved a useful package of measures introduced by Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader. These included increased Pentagon monitoring of satellite sales to China and a strengthened role for intelligence agencies in reviewing export licenses. The Senate package also provides for more rigorous security training at the nuclear labs, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation supervising employee background checks. It also requires the Central Intelligence Agency to report to Congress on foreign efforts to steal sensitive American technologies.
Satellites and their launch by Chinese rockets require particular scrutiny, since they incorporate technology that can be used in ballistic missiles. Advanced computer sales also need careful review because these powerful machines can be used to simulate missile trajectories and nuclear weapons tests. Ideally, all countries capable of exporting such militarily sensitive goods should adopt common restrictions. But absent that, the United States, the world leader in advanced technology, must tighten its own controls.
Nuclear lab security can be improved without compromising civil liberties or scapegoating Chinese-Americans. All lab employees doing sensitive weapons or computer work must be carefully vetted and supervised. Those known to have shared inappropriate information with foreign colleagues or to have copied restricted files onto insecure computers should be excluded from such work and denied top-secret clearances. Clearances should be administratively suspended whenever a lab employee comes under investigation.
Academic interchange, through publications and conferences, is essential to the labs' scientific work. Additionally, exchange visits by foreign scientists, including those from Russia and China, are essential to arms control programs that strengthen American security. But all exchanges must be carefully planned and monitored to avoid leakage of military secrets.
Clearer lines of jurisdictional authority should be established among Government agencies responsible for nuclear and computer security. Top Justice Department officials need to be made aware of and take charge of suspected cases of nuclear espionage. The F.B.I. and C.I.A. both need to develop greater expertise on Chinese methods. Continued engagement with China is a necessity. But it can be pursued without carelessly exposing American military secrets.

Where Will Hillary Clinton Love New York?

BYLINE: By ELEANOR RANDOLPH 

 BODY:
Bill and Hillary Clinton are said to be planning a vacation in New York this summer. The First Lady needs to learn more about the state she might like to represent in the Senate, but their problem is where exactly to go.
Most Americans put a high priority on beaches or battlefields, canyons, mountains or theme parks. Mrs. Clinton would presumably prefer to spend her time with voters and donors. She will also need enough scenery for photo opportunities -- the kind of exquisite backdrop for a commercial that brings out the healthiest fresh-air look in even the wonkiest of indoor politicians. Unfortunately, many of the state's most scenic spots have already been used by Gov. George Pataki. 
 The Clintons' analyzers are said to be looking at the electoral possibilities of Shelter Island, the Finger Lakes and the Adirondacks. Shelter Island has a few advantages. It is close to Steven Spielberg's place in East Hampton, and some of the nation's biggest campaign contributors are a short ferry ride away. Also, Shelter Island would not be considered too fancy because, technically, it is not a Hampton. In fact, some people on Shelter Island have been hunkering down for years, hoping that nobody from the Hamptons looks north and discovers them. Since it would be hard for the locals to remain invisible with the Clintons there and since Shelter Island has a particularly hazardous colony of journalists, the couple might prefer more remote territory.
The Finger Lakes between Syracuse and Rochester would be an easy choice, with the universities and the home of Susan B. Anthony. But Adirondack State Park offers a challenge -- six million acres worth of everything from wilderness to water parks. The real problem is that the region is so heavily Republican that a local Democrat usually tries to keep such tendencies hidden from the neighbors.
Republican roots go deep in this wild territory. Teddy Roosevelt started coming to the Adirondacks as a boy. Calvin Coolidge summered near Saranac Lake. One Democratic President, Grover Cleveland, apparently visited sometime in the previous century. A fisherman who weighed in at 300 pounds, Cleveland was undoubtedly a challenge to the watercraft of the day.
As for donors, most of the old rich -- like the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts and Morgans, who owned "camps" the size of Blenheim -- are gone. The next moneyed generation has arrived, discovering anew the incredible beauty and discomfort of an Adirondack twig chair. So far, however, there seems to be some reluctance about hosting an outgoing President and his up-and-coming wife.
Gary Heurich, a Washington, D.C., brewer who owns one of the park's splendid private properties, has sent word that the Clintons are welcome to visit. Mr. Heurich, however, warns that he is not a Democrat but an independent, which, he says, "may be as close as they'll get."
Mr. Heurich's camp, whittled down to a few hundred acres after the family gave a few thousand acres to the state as forest preserve, has three houses, including a renovated lighthouse. There is also a helipad and a mile of shoreline on Lake Champlain.
Among the attractions of the area are golf courses and such scenic spots as the place where Samuel de Champlain shot two Iroquois chiefs with his harquebus (gun) and started the French and Indian War. Birders bring their binoculars for over 100 species of birds. Nearby are also the beaches where young Canadian humans come south each August to swim in the nude.
If such amusements do not appeal to the First Lady, the park is full of serious issues as well. Adirondack lifers can talk for days about acid rain, motor-boat hazards, seasonal economics, prisons or wildlife, particularly the common loon. Whether they will vote for her, even if they find her surprisingly charming, is another matter.
Finally, the Adirondacks include a number of places that are great but not so grand, like the western hills where my family celebrates summer. For us, a star-studded evening means a chair on the nearest dock. Gatherings feature bring-your-own casseroles and beer, and everybody smells like a bath oil known for offending not merely humans but also bugs. It's a lovely place to August, but socially, at least, we are a long way from the Hamptons and a lot closer to rural Arkansas.

Priced Right Out Of the Mailbox?

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Ever wondered how the banks that inundate Americans with credit card offers can afford all those come-on letters and tempting introductory rates? Perhaps some of them can't. The mailbox of the future may still groan under the weight of credit card solicitations, but they will come from a smaller number of banks, Moody's Investors Service says.
Just as big airlines can drive new carriers out of business by temporarily lowering prices, bigger lenders can do the same to smaller banks by temporarily lowering the price of borrowing money, and that is what they are doing with credit cards. 
 "Cutthroat competition between issuers remains the rule," said David Fanger of Moody's, a credit rating agency, "while the prevalence of teaser rates continues to encourage consumers to surf" for new cards. All of that shaves profit margins and gives an advantage to the big lenders that can afford to stay longer in the game.
The cost of just signing up a new customer now ranges from $90 to $110, double the cost six years ago, mostly because of the expense of mass mailing, according to The Nilson Report, a credit card industry newsletter in Oxnard, Calif. That may decline as issuers turn to the Internet: "Acquiring a new customer over the Internet may be only half as expensive," said David Robertson, the president of Nilson. But smaller issuers who cannot match the low-rate offers from big lenders may not be in the game long enough to realize the Internet savings. DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

Time for Batman? Week of Wild Swings

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
It was like trading inside a comic strip. Bam! Pow! Kerplunk. Investors dodged and volleyed the best they could in a week marked by four consecutive swings of 100 points or more in the Dow Jones industrial average.
 The Dow fell 2.5 percent for the week, to 10,559.74, down 5 percent from its most recent high. Nasdaq slipped 2 percent, to 2,470.52, off 9 percent from its recent peak. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.1 percent, to 1,301.84, down 5 percent from its recent record. 
 And now that Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange want to extend trading hours, will investors be up to the challenge?
 The week's volatility was powered by recurring fears that any hint of inflation would cause the Federal Reserve to raise rates. Those worries were tempered on Friday by a decline in the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago business activity index.
 Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock & Company, told The Associated Press on Friday, We still are in a tug-of-war between those people who think interest rates will go higher and those that don't.
 Markets in Europe, Japan and Hong Kong fell for the week. MICKEY MEECE

HEADLINE: Passing the Endurance Test;
The Anatomy of Discretion, Or, How to Fit Brassieres

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
Deborah Sherman remembers what it was like. "I used to go with my mother in the Bronx," she recalled the other day, with not much nostalgia. "At the store, these huge old ladies would mrrff, rrrmm" -- her hands smushed the air in front of her chest into imaginary A-cups. "And you're just dying, but they don't care."
Dr. Sherman, now a gastroenterologist, found a better way to get undergarments that do what they're supposed to. She is one member of an uncounted, savvy sisterhood that depends on the brassiere fitters at the Town Shop, at Broadway and 80th Street on the Upper West Side. 
 Bra fitting, once routine at finer boutiques and neighborhood department stores, is almost unheard of these days. Some smaller lingerie stores have clerks who will peek into the dressing room and opine, and a few heavyweights -- notably Bergdorf Goodman and Saks -- have fitters provided by major lingerie makers. But Lord & Taylor, Barneys and Bloomingdale's rely on their staff members, and Macy's depends on a tape measure in the rear of the lingerie section. Bendel and Takashimaya don't even carry bras.
At the Town Shop, a small, old-timey store with walls of pink drawers labeled with brand names and cup sizes, Eyvette Manigault, Margaret Croom and a handful of other women "size" fully clothed women with a glance, but they don't leave it there. They grab a handful of bras -- which cost no more than they would in a department store -- and escort the customer to one of five fitting rooms, helping her out of clothes and into undergarments with a matter-of-fact manner that dispels shyness.
The scrutiny is keen -- and not knee-jerk flattering -- when the bras go on. The point, Ms. Manigault said, is to fit the cups to the sideward expanse of the breast.
"Some women go their whole lives without knowing their true size" is a truism often repeated by the shop's fitters, owners and customers, most of whom discuss the finer points of the subject with their hands gently cupped upward and vaguely bouncing in front of their torsos.
A rather handsome, nearly doe-eyed man often takes the command position behind the counter. He is Daniel Koch, 40, and he is following in his father's, grandmother's and great-grandfather's footsteps. "It doesn't faze me," he said. "I know what we sell, and I also know that just about every woman in America is wearing a bra."
Last week, he found himself faced with a client with her arms folded across her chest who said: "I wonder if you have strapless minimizer bras? Maybe a 34C?" He pulled out a drawer full of strapless minimizer 34C's, and they had a discreet conversation about materials and comfort. His eyes never appeared to dip below her neck, but when she disappeared into a fitting room with Ms. Maginault, he said, "She probably should be wearing a 32D, but I don't say that because I don't want them to know I'm looking."
Mr. Koch's grandmother, Selma Koch, a few weeks shy of her 92d birthday, is the Town Shop's C.E.O. (chief everything officer). She has kept the business running through Depression, recession and inflation, but today's challenges worry her. Costs keep increasing. The monthly rent rose to $10,000 from $3,000 a few years ago, when a new landlord took over, she said, and it's now up to $18,000.
"I am serving four generations," she said. "I get worried; these women come in, they're all gray, they can't walk, and they say: you fitted me for my trousseau!"
As if to prove Mrs. Koch's point, Dr. Sherman pointed out Ms. Croom and said: "I think she was the one who fitted me for my wedding and honeymoon 10 years ago. And she made me get all these things that I never would have gotten -- like a leopard bikini." Ms. Croom, overhearing, smiled. "It was nice though," she said, "wasn't it?"

HEADLINE: Nationalist Group Fights for Identity in South Africa

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, May 29

 BODY:
The party whose slogan used to be "one settler, one bullet" is trying to stay in office by appealing to the nostalgia vote.
The Pan Africanist Congress now preaches "non-racialism" and says it welcomes anyone who considers himself an African first, including white Afrikaners. 
 But it insists it is the true torchbearer of the ideals upon which the African National Congress was founded in 1912. The A.N.C., it argues, went off track in 1959 when it embraced the Communist Party, Indians and mixed-race voters, thus diluting what was then supposed to be a black nationalist struggle.
Its leader, the Rev. Stanley Mogoba, reminds voters that, like President Nelson Mandela, he too was imprisoned on Robben Island.
In its early days, the party was a serious challenge to the A.N.C. for leadership of the struggle. It led the 1960 Sharpeville demonstration that ended in the massacre of 69 protesters by the police. It too, had a guerrilla army in exile. It tended to hit soft targets like bars; in 1993, its partisans stabbed to death Amy Biehl, a California college student dropping friends off in a black township.
Having formally abandoned violence, the party still seems stranded on the banks of the river of history. Pollsters say it will get only 1 percent of the vote on Wednesday. It got 1.2 percent in 1994. Since then, its five members in the National Assembly did not really make names for themselves by taking the Government to task as, for example, the seven members from the Democratic Party did.
Mr. Mogoba, a Methodist Bishop, did bring the party back into the headlines recently by publicly musing that murderers and rapists should have their offending parts amputated. He said the party had not "worked out the details," such as whether the chopping would be done in an operating theater or a public square.
"We don't say we'd like to cut people's limbs off," he said. "But rather than allow criminals to cut throats, to rape, we'd contemplate it."
He argues that the present Government is soft on crime and soft on corruption, has let moral standards decline so children no longer defer to their elders, and has developed a "trickle down" economic policy while he prefers a focus on the poorest of the poor. He also favors aggressive redistribution of white-owned land.
He and his secretary general, Ngila Michael Muendane, reject their lowly 1 percent poll rating, saying some poll sponsors are controlled by the A.N.C. They accuse the national television network of giving them short shrift on the evening news. A.N.C. members tear down their posters and even threaten gullible farm workers, Mr. Muendane said, "by saying they can see their vote, and if they vote P.A.C., they'll lose their housing or their pension."
In its literature, the party assures voters that "the P.A.C. has a plan" for every ill of the country: crime, disastrous public schools, overwhelmed hospitals, the housing shortage. The plans apparently involve "investing massive resources," although it is not clear where the money would come from.
Its literature contains a seven-stanza poem honoring the struggle of the homeless, the jobless, the worker, the student, the woman and the aged. One verse:
You can't earn a cent
And all your money's spent
So you think about crime
But why do time?
For you the jobless,
The struggle continues.
There is an odd echo to the party's platform. With its emphasis on renewing morality and zero tolerance for crime, it sounds like the other angry opposition parties, including even the National Party, the latest incarnation of the party that instituted apartheid but which now also proclaims itself multiracial and would probably back all the P.A.C. goals except farmland redistribution and aggressive affirmative action.
The opposition is fragmented and the A.N.C. is expected to sweep more than 60 percent of the vote.

HEADLINE: North Korea Unresponsive In U.S. Talks, Envoy Reports

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 29

 BODY:
Former Defense Secretary William S. Perry said today that during his just-completed trip to North Korea, he had "clearly and firmly" expressed concern about North Korean military programs, but that he did not get any definitive response.
Mr. Perry spoke in Seoul, South Korea, after concluding a four-day visit to North Korea, where he apparently outlined a Clinton Administration proposal to offer North Korea a major expansion of economic and diplomatic ties in exchange for the North curbing its nuclear and missile programs. 
 If accepted, the arrangement could eventually lead to a far-reaching relaxation of tensions in northeast Asia, but there is widespread skepticism that the deal will work smoothly, if at all.
One inauspicious sign was that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, declined to meet with Mr. Perry, despite American hopes for such a meeting.
Mr. Kim almost never meets foreigners, so it was not a great surprise, but it reflected a lost opportunity to signal a new start in relations.
Mr. Perry did pass on to North Korean officials a message to Mr. Kim from President Clinton, as well as from South Korean and Japanese leaders.
Although former President Carter visited North Korea in 1994 on his own, Mr. Perry as a presidential envoy was heading the highest-ranking delegation to North Korea since the Korean War, yet his North Korean counterparts were mostly at the vice minister level.
Mr. Kim said in Seoul that he had spoken to officials close to Mr. Kim and had tried to convey to them "clearly and firmly U.S. and allied views and concerns," The Associated Press reported.
But he said "it will take some time" for each side to reflect on the visit and decide what to do next.
From Seoul, Mr. Perry flies back to Washington to brief Mr. Clinton and to put the finishing touches on his review of policy toward North Korea.
The aim of the review is to achieve a more bipartisan policy, with backing from Congress, dealing more consistently with North Korea and seeking a way out of the existing stalemate.
One underlying problem in achieving any breakthrough in relations is the deep distrust with which each side views the other.
Many Americans, including a number in the Congress, see North Korea as a Communist menace that does not keep its bargains and is starving its own population, yet has somehow become the largest recipient of American aid in East Asia.
North Koreans argue, however, that they have kept their side of the landmark 1994 agreement to improve relations, and that it is the United States that has backed out of its promises to lift economic sanctions and normalize ties.

The United States appears to be heading for another clash with China, this time over a divisive World Bank development loan that would help Chinese authorities resettle tens of thousands of Chinese in regions traditionally inhabited by Tibetans and Mongolians.
The Clinton Administration seems to be getting ready to oppose the plan when it comes before the World Bank's executive board for a final approval next month, though White House officials say no final decision has yet been made. 
 Private pro-Tibetan groups are lobbying against the project, which would spend $160 million to resettle 60,000 poor farmers from eroded hillsides in China's western Qinghai province to better lands about 300 miles farther west.
China and the World Bank see the plan as part of a campaign to alleviate rural poverty in remote areas by offering farmers the chance to make a better living and relieving population pressures in vacated areas.
But critics argue that moving these farmers, who are mainly Han Chinese and members of the minority Hui, Tu and Salar ethnic groups, will further erode the position of the Tibetan inhabitants of Dulan County in Haixi Prefecture, where the farmers are to be resettled and which is a designated Tibetan and Mongolian Autonomous Area. Tibetans are already in a minority there.
Qinghai province is outside the borders of the Tibetan region China annexed in 1959, but has traditionally been strongly ethnically Tibetan and is the birthplace of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader.
Although Qinghai has been a province of China since the 17th century, critics see the proposed resettlements as part of a broader campaign by the Chinese authorities to weaken Tibetan national identity.
Asked about the project during an appearance before the House Banking Committee last week, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said, "We are enormously concerned about it," adding that the United States is "inclined to oppose it."
John Ackerly of the International Campaign for Tibet, a Washington-based organization fighting for Tibetan rights, said: "This relocation, which the World Bank now proposes to help finance, is part of a larger Chinese policy which is now the greatest threat to the continued existence of the Tibetans as a distinct people and culture."
Critics say the plan violates World Bank guidelines, which state that indigenous ethnic minorities should "not suffer adverse effects from bank-financed projects and that they receive culturally compatible social and economic benefits."
"The proposed resettlement will make the indigenous Tibetans even more marginal than they are already," said Kate Saunders of the London-based Tibet Information Network, which first highlighted the dangers of the project.
Critics also argue that the scheme is part of a broader plan to establish the infrastructure needed to exploit the region's mineral resources, which would inevitably attract additional inflows of non-Tibetans.
For the moment, the World Bank is standing behind the project. In a briefing paper issued this week it defends the resettlement plan as an integral part of its efforts to reduce poverty in China, which has cut the number of rural poor from 280 million to 80 million over a decade.
The farmers to be resettled, it argues, are "among the poorest people in the world, with incomes of about $60 a year." But it admits that the resettlement would weaken the position of indigenous Tibetans and Mongolians in the area.
In Haixi Prefecture, the Tibetan percentage of the population would fall from 11.1 percent to 10.3 percent, while in Dulan County it would decline from 22.7 percent to 14 percent. For Mongolians the declines are from 7.6 percent to 6.5 percent and from 14.1 percent to 6.7 percent.
The number of Han Chinese in Haixi Prefecture would rise from 236,918 to 261,375 and in Dulan County from 27,977 to 52,434.

HEADLINE: Black Groups in Florida Split Over School Voucher Plan

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
Exposing the sharp debate over school vouchers among black people, two long-time allies from the civil rights struggle in Florida find themselves on opposite sides on whether the state should help pay for some children to attend private schools.
The plan, passed last month by the Florida Legislature and awaiting the expected signature of Gov. Jeb Bush, would permit students from the lowest-rated public schools in the state to attend private schools, including religious ones, with vouchers paid by taxpayers' money. Florida would become the first state to have a statewide school voucher program. 
 The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and several other liberal groups have vowed to sue to block the voucher plan, contending that it would reduce support for public education and violate the constitutional separation of church and state.
In response, the Urban League of Greater Miami, breaking with its national headquarters, has retained a Washington law firm to intervene in court on the state's side in defense of the program.
"Isn't that healthy?" said T. Willard Fair, president of the Miami Urban League, referring to the differences of opinions among civil rights leaders. "It shows that we are now getting to the point where we can behave like human beings. We can like and dislike. We can select and reject. We are not bound by color the way we used to be bound, where people said, 'You can't think that way because you're black.' "
Most prominent civil rights leaders and organizations, including the National Urban League and its president, Hugh Price, remain firmly opposed to school vouchers.
The organization's New York headquarters issued a statement in the name of Mr. Price, who was on vacation.
"Our Urban League of Greater Miami affiliate must do what it feels is best for the communities it serves," the statement said, "and the National Urban League will continue to do what we feel is best for our constituents."
Unlike the N.A.A.C.P., which insists that its local chapters hew to a policy line worked out at its convention or by its board, the National Urban League is much more decentralized. Local affiliates have their own boards, raise most of their own money and can take independent positions.
While describing Mr. Fair as "one of the most successful Urban League directors in the country," Leon Russell, president of the Florida Conference of N.A.A.C.P. Chapters, sharply disagreed with his stand on school vouchers. Mr. Russell and other critics assert that vouchers would damage the public schools by siphoning off the best students.
"He might be correct in terms of wanting to do something to improve public education," Mr. Russell said. "But I think his concept of how to do it is all wrong."
The split between the two civil rights groups in Florida mirrors the divisions among black people over the voucher issue. While liberal civil rights groups generally oppose school vouchers, polls show that many low-income African-Americans, especially those with children in poor-performing public schools, support the concept. Conversely, more affluent and college educated black people are much more wary of such programs.
A 1998 survey by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research organization specializing in issues involving black people, found that 48.1 percent of African-Americans favored allowing state money to be used for private school tuition, while 39.8 percent opposed it. The poll also indicated that whites opposed such vouchers by a margin of 50.2 percent to 41.3 percent.
Mr. Fair is a strong ally of Mr. Bush and, like the Republican Governor, an enthusiastic advocate of using changes in education policy to put pressure on public schools to improve. These include the voucher plan and charter schools, which are public schools licensed by local school boards to pursue innovative teaching methods. In 1996, Mr. Fair and Mr. Bush founded the Liberty City Charter School in a poor black neighborhood in Miami.
"If we plan to make the system do things it's never done before," Mr. Fair said, "we have to be prepared to do things that we've never done before."
The voucher program, if signed by Governor Bush, is expected to go into effect in September. The plan calls for all public schools to be graded A to F, based on statewide standardized test scores, attendance, disciplinary actions taken against students and graduation rates. All students in public schools that received a grade of F in two out of four years would be eligible to receive a voucher worth about $4,000 to pay tuition at private school.
Mr. Fair's group has also angered some liberal civil rights groups by retaining the Institute for Justice, a conservative legal foundation, to represent it in any litigation involving the voucher program. The institute has been an outspoken critic of affirmative action programs.
Clint Bolick, the institute's director of litigation, said he had approached Mr. Fair's group two weeks ago and persuaded it to join in the defense of the school voucher program if the N.A.A.C.P. carried through its threat to file suit. Mr. Bolick said he wanted to insure that any judge hearing the case did not have the impression that black opinion was "monolithic" when it came to school vouchers.
"If the first name you see on a lawsuit is the N.A.A.C.P.," he said, "that unquestionably creates an impression that the black community is on one side of that lawsuit. That image in this case would be demonstrably false. Having the Urban League on the other side evens the equation."

HEADLINE: As Agriculture Struggles, Iowa Psychologist Helps His Fellow Farmers Cope

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: HARLAN, Iowa

 BODY:
After hauling oats to his cattle before sunrise on the Iowa prairie, Michael Rosmann drives to an office and sits down with farmer after farmer to listen to their troubles. A fourth-generation farmer as well as a clinical psychologist, he speaks the language of men and women on the verge of losing their place on the land.
"These are good people who feel like terrible failures," said Dr. Rosmann, who knows what it is to endure sleepless nights spent worrying about crop prices and peril to family tradition. "Somebody needs to tell them it's not their fault." 
 Dr. Rosmann, a big man in a leather vest and cowboy boots who lost part of a foot in a farm accident, sees most of his patients at his office, off the town square in this small western Iowa town. But he will counsel wherever the need takes him, practicing psychotherapy while standing in a cornfield or leaning against a tractor tire and talking to a farmer in bib overalls.
"Last week I took a guy fishing," Dr. Rosmann said. "He's so down he had stopped talking. So we sat. And we fished."
A quiet desperation shrouds the countryside in places like Harlan, where plunging corn, bean and livestock prices are bringing ruin to farms nurtured by families for generations. But if troubles are in plentiful supply in much of rural America, psychological help like Dr. Rosmann's most often is not.
So, with the farm economy lurching toward the dreadful conditions of the early 1980's, when suicidal gunshots rang out from red barns, rural social and church groups are trying to extend solace to men and women on the verge of breakdown, both financial and emotional.
Dr. Rosmann himself recently helped organize the Sharing Help Awareness United Network, or Shaun, named for Shaun Petersen, a 13-year-old Iowa boy killed in a farm accident in 1989. The nonprofit group promises to find counseling for farm families that need it, regardless of their ability to pay.
In rural Adair County, east of here, a group of scholars, social workers and clerics gathered the other day for an Ecumenical Retreat on Family Farm Stress, where they mapped mental health strategies to help people faced with financial ruin.
In Nebraska, a series of workshops called Working With Distressed Farm and Ranch Families, for clerics, families and social workers, is set for July 6-9 in Lincoln, Kearney, Omaha and South Sioux City.
And in the rural communities of eastern Washington, social workers have been counseling farmers' children and checking for signs of strain.
"When you're a farmer, your work is your home, and there is no escape from the suffering," said Fred Moskol, a researcher in rural mental health at the University of Wisconsin Medical School. "And the poor kids, they're watching it all."
The root of the suffering is a market that has sent the prices of crops like corn and soybeans to 12-year lows. Livestock, too, has been hit hard. At the end of last year, hogs were selling for as little as $9 per hundredweight, barely a fourth of what a pork farmer with little debt would need to break even; hog prices have since rebounded to $35 or $40 per hundredweight, but that is only half their mid-1990's highs. The United States Department of Agriculture reports that average farm income dropped 33 percent from 1996 to 1998 and that an additional dip of 10 percent is expected for this year.
Without psychological help, says Larry Barber, a rawboned 57-year-old patient of Dr. Rosmann who recently lost a farm that had been in the family for more than a century, he would have lost his mind as well. For patients who can afford it, Dr. Rosmann charges $100 an hour. But he has charged some distressed farmers as little as $20 for a two-hour session. And others he has not sent a bill at all.
A week before Mr. Barber was forced to sell his cattle, he sat and cried, tears streaming down his face, making no sound, his body shuddering.
"I lost all desire to do anything," Mr. Barber said, tears now again in his eyes as he drew hard on a cigarette. "This is like a death, you know."
Riding the agricultural economy's roller coaster, farmers like Mr. Barber saw record prices for their crops just three years ago, before the Asian economic crisis stifled demand for American agricultural products.
Mark Drabenstott, a vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said: "It's a classic tale of supply and demand. When prices hit records in 1996, farmers responded by bringing more product to market. Just then their best customer, Asia, starts going into terrible financial problems."
Mr. Drabenstott said that while the American farm economy was now "clearly in the throes of a serious downturn," the severity was not yet that of the 1980's, when interest rates, always a crucial index to a way of life that runs on borrowed money, soared to nearly 20 percent and land prices plunged, leaving many farmers without sufficient collateral to back their loans. The value of farm acreage has lately been holding steady, Mr. Drabenstott said, and interest rates have been relatively low.
A steep drop in income has nonetheless meant disaster to farmers already working on slim margins.
Besides the low commodities prices, Mr. Drabenstott said, American agriculture is seeing "substantial structural change," with more farmers working under contract with big processing companies, especially in the hog business. Since the processors find it most efficient to deal with large farms, the smaller, family farms, particularly those with big debt loads, have been the ones most often squeezed out.
While farmers like Mr. Barber and his wife, Linda, may understand that it is forces beyond their control that are driving them out of business, that knowledge does little to relieve a certain guilt.
"People tell me, 'It's not your fault,' " Mr. Barber said, "but it is a little like driving a car, then skidding on a bad patch of ice and hitting a child. It wouldn't be your fault, but you'd live every day with the doubts and thoughts of how could I have avoided this terrible thing."
Farmers tend to be an independent breed, of course, and many are reluctant to ask for psychological help, even where its shortage in rural areas does not place it out of reach.
"In a small town," said Mr. Moskol, the University of Wisconsin researcher, "you walk into the mental health center and everybody sees you do it."
But for the most part, Dr. Rosmann said, farmers understand the benefits of psychotherapy and drugs in treating depression and anxiety.
"These are smart people," he said. "They're stubborn, but they're also innovative. They've got to be. A good manager will try anything that helps the operation. If that means going to a psychologist, then fine."
The big problem, he said, is making the time out of a busy schedule, especially if you are forced to drive 50 miles or more to find a counselor.
His caseload growing with the worsening of the farm economy, Dr. Rosmann rented out his corn and bean acreage this year so that he could devote more time to his patients. He says farmers appreciate that he can talk about the ins and outs of agricultural work as well as the emotional pressures. Other psychologists, he notes with a smile, might be at a loss should the discussion turn to crop rotation.
Dr. Rosmann, a native of Harlan who taught psychology at the University of Virginia before returning here to farm, says the suicide to which financial pressures sometimes drive farmers tends to differ from suicide among city dwellers, or even among rural people in other occupations.
For one thing, he said, farmers who try suicide are far more likely to achieve it. While suicide attempts among nonfarmers often occur after a Friday or Saturday night drinking bout, farmers are more likely to be sober and deliberative, taking their lives on a Sunday morning when their wives are away at church.
"And then we have a lot of 'accidents' on the farm," Dr. Rosmann said, referring to those cases that could be suicide and presumably are. "They want to make sure the insurance will be paid to their families."
Mr. Barber, who is now on antidepressants, said he would never have taken his own life. But his wife believes he would have been driven to the grave by stroke or heart attack had it not been for Dr. Rosmann.
Mr. Barber still struggles terribly with the changes in his life, swallowing hard when he is asked about his new job in a lumberyard. His wife was once active in volunteer work, winning awards for her efforts on behalf of shelters for battered women and in helping the poor with their taxes. Now she is looking for a job, as a receptionist or a secretary.
"I also go to Dr. Rosmann," Mrs. Barber said. "There are a lot of things I need to work through."
When they farmed, Mrs. Barber liked to do the disking in the fields. She would ride her tractor and talk to her husband on a walkie-talkie as he rode a combine.
"Waving to each other across the field," Mrs. Barber said, her voice breaking, "I miss that so much."
The old Barber farm is a pretty place, with bur oaks, ponds and rolling prairies. The Barbers were able to hold on to their modest house there, and these days they often sit at the kitchen table, looking out at the countryside when they are not just staring into their coffee.
Simply getting from one day to the next has been such a struggle, they said apologetically on one recent evening, that the housekeeping has suffered a bit lately. A stack of newspapers, magazines and files leaned against a computer in the kitchen, and in the living room stood an artificial Christmas tree, still wrapped in tinsel.
"A Christmas tree in May -- it doesn't belong," Mr. Barber said. "That's how I am, I guess. Just out of place."

HEADLINE: Testing Welfare Applicants for Drugs

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 29

 BODY:
In a controversial and unusual effort to move more welfare recipients into the work force, Michigan plans a pilot program that would require thousands of those applying for aid to take drug tests to qualify for benefits.
Starting in October, Michigan welfare applicants under 65 in three locations yet to be chosen will be required to take drug tests or forfeit their benefits. People already receiving benefits at those locations would be randomly tested. 
 Those who test positive for illegal drugs would be required to get treatment to collect welfare money, and those who refuse treatment would be dropped from the welfare rolls.
Against a tide of opposition from civil libertarians and welfare experts and mixed reaction from welfare recipients themselves, Gov. John Engler explained that the program would help those who needed drug treatment to get it and to obtain jobs.
"The idea is that workplace testing today is so common," Mr. Engler said. "This is a tool that will help identify some of the problems that need to be treated."
Michigan was one of the early leaders nationwide in the effort to end the decadeslong system of guaranteed welfare benefits and to replace it with time limits and other changes intended to force those on welfare to work.
Since October 1992, when Michigan's welfare changes began, the state's caseload has dropped about 60 percent, to 89,866 families from 225,359, the 14th largest drop among states, according to Federal statistics.
With many of those most able to find jobs already working, Michigan is trying a new approach on welfare. The mandatory drug tests, which other states have considered but rejected, are just one indication of its new direction.
Other initiatives include a plan to reduce fraud by taking computerized fingerprint images of those applying for welfare. And the welfare agency plans to expand its "Project Zero" program to 25 additional welfare offices around the state, bringing to 60 the number of locations offering flexible, expanded social services, like child care and transportation, with a goal of reducing welfare cases in a given area to zero.
But of all the initiatives, mandatory drug testing has raised the most concern, especially among civil libertarians, social workers and welfare experts.
The Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is considering suing the state to challenge the program on constitutional grounds, arguing that the mandatory drug test violates the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure.
"The state is starting from the assumption that the poor are criminals," said Kary L. Moss, executive director of the A.C.L.U. of Michigan. "The state is saying that if you want money for food and shelter you have to give up the Fourth Amendment rights that others have."
Social workers are concerned that the new program could have unintended consequences.
"It is very demeaning," said Sharon Parks, senior research associate at the Michigan League for Human Services, a nonprofit organization. "It might have a real chilling effect on people even coming in and applying."
Welfare experts object to the program and say it has a number of shortcomings.
"Michigan is the only state in the country that is doing this," said Gwen Rubinstein, director of policy research at the Legal Action Center, a nonprofit organization based in New York that focuses on alcohol and drug policy and tracks drug testing efforts nationwide. "Drug testing often sounds on the surface like a good idea, but it has so many flaws."
First, Ms. Rubinstein said, drug testing will not turn up those with alcohol abuse problems, which are more prevalent among welfare recipients. The tests are intrusive, she said, and casual drug users who are able to work will test positive along with addicts who need treatment.
Because testing is also expensive, it can divert money that could otherwise be used for drug treatment and other social services, Ms. Rubinstein said.
Sheldon Danziger, an economist and professor of social work and public policy at the University of Michigan who conducted a study of Michigan welfare recipients, said money used to test for drug use could be put to better use screening for mental health problems that needed treatment.
"A much greater percentage of women have mental health problems like depression, anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder than have substance abuse problems," Professor Danziger said.
But Douglas E. Howard, the new director of the state welfare agency, defended his plans.
"Michigan's approach is very unique," Mr. Howard said. "It is not just testing; it is testing followed by treatment."
He said the falling welfare caseload in the state dictated a change in direction.
"We're in an economy now where job placement isn't as tough as it was 10 years ago," he said. "The challenge is in job retention."
The state plans to select the three pilot sites in June, with one likely to be in Detroit, one in another large city and one in a rural area, Mr. Howard said. Drug treatment availability varies by region, and the sites chosen will be those with adequate treatment centers.
"What we are trying to do is remove barriers to work," he said.
It is unclear how much the testing and treatment programs will cost because neither the sites nor the testing material -- urine, sweat or hair follicles -- have been decided on. Most drug tests cost about $40 a person, Mr. Howard said, but he was not sure how many people would fall under the jurisdiction of the three locations.
Some welfare recipients here vehemently oppose his plans, and others applaud them.
"It definitely would be humiliating to me," said Barbara L. Whitfield, 61, who has been raising four grandchildren since her daughter died nine years ago. "They should find a better way to do that, a more dignified way."
Others supported the plan. "I think it is a good idea," said Talonda D. Loggins, 25, a mother of three who works as a nurse's assistant when she can find good child care and collects welfare when she cannot.
"Some recipients are not using their money the way it is supposed to be used," Ms. Loggins said, adding that the testing would reduce recipients' use of drugs.
Other states have considered similar drug testing programs but have backed away.
Last year, Florida set up a pilot program in two regions to detect drug-abusing welfare recipients. It asks drug-use questions of all applicants, but uses physical drug tests only on those it has reasonable cause to believe use drugs.
Louisiana passed a law in 1997 requiring drug testing for welfare recipients and certain public employees. But after a task force was set up to carry out the law, the state decided instead to require applicants to answer a questionnaire about drug use. Answers to the questions determine whether a drug test is administered.
New York and Maryland planned to require drug tests but found that other types of screening like questionnaires were cheaper and more effective. Four other states -- New Jersey, Minnesota, South Carolina and Wisconsin -- randomly test welfare recipients with felony drug convictions.

The space shuttle Discovery became the first craft to dock with the international space station, for six days of activities that include a spacewalk and repair work. The docking, 235 miles above the border of Russia and Kazakhstan, brought seven astronauts to the station to prepare it to accommodate its first permanent occupants next year. 15
 
State Links Welfare and Drugs
Against significant opposition, Michigan is planning a pilot program that would require thousands of people applying for welfare to take drug tests to qualify for benefits. Those who test positive for illegal drugs would be required to get treatment to get welfare money, and those who refuse treatment would be dropped from the rolls. 14
 
Voucher Plan Divides Allies
Two longtime allies of the civil rights movement in Florida are on opposite sides on whether the state should help pay for some students to attend private schools. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and other groups have vowed to sue to block the voucher plan, passed by the legislature last month. The Urban League of Greater Miami supports the plan and has retained a law firm to intervene in court in defense of the program. 17

HEADLINE: A Year After Lilco Takeover, Power Use Surges but Critics Hang In

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., May 28

 BODY:
Ever since New York State took over Long Island's electricity system a year ago today and cut rates by an average of 20 percent, customers have reacted like bargain hunters at a sale. They are using more electricity than ever.
For two decades, power consumption was largely stagnant on the Island, as the Long Island Lighting Company pushed rates to the highest level in the contiguous United States. But since last year, power use has surged by nearly 5 percent. Nationwide growth averages 2 percent to 3 percent per year, according to the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group. 
 "The increase is a huge surprise," said Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, which took over the utility. "I have no doubt we'll hit another peak this summer."
Cheery optimism is new for a power company on Long Island, where for years the name Lilco was an epithet, a synonym for corporate arrogance and exorbitant prices. After Lilco disappeared in a complex takeover engineered by Gov. George E. Pataki and financed by a sale of $6.8 billion in municipal bonds, the biggest in national history, its successor, LIPA, began billing itself as "a change for the better."
But in the aftermath of the changeover, as new problems have arisen and old ones have persisted, die-hard critics have challenged that boast. They continue to attack the deal as a giveaway to Lilco stockholders, one that bailed out the company after its $5 billion fiasco, the never-opened nuclear power plant at Shoreham, and left consumers with a staggering debt. Even after being reduced, the new rates are still the nation's seventh highest. And critics say the rate cut is a deception made possible by a five-year delay in debt payments.
"I'm not ready to light a cake and sing 'Happy Birthday' to LIPA," said Gordian Raacke, director of the Citizens Advisory Panel, a court-appointed watchdog group. "We still have to pay back an unprecedented debt."
As could be expected, little naysaying was heard at LIPA's first-anniversary board meeting in Riverhead on Thursday, where a large poster read, "Promises made, promises kept."
"We lowered electric rates, just like we said we would," said Mr. Kessel, calling the rate cut the largest in the nation.
LIPA and its supporters can cite other good news: Agency revenue is stronger than expected. Customers are pumping nearly $500 million a year into the Island's economy using the savings on their electricity bills.
"The economy has never been better," said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, the Island's largest economic development group. He said he had heard that one supermarket chain was saving $3 million a year, more than its usual profit.
And electricity service has been good. A State Public Service Commission study for 1998 showed that Long Island had the fewest and shortest power disruptions in the state. One exception was a power failure during a severe thunderstorm last summer that drew numerous complaints. And a snowstorm in March also caught LIPA by surprise. Mr. Kessel said LIPA was improving its response time.
And unexpectedly low interest on its bonds enabled LIPA to shrink the 30-year repayment period to 16 years, saving customers $4 billion. "We've begun to lift the burden of Shoreham debt from the backs of future generations," Mr. Kessel said. "Once we get rid of it, we can cut rates another 10 percent."
A spokesman for Mr. Pataki, Michael McKeon, said, "The Governor is extremely pleased."
But challenges remain. The higher demand for electricity poses one problem. "The downside is we're going to get into a tight situation on supply," Mr. Kessel said, "and we have to move quickly." To insure power for future generations, LIPA is scrambling to build generators and lay a $200 million cable underneath Long Island Sound to import electricity.
About 1,000 jobs have been eliminated as part of the merger of parts of Lilco with Brooklyn Union Gas to create Keyspan Energy. Its executives are contending with tensions between Keyspan's two halves while simultaneously expanding operations around the world and trying to boost a slumping stock price.
And critics of the takeover remain as adamant as ever. The State Assembly's Energy Committee chairman, Paul D. Tonko, said: "The consumers got ripped off. They paid too much for Lilco and got saddled with debt, while other areas will benefit in the new era of energy competition."
A year ago today, teams of Wall Street lawyers, state officials, corporate executives and bond underwriters were winding up an all-night marathon of document signing.
That elaborate transaction abolished Lilco, and LIPA used tax-free municipal bonds to buy the utility's power lines and customer service division. The rest of Lilco -- its work force, electricity generators and gas division -- merged with Brooklyn Union to become Keyspan. (Confusing matters, the company briefly called itself Marketspan.) LIPA hired Keyspan to run the electricity system.
No sooner than the deal was done, a scandal erupted over $67 million in "golden parachute" payments for 26 Lilco executives who were kept on at Keyspan. The biggest winner: Lilco's often pilloried chairman, William J. Catacosinos. He became Keyspan's new chief and still collected $42 million.
Critics accused LIPA of ignoring the fine print that granted the payments. But Mr. Kessel charged that Lilco had deceived LIPA and had violated a ban on such payments. Mr. Pataki denounced the payments as "disgraceful" and moved to force out Dr. Catacosinos. Officials from Brooklyn Union said they had been betrayed by their new partner.
A battle broke out for control of Keyspan. Dr. Catacosinos marshaled institutional investors who hoped that he would drive up the stock price by selling the company, perhaps to Consolidated Edison. His rival was his second in command, Robert B. Catell, who had led Brooklyn Union. He favored expanding Keyspan, not selling it. Finally, in an emergency board meeting, Dr. Catacosinos quit and Mr. Catell emerged victorious.
The payments to the Lilco executives prompted state investigations and about 20 shareholder lawsuits. As a result, Keyspan, as Lilco's successor, agreed to pay $6 million to LIPA, $1.5 million to the State Attorney General and $7.9 million to settle the shareholder suits.
Dr. Catacosinos vacated his office this month and resurfaced on Tuesday as leader of an investor group planning a $1 billion leveraged buyout of TNP Enterprises of Fort Worth, which provides electricity to 229,000 customers in Texas and New Mexico.
Keyspan, after pocketing $2 billion in the LIPA takeover deal, was considered a candidate to buy another company or be taken over itself. Instead, its stock slumped and has hovered around $27.
"It was at $38, so you're down 11 points from the high," said Edward J. Tirello, a utility analyst for BT Alex. Brown, an investment bank. A fan of Dr. Catacosinos, Mr. Tirello still credits Mr. Catell for moves like buying back $600 million in stock. "But to get the price up, they have to look for a merger partner. The number of candidates is declining daily. I would say they have a year or two."
Keyspan says it aspires to become "a premier energy company in the Northeast." To that end, it is buying Con Ed's 2,168-megawatt and 415-megawatt generators in Ravenswood, Queens, for $597 million and the Philip Fritze & Sons heating and ventilating contractors in New Jersey for an undisclosed sum. It is also investing hundreds of millions of dollars in gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, gas processing in Canada and gas pipelines and storage nationally and in Northern Ireland.
The company cut its work force to 7,300 from 8,300 through attrition and early retirement, without having to resort to layoffs. But meshing Lilco and Brooklyn Union has not been simple. Aware that mergers often fail because of clashing styles, Keyspan holds seminars on the corporate cultures of the two old companies and the aims of the new one. "We're putting all the employees through it," Mr. Catell said. "It's coming along quite well."
Not so, says a leader of Keyspan's biggest union. "Regrettably, I am taken aback that the integration hasn't progressed better," said Ralph Ranghelli, business manager of Local 1049 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which has 2,000 members at Keyspan.
"We from the former Lilco side see ourselves as adopting more of Brooklyn Union's culture, and that is troubling," he said. "In the old Lilco, things were much more structured and focused from the top down, whether you liked it or not. Brooklyn Union's method is much more loosely constructed. Executives freelance and change as they go along. Their team has become dominant."
Keyspan seeks to be evenhanded, Mr. Catell said. Nearly half of Lilco's top executives forfeited $3.8 million in compensation payments to stay with Keyspan, he said.
Keyspan said it would extend to Long Island the community development programs that won good will for Brooklyn Union. For its part, LIPA just approved an expenditure of $32 million a year to promote energy conservation and new technology.
As a public utility, LIPA is exempt from regulation. Critics have proposed voluntary oversight, perhaps through the State Consumer Protection Board, and Mr. Kessel is agreeable. "Look, we've started to turn the corner in the war between the public and its electric utility," he said. "This is a big sea change on Long Island."

HEADLINE: Times Sq. Dreamer or Visionary, He Hopes for a Better Deal

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Real estate developers branded Charles B. Moss Jr. a hopeless romantic and worse last year after he walked away from a $92 million deal at his Broadway block front between 44th and 45th Streets.
His critics said that Mr. Moss, 53, whose family roots are sunk deep into the vaudeville theaters and movie palaces of Times Square, could not bear to let go of the property where his grandfather had opened the Criterion theater 63 years ago. So after months of agonizing negotiations, Mr. Moss scuttled a deal with Bertelsmann A.G., the giant German communications conglomerate, which was willing to pay him a fortune to build a new office tower on a platform over his property, while allowing him to keep his storefronts. 
 But Mr. Moss, who is now busy marketing the property, rejects that view, saying sentimentality did not enter into his decision. He said he could make more money leasing the wide expanses of space at 1514 Broadway than he could have in a deal with Bertelsmann, which wanted to fill some of that space with supporting columns for the tower.
"Our family goes back a long time with this building," said Mr. Moss, who lives in Aspen, Colo. "But I like to think of myself as a rational businessman. The Bertelsmann deal just didn't make economic sense."
By next month, Mr. Moss will have cleared the three-story, 140,000-square-foot building of all but one tenant. The leases on the giant billboards attached to the building are also running out. Mr. Moss is betting that entertainment companies and national retailers will pay some of the highest rents in Times Square for his 200-foot stretch of Broadway.
Now that the once shabby district is attracting the likes of Madame Tussaud's, Disney, Virgin Records and MTV, rents have tripled in recent years to as much as $300 a square foot for prime, ground-floor space. C. Bradley Mendelson, a broker with Insignia/ESG who is representing Mr. Moss, said he was negotiating with potential tenants.
But more than one real estate executive is waiting to see whether Mr. Moss made a mistake. Some retailers are complaining that rents in Times Square have jumped so high that they have been priced out of the market.
Still, more than 20 million tourists pour through Times Square every year, spending an estimated $650 million at retail stores. "It's an amazing building, dead center in Times Square," Mr. Mendelson said of Mr. Moss's property. "It has within its four walls the best space in the city."
Although Mr. Moss grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., where the developer Seymour Durst was his baseball coach, his family's roots were in the theater business. His grandfather, Benjamin S. Moss, moved to New York at the turn of the century and opened a string of vaudeville theaters named after American historical figures or themes: Franklin, Jefferson, the Colony. Headliners included Milton Berle and George Burns.
After vaudeville faded, the Moss family switched to movie theaters, leasing space for the Criterion at 1514 Broadway. It opened in 1936.
Other tenants there included Woolworth's, Crawford Clothes and the International Casino, the largest and most dazzling of the big band nightclubs. Later, Bonds, a clothier, bought the building and ejected its rival, Crawford Clothes.
Mr. Moss said the police used to stop traffic in Times Square for movie premieres at the Criterion, while klieg lights brightened the sky and workers rolled out a red carpet from the theater, which showed the premiere of "My Fair Lady" and "Funny Girl," to the old Astor Hotel, where there was a party for the actors.
Mr. Durst, the late developer, bought the building in the 1960's with plans to build a 10-acre office complex that would rival Rockefeller Center. But during a recession in the early 1970's, Mr. Durst abandoned the property to his lender. Mr. Moss and his father, Charles S. Moss, reluctantly agreed to buy it in 1977 for $4 million in what had become a rundown district.
"At the time we bought the building, it was to preserve the Criterion," Mr. Moss said. "It was a huge financial risk for us."
Mr. Moss, who eventually sold most of his family's theaters, leased space to a succession of discotheques, restaurants and electronic stores. After several false starts in the 1980's, he decided to develop the property in 1997, when Times Square was emerging from a long decline.
Last summer, he opened talks with Bertelsmann, which had a giant tower next door at 1540 Broadway and was looking for a new home for its latest acquisition, Random House. Mr. Moss and his architect, Fox & Fowle, came up with a plan that would allow him to keep his retail space and billboards, by building a 35-story office tower on a platform over the existing building. Under that plan, the platform required only four support columns.
But just as the deal appeared to be coming to a close in November, Mr. Moss said, Bertelsmann executives said they needed a dozen columns, not four, for the platform. Complaining that the columns would consume too much of his retail space, Mr. Moss broke off negotiations.
Random House is now looking at a deal at Broadway and 55th Street, while Mr. Moss is looking for new tenants.
"Developing real estate in New York can be as complex as solving Rubik's Cube," said Ross Moskowitz, a real estate lawyer at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. "The difference here is that logic will only give you part of the puzzle because ego, personal relationships and other intangibles come into play."

HEADLINE: Despite Grim Test Scores, a School Marks Its Small Triumphs

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
The day was winding down in a hectic week for Magalie Pierre's class of fourth graders at Public School 129 in Harlem, and so a party was in order.
Every party has to have a toast, and the duty on Friday fell first on Juriel Gomez, who set aside his plate of pizza, grapes, popcorn and macaroni, pushed back his tiny classroom chair and held aloft a plastic cup filled with soda. 
 "A toast, to everyone who did well on the reading test," Juriel said to applause, as other students rose to offer more salutes to themselves, the school, Ms. Pierre, the principal -- even the people who wrote the test -- so they could have this party.
The students had not yet received their individual scores from the first sitting of the state's new fourth-grade reading exam, but the school did on Tuesday, along with the rest of the state. And at first blush, the festive mood and the toasts might appear to contradict the statistical reality.
At P.S. 129, one of 97 city schools on the state's roster of chronically low-performing schools, just 25 percent of the 95 fourth-graders met or exceeded the state standard. That was 8 percentage points below the citywide average of 33 percent, and 23 points below the state average of 48 percent.
But the school scored above other "schools under registration review," as those on the state roster are officially called; they registered an average of 16 percent. And it ranked third among 13 schools in District 5, whose average was 19 percent.
Beverly N. Lewis, the principal, who had prepped her students with extra tutoring over Christmas break and on weekends and wrote a special reading curriculum with teachers, greeted the results with a mixture of optimism and concern.
The school may have fared better than its low-performing peers, but it is still forever compared with schools across the state that lack the social ills her pupils face.
Nearly every one of her 800 students in kindergarten through sixth grade comes to the school, at 425 West 130th Street, from families poor enough to qualify for free lunches. A quarter of the students live in a shelter for homeless families down the street.
And on top of it all, the stakes are higher than ever. The school system plans to begin holding back failing students in the third, sixth and eighth grades as early as this year, and the 4th through 12th next year. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, reacting to the reading scores, has called for the dismissal of principals of schools performing most poorly on this and other tests.
Next week, the fourth graders will take the state's new mathematics test, which like the one on reading given in January, is said to be more rigorous than previous standardized tests because it asks students more analytic questions in addition to the usual multiple-choice questions.
"I'm very proud of our progress, but want everyone to be aware we have a long way to go," Dr. Lewis said in her office, festooned with slogans like "Readers Are Leaders" and "When You Believe in Yourself, Anything is Possible."
"Everyone" extends to the children. And so later on, in Ms. Pierre's classroom, Dr. Lewis picked up a cup and offered her own toast: "I'd like to toast all the children. I'm very proud of you and I know we are going to continue to make progress."
Progress is a slippery but important concept here. In November 1997 the school landed on the state's list -- with a threat that it would be closed after three years unless it showed gains on standardized tests and other measures. The next spring it posted a substantial gain on the state test, but still ranked well below city and state averages.
On exams the Board of Education gives in the third through eighth grades, 26 percent were reading at or above grade level last year, giving the school a rank of 619 out of 676.
The state has not yet decided what score on the new exam might take schools off its roster of poorly performing schools, or put new ones on.
Askia Davis, the District 5 administrator, said he did not expect an overnight success. "God is not going to wave a magic wand and say, 'Now you can all read on grade level,' " Dr. Davis said.
A state monitor, Sheila Evans-Tranumn, an associate commissioner at the State Department of Education, said she was heartened by the performance at P.S. 129, but wanted to see it and other troubled schools perform closer to citywide averages.
In the last few years the school has rooted out several apathetic teachers and received grants from the state, city and private sources to train teachers, offer after-school and weekend tutoring and buy computers.
Last year, about 250 students attended summer school, and Dr. Lewis said she expected the same number or more to do so this year, depending on financing from the board and other sources.
The school, a three-story brick building opened in 1958, slid academically as unemployment, drug abuse and homelessness brought down the neighborhood.
Adding to the trouble has been political turmoil in District 5, where Dr. Davis, a former central office administrator, arrived two years ago as interim superintendent to replace Bertrand Brown after a Board of Education report faulted him and the local school board for chronic educational failure.
Whatever the problems, the school's principal tends to put the best face on things.
"We have a lot of societal ills, but all our children can learn," Dr. Lewis said.
And so the school hums with activity from first bell at 8:30 A.M. till nearly 7 P.M. every day, and for several hours over winter and summer breaks and weekends.
Parents like Joyce Winn, who has daughters in the fourth and sixth grades and a son in kindergarten, said she had seen improvement. For instance, her fourth grader, Katherine, "instead of watching cartoons now reads books."
Ms. Winn said it was difficult to get parents involved in the school because they are working, caring for other children at home or slow to appreciate the importance of giving their children extra help at home, having lacked such attention themselves.
But Dr. Lewis and the staff of 47 teachers persevere.
During school hours, students are drilled with practice tests and extra reading of fables and folk tales, the kinds of stories that showed up on the fourth-grade exam.
Jennifer Tyler had her students keep journals and summarize virtually everything they read, even newspaper articles. For the state math test this week, the students on Friday went over work sheets filled with fractions.
Teachers try to boost self-esteem along with the scores.
"I tell them, 'Twenty years from now do you want to be pushing a broom?' " Ms. Tyler said. "I am pushing the stakes up."
The children speak of "staying on task" and "using reading strategies" -- meaning they read and write endlessly.
Aisha Smith, a fourth grader and one of a few pupils who did receive her score (the school is just beginning to distribute them), said all the preparation was worth it, even if she was a little disappointed that she scored a passing grade, level 3, but not the highest, level 4.
"I thought I would pass because our teacher gave us enough courage and enough help to do it," Aisha said.
The consequences of not doing well on such tests weigh on some minds.
"I'm very worried," said Ebony Wilder, a fourth grader. "I told my mother, 'Please don't be mad at me if I get held back.' "
But other fourth graders, like Melanie Hudson, do not mind the pressure. "Tests are good because you can prove to yourself that you passed and can go on to the next grade," she said.
In Ms. Pierre's class, Jose Garcia, who got over the anxiety of one test, must now face another on Wednesday, when he takes the math test.
"I like tests if it involves reading," he said. "But my worst subject, the one I don't really hate, but I don't like, is math. I don't know if I'm going to do well, but Ms. Pierre is helping us."

GOELZ, SHIRLEY J.

 BODY:
GOELZ-Shirley J. On May 25, 1999. Beloved wife of the late Charles V. Goelz. Devoted mother of Adam and Joshua Galef and Peter and Thomas Goelz. Loving sister of Eleanor Stillman. Also survived by five grandchildren and two nieces. Funeral private. Contributions in her memory to the Project Reachout Division of the Goddard Riverside Comm. Center, 593 Columbus Ave., NY, New York 10024 would be appreciated. A memorial service will be scheduled at a later date.
GREENE-Jerome L. On May 27, 1999, at age 93. Beloved husband of Dawn Greene. Loving father of Patricia Humphrey and the late Cynthia Sue Greene & stepfather of Christina McInerney. Cherished grandfather of Daniel and Joel Humphrey. Interment is private. Memorial service at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street, on Tuesday, June 15th, at 4PM. Contributions in his memory may be made to the Montefiore Children's Hospital.
GREENE-Jerome L. The President, the Board of Trustees and entire Montefiore Medical Center community deeply mourn the death of our dear friend and supporter, Jerome L. Greene. A devoted and active trustee since 1972, he had an extraordinary impact on the quality of health and life of thousands of Montefiore patients and residents of the Bronx and Westchester. Combining his skills as a lawyer with his belief in Montefiore as an instrument of social responsibility, he led the medical center in the founding, 18 years ago, of the Mosholu Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit community development support corporation that has, with his guidance, saved housing, revitalized neighborhoods and created innovative projects such as moderate income housing, a community newspaper that serves 15,000 households, the first and only NYC business improvement district sponsored under the auspices of an academic institution, a vast program of graffiti removal and a youth job training program-all of which have played a role in the Bronx's nationally recognized resurgence. He believed in the crucial role of academic medical centers such as Montefiore in advancing the health of communities through research, education and provision of high-quality care, and with his beloved wife, Dawn, he helped Montefiore create the Jerome L. and Dawn Greene Medical Arts Pavilion, a state-of-the-art building that opened in 1997 offering a full range of general and specialty services in an ambulatory care setting. More recently, he and his wife have been generous benefactors of The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, scheduled to open in 2001. In 1991, at its annual Celebrate Montefiore dinner dance, the medical center honored this remarkable man of vision and commitment for his exemplary stewardship. This year, Montefiore nominated him for the United Hospital Fund's 1999 Distinguished Community Service Award. The medical center has lost one of its greatest friends. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his loving wife, Dawn, and their entire family. Spencer Foreman, MD, President Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center
GREENE-Jerome L. The Directors and Officers of Mosholu Preservation Corporation (MPC) note with profound regret the passing of our founding Chairman, Jerome L. Greene. Mr. Greene's foresight in founding MPC, Montefiore Medical Center's non-profit community development support corporation, has served the community and its health for 18 years. The establishment of MPC was rooted in Mr. Greene's strong belief that Montefiore's commitment to broader public health issues and its long tradition of social responsibility was directly related to neighborhood preservation. His generosity and hands-on leadership of the Corporation made possible the creation of solutions to major problems of community life. His vision helped form a national model for institutional participation in community development. His efforts will mean better lives for people for generations to come. Lewis Henkind, Chairman Dart Westphal, President Spencer Foreman, MD, Secretary Maurice E. LaBonne, Treasurer
GREENE-Jerome. The Juilliard School deeply mourns the death of Jerome L. Greene. A Trustee of the School since 1985, he brought extraordinary leadership to the institution through his exceptional intellect, unique vision, and caring sensitivity to the needs of all members of the Juilliard Community. With a quick wit and a devotion to the performing and visual arts, he enriched us all through his presence and commitment to the School. The Jerome L. Greene Fellowships stand as the first scholarship fund in the history of Juilliard to be created for all three of the performing arts taught at the School. His wise counsel and generosity also made Juilliard's residence hall a reality. We send our heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife, Dawn, and all of his family. He will be profoundly missed by us all. Mary Rodgers Guettel, Chairman Joseph W. Polisi, President
GREENE-Jerome L. Once in a great while there comes along a person, who in life makes an indelible impression upon others by their very being...that their memory will likely never fade. Jerome L. Greene was one of those rare individuals. The Carlyle has long been a part of his life, and he has been so very important to this New York institution. We cherish most and value greatest that we were privileged to know, love and be influenced by him, for he was a very special man. Dan Camp and the Staff of The Carlyle
GREENE-Jerome L. The firm of Richards & O'Neil, LLP, expresses its sadness on the passing of its longtime friend and client, Jerome L. Greene. Jerry was a mentor to several of our partners. We admired his legal and business acumen, his dynamic personality and his generous nature. His many charitable endeavors on behalf of educational, medical and cultural organizations will leave a lasting legacy. We mourn his loss and extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Dawn and his family.
GREENE-Jerome. The Board and Staff of the Citizens Committee for New York City note with deep sorrow the loss of its beloved director Jerry Greene. A dedicated New Yorker, he believed in the power of the city's people to make life better. His gentle humor and generous spirit will be missed. Our deepest sympathy to his wife Dawn, his daughter Patricia, and his entire family. Oz, Michael and the entire Board and Staff.
GREENE-Jerome L. The Board of Directors and members of the Quaker Ridge Golf Club record with deep sorrow the passing of our esteemed member, Jerome L. Greene, whose many years of friendship and devotion to the Club will always be remembered. We extend our deepest sympathy to the family. Richard M. Feldman, President Edward J. Landau, Secretary
GREENE-Jerome L. The Winter Organization and the entire Winter family extend their deepest condolences to the family of Jerome L. Greene, an esteemed friend and partner for many years. We will miss his wise counsel and warm wit.
GREENE-Jerome L. With condolences to Dawn and her family. We bid a sad farewell to our good friend and partner, Jerome L. Greene. Liliane and Norman Peck

HEADLINE: Presidential Candidates Seem Indifferent to a Salary Rise

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
The people who want to be President seem almost indifferent to an issue of public policy that could affect one of them personally: How much should the next chief executive be paid?
Despite repeated requests, fewer than half the candidates commented last week on a proposal in Congress to raise the pay of the President to $400,000. The salary has been $200,000 since Richard M. Nixon took office in 1969. 
 "Al Gore has spent his career in public service to help people, not to go after a pay raise," said Melissa Ratcliff, a spokeswoman for the Vice President.
Former Senator Bill Bradley, Mr. Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination, had a similar view. "You don't run for this job for the annual salary," Mr. Bradley said through his spokesman, Tony Wyche. "I think we should leave it up to Congress."
The leading Republican candidate agreed entirely. "It's the job of the Congress to decide," Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said through his spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker.
One of his rivals for the Republican nomination, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, also declined to involve himself in the debate. "I shouldn't help to set the salary I will receive as President," Mr. Alexander said through his chief press aide, Bo Harmon.
Steve Forbes, another Republican candidate, opposes a raise for the next President, said his spokeswoman, Juleanna Glover Weiss. The wealthy Mr. Forbes, of course, does not have to worry about money.
Gary L. Bauer, a social and religious conservative, is regarded by pollsters as the longest of long shots for the Republican nomination, but on the issue of Presidential pay his views -- as far as they go -- are in line with those of his countrymen.
"I can tell you that Gary opposes doubling the President's salary all at once," Mr. Bauer's spokeswoman, Jessica Morris, said.
So do most Americans, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press in Washington. Only one person in four thought the President's pay should rise by more than $20,000.
About two-thirds of those surveyed said the President should get a raise at least once a decade. Told that the President's pay had not gone up since 1969, 49 percent said the next one should get a raise while 39 percent said no.
But when those surveyed were told that the President now makes $200,000 (a fact only 19 percent of the respondents knew beforehand), plus $100,000 for travel and $50,000 for expenses, only 41 percent favored a raise, while 55 percent opposed one.
The survey was based on telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of 1,179 adults from May 12 through May 16 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The public's feelings notwithstanding, witnesses who appeared last week before a panel of the House Committee on Government Reform were "nearly unanimous" that the President's pay should go to $400,000, said Russell George, chief counsel and staff director of the Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and Technology.
Former Presidential aides who might agree on little else, politically or historically, were united in their view that the President's compensation (even with its many fringe benefits) ought to go up.
"This is not even a close call," said Kenneth Duberstein, a former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan. "This needs to be addressed now. It is a case of simple equity."
Alexander M. Haig, onetime chief of staff to Nixon, agreed, as did John H. Sununu, who held the job under President George Bush, and Thomas F. McLarty 3d, former staff chief to President Clinton.
Mr. McLarty said that other high officials, unlike the President, are eligible for Congressionally approved cost-of-living increases but that those increases were becoming minimal out of fear that the pay of some officials would overtake the President's. For instance, the Vice President, the Chief Justice of the United States and the Speaker of the House make $175,400.
If Congress does not act on a Presidential raise in 1999, it may be even less likely to do so in 2000, since the pay of public officials is a sensitive issue to take up in an election year. If nothing is done before noon on Jan. 20, 2001, the next President will not get a raise.
Five Republican candidates, former Vice President Dan Quayle, Elizabeth Dole, Patrick J. Buchanan, Senator Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire and Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, declined comment on whether the next person in the White House should be paid more.
But it is a safe bet that they agree with Governor Bush and former Governor Alexander on one point. "He'd take the job either way," Ms. Tucker said of Mr. Bush.
"That's our position, too," Mr. Harmon said for Mr. Alexander.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 3, 1999, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the opinions of Presidential candidates on whether the next President of the United States should get a pay increase misstated the attitude of Elizabeth Dole. Rather than being one of five Republican candidates declining to comment on the President's salary, Mrs. Dole told Speaker J. Dennis Hastert in a letter last week that Congress should reject a proposal to raise it to $400,000. She said the current figure of $200,000 was "fair and appropriate," considering the many perquisites of the office.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "DOLLARS AND SENSE: Presidential Pay"
Starting at $25,000 in 1789, the President's salary has been raised only four times. It was first raised to $50,000 for Ulysses S. Grant's second term. William H. Taft was the first beneficiary of the second raise; pay was raised again for Harry S. Truman's second term. Richard M. Nixon was the first to benefit from the most recent raise.

HEADLINE: Report Cards: How the Island's Fourth Graders Are Reading

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL 

 BODY:
The New York State Education Department released the first results of its new fourth-grade English Language Arts test last week, and the results were a disappointment to many parents and teachers across the state. The new test, administered over three days in January, was designed to measure how many fourth graders meet new standards requiring them to read complicated passages and write intelligently about them.
 The results showed that many students have a long way to go. Across the state, 52 percent failed to meet the standards. And even on Long Island, with some of the best-performing schools in the state, 38 percent fell short of the standards, and fewer than 7 percent scored at an advanced level. 
 What follow are the scores for every public school with a fourth grade, along with information on family income so schools with students of similar economic status can be compared.
 Here are explanations of the categories.
 STUDENTS TESTED The number of fourth graders who took the test. Unlike past results, these include special education students who took the test.
 INCOME Percentage of students who did not qualify for free lunch, based on Federal income guidelines in 1998. The higher the number, the higher the income. When schools did not provide a percentage, the state provided an alternative measure.
 PERFORMANCE LEVELS Percentage of students in each category.
 Levels are ranked from 1 (lowest) to 4. Students at levels 1 and 2 fall below the standards, with those at level 1 having serious deficiences and those at level 2 needing extra help.
 Students at levels 3 and 4 meet the standards. Those at level 3 are on track to meet the state's high school graduation requirements, and those at level 4 perform at consistently high levels.
 PERCENTAGE MEETING STANDARDS The black bar shows the percentage of students who scored at level 3 or 4.
 Note: Blanks indicate missing data.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
Venturing (Widely) Forth With City Hall Capital

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
CITIES and states everywhere long to be the next Silicon Someplace. Many have used tax money to set up business incubators and promote their attractions to entrepreneurs; some even throw subsidies and tax relief at technology companies to lure them to set up shop, create jobs and join the local tax rolls.
But as a piece of civic boosterism, the Prospect Street NYC Discovery fund is a strange animal. 
 It was created in 1995 by the City of New York to invest in fledgling technology companies, using tax money and contributions from several of the city's utilities. At the time, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the city expected the fund's activities to generate 4,000 new local jobs, foster a hot new business sector and maybe even earn a decent return on the investment.
Four years later, the fund's returns have indeed been decent, though far from stellar. But the fund has sometimes strayed from its other goals. Few new jobs have been created directly, and several of the fund's investments have been in companies with a tenuous connection to high technology and none at all to the city.
Among the major beneficiaries of the fund's activities have been the people who run it. Executives at Prospect Street Ventures, the New York-based venture capital firm paid by the city to operate the fund, have also been compensated in cash and stock option grants by companies in which the fund has invested, for serving on their boards of directors.
The fund's initial capital of $30 million in equity -- $10 million of it from city coffers -- and $26 million in Small Business Administration loans has since grown to $76 million, with $48.3 million invested in 11 companies and the rest in liquid investments awaiting deployment. Prospect Street executives now sit on the boards of nine of those companies, positioning them to reap windfalls if the companies prove successful.
It is common for major early investors in a start-up company to get seats on the board, so they can keep a close watch on their investments and help the company grow. Prospect Street, which also invests for private-sector funds, routinely asks for such representation when the Discovery fund invests. "It's not a hard-and-fast rule," said Stephen G. Hall, a principal at Prospect Street. "But getting a board seat is typically a prerequisite."
In the Discovery fund's case, it is public money that the managers are investing and risking, while they personally reap the rewards of the board seats. "We're aware of this arrangement," said Bernadette O'Leary, a spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, which oversees the fund. "It's very standard for the industry and it's in keeping with our agreement."
John F. Barry, the managing partner of Prospect Street, is himself on the boards of eight companies that have received money from the Discovery fund, including two that reported the compensation of their directors to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those documents show that Mr. Barry has personally received cash, stock and stock options for his services -- for example, 18,750 shares of 24/7 Media, a New York-based Internet advertising company whose stock has risen sharply since its initial public offering in 1998 and closed on Friday at $28.50. Mr. Hall said the compensation is justified because "there needs to be appropriate incentives to take on that liability" of being a director, and added that Mr. Barry holds such stock and options on behalf of his firm, Prospect Street Ventures.
To be sure, the executives work for the money. A new Internet company can consist merely of a couple of sharp programmers with a bright idea but no management experience. Experienced directors like the Prospect Street executives often help shape business plans and recruit crucial employees. (Prospect Street highlights on its Web site the hands-on role of its executives in companies in which it invests.)
That kind of work has helped the fund post a cumulative return of 108 percent over four years -- not bad, though many technology-stock mutual funds have gained far more during the same period.
City officials say the fund's activities have helped accelerate the creation of Silicon Alley, a district in Manhattan extending roughly from the Flatiron Building to the financial district where Internet companies congregate. They say they are pleased with the results, though they acknowledge that Silicon Alley grew mostly on its own.
"It's not as if somebody in City Hall said, 'Hey, I know, let's get a bunch of kids in their 20's with shoulder-length ponytails, give them computers and and see what happens," said Charles Millard, the director of the city development agency, who is resigning to become a managing director at Prudential Securities. "They simply try to help the market that has occurred on its own function more powerfully."
The fund's managers estimate that its investments have created 600 jobs so far.
Prospect Street was selected from among four bidders to manage the fund. Its mission was to find suitable New York City technology companies for $1 million to $6 million investments. Almost immediately, records of the fund's investments indicate, Prospect Street began to stray from the target.
Some $3 million went into Bondnet Trading Systems, a Connecticut operator of an Internet securities trading service. Mr. Barry was named chairman and chief executive of Bondnet, and Mr. Hall was named to the board. Investing in a Connecticut technology company was appropriate, Mr. Hall said, because most of its business was done in New York. The company's assets were bought by the Bank of New York in 1997.
The fund also invested in All Service Computer Rental, an Englewood, N.J., company that seems to fit none of the fund's stated purposes: It is not in New York, has no direct ties to Internet commerce and, having been in business since 1985, is not a fledgling. "The most important goal of the fund is to receive a return," Mr. Hall said. "It's our most profitable company."
The fund's very first investment was also of questionable relevance, and has performed terribly. In July 1995, when the fund was less than two months old, Prospect Street bought 1.09 million shares of Skyline Multimedia Entertainment, which operates a virtual-reality ride at the Empire State Building and an arcade near Times Square, at $2.75 a share. Mr. Barry joined Skyline's board and by November 1996 had been personally granted options to buy 10,000 shares of Skyline stock at $3.50 to $5 a share.
The next month, the company began work on a new virtual-reality ride in Sydney, Australia, and sank nearly $1 million into film footage for it; the project collapsed when a lease fell through. Around the same time, the company made substantial loans to one of its executives. Still, the Discovery fund pumped in capital, $500,000 more in 1997 and a further $435,000 in 1998, while the stock was losing nearly all its value; on Friday, it traded for 6.25 cents a share.
"It's very common for a venture capital firm to continue investing in a company that we think has potential," Mr. Hall said. "We have some investments that are all-stars and some that are not."
Since 1997, the fund has also found successful Internet companies in which to invest, including Multex, Miningco.com (since renamed About.com) and 24/7 Media. Dean Margolis, chief executive of Comet Systems, which has grown to employ 40 people in New York, said Prospect Street chipped in $2.4 million of the company's $2.5 million in start-up capital.
But of the 14 Manhattan technology companies that planned public offerings in the second quarter of 1999, only one, Juno Online Services, has received money from the Discovery fund. Juno went public last Wednesday at $13 a share and closed on Friday at $12.25.
"We're really in the business of looking into the future," Mr. Barry said. "Unfortunately, no one has given us a crystal ball."

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about Prospect Street NYC Discovery, a venture capital fund created with New York City tax money, misstated its performance. In the four years ended March 31, the fund's internal rate of return averaged 100 percent a year; it was not 108 percent cumulatively.
The article also referred incorrectly to securities granted to John F. Barry, managing partner of Prospect Street Ventures, the firm that operates the fund, for serving on the boards of companies in which it invested. The grants were entirely of stock options, not options and stock.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Asia, Slowly Recovering, Still Offers Bargains

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
WITH the economies of most Asian nations appearing to be slowly on the mend, the region's airlines and hotels are no longer practically giving away their services, as they were less than a year ago. Nevertheless, there are still lots of travel bargains to Asia, and travelers whose plans can accommodate midweek departures, Saturday stays and other restrictions can save money, or at least enjoy an array of extras.
Experts say the bargains are also beneficial to countries in the region. "Tourism is actually helping to stimulate economic recovery and growth in destinations including South Korea, Thailand and Bali," said Joseph A. McInerney, the chief executive of the Pacific Asia Travel Association in Bangkok. "In Thailand, for example, tourist arrivals from the U.S. reached 361,705 in 1998 -- a 16.3 percent increase over 1997." 
 The biggest bargains, as usual, are those offered by the airlines, which typically arrange package deals with tour operators and hotels.
Northwest Airlines, for example, is offering a Bangkok package that includes air fare and five nights in a hotel for $669 for West Coast departures, and $717 from New York, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Memphis and Minneapolis/St. Paul. After June 30, prices rise to $809 and $845, for travel through Aug. 31. Other Northwest packages are available for travel to Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo.

Also included are a daily American buffet breakfast and 500 miles with either United Airlines or Japan Airlines.
Marriott Hotels are lowering rates, at least through September, and are making more of amenities packages. In addition to ground transportation to and from the airport, a daily newpaper and free use of the health club, the Marriott Royal Garden Riverside Hotel in Bangkok is offering a 50 percent discount on tennis lessons.
Hilton Hotels in Singapore, Tokyo, Bangkok, Taipei and Beijing have also trimmed prices modestly and added upgrades, transportation, breakfasts and other perks. Most of the hotels will offer the promotions at least through September.

 BODY:

THE NIGHT INSPECTOR
 By Frederick Busch.
 Illustrated. 278 pp. New York:
 Harmony Books. $23. 
 EDMUND WILSON wrote a vast study of 19th-century American literature, "Patriotic Gore," in order to answer the question of why so few novels were written about the Civil War by those who experienced it. Perhaps, like the Holocaust (but unlike World War I), it was an event so overturning of values, so profoundly dehumanizing even as it promoted a noble end, that those who experienced it could not conceive of how to tell the truth about it in the modes available to them.
In time, we might learn how, or learn many different ways how, from Stephen Crane to Frederick Busch's new novel, "The Night Inspector." The book is centrally about how to tell truths the soul has not found words for or that no one else can hear -- or wishes to.
William Bartholomew was a sharpshooter in the war, the model in fact for Winslow Homer's famous rendering of a Union sniper in a tree. Detached from his unit with only a sergeant and a couple of privates, he stalked Southern soldiers, gaining a terrible reputation not only among the Confederate troops he preyed on but also among the Northern soldiers, who shunned him. We learn Bartholomew's war story in fragments as he haunts the infamous Five Points neighborhood of lower Manhattan after the war, among the outlaw gangs, wild pigs, lost children and sewer rats, human and otherwise. He wears always a papier-mche mask, made by a prosthetist to hide the disfigurement of a hideous bullet wound that ended his sharpshooting. "You have your limbs, God forgive us," the prosthetist tells him. "I suggest that I am proof of His unreadiness to do so," Bartholomew replies. He is in business now, making money in the brutal and very personal battleground of New York commerce, collecting his own debts on the streets like a gangster, and yet he is a profound observer and rememberer, as self-possessed as when he hid unmoving in the trees with his Sharps rifle.
Among the night people he comes to know downtown is a former writer of fiction, once very popular, then not popular, now nearly silent except for the obsessive writing of verse no one reads. He is employed as a deputy customs inspector; he wears a tin badge and carries locks with which to seal cargoes that he suspects of being illegally unloaded. Busch names him with a certain coyness as M, but he is indeed the author of "Moby-Dick."
"I am the man I was," he tells the masked Bartholomew. "I am my own secret now, however. I am my darkest, best-held secret. Do I wish to be? I would prefer not to. Do I choose? I do not. Shipmate: Like the nation, I was divided from myself; like the nation I was wounded; riven, like the nation I healed; like you now, Bill, I am healthy; we are whole." This Melvillean irony, so harsh and utter, is the spirit of this book; Busch's sinewy and truth-telling prose is its body.
Why did Bartholomew become a sharpshooter? Not out of allegiance to the Union cause, for he believes Abraham Lincoln to have been a vain blowhard and the real causes of the war to be economic. We are not allowed to know why, but we know that Bartholomew was capable before the war of plotting a dreadful death for a smarmy uncle who forced himself upon Bartholomew's widowed mother. He seems to others to be a creature of cold resolve, inhuman, death itself; he knows himself to have always been afraid.
Bartholomew remembers every Confederate he shot from ambush: the young officer reading a letter, the "Rebel whore" who tried to defend her house and her clients from his shots out of the darkness, the two men engaged together in sex. The death that stings him most is that of a dog he threw himself upon and killed with his knife so that it could not give him away: "His jaws, in the grip of my left hand, were under my belly, and he heaved beneath me like someone at love. Up and down we jerked and rode and sawed, I like death itself come down on him from the evening, and the tired, terrified, dying dog like any one of us."
Unwillingly, unwittingly, Bartholomew imports the tragic violence of his past life into his present. He sells his Army revolver to M for a pittance, as a gift for M's son Malcolm, a feckless and self-indulgent youth who has joined the National Guard. Malcolm, after a drunken night, kills himself in his bedroom with this pistol -- by accident or not no one can know.
Guns, locks and masks are invoked often, their varied significance noticed and discussed by Bartholomew and the grieving M. Bartholomew frequents an uptown brothel -- the same one where Melville's son was accustomed to drink -- and he spends his new money on Jessie, a former slave whose "golden" skin, obsessively referred to, is marked with tattoos, which she reads for him. She is one of two women who are allowed to see Bartholomew without his mask (the other being a sturdy Chinese washerwoman who bathes him in her steaming tubs). He allows Jessie to talk him into a plot to abduct and bring to New York a shipload of black children still held in slavery in Florida, an act of generosity to which he brings all his considerable resources, and into which he draws M, the night inspector.
The workings of Jessie's plot move very slowly forward; what compels the reader more are Bartholomew's conversations with M and with Sam Mordecai, a young reporter down from Boston who was one of the soldiers in Bartholomew's detachment during the war. Sam wants above all to be a writer; he is one of those few readers who remember and revere M for his books. Sam's attempts to understand and record the bristling and formidable M, and M's awful grief and relentless self-questioning about his son's death, are given to us in Sam's notebook, a reporter's scribbled transcriptions that are at the same time a truly Melvillean rhapsody, and a triumph for the writer -- for Busch, that is.
There are various ways of giving authenticity to a period novel, and Busch has chosen the simplest and most effective -- and the most difficult: his prose and his conversations are precisely, surprisingly and thoroughly of their time; these sentences ring like silver dollars on cobblestone. Since no one alive today can really know what the sound of conversation, or of private thoughts, really was then, there can be no question of actuality, but of authenticity we can judge: this is the voice of that time as we know it from its own writings, only spoken by a man more of our time than his.
It is not the only pleasure of "The Night Inspector." The sharpshooting scenes are compelling, and Busch shows great skill in moving us from the killing fields to postwar New York without fuss or confusion, and without the melodramatic jump-cuts that are the usual method. The harsh wit of the dialogue is wonderful: "A recent loss?" Sam asks when Bartholomew mentions his uncle's death. "No, you would have to call it a profit," Bartholomew says.
THE plot to save the slave children is not what it seems, and Bartholomew's belief that money and business rule the world is horribly borne out at the end. Sam, M and Billy join a nightmarish rescue attempt on the Hudson at night, more reminiscent of the 19th-century fantasist Charles Brockden Brown (whom Bartholomew once read with interest at Harvard) than of Melville.
Busch, pulling for shore in the last scenes of his book, loses something of the force of his characters and his language even as the darkness of the story deepens; it's the novelist's curse, the wrapping-up of the plot, and characters often shrink away in the process. But Busch's bitter closing is neatly allayed by a couple of postscripts, one tart, one sweet. In one, Billy, M and Sam observe the sensational performance of Charles Dickens reading from his own works -- unlike the forgotten Melville, "he would carry away from New York several hundreds of thousands of dollars"; the other is a gentle, almost Tolstoyan, last glimpse of Billy and the Chinese washerwoman: "a tea-colored woman with an oval, impassive face, and a man beside her whose face was a mask of another sort." "The Night Inspector" is a marvelously dark-hued story by a master craftsman, and watching mastery at work provides at least a part of the pleasure of reading it.

HEADLINE: A Peacenik Goes to War

BYLINE: By Josef Joffe; Josef Joffe is the editorial-page editor and a columnist for Sddeutsche Zeitung, a national daily published in Munich.

 BODY:
Think of Abbie Hoffman or Jerry Rubin, yesteryear's counterculture icons, and imagine them as Secretary of State today. That will give you a first approximation of Joschka Fischer, 51, the onetime political prankster, street fighter and revolutionary who was sworn in as Germany's Foreign Minister last fall.
When Fischer himself fell prey to a prankster earlier this month -- having his head and face splattered with red paint -- his personal transformation was virtually complete. Joschka Fischer, the perennial bad boy of German politics, was now the victim of political theater, the establishment object of counterculture protest. 
Thirty years ago, he battled against American "imperialism" in the streets of Frankfurt; this year, he closed ranks with the United States in Germany's first shooting war since 1945. Two decades ago, Fischer and his fellow Green Party members marched against the deployment of Pershing nuclear missiles in Western Europe; today, the defrocked pacifist looks on approvingly as the Pentagon lobs cruise missiles into Serbia.
Fischer recalls his last conversation with the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, in Belgrade, just before NATO unleashed its planes on March 24. "I am ready to walk on corpses, and the West is not," the Serbian strongman said. "This is why I shall win." Milosevic's cynical arrogance, Fischer says, bristling, convinced him right then that the bombs had to fly.
Nor is the renegade from the peace uber Alles camp alone. His Chancellor, the former left-wing radical Gerhard SchrRated PG-13der, wants to "break Milosevic's criminal will," but not with ground troops, as he emphasized in a May 19 statement that reverberated throughout NATO capitals. That's a step too far, not only for Germany but also for virtually every European nation except Britain. Like Fischer, the Chancellor, a Social Democrat, says that "Milosevic must not win this war." And so do many of Fischer's Greens -- grudgingly, ambivalently. One of those is Angelika Beer, a Communist in her student days, who now represents the Greens on the Bundestag's Defense Committee. "Guarding the peace and protecting human rights," she intones, "are two Green objectives that cannot be realized simultaneously at this point."
Fischer's enemies in the party are not so polite, heckling him, jeering and, in that one celebrated instance, pelting him with a plastic bag filled with red paint. In that incident, during a convention called hastily this month to debate the Kosovo war, his eardrum was broken by the impact. Yet Fischer didn't give an inch. His address to the 800 delegates (protected by 400 police officers) was his final farewell to the party's fundamentalists.
"Peace," he thundered, "means that men aren't murdered, women aren't raped and people aren't driven from their homes." Some of his comrades were calling for an unconditional halt in the bombing. "If you pass this resolution," he bellowed, "I will not act on it!" The pacifist extremists got only 318 votes, while the moderate resolution introduced by the leadership carried the day with 444 votes.
The Greens did not bolt from the Government, and Germany did not go AWOL on the West's war against Belgrade. Today, the old America-basher Joschka Fischer has only kind words for the "last remaining superpower." No, he insists, he was "never anti-American." He was "against a lot of American policy," he said recently. "But I felt close to American culture. Berkeley was around the corner. Woodstock . . . was our own culture." He sounds like Madeleine Albright when he affirms that "the United States is an indispensable power for me -- even if Europe unites, it will need an Atlantic insurance policy."
In conversations with reporters, Fischer keeps insisting on the powerful connection between Germany's democracy and its Westbindung, or "community with the West." "If we turn our back on that community," he says, "we might jeopardize our democratic revolution." And that, he is quick to add, is the first in German history that has worked. No Schaukelpolitik for him -- the policy of maneuver and balance between East and West that has regularly brought grief to both Germany and Europe. "To me," Fischer insists, "the West is an indispensable insurance against the return of German nationalism."
But Germany is indisputably shedding the fetters of the cold war, raising difficult questions about what its foreign policy should be. Fischer is emphatic on what it should not be. It should "never again be back to Bismarck," a hegemonial policy that would try to run Europe from Berlin. That would reactivate precisely the "nightmare of coalitions" Bismarck had dreaded all his life. But isn't that too modest a role for Europe's most powerful country?
Fischer responds with a slight smile, "We lead from the second row, but we are doing quite well there." This could be Helmut Kohl speaking. Like the former Chancellor, to whose girth Fischer once aspired, the new Foreign Minister has the twin lessons of this century practically bred into his genes. When Germany struck out on its own, it reaped disaster. When it went for community and integration, it flourished.
"The more we pursue our interests multilaterally, through Europe," Fischer postulates, "the more we'll get for ourselves." In other words, you do well by doing good for others. Not bad for a medium-great power that has learned in the most painful way that wingtips and cell phones are far more useful than panzers and jackboots.
A pacifist going to war? An anti-Vietnam marcher praising America? Self-reinvention is Joschka Fischer's business. He reminds you a bit of Forrest Gump, who ran his way to fame and riches, grabbing and shedding personas as he went. Fischer, who began the morphing game when he ditched his official first name, Joseph (for the Joschka of his forebears, who lived in Hungary), started running seriously rather late in life -- when his third wife, Claudia, 17 years his junior, dumped him in 1996. (He just married No. 4, Nicola Leske, a 29-year-old journalism student.) Traumatized by the breakup, Fischer literally transformed himself. He was so fat back then that he would wheeze after a mere dash to the refrigerator. So he took up jogging with a fierce determination. Over the next several months, he drove his ballooning frame down from 240 to 165 pounds.
And he kept running. No more booze, cigarettes and wurst, just mineral water, veggies and muesli. And Puccini, especially "La Boh<heart>me," which struck him as "real tripping music, and more psychedelic than Pink Floyd." It was the Hamburg Marathon next, and -- joints willing -- it will be New York, his great dream, one of these days.
In the meantime, though, there was a bigger race to win: the 1998 election. His Greens, an infighting bunch of pacifists, ecologists, counterculturists and plain old leftists, had been around for almost 20 years, in and out of Parliament. Unlike his fundamentalist comrades (known as "fundis"), Fischer and his growing retinue of "realos" knew that '98 was the Greens' first, and perhaps only, chance to slip into Government -- as junior partners of Gerhard SchrRated PG-13der's Social Democrats.
So Fischer stopped pursuing the runner's high and instead began to jog for power. To bring in the vote, he crisscrossed the country, "a bit in each district," for a grand total of 300 miles. He drew enough recruits for the Greens (6.7 percent of the vote) to push the Social Democrats over the top.
On the night of Sept. 27, Kohl, Germany's apparent Chancellor-in-Perpetuity, was history. The man who had ruled Germany for 16 years was replaced by a Red-and-Green duo: by Gerhard SchrRated PG-13der as Chancellor and Joschka Fischer as Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister.
No more Nike running shoes like the gleaming white pair Fischer wore at his swearing-in as Environment Minister in Hesse, his home state, in 1985. Back then, the good people of Frankfurt could not believe that this punk, who used to lead the shock troops of Revolution<diamond=rer Kampf (Revolutionary Struggle) against their finest, was now going to ride around in an official Mercedes-Benz.
Since last fall, however, nobody has seen the ex-punk in anything but a gray three-piece suit, complete with french cuffs and dark solid or polka-dot ties. He also sports a signet ring, the traditional affectation of German aristocrats. Considering his most humble beginnings, this get-up has "Only in America" written all over it. Though this is Germany, Fischer does embody an American career in spades -- from high-school dropout to the seventh floor of Foggy Bottom, as it were, in 33 years.
His father, a butcher in a meat-processing plant, was felled by a stroke when Fischer was 18. He recalls how he went to the hospital to pick up his father's belongings, "those work clothes reeking of fat and blood, the greasy butcher's satchel he had lugged around all these years." Back in his parents' apartment, he had an epiphany, as he recalls it. "I was at home, all alone, and I told myself, 'No, I ain't gonna live like that."'
He had already quit high school the year before, at 17, and there was Edeltraud, a girl he had just met. The two of them took off together, hitchhiking to Paris, Amsterdam and Marseilles, where they spent the nights in empty freight cars. To feed themselves, they covered the Marseilles sidewalks with chalk paintings -- Jesus figures and windjammers -- that might elicit some coins from passers-by. Then a run to Gretna Green, Scotland, where minors could marry without parental consent in those days.
Fischer (who never did finish high school) also tried his luck as a wedding photographer, auto worker, used-book seller and taxi driver, his most stable job. He wrote countless tracts on left-wing politics and taught his fellow travelers from the Revolutionary Struggle how to fight the "pigs." Did Fischer ever engage in "revolutionary violence" himself? He is adept at dodging the question. A former comrade in arms, Thomas Schmid, now the editorial-page editor of the conservative daily Die Welt, says, "No comment."
Since his latest reinvention, Fischer has roamed the world in a Luftwaffe Airbus, with his very own sleeping quarters decorated in haute motel-modern. In the back there is a retinue of 20 aides and two dozen reporters and photographers. Asked why he keeps recasting himself, Fischer stretches out on his cabin bed and clasps his hands behind his neck. "I hate nothing more than boredom," he says. "When you reach the point where you've exhausted all the possibilities of your present life, you choose another one -- just like a mountain climber who goes for the top only to start looking for the next one."
He has gone for a new life every 10 years or so, he reports, but, no, he is no Forrest Gump. "More like Robert De Niro, who really lives his roles. So do I, I live them, too. And now I am the Foreign Minister." Thomas Schmid agrees with the De Niro analogy, adding tartly, "He has an incredible mimetic talent."
So Fischer keeps changing and running, and the media lap it up. "They treat him like a rock star," said Richard Burt, the former United States Ambassador to Germany, as he watched a horde of photographers converge on Fischer at a recent strategy conference in Munich.
Fischer is quite specific about the events that made him veer off the revolutionary road, which by 1976 left him arrested and jailed after a police car was firebombed during a demonstration. With a young officer near death, Fischer and a dozen others were brought in on a possible charge of attempted murder. But at the arraignment the next day, the judge let all of them go. Two months later, pro-Palestinian German terrorists hijacked an Air France airplane to Entebbe, Uganda.
Suddenly, Fischer saw ugly reality behind the self-righteous anti-Zionism of his kaffiyeh-clad comrades, who chose to cast the Israelis as Nazis and the Palestinians as Jews. Why would young Germans concoct this bizarre projection if they were supposedly protesting not only against capitalism and imperialism but also against their parents' complicity with Nazism? By raging against the evils inflicted on the Palestinians by Jews, young Germans could regain the moral high ground precisely against those who kept reminding them of their inherited guilt. That was the unconscious function of anti-Zionism. Nor is this ancient history. During the gulf war, one of Fischer's Greens, Hans-Christian StrRated PG-13bele, declared that Saddam Hussein's Scud attacks on Israel were but payback for the occupation of Palestinian lands.
In Entebbe, Fischer recalls, "those pretending to be anti-fascists almost compulsively re-enacted what they had blamed their fathers for, where they separated Jewish and non-Jewish passengers." He deliberately uses the German word selektieren, the process by which Jews were chosen for the gas chamber.
Entebbe and a wave of terrorist murders that swept Germany in 1977 were the turning point where "illusions were lost," Fischer reports. At that moment, "the best ideals and intentions . . . degenerated into high crimes -- that was a defining experience for me." It was time for another metamorphosis.
In 1981, he joined the one-year-old Green Party and, after the 1983 election, suddenly found himself sitting face to face with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the Bundestag. Though he would not drop one of his previous personas: the clowning provocateur who loves to play to the gallery. He remained an in-your-face agitator who, during one heated debate, hurled a scatological epithet against the President of the Bundestag before quickly adding, "If you don't mind, sir." Rhetorically, he bragged, he was doing to Kohl's parliamentary minions what "Attila and Genghis Khan had done to the West."
Throughout the early 1980's, Fischer continued his slow transformation from revolutionary to Realpolitiker. The strategic calculus was obvious. His Greens could climb to the top only on the backs of the Social Democrats, but as radical pacifists and neutralists, the Greens were untouchables -- even for the leftish Social Democrats. So while holding on to his pacifist cloak, Fischer started pushing to the right. It was a long, uphill battle.
In 1985, he signaled his party to grow up by subtly ridiculing its hatred of NATO. Cautiously, he expressed his "doubts" about "how far one could get with the slogan 'Out of NATO!"' Not very far, he might have added, if the Greens wanted the Social Democrats' stamp of approval. In the mid-80's they did not, putting ideology above interest. A year later, the party congress passed its notorious "Germany Out of NATO" resolution, which further stated that "there can be no peace with NATO." Fischer refused to vote for it -- an act of considerable courage in those days.
Fundamentalist strength reached its zenith in 1986, arguably the height of the cold war, but it took another 10 years before the intraparty balance of power began to tilt toward the "realos." Much of the credit belongs to Fischer, who patiently chipped away at the extremist positions of his brethren. In 1994, he published "Risiko Deutschland" (roughly, "Hazard Germany"), a long essay on German foreign policy. With the "fundis" watching his every step for "right-wing deviationism," Fischer still felt constrained to drape his pro-Western sentiments in the conditional. "If it is true," he reasoned, "that integration in the West is Germany's central raison d'tre, then the German left will have to rethink its nationalist-pacifist and neutralist course." Anything stronger could get you excommunicated, even in 1994.
The break with his party's peace uber Alles dogma came one year later, after the slaughter of more than 7,000 Bosnians in Srebrenica. But Fischer still had to fight pacifism with pacifism, as it were. "If war once more turns into a successful means of policy, then we can forget about a peaceful future for Europe."
By this year, he was openly advocating force to stop force. He was even willing to dispense with a United Nations Security Council mandate -- if there is no consensus while we are facing a humanitarian catastrophe or a grave threat to the regional peace," as he said last November. To those Greens who now claim that NATO's strikes against Serbia are morally worse than the daily massacre of Kosovars, Fischer says, "I learned not only 'No more war' but also 'No more Auschwitz."'
While Fischer has no doubts about Kosovo, or Germany's place in NATO and Europe, his Green Party is deeply divided. Its members still don't know whether they are in politics for good or whether, though fuller of girth and grayer of hair, they want to continue as a utopian movement that clings to principle over the exercise of power. They will have to decide soon.
The Greens have much the same problem as Levi Strauss, which has been closing blue jeans plants all over the world because kids refuse to wear the same pants as their parents. Neither do German youngsters want to meet their bearded and Birkenstock-shod math teachers in the local Green Party meeting.
So the young are absconding in droves, and in the most recent German election, in Hesse, Fischer's home state, the Greens' take plummeted from 11 percent to 7 percent. They have lost votes in 11 state elections since 1994, as they did in the national vote in 1998. And no wonder. The Greens are essentially a party of functionaries, teachers and public servants whose jobs are as safe as their fringe benefits are fat. Largely sheltered from the "real" economy, with its permanent double-digit unemployment, many of these 50-somethings are wedded to statism and the status quo: to high Government spending, anticompetitive regulations and a reactionary utopia that romanticizes trees and vilifies technology.
In an open letter to Fischer, four young Greens protested that "the party no longer reaches people because it has moved away from the realities of life." Those include a high unemployment rate and the country's leisurely passage from manufacturing to a job-rich service economy. The solution is not windmills or solar power, they wrote, but "cars, computers, chip cards and cell phones." In its conservatism, they said, the Green Party "resembles the Catholic Church."
If anybody grasps the existential quandary of the Greens, it is Fischer, the man who smells a trend faster than Dick Morris. Was his party just the one-shot project of a protest generation that is now slowly moving toward retirement? "Perhaps," he concedes. "I've been warning them for years about this danger." Asked how he would crack the quandary, the Foreign Minister slips into generalities. "We have to combine the professionalism of a party in power with the visionary elan of a programmatic reform movement."
But as Fischer well knows, environmentalism was co-opted by the established parties, and the Greens' other big issue, peace, rings not only hollow but also morally bankrupt when people are dying in Bosnia or Kosovo. The party has aged, but not matured; it is in power, but not in control of its future.
So where is Fischer? In Washington, at NATO's 50th-birthday celebration. Or in Moscow, pushing his peace plan for Kosovo. Or in Brussels, Amsterdam or Luxembourg at one of those innumerable inter-Governmental meetings seeking to reform the screeching decision-making machinery of the European Union. Or in Sana, Djibouti or Beijing.
He is running as always, crisscrossing the world in his Luftwaffe Airbus, using a small corner of his brain to think about the next way to reinvent himself. For as much as he wants to give his "utmost," he hates "boredom." So when "something is exhausted," he muses, "it is time to leave it behind."
His life, Fischer explains, "unfolds in 10-year cycles." So he'll keep that Luftwaffe plane until 2008? Given the extraordinary longevity of German Governments -- from 13 to 16 years in the past -- it's a good bet that he will, especially after that last party congress this month. His comrades may have hit him with paint bombs and ultrapacifist resolutions, but they did not bolt, and so the Red-and-Green alliance continues to hold. Maybe those 50-somethings have grown up after all. If so, they owe it to Joschka Fischer, the high-school dropout and former pavement painter who has developed into one of the most extraordinary politicians of his generation.

Another Award, Other Memories Of McCarthyism

BYLINE: By JEFF KISSELOFF; Jeff Kisseloff is the author of "The Box: An Oral History of Television, 1920-1961."

 BODY:
AROUND the time the first peals of outrage were heard in Los Angeles over the honorary Oscar for Elia Kazan, who had named names to the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy era, a small ceremony in New York was conducted with none of the dissonance that accompanied the Hollywood salute.
In February, Frank N. Stanton, the former president of CBS, who oversaw the network's blacklisting policies in the 1950's and 60's, was given a lifetime achievement award for his First Amendment work by the New York chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. 
 Like Mr. Kazan's, Mr. Stanton's associates can point to a host of solid achievements. Over the course of his 27 years at the helm, Mr. Stanton often stood tall. When President Richard M. Nixon sent armed process servers to intimidate him into turning over outtakes for "The Selling of the Pentagon," Mr. Stanton refused at risk of a contempt citation. When the Teamsters threatened to shut down CBS over a documentary on Jimmy Hoffa, he told them to go ahead and make his day. And when Congress tried to close the door on television cameras, Mr. Stanton battled until he won.
"I don't think anyone in this business has ever fought harder for the First Amendment," William F. Baker, the president of WNET (Channel 13), who presented Mr. Stanton with the award during a lunch, said in a recent interview.
While Mr. Baker said he knew nothing about Mr. Stanton's involvement with the blacklist, a number of television veterans, still scarred by the McCarthy era, are all too familiar with that other side of Mr. Stanton's work: when those whose only crime was to take the right of free expression seriously were banned from the network. Not surprisingly, some question whether such an award is appropriate.
"I'll use a word from my granddaughter's new vocabulary: despicable," says Allan Sloane, a leading radio writer of the 50's who was blacklisted by CBS, referring to Mr. Stanton's being given the award. "Here was someone who had to make a choice between right and wrong, and he chose wrong."
Mr. Stanton's award and reactions to it reflect the television industry's disparate attitudes, almost 50 years afterward, toward the blacklisting era as a whole. Mr. Kazan and Mr. Stanton may take home trophies, but their deeds live on in the memories of those they affected. Given a choice between forgiving and forgetting, Mr. Sloane chooses neither. "I don't believe in that kind of redemption."
He is not alone.
"The blacklist was an atrocity for the Bill of Rights," says the former CBS producer Norman Corwin. "It was the blacklist that was true un-Americanism. It was mean, and it was also cowardly."
Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, calls the blacklisting era "one of the darkest moments in American history."
"You would hope there would be leaders in the Government and in the industries who would not succumb to that kind of pressure, including financial boycotts," Mr. Siegel said, "but history tells us we don't have those kinds of leaders -- or at least they are rare."
Sally Bedell Smith, the historian and author of a biography of William S. Paley, the longtime chairman of CBS, looks more kindly on Mr. Stanton. "I think that award was justified, because he really did do great things for the First Amendment," she said. "The blacklisting period should not be considered an indelible mark against him." She is less generous in her book, however. In it she calls CBS's political screening "a reprehensible violation of basic civil liberties."
Blacklisting took root in 1947. That year, three former F.B.I. agents began publishing Counterattack, a newsletter with the expressed purpose of exposing Communist influence in the entertainment industry. In reality, the editors were engaged in a protection racket. Those named in Counterattack could be cleared by the publishers for a fee, and producers were ordered by network executives to call in their cast lists for clearance before hiring. A producer who hated the process added Santa Claus to the list. Santa was cleared, for $5.
In 1950, Counterattack's publishers issued Red Channels, a booklet accusing 151 people of belonging to or supporting the Communist Party or sometimes merely backing progressive causes like the United Nations and integration. Some were blacklisted for speaking out against blacklisting. As John Henry Faulk, a CBS blacklisting victim, wrote in "Fear on Trial," his 1964 book, "The cry to end injustice was now more of a target than the injustice itself." Almost all of those listed in Red Channels were immediately blacklisted.
Each of the networks caved in to some extent. NBC abruptly canceled "The Aldrich Family" in 1950, for instance, until an actress could be found to replace Jean Muir, its star. Muir did not work in television again for eight years. The actress Kim Hunter has recalled being blacklisted by CBS, ABC and NBC, in that order. Delbert Mann, who directed "Marty" for "Goodyear TV Playhouse," has said he was so fed up with NBC's blacklist that he had to be talked out of leaving the network. But none of the other networks went as far as CBS.
In 1950, Mr. Stanton approved a companywide loyalty oath to reassure advertisers and self-proclaimed patriots of the political correctness of CBS employees. The next year, with Paley's approval, Mr. Stanton took the network beyond Red Channels with the creation of a security office staffed by former F.B.I. agents to investigate the political leanings of its employees.
The screenwriter Walter Bernstein was contributing scripts to CBS until his blacklisting. Mr. Bernstein, a World War II veteran who has written two movies ("The Front" and "The House on Carroll Street") and a memoir ("Inside Out") on the subject, still recalls the panic of not knowing how his rent was going to be paid. Both he and Mr. Corwin believe that the network has never acknowledged its wrongdoing.
"What I would like is some acknowledgment of what they did -- just to say they participated in something very bad," says Mr. Bernstein.
In a recent interview, Mr. Stanton, 91, said blacklisting had been necessary to stave off pressure from advertisers and affiliates who were threatening to abandon CBS and possibly shut it down. He conceded, however, that the network's response to the pressure may not have been the best one.
"I didn't have the wisdom, nor did anyone else," Mr. Stanton said. "The head of the law department was one of the fairest people I've ever known. When he said this was the course we should follow, we went along with it."
Told of Mr. Stanton's remarks, Mr. Corwin, 89, had kind words for his old friend. "Well, that's a lot better than Kazan thumping his chest over what he did."
Still, the broadcast historian Erik Barnouw says CBS was never in any real economic danger in the 1950's. "To reduce their income by 10 percent, that would have been enough to upset them." He does not believe the sins of the past can be dismissed.
"It's almost callous," Mr. Barnouw said, "to simply shove under the rug the horrors committed by the blacklist situation."
As Mr. Sloane, 83, paged through a copy of Red Channels in the office of his New Canaan, Conn., home, he chuckled to himself as if he were looking through his old high school yearbook. "There I am between Bill Shirer and Howard K. Smith. I'm in pretty good company." But after a few more moments of more names, he shook his head sadly. "This opens an old scab," he said. "I thought it was a scar, but it isn't."
He pulled a glassine envelope from a desk drawer. Inside were scraps of bones he scooped from the ovens of Dachau as a reporter in 1947. "I would speak to kids, and I would shake the envelope and say, 'This is the sound of fascism.' When I was blacklisted, I asked someone why I couldn't get work. He said, 'Because you want to change the world with your typewriter,' and they didn't want that."
"CBS decided not to carry my stuff any more, and the world went on, but not for Edward Bromberg," who was named by Mr. Kazan and died of a heart attack after testifying before the House committee, he said, "and not for Phil Loeb. One day he was on 'The Goldbergs,' and the next day he was untouchable. Ask him how it felt. Find a medium that is in touch with him."
Philip Loeb was the co-star of "The Goldbergs," a sitcom about a middle-class Jewish family in the Bronx. The show was canceled by CBS in 1951 when its star and producer, Gertrude Berg, refused to dismiss Loeb, the object of four letters of protest. And when the series re-emerged the next year, on NBC, it was with a new actor in the role. Loeb never worked on television again. In 1955, when his mentally ill son had to be moved to a state home because there weren't enough funds for his care, Loeb became despondent and killed himself.
Ms. Smith, the historian, says it's important to place the blacklist period within the context of the times.
 THERE was little economic pressure in 1963, however, when an episode of the law series "The Defenders" revealed just how hypocritical CBS's actions were.
That year the show's creator, Reginald Rose, proposed doing an episode about race, a touchy topic at the time. "They were very nervous about it," says Mr. Rose. "I said, 'Let me do a show on blacklisting, and I'll forget this show.' " To his astonishment, network executives agreed. But when the script was completed, it ran into trouble with CBS's program practices department.
David Shaw, the show's story editor, recalled what happened. "The head of program practices said: 'This has to be set in the movies. We don't have a TV blacklist.' He was in charge of the blacklist."
But the ultimate shock came when the cast list had to be submitted for clearance. "I said, 'My God, we're doing a show on the blacklist,' " recalled Ernie Kinoy, who wrote the episode, " 'and we have to submit the names!' "
The episode won two Emmys, but the blacklist was still being enforced. The process did peter out not long afterward; Faulk's legal victory over those who blacklisted him (he won a libel suit against the publishers of Counterattack and Red Channels) had also made it unprofitable for the practice to continue.
Some 35 years later, in an editorial on Mr. Stanton's career, Broadcast and Cable magazine hailed "the Stantonian period" as a high-water era for the Bill of Rights. "They're not rewriting history," says Abe Polonsky, a blacklisted writer who helped write CBS's classic show "You Are There" under a pseudonym. "They can't rewrite the facts, but they can rewrite what we think about those facts."

Surfing to Soothe a Savage Breast

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
The Comcast Corporation, a cable giant with diverse holdings that include stakes in the television and on-line versions of the QVC shopping channel and E Entertainment Television, has added a more highbrow investment to its portfolio: Culturefinder.com.
Culturefinder is a Web site that lists arts events and sells tickets to exhibits, operas, symphonies, dance and theatrical performances around the United States. 
 For Julian A. Brodsky, vice chairman of Comcast and chairman of the six-month-old fund, Comcast Interactive Capital Group, that announced the $3.75 million investment two weeks ago, the move was part of his company's effort to "leverage our involvement with the Internet and create an investment hedge against the changing relative values of content, commerce and distribution."
For Eugene Carr, the founder and chief executive of Culturefinder.com, the investment by Comcast, which is based in Philadelphia, represented even more: further validation of a business that has enabled Mr. Carr to combine his entrepreneurial impulses with a lifelong affinity for the performing arts.
Mr. Carr, a cellist who studied at the Juilliard School of Music while still in high school, earned an M.B.A. at Columbia University. He was the executive director of the New York-based American Symphony Orchestra when he started Culturefinder.com in 1995.
"I perceived that the Internet would be big and so would massive sites that collected around specific interests," he said in an interview in Culturefinder's crowded offices, which are situated, appropriately, near Carnegie Hall. "I knew that someone would do an arts site, and I thought it would be an incredible opportunity to do it myself."
After polling administrators of 50 arts groups to see if they would support a site that listed their programs, Mr. Carr invested $50,000 of his own to start Culturefinder.com. He also got $300,000 from America Online to participate in its Greenhouse project -- an effort, since dropped, that backed content providers in their infancy.
Some other Web publishers, like the Sidewalk operation of the Microsoft Corporation, list concerts and other performance arts. And some, like Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch Inc., sell tickets. But Culturefinder.com is the only national on-line directory of arts events and seller of electronic tickets for more than 2,200 organizations in some 1,300 cities. The institutions, which vary from the New Century Chamber Orchestra in Mill Valley, Calif., to the New York Philharmonic, do not pay Culturefinder to be included in the listings. Instead, much of Culturefinder's revenue comes from the fees -- ranging from $2 to $4.50 -- it charges for each ticket sold.
"Organizations like Ticketmaster Online compete with Culturefinder only on high-profile events," said James McQuivey, senior analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "Focusing on art and culture gives Culturefinder an extra market Ticketmaster is not in."
In partnerships with the on-line retailers Amazon.com, CD Now, Image Exchange and Reel, Culturefinder also peddles compact disks, arts posters and videos. For patrons who might want to venture far afield in search of a good scherzo, it has an alliance with Microsoft's Expedia on-line travel agency. The site also offers various articles, program notes and primers about the arts aimed at its estimated 250,000 different visitors each month, an audience that surveys indicate is two-thirds female, largely urban, highly educated and, on average, 36 years old. That gives Culturefinder a desirable demographic for its on-line advertisers, the largest of which is the Baldwin Piano and Organ Company.
Mr. Carr and his staff of 14 "bring passion, experience and an intense focus on arts consumers and arts organizations," said Mr. Brodsky, the Comcast executive. "This, combined with superb technology and the dramatically quick adoption of E-commerce among upscale consumers, bodes well for Culturefinder's future."
To stimulate sales, Culturefinder.com recently reached ticket sales-referral agreements with three other Web sites: the search portal Lycos.com, America Online's city guide service Digitalcity.com, and Ovationtv.com, the site of the arts-oriented cable television network.
As a privately held company, Culturefinder.com does not report its financial results. But Mr. Carr said he expected revenue this year of about $1.5 million and a loss that he declined to quantify. He predicted that the company would become profitable as soon as 2001.
He estimates that institutions in the United States like those represented by Culturefinder sell close to $3 billion worth of tickets annually. But he said those organizations typically sell only 70 percent of their available tickets -- representing an opportunity for companies like his to help fill lots of empty seats.
Besides America Online and Comcast, a number of prominent individual investors have put a total of $1.75 million in Mr. Carr's venture. They include Arthur Zankel, a partner in First Manhattan, a New York-based investment advisory firm, and a member of the board of Carnegie Hall; Robert H. Lessin, whose privately held Wit Capital Group specializes in Internet-related investments; Thomas G. Stemberg, chairman and chief executive of Staples Inc.; Stuart G. Moldaw, chairman of Gymboree, and David Horowitz, former chief executive and president of MTV Network.
"I gave him money for the American Symphony Orchestra and had a high opinion of what he accomplished with it," Mr. Zankel said. "I have great admiration for Gene's marketing skills and imagination, and I haven't been disappointed."
David Kitto, director of marketing and ticket operations for Carnegie Hall, said Culturefinder could help arts organizations of all sizes expand their audiences, whether or not the arts groups have their own Web sites. "All of us are looking for ways to connect with the audience," Mr. Kitto said. "Culturefinder is not competing with us; they're providing an alternate means to purchase tickets."
In Mr. Kitto's view, the biggest challenge Culturefinder now faces is creating identity and brand awareness. "They need to work to become the place arts consumers go to to find out about ticket availability," he said.
For his part, Mr. Carr wants Culturefinder.com to expand to include arts listings outside the United States. And to generate new commission income, he intends to begin offering special tour packages late this year, like an individually tailored Broadway weekend in New York with hotel accommodations, theater tickets, meals and museum admissions.
Unlike many Internet start-ups at this stage of business, Culturefinder is not now destined to be sold or to issue stock in an initial public offering, Mr. Carr said, though he does not rule this out in the longer term. "We've been very focused on raising the venture capital round," he said, referring to the Comcast infusion. "At the appropriate moment, to raise additional funds, every financing option will be considered -- including an I.P.O."
Mainly, the Comcast money will help Culturefinder promote its brand more actively, Mr. Carr said. "I'm trying to be Mr. Arts in cyberspace," he added, "to be front and center so when opportunities present themselves, I'm first in line."

HEADLINE: Advertisers Spend Eagerly For TV Time in Fall Season

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
The advance sale of commercial time by the broadcast television networks for the fall season, known as the up-front market, is ending on an even stronger note this year than the optimistic forecasts in recent weeks had anticipated.
"There is even more demand than we had expected," said Jamie Kellner, president of the WB Network in Burbank, Calif., which is owned by Time Warner Inc. and the Tribune Company. "We were in a position to increase rates." 
 If current estimates are correct, the six broadcast networks will sell $7 billion to $7.2 billion worth of commercial time in advance for the prime-time programs in the 1999-2000 season. Though negotiations are not entirely wrapped up -- some dickering is to continue this week and into June -- the estimates are about 9 percent higher than the approximately $6.4 billion worth of commercial time sold ahead of the 1998-99 prime-time season.
"There was amazing speed and earliness" to the demand, said Joe Mandese, editor of The Myers Report, a media newsletter, who tracks the annual performance of the up-front market.
"The other day parts were pretty strong, too," he added, referring to sales of commercial time during morning, news and late-night programs. "It all speaks to the underlying strength of the media economy."
The robust results came despite continued declines in ratings for most of the prime-time programs on the broadcast networks during the 1998-99 season, which ended last week. But even as viewership continues to erode, those six networks -- ABC, CBS, the Fox Broadcasting Company, NBC, UPN and the WB -- still offer marketers the chance to pitch products before large audiences.
As usual, the networks focusing their programs on the younger consumers most coveted by advertisers performed particularly well. WB, for example, which seeks viewers ages 12 to 34, sold about $450 million worth of commercial time in the up-front market, compared with $300 million last year.
"Everyone looking for young eyeballs was showing up," Mr. Kellner said. "There were a lot of new advertisers, and then incumbent advertisers were asking for more inventory."
Fox, the unit of the News Corporation that aims its programs at viewers ranging in age from 18 to 34 and 18 to 49, sold more than $1.3 billion worth of commercial time, compared with about $1.15 billion last year.
Demand was consistent among advertisers for many categories of goods and services, Mr. Mandese said, with retail and telecommunications advertisers especially eager to make commitments.
Internet and so-called dot.com marketers were "not a big factor so far," he added, but should be later, when the networks sell commercial time during the season in what is called the scatter market.
The demand for broadcast commercial time augurs well for the cable networks, which conduct their up-front market after that of their broadcast counterparts. Ratings for many cable programs rose during the 1998-99 season as viewers sought alternatives to broadcast fare.

HEADLINE: In an Antitrust Suit, a Tiny Ex-PartnerIs Taking Aim at Microsoft

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
As the trial in the Government's antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation resumes on Tuesday in Washington, evidence in a separate trial set to open this week in Connecticut seems to offer tantalizing support for an assertion that the company's rivals have made for years -- that Microsoft wields its industry-standard Windows operating system as a club to control the software business.
Central to the Connecticut case is an issue that has been raised peripherally by several Government witnesses in the Washington case -- how Microsoft controls its competitors' understanding of application program interfaces, or A.P.I.'s. 
 A.P.I.'s are the paths into and out of the operating system that programmers must follow for their software -- spreadsheets, Internet browsers, picture editing and so on -- to run efficiently. Rivals have long said that Microsoft gives them only rudimentary maps of the Windows A.P.I.'s, making it impossible to compete with the designs of Microsoft's own applications programmers, who enjoy a detailed road map of Windows, complete with little back roads and alleys that can be used as shortcuts.
Microsoft dismisses such contentions as whining by competitors. But in an internal E-mail memo to several senior executives on Feb. 28, 1996, Mark Ryland, a company manager, observed matter-of-factly, "Microsoft learned long ago that to control the A.P.I.'s is to control the industry."
That memo is among thousands of internal Microsoft documents filed in United States District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., as part of a private antitrust suit scheduled to go to trial on Wednesday. Among other things, they show a spirited debate inside Microsoft over how much of its software should run "cross-platform" -- that is, on competing operating systems like Unix, the platform for many large corporate networks.
And some of the E-mail offers vivid glimpses of Microsoft's winner-take-all style of competition. In one internal memo, a Microsoft manager discusses a proposal to enable some of its data base technology to work on Unix. This was a topic previously raised with data base companies like Sybase Inc. and the Oracle Corporation, which compete with Microsoft in data base software but also develop products that run on Windows as well as on Unix.
On April 19, 1996, James Allchin, a Microsoft senior vice president, wrote: "Please give me one good reason why we should even consider this. (Hint: any good answer needs to include making more money and helping kill Unix, Sybase or Oracle.)"
The suit in Connecticut is not directly related to the Government's sweeping antitrust case. But the Justice Department and the 19 states suing Microsoft are eagerly awaiting the evidence in the Connecticut case because it focuses squarely on the issue of technology access.
The plaintiff, Bristol Technology Inc., a small software maker in Danbury, Conn., charges that Microsoft illegally cut off its access to Windows technology after three years of cooperation and says that Microsoft had a "duty to deal" with it.
The Government's more traditional antitrust suit charges that Microsoft used its Windows monopoly to stifle competition from Internet software. The Justice Department left the issue of technology access to be addressed in the remedy phase of the trial if it wins, and it is a crucial subject in continuing settlement talks with Microsoft.
One Justice Department official observed, "I think we should put a sign up in the war room here, 'It's the A.P.I.'s, stupid' " -- a play on President Clinton's 1992 campaign theme stressing the economy.
Microsoft says that reading too much into a few E-mail messages is unfair. The company, its lawyers note, is unapologetically filled with highly competitive people with a passion for the software business -- a passion reflected in their E-mail. "And a lot of the E-mail that Bristol has filed as evidence has nothing to do with this case," said Steve Aeschbacher, a senior corporate lawyer for Microsoft. "There are discussions about cross-platform strategies all the time within Microsoft."
Indeed, Bristol is not going to win its antitrust suit against Microsoft merely with piles of inflammatory E-mail that raise important industry issues. It must produce convincing evidence that Microsoft violated the antitrust laws, and legal experts say that is a stiff challenge.
Bristol has assembled a legal team led by two veteran antitrust experts known for defending the International Business Machines Corporation, Patrick Lynch, a partner at O'Melveny & Myers, and Anthony L. Clapes, a former I.B.M. assistant general counsel. But legal experts say that "duty-to-deal" cases are hard to win outside industries with traditions of regulation, like telecommunications, or businesses involving natural assets, like ski slopes.
"The courts are very reluctant to say that dominant firms have a duty to deal, because that takes you down a regulatory path," William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University Law School, said. "It also reduces incentives to innovate if a dominant firm is forced to share its hard-won assets -- like intellectual property in the software business -- with other companies."
But Bristol charges that Microsoft used it as a tool in a cynical campaign to gain a foothold in the market for heavy-duty corporate computing and then tried to shift those customers over to using Microsoft's most advanced operating system, Windows NT. Windows NT has gradually improved over the years, but after it was first shipped in 1992, it struggled to compete against Unix in the market for big corporate systems.
Microsoft's main advantage was the popularity of the many software applications -- an estimated 100,000 -- written to run on Windows. For example, a scientist using a powerful Unix work station for research might very well want to use Microsoft Word to write memos or an Excel spreadsheet for doing budgets.
Bristol developed a product that solved that problem. Its Wind/U software enabled programs written for Windows to run on Unix work stations, or hub computers called servers, that send data to workers' desktop machines. That opened mainstream corporate business to the legions of Windows software developers.
But for Bristol's translation software to work, the company needed access to Microsoft's technology. In 1994, Bristol signed a three-year contract with Microsoft giving Bristol virtually open access to all Windows A.P.I.'s. Lifted by its partnership with Microsoft, Bristol thrived. In 1997, Inc. magazine ranked Bristol 140th among the 500 fastest-growing companies in the nation, with a payroll of 70 people and estimated revenue of $8 million.
Yet that was the high point for Bristol. It began negotiating with Microsoft on a contract for access to the newer versions of Microsoft's operating-system technology. After the two sides failed to reach an agreement, Bristol sued last August contending that Microsoft's offer -- a fourfold increase in price and much-reduced access to Windows technology -- was an "apple core," as a Microsoft E-mail message described it.
According to Bristol, the changed terms were no mystery. Windows NT has made real strides in the corporate market against Unix. Cripple the cross-platform software provided by Bristol, and many customers that have become dependent on Windows applications thanks to Bristol's software would move from Unix to Windows. "Microsoft's dealings with Bristol are a classic bait-and-switch," Mr. Lynch, Bristol's lead trial lawyer, said.
Microsoft replies that Bristol has no legal grounds for its case and has embarked on litigation as a business tactic. It points out that the 1994 contract covered access only to Windows NT 3.0, Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, and it contained no language about future versions of Windows.
True, says Keith Blackwell, the president of Bristol. But he points to the many public statements Microsoft made about its commitment to the cross-platform program, called the Windows Interface Source Environment, or WISE. One document posted on the Web in 1995 stated, "Microsoft is committed to providing WISE licensees" -- like Bristol -- "with future versions of Windows family source code."
Mr. Blackwell said, "Microsoft repeatedly and publicly made all these representations that the WISE program was a safe way to go."
Other companies also had conflicts with Microsoft over access to Windows technology, including AT&T, the inventor of Unix, which eventually settled a contract suit seeking access to Windows NT 5.0 programming code.
But a Bristol rival, Mainsoft Inc., did reach an agreement with Microsoft last year. And Bristol, according to Microsoft, rejected the same contract terms that Mainsoft found acceptable. The negotiations with Microsoft were lengthy and difficult, William McCarthy, Mainsoft's vice president for business development, said. "But there's nothing we can't do that we want to do under the new contract."
Bristol's duty-to-deal case falls apart because "Microsoft has not refused to deal with Bristol -- it was offered the same terms as Mainsoft," the Microsoft lawyer, Mr. Aeschbacher, said. "Just because someone is not happy with the terms of a deal they are offered, that is not an antitrust case."
Bristol replies that Mainsoft was struggling and willing to take whatever Microsoft offered to stay afloat.
An internal E-mail message certainly suggests, at least, that Microsoft found Mainsoft easier to deal with. On May 18, 1998, Dan Neault, a WISE program manager, wrote: "Mainsoft is in our pocket. Bristol is rattling sabres hard."
Bristol contends that the offer Mainsoft accepted is a hobbled version of the original cross-platform promise of the WISE program, and thus Microsoft has used its market power to undermine competition.
In court, Microsoft will seek to portray Bristol as a company bent on litigation, trying to win a huge financial judgment against a deep-pocketed defendant.
On July 7, 1998, a month before negotiations finally broke off, Bristol received a "strategic communications game plan" from Fleishman-Hillard, a New York public relations firm.
The document, entitled "David v. Goliath," recommended: "Position David as a reluctant, yet courageous plaintiff defending its small, successful and growing entrepreneurial company and Goliath as a predatory, deep-pocketed, unethical behemoth."
Bristol says it would have been foolish to take on Microsoft without some preparation. And it insists that if anyone was negotiating in bad faith, it was Microsoft.
In an E-mail message titled "Co-opting Unix," William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, listed as part of the company's strategy, "Picking Mainsoft as our partner for Windows A.P.I.'s on Unix and revving up their activities."
Mr. Gates wrote the message on Sept. 28, 1997, about 11 months before negotiations between Microsoft and Bristol ended.

Chart: "Legal Fights on Many Fronts"
An antitrust suit against Microsoft that begins this week in Bridgeport, Conn., is just the latest in a series of legal challenges to its business practices. Here is a look at the pending cases.
 
OPPOSITION: Bristol Technology
ISSUE: The company, which makes software that lets Windows programs run on other operating systems, says that Microsoft effectively cut off its access to the programming code for the new version of Windows NT.
STATUS: The case goes to trial this week.
 
OPPOSITION: Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general
ISSUE: The biggest challenge to Microsoft. The Government says that Microsoft engaged in anticompetitive behavior in an effort to dominate the market for browsers, the software used to navigate the World Wide Web.
STATUS: The trial resumes this week.
 
OPPOSITION: Sun Micro-systems
ISSUE: Sun says that Microsoft violated a licensing agreement on the use of Java, Sun's programming language, when Microsoft released a version of Java for Windows that was incompatible with Sun's version. According to Sun, Microsoft set out to undermine and destroy a potential threat to Windows.
STATUS: Last week, a Federal judge tentatively ruled that Microsoft had infringed on Sun's patents.
 
OPPOSITION: Temporary Microsoft employees
ISSUE: Thousands of temporary workers say they are entitled to many of the same benefits regular employees receive, including purchasing company stock at a discount, retirement benefits, health insurance and vacation, holiday and sick leave.
STATUS: A court ruled the workers are entitled to buy stock; Microsoft is appealing, and the other arguments are pending.
 
OPPOSITION: Caldera
ISSUE: The company, which made an operating system for PC's called DR-DOS, says Microsoft put pressure on PC makers and used illegal tactics to drive its system, which competed with MS-DOS, out of the market.
STATUS: The judge is handling pretrial motions; the case has yet to start.

HEADLINE: Joao Carlos de Oliveira, at 45; Held Triple Jump World Record

 BODY:
Joao Carlos de Oliveira, a Brazilian sports hero who held the world triple jump record for a decade, died Saturday at Beneficencia Portuguesa Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. He was 45.
De Oliveira, who lived in Pindamonhangaba, in Sao Paulo state, was suffering from pneumonia, hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver that caused internal bleeding, the hospital said. 
 De Oliveira won the triple jump at the Pan American Games in Mexico City in 1975 with a distance of 58 feet 8 1/4 inches, beating the previous world record of 57-2 1/2. The record was set at an altitude of 7,550 feet, with reduced air resistance.
The record stood until Willie Banks of the United States leaped 58-11 1/2 in Indianapolis on June 16, 1985. Banks's mark, at an altitude of 700 feet, also stood for 10 years. It was broken by Jonathan Edwards of Britain, who jumped 59 feet in July 1995 in Salamanca, Spain, and who set the current record of 60-0 1/4 in August 1995 at Goteborg, Sweden..
De Oliveira won bronze medals at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal and the 1980 Games in Moscow and captured gold at the World Cup in 1981.
His athletic career came to an end in December 1981, when his right leg was amputated below the knee after his car was hit head-on by a drunken driver being chased by the police going the wrong way at night on a highway in Campinas, Brazil.
De Oliveira was twice elected a state deputy in 1986 and 1990 but confronted financial problems afterward when business ventures foundered. Unemployed since he left public office, de Oliveira had been living on a monthly pension of about $700, according to local news reports.
Last year, de Oliveira announced that he would train for the long jump at the Paralympic Games for disabled athletes in Sydney, Australia, in 2000, when he would be aided by an artificial leg. But he abandoned training earlier this year amid illness and depression, friends said. The weekly magazine Epoca said he had been plagued by heavy drinking, which his family denied.
De Oliveira's body was taken yesterday to Sao Paulo's State Assembly, where he once served.

HEADLINE: Disabled Spouses Are Increasingly Forced to Go It Alone

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
As modern medicine extends the lives of people with chronic diseases from diabetes to cystic fibrosis, the rate of divorce among them is increasing, leaving a growing number without income, health insurance or support at home, health analysts say.
Among the reasons, they say, are the stresses on the health of the spouse caring for a disabled partner, and the pressure on family finances, especially if one spouse has to stop working to stay home and tend the other. 
 "More diseases that occur in adulthood are treatable, so we know more couples are living longer with one having a chronic illness," said Dr. John Rolland, a psychiatrist and co-director of the Center for Family Health at the University of Chicago.
Louis Harris & Associates, which has surveyed the relationships of people with disabilities for the National Organization on Disability since 1984, found that 13 percent of those it surveyed last year were divorced, compared with 11 percent in 1994 and 9 percent in 1984.
The Government's National Health Interview Survey of nearly 50,000 households in 1994 said 20.7 percent of the disabled adults among those polled were divorced or separated, compared with 13.1 percent of those without disabilities.
Other surveys as well as demographers, family therapists and divorce lawyers suggest that while the divorce rate among spouses with some health conditions, notably breast cancer and multiple sclerosis, is about the same as that of the general population, it is much higher for others.
For people with spinal cord injuries, said Dr. Michael DeVivo, an epidemiologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, "Marriage rates are below normal, and divorce rates are above normal."
When Russ Benning, a 50-year-old graphic artist from Antioch, Tenn., was divorced last year after 15 years of marriage, he lost not only his wife, but also her income and her health insurance. Mr. Benning had a painful blood-clotting condition in one leg when he was married, and it developed in the other leg a year later.
He cannot work, must use a wheelchair and makes do with disability payments of $10,000 a year. "It's not easy having the pain, and I do my best not to show it," he said, "but it's unavoidable. It's also not easy to look at somebody in pain and not be able to do something about it."
Among couples who stay together despite a disability, many say they come close to the brink of serious depression or splitting up.
"We were high school sweethearts," said Barbara Fleming, 52, of Mount Airy, Md., whose husband, Kenneth, 55, a retired firefighter, was told he had multiple sclerosis five years ago. "We were a boating family. We had a beach house."
But Mr. Fleming's condition has ended the old routines. He is lucid and speaks clearly, but he is nearly blind and walks with a cane. "We struggle along, but in the end it falls on me," Mrs. Fleming said. "I've gone outside the front door and mentally screamed. I've been in therapy and I go back when I feel I have to have someone to talk to who is not in the family."
Suzanne and Steven Mintz were the parents of a 5-year-old daughter when doctors told Mr. Mintz, an economist, that he had multiple sclerosis 25 years ago. "It turned our lives upside down," Ms. Mintz said.
Soon after the diagnosis, "We separated twice, for 18 months and again for two years," said Ms. Mintz, who used her experience to establish the National Family Caregivers Association, an advocacy group in Kensington, Md.
"It was hard to talk about feelings, to have a conversation about what was disturbing us," she said. "He's in a wheelchair and he needs help with daily activities. But he's still working, thank God. We've come to a better place. He has clinical M.S., but we both have M.S."
Since 1980, researchers at Pennsylvania State University, the University of Nebraska and Virginia Tech have been monitoring about 2,000 couples on a variety of issues, including health.
"What we find is that declines in health have an adverse influence on marital quality," said John N. Edwards, professor of sociology at Virginia Tech.
Tensions develop because the disabled spouse carries less weight in the household, shares in fewer activities and withdraws or becomes moody, angry or critical, Professor Edwards said.
Adrienne Asch, a professor of biology, ethics and human reproduction at Wellesley College and a past president of the Society of Disability Studies, said: "The data are that marriages do break up more often when there is a disability than when there isn't. We also know that men leave wives more often than wives leave husbands."
Lawyers say divorce among the disabled is also influenced by factors that have been driving up the overall rate of divorce, like more casual public mores, less stigma attached to divorce and more wives who work outside of the home.
"It's no longer considered necessary to hang in there with the disabled spouse," said Ira Lurvey, a divorce and custody lawyer in Los Angeles and former chairman of the family law section of the American Bar Association. "The real message we get from the icons of society is if the marriage is too hard, you're not expected to keep it going."
Willard H. DaSilva, a divorce lawyer in Garden City, N.Y., cited a client in her 30's who had filed for divorce. The client's husband had been struck by a car and suffered severe brain injuries, Mr. DaSilva said, adding: "He has difficulty walking, cognitive problems and needs constant attention. He is no longer the person she married."
The health analysts allow that sometimes, in cases of character-transforming conditions like severe brain injury, Alzheimer's disease or conditions requiring the constant care of a nursing home, separation is unavoidable.
Short of those extremes, however, disability can still change a marriage's foundations, said William Pinsof, a clinical psychologist and president of the Family Institute at Northwestern University, which trains therapists.
"It impairs your ability to travel with a spouse, to participate in social life," Mr. Pinsof said.
Dr. Sandra Weintraub, director of an Alzheimer's clinic at Northwestern, said: "There's a whole psychological layer. When you get married, it's not to be somebody's nurse, and suddenly you are somebody's nurse."
For better-off couples, a hired hand can save work and relieve tension. Dr. Weintraub said: "There are spouses who say, 'In no way will I diaper my wife.' So you go out and have somebody else diaper your wife. It helps to have money."
But money becomes a shrinking resource for couples that become caught in the bind of a lost job and the rising cost of care.
"Fully a third of adults with disabilities," the Harris study reported, lived in a household with an annual income of less than $15,000 in 1997, compared with only 12 percent of those without disabilities.
In the face of such pressures, the analysts say, a disability can take as big a toll on the caregiver as it does on the patient. The emotional state of patients with spinal cord injuries often improves within a year, but that of their spouses often declines, said Scott Richards, a clinical psychologist and research director in the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
The reason, Dr. Richards said, may be that other sources of support -- friends, family, agencies -- drift away, leaving the spouse alone.
Linda Teri, director of the Tornyay Center on Health Aging at the University of Washington in Seattle, said that "spousal caregivers have much higher levels of burden, depression, medical illnesses" than others. Her patients, the elderly, rarely resort to divorce. But younger generations, Ms. Teri said, "are more likely to say it's not worth it."

HEADLINE: Shift by Older Voters to G.O.P. Is Democrats' Challenge in 2000

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
Older Americans were once among the most loyal of Democratic voters in Congressional elections, reliably returning the party of Roosevelt and Truman to power on Capitol Hill.
But the New Deal generation of older Americans is passing -- World War II veterans are dying at a rate of more than 1,000 a day by one Government estimate -- and their successors are more likely to have Ronald Reagan as a reference point than Franklin Roosevelt. 
 According to surveys of voters leaving the polls, Republicans carried the 60-and-over vote in House races in the last three elections, a source of considerable soul-searching among Democrats. The power of older voters is magnified because of a simple fact: they turn out at the polls.
And strategists in both parties now see older Americans as a critical swing vote in elections next year, a factor that could determine control of the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a scant majority of 222 to 211.
"It's virtually impossible to take back the House or win the Presidency without taking back seniors," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. "That makes them the key battleground, and both parties know it."
In fact, some Democratic analysts think that their party would control the House today had it not lost the older vote so decisively last November, 45 percent to 55 percent, while winning or breaking even with every other age group.
The heightened competition for the 60-plus vote affects the policy agenda in a variety of ways, strategists say. It helps explain why the gaps in Medicare benefits, like prescription drug coverage and long-term care, are getting more attention on Capitol Hill these days. As Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, puts it, "We're having a policy debate over a prescription drug benefit instead of what do we do about the uninsured."
This competition also makes it harder, in the short term, to reach bipartisan consensus on the financial difficulties of Social Security and Medicare, which both need shoring up before the baby boom generation retires.
"Each party is trying to one-up the other," said Representative Thomas M. Davis 3d of Virginia, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. He added that he was ultimately optimistic about a solution. "It's difficult now because everybody wants the other guy to go first and take a shot at their proposal."
Nobody is quite sure why the older vote has shifted, but demographics are clearly part of it. Many analysts note that as a group, older Americans are substantially more affluent today than they were 30 years ago. The poverty rate for Americans 65 and older dropped to 10.5 percent in 1997 from 35 percent in 1959, according to the Census Bureau. Their median income, in constant 1992 dollars, more than doubled between 1957 and 1992.
"They're more affluent, more educated, more mobile, healthier, wealthier, and I'd go a step further and say more positively disposed to the private sector," said Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa, speaking of people who are just now joining the ranks of older Americans.
Moreover, their political allegiances were formed in a different era. "Many of the elderly today were in the prime of their working lives during the Reagan era," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California. "They were Reagan Democrats. So ideologically, they're probably more centrist and to the right."
Robert Teeter, a pollster who long worked in Republican politics, noted that such generational shifts have occurred before. In the 1950's and 1960's, Mr. Teeter said, older Americans were considered reliably Republican voters. By the 1970's, he recalled, "you'd sit through all kinds of meetings" with Republicans trying to figure out why they were losing that vote.
The voter surveys showed Democrats carrying the 60-and-older vote in House races from 1980 through 1992, with one exception: the Reagan landslide year of 1984.
Robert Binstock, a professor of aging, health and society at Case Western Reserve University, has argued for many years against the notion that older Americans are a monolithic group voting solely on the basis of their age and their benefit programs. Other factors, like economic status and gender, affect their voting behavior, just as they do with every other age group, Professor Binstock said.
There are significant differences between older women and older men. Republicans began winning the 60-and-over male vote in 1994; they did not carry older women until 1998.
Several analysts argue that older women are much less economically secure than older men, and therefore more open to Democratic appeals based on protecting benefits.
Aside from demographics, there are also short-term explanations for the shifting allegiances of older Americans. Strategists in both parties say the scandal leading to President Clinton's impeachment probably played a role in the size of the Democrats' loss among the 60-and-over vote last November.
"Seniors are somewhat more sensitive to the values issues," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, "and we have not always presented our strongest face on those issues in recent years."
The voter surveys support this analysis: Social Security was the top issue on the minds of 60-and-over voters last November, but moral and ethical standards ranked No. 2, and 89 percent of those who said the moral issues were the determining factor in their vote selected a Republican candidate for the House.
Republican strategists and candidates have also gotten better at campaigning for the votes of older Americans, strategists in both parties say. For years, Republicans were on the defensive, battered by Democratic campaigns accusing them of plotting to cut Social Security or Medicare.
Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, remembers one rough election in 1982, after the intense maneuvering around Social Security of the early Reagan Administration, including a Senate Republican plan calling for $40 billion in unspecified Social Security savings over three years. The plan quickly died, but the issue did not.
"I have vivid memories of the bumper sticker: Save Social Security, Vote Democratic," Mr. Shaw said. "I went home and I changed every political ad I had going, and everything was Social Security."
In recent years, Republicans have learned to anticipate those campaigns. Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said, "Rather than wringing our hands and waiting for the Democrats to use their scare tactics on Social Security and Medicare, we've been getting out there and saying, 'This is our position and don't believe the scare tactics of the last few weeks.' "
In the current maneuvering over the budget, Republicans have been promoting their "lockbox" proposal, pledging to "lock away" the Social Security surpluses. The House passed a version of the plan last week.
"When Social Security and Medicare are neutralized" as issues, Representative Davis said, "Republicans do very, very well."
Democrats see what the Republicans are doing as "fuzzing up these issues," in the words of Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader.
Mr. Gephardt added, "We have not done a good enough job pointing out the real differences between the two parties on issues of real importance to seniors -- i.e., the patient bill of rights, getting prescription drugs to people on Medicare at a good price, long-term care insurance and tax breaks for long-term care, shoring up and keeping strong Social Security and Medicare."
Representative Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the House Democratic caucus, contends that when Democratic candidates campaign hard for older votes on the traditional issues, they prevail. Democrats remain convinced that their party, which pushed through the legislation creating Social Security and Medicare, should, by all rights, have a natural advantage with older voters.
But Lawrence R. Jacobs, associate professor of political science at the University of Minnesota, and an expert on public opinion and the elderly, argues that the differences between the two parties are muted on some of the key issues, like putting more managed care into Medicare.
"They don't really perceive the kind of massive differences they have in the past," Professor Jacobs said of older voters.
All of these issues are the subject of intense speculation in both parties right now, with one fact adding urgency to it all. Older Americans are not simply a growing population, but one that continues to vote at a remarkable rate. They made up 28 percent of the total House vote in 1998, but can account for a third or more of the vote on Election Day in states like Florida and Pennsylvania. In recent elections, people age 65 and over were more than twice as likely to vote as people age 18 to 24.
So the struggle continues: a Gallup Poll released last week showed the two parties essentially in a dead heat among voters 65 and up, when asked whether a Democratic- or Republican-controlled Congress would be better for the country.

HEADLINE: Stocks Drive a Rush to Riches In Manhattan's Silicon Alley

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
There was something about the wave of unrepentant jubilance sweeping through iVillage's downtown Manhattan offices the day the three-and-a-half-year-old Internet company went public that made Susan Weaver uneasy.
As employees who had been allowed to buy stock for as little as $6 per share watched it climb to $103 in its first afternoon of public trading, Ms. Weaver -- at 46, an elder in a company whose average hire is 31 -- addressed a cigar-wielding group gathered in the hall at iVillage, a provider of on-line information and discussion forums for women. "I just want everyone to realize this is Disneyland," she remembers saying that day in March. 
 Ms. Weaver, iVillage's vice president for programming and a former NBC producer, later explained: "I didn't want them to feel that they were entitled to what was happening to them. This doesn't happen all the time."
That is, it didn't used to. Particularly not in New York, where the cluster of new-media companies known as Silicon Alley has always been viewed by its Western namesake as an also-ran in innovation and wealth creation.
But since March, with Wall Street valuing infant Internet companies that have never made a profit in the same range as car makers and airlines, Silicon Alley has witnessed initial public offerings at the rate of one a week. And as investor fervor for Internet companies threatens to fade, the sprint for I.P.O.'s, as the offerings are known, has only picked up speed.
Even as Internet stocks faltered last week -- iVillage, for example, lost almost 10 percent of its value in one day -- three New York-based companies launched themselves on the public market to a respectable reception. And shares of StarMedia Networks, the most highly anticipated of last week's offerings, closed 74 percent above its initial offering price of $15 per share on Wednesday, its first day of trading.
"It's unbelievable, it's surreal -- it's good, I guess, would be the sound bite," said Fernando Espuelas, 32, who three years ago created StarMedia, which provides Internet access in Latin America. The I.P.O., he said, has made him worth $162 million on paper. "Wow, that's the first time I've said it out loud. It's kind of weird."
The Internet boom has created as many as a thousand paper millionaires among the founders and executives of Silicon Alley companies, said Uri Kaufthal, the president of AST StockPlan, which administers the stock benefit packages for several of them. Many junior employees among Silicon Alley's more than 100,000 workers -- at companies ranging from financial information services to Web site developers -- have collected enough to pay off student loans or consider buying an apartment.
In a city where the well-worn paths to success have led through the trading floor or the ranks of large media corporations, the emergence of sudden Internet-bred wealth holds out the promise of much quicker rewards. It is exposing New Yorkers to the Silicon Valley culture of entrepreneurial risk. And it is prompting resentment, envy and a scramble to be a part of it.
"All of us had friends on Wall Street who always made so damn much money," said Sunny Bates, an executive recruiter for New York-based Internet companies. "Now you can make a lot of money and you don't have to be an investment banker. Everybody wants to get on the train."
Still, Silicon Alley is not embracing the I.P.O. life style without a healthy dose of apprehension.
For one thing, the seeming arbitrariness of who is getting rich can be disconcerting, even for those who are now buying BMW's. Those at start-ups that have yet to issue a prospectus wonder whether their chance will come before it is too late. Workers in the Internet divisions of traditional media companies yearn for their operations to be spun off and taken public.
Meanwhile, veterans of other industries worry that a generation is emerging with the expectation that working late nights for a couple of years at the right company should make them set for retirement. And among some early denizens of the Alley, many of whom started out with the conviction that technology could democratize society and create new modes of expression, there is a sense of loss as talk turns from changing the world to when their options vest.
"There used to be a sense that we were on the cusp of a significant change that was at once economic and cultural," said Jason Chervokas, the editor of @NewYork, an industry newsletter that was recently bought by MecklerMedia. "But the original idea, which was, hey, let's build a medium with a new hip, gender-neutral image, has fallen by the wayside, and I regret that, I really do. The sense that you're allowed to experiment has been replaced by pressure for quarterly results."
For Alley veterans and newcomers alike, it can be hard getting used to running into 20-year-old millionaires at parties in downtown lofts.
"Being around this kind of gargantuan 'monetizing' day in, day out -- it warps your mind," Marisa Bowe, the editor of the on-line magazine Word, wrote in a recent essay in The New York Observer about watching her Silicon Alley friends cash in. "Just a few years ago, we were dance or literature majors, actors with day jobs. Now we live in a strange world where it seems as if every 10th person has won the lottery."
 
A Fast Ride On the Money Wave
But for bystanders, the logic of I.P.O. winnings is somehow harder to swallow than the luck of the lottery. Paul Debraccio, who spent 15 years selling advertising at the magazine publisher Conde Nast before doing the same at a lower salary for an Internet company, Tripod Inc., says some of his former colleagues have a hard time understanding how he has come to be bidding on real estate in the Hamptons this spring.
"The average person just can't conceive that in two or three years you can become a millionaire without having started your own company," said Mr. Debraccio, whose options in Tripod were converted to stock worth over $1.5 million when the company was sold to New York-based Lycos Inc. last year. "At Conde Nast, the most you could make is $500,000 a year, and that's if you were a publisher."
Mr. Debraccio is now the senior vice president for advertising at Uproar, an Internet games company in New York that trades on the Vienna exchange but may soon offer shares in the United States. As is typical for Internet company employees, he accepted a lower salary in exchange for stock options. "Part of it is about riding the money wave," he said. "This is probably going to turn out good as well."
Dave Kansas, the editor of the on-line financial news service TheStreet.com, is less sanguine about his paper wealth, which hovers around $9 million and has in recent days served as a somewhat obsessive topic of conversation in The Wall Street Journal's newsroom, where he used to be a reporter. (On May 11, the day his company went public, Mr. Kansas received several E-mail messages from former colleagues along these lines: "Dave, I was just going to lunch, but I'm a little short today. Do you think . . .")
"I've sacrificed a lot over the last three years," said Mr. Kansas, 32. "Can I value it at $9 million? I don't know."
Indeed, even the biggest evangelists of the Internet wealth culture wax insecure about its scale -- and its future. That is in part because Federal regulations require that institutional investors and senior executives hold onto their stock for six months after the initial public offering. (Junior employees are not subject to those restrictions.) Moreover, stock options that are granted to employees typically vest over a four-year period, so just how rich somebody is depends on how many options they actually own and whether the stock price holds up until they can exercise them.
"It's Monopoly money -- I don't count it," said Fred Wilson, a co-founder of Flatiron Partners, the New York venture capital firm that has financed several of the most successful Internet companies to go public lately, including TheStreet.com, theglobe.com and StarMedia. "You can watch your value go up and down millions a day and you can't do anything about it. It's surreal."
The giddy tone at many of the city's cyber-celebrations and the frequency with which new-media employees check the company stock price underscores the anxiety that their net worth is housed within a speculative bubble that is destined to pop. It is a fear that plagues the industry well beyond New York.
"Historically, to make a gazillion dollars in the computer business you had to have a good product, and there was pretty clear evidence about what made it good -- i.e., people bought it," said Jonathan Weber, the editor of the Industry Standard, a trade publication that follows the Internet economy. "The Internet boom and the I.P.O. phenomenon is so speculative that what separates certain companies from the pack is not always that obvious."
 
Finding Rewards In a Different Risk
Still, many who have benefited even modestly from the boom remember when their friends and families scoffed at their choice to forsake more traditional careers for this strange thing known as the Internet. They do not quite see why the risk of their own opportunities should be deemed less worthy of reward than the risks, say, that investment bankers take with other people's money.
For instance, Kate Hanley's starting salary at iVillage in 1996 was $15,000 less than the book editing job she was offered at Fairchild Communications. But as one of the first 30 employees of the company, she was granted 333 stock options at $6 per share. (iVillage's shares closed Friday at $47.875 -- less than half the price attained on the day it went public but still a healthy premium for Ms. Hanley's options, three-quarters of which have vested. She has not cashed them in.)
Ms. Hanley was also given "friends and family" options, which allow employees and others designated by the management team to buy stock at the initial offering price. The proceeds from that stock, which Ms. Hanley bought at $24 and sold at the opening price of $95, netting her about $25,000, served as a down payment for the Chelsea apartment that she moved into this month.
"People act as though I found this money in a bag on the street," said Ms. Hanley, 29, a producer for iVillage's computing site. "It's like, where were you when I was working for the last three years till 9 or 10 at night and on weekends?"
For Ms. Hanley's friend Annie Rhodes, 28, who works at ToggleThis, another Internet company three blocks away, the iVillage public offering was bittersweet.
"When they went public, I was sort of kicking myself,"' said Ms. Rhodes, who left iVillage two years ago and missed out on cashing in. "But it's also exciting. Until you know people who have hit it big with options, it doesn't really seem real. Now it seems like, God, it's not a joke. This could happen to us."
Filled with that sense of promise, business school students who used to head straight to the finance courses that would get them to Goldman Sachs are packing into the electronic commerce class at Columbia and oversubscribing the entrepreneurial course at New York University.
Those with M.B.A.'s are not the only ones to be drawn by the prospect of entrepreneurial freedom and fabulous wealth. Ken Perlin, a professor of computer science and the director of the Media Research Laboratory at New York University, said the Internet boom had changed the orientation of his students, particularly since Yahoo bought Webcal, the Web calendar that one of the laboratory students developed, for $12 million in stock last July.
"Young people in this field think they should be millionaires, and that's a new phenomenon," Professor Perlin said. "The concern is that it's deceptive. I know a number of students who tried to make a go of it and it didn't work."
But if there is angst or self-loathing among some of those who have tried their hand in Silicon Alley, Jeff Dachis, a co-founder of Razorfish, an Internet services company that went public April 27, does not share it.
"I don't want to be lumped in with the hucksters of the world, because we have the real deal," said Mr. Dachis, 32, who bought a BMW 5-series as an I.P.O. gift to himself. "I feel completely and utterly entitled to whatever success comes our way. Not everybody's good, not everybody has the winning idea, not every idea deserves to be funded or to be public. I'm sorry, but there are sheep and there are shepherds, and I fancy myself to be the latter."
Andrew Zolli, the vice president of the interactive division of the advertising firm Siegal & Gale, said he spent a week of sleepless nights pondering his past and future after watching friends and former colleagues at Razorfish make millions this month. Finally, though, he came to peace.
"I love my job, and ultimately I believe this is still the most important medium of the next half century, and our ultimate judge is not the size of our bank accounts," said Mr. Zolli, 28. "When this insanity passes, what will matter is who had the really good ideas and good work. I really believe that."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Monday about the flurry of initial public offerings among new-media companies based in New York misstated the reason senior executives are often unable to sell their stock for several months after the start of trading. The practice is dictated by contracts between the companies and their underwriters, not by Federal regulations. The article also misidentified the headquarters of Lycos Inc., an Internet company. Although it has a sales and marketing office in Manhattan, it is based in Waltham, Mass.
The article also misspelled the name of a strategic-communications firm. It is Siegel & Gale, not Siegal.

HEADLINE: Critic of CUNY, Badillo, Chosen To Head Board

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki has named Herman Badillo, a sharp critic of the City University of New York and a primary force behind efforts to change it, as its next chairman.
The appointment gives Mr. Badillo, 69, a lawyer who has been CUNY's vice chairman and a close ally of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the opportunity to shape one of New York City's most important educational institutions, one with 200,000 students, at a time of enormous ferment. He will also be able to fill many top positions that are now open at the university and its 17 undergraduate colleges. 
 Like many public urban universities, CUNY draws many students who are not viewed as prime college material: welfare mothers, immigrants who speak little or no English, students from inner-city neighborhoods who have little to show for their high school years. And at a time of budget cutting and a renewed focus on standards, the education of these students has become a hotly debated issue.
Many CUNY traditionalists say that the university must not abandon its mission to admit all students and to try to help them. But Mr. Badillo and other critics, including the Mayor and Governor, have long accused CUNY of squandering its resources on weak students who never graduate.
"There is no question in my mind that CUNY needs reform," Governor Pataki said in a telephone interview yesterday. "Herman Badillo has a knowledge of the system, he's a product of the system and he has a vision for the system. That all made it plain that he's the man to reform CUNY."
To achieve that reform, CUNY's critics say, the university must set higher admissions standards to encourage applicants to work harder in high school, push students to complete remedial work and earn degrees more quickly, and establish tougher requirements for graduation so that a CUNY degree will be more respected.
"We need to make sure that the value of the City University diploma is accepted anywhere in New York City or the world," Mr. Badillo said. "That is my goal."
But critics of Mr. Badillo's efforts to transform CUNY expressed alarm at his appointment, which was first reported yesterday in The Daily News, and said it would result in further disarray.
"When the fox guards the chickens, you don't expect to have anything left except skin and bones," said Sandi E. Cooper a CUNY history professor and former chairwoman of its faculty Senate.
Edward C. Sullivan, chairman of the State Assembly's Committee on Higher Education, called the appointment "an insult."
"The CUNY board is in chaos, so why would the Governor want to reward the purveyor of chaos?" he said.
And Robert Hollander, a CUNY graduate student and adjunct professor, said he viewed Mr. Badillo as "CUNY's worst enemy," someone who did not appreciate CUNY's mission to provide both access and excellence to students.
Mr. Badillo said his intention was not to harm the university, but to improve it.
"I have no desire to curtail its traditional function as a gateway for the poor, but to do it even better," he said.
Partly because of Mr. Badillo's prodding, CUNY faces basic questions on the role it should play, how it is structured and run, and crucial policies like criteria for admissions and graduation. CUNY estimates that at least 60 percent of New York City high school students go on to CUNY, either directly from high school or later.
Mr. Badillo said his first three steps would be to find a new chancellor, to prepare CUNY's response to the State Board of Regents as it reviews the university's new policy on remedial students, and to respond to Mayor Giuliani's task force on CUNY, which is expected to release its findings on CUNY soon.
"The timing is perfect," Mr. Badillo said. "All three of these things will define CUNY's priorities."
CUNY's top policy slot opened last week when Anne A. Paolucci, the university's chairwoman, resigned unexpectedly. Dr. Paolucci, a former English professor at St. John's University and expert on Pirandello, never developed a close working relationship with the Governor. She said last week that she wanted to return to her scholarly work and would leave CUNY's board tomorrow. Mr. Badillo's appointment will take effect then.
Dr. Paolucci was unusual in coming from academia; like Mr. Badillo, most of CUNY's chairmen have been lawyers or businessmen with close political connections.
Mr. Badillo, a former Congressman, Bronx borough president and Deputy Mayor, has worked closely with Mayor Giuliani and his senior adviser on education. Both men say that CUNY does not set high enough standards for entering students and for graduation and that it allows students to spend too long in remedial classes.
At a time when the Mayor is battling for greater control over the city's public schools, the appointment of his ally Mr. Badillo appears to give Mr. Giuliani a more direct hand in CUNY. And it could deflect some criticism that CUNY is ignoring the interests of Hispanic and other minority students.
Mayor Giuliani, speaking during a visit to a fire station in Forest Hills, Queens, yesterday, said that Mr. Badillo's task would be "changing a culture of total failure."
"It's changing a culture that embraces a 1-percent graduation rate and tries to defend it, excuse it and alibi for it as opposed to dramatically trying to change it," the Mayor said, referring to the low percentage of CUNY community college students who graduate in two years. "He has got to have everyone take a leap of faith toward high standards."
CUNY has been a lower priority for Governor Pataki, as for many governors. The university was largely a city responsibility until the state took over most of the city's financial support for CUNY in the late 1970's after the city's budget crisis. And Mr. Badillo, a seasoned politician, has made himself a ready link between the Governor's mansion and the university, earning the Governor's trust.
"Anyone who ignores the Mayor and the Governor is a fool," Mr. Badillo said yesterday. "The money comes from the Mayor and the Governor and the policies come from the Mayor and the Governor. They are the top elected officials. That is why I get along with them; I understand that."
The Governor, who has the responsibility for selecting CUNY's chairman and vice chairman from among its 17 trustees, has joined with the Mayor and Mr. Badillo in charging that CUNY's standards are unacceptably low, and privately criticized Dr. Paolucci for not moving fast enough to remake CUNY.
Over the last year, there was wide speculation that he would ask her to resign as soon as he had someone to replace her and a more secure majority on the often-divided board.
The Governor said yesterday that Dr. Paolucci had started the reform process, but that CUNY still needed significant improvement.
"There is no question in my mind that CUNY needs reform," he said, "whether it is the failure of some campuses to educate their students properly or that so many of their teachers graduate who are unprepared to teach."
While Governor Pataki and Mayor Giuliani have had various public spats -- including the recent one on the repeal of New York City's commuter tax -- the Governor said yesterday that he and the Mayor "have a common view on the need to improve CUNY."
Mr. Badillo, a native of Puerto Rico who graduated from City College, has been vice chairman of CUNY's board since February 1997, when the Governor appointed him at the same time he named Dr. Paolucci chairwoman. Since then he has often been its effective leader.
After he learned that students at Hostos Community College were being allowed to graduate even if they could not pass CUNY's placement exam in writing in 1997, he formulated a policy requiring all community college students to pass the test to graduate. Over great protest from some students and faculty members, the board adopted the policy.
Working closely with both the Mayor and the Governor, Mr. Badillo was also the main architect behind the controversial remedial education policy passed by CUNY's trustees last year. The policy will bar students from entering CUNY's bachelor's degree programs if they fail to pass placement examinations in reading, writing and mathematics.
The policy is scheduled to be phased in beginning in January, but the Regents have said they intend to review it and have raised questions about its impact and whether it will change CUNY's mission.
Other appointments on the board could come in June and give Mr. Badillo a more secure majority than he and Dr. Paolucci have had. Of the 17 trustees, the Governor appoints 10 and the Mayor appoints 5, and the students and faculty each elect one, although the faculty trustee does not have a vote.
The Governor will be able to replace both James P. Murphy and Edith Everett, two trustees who frequently oppose Mr. Badillo. John J. Calandra, another gubernatorial appointee whose term is up, is more likely to be reappointed, since he has been a strong Badillo supporter.
The Mayor can also make two new appointments in June if he wishes, to replace Richard B. Stone and Ronald J. Marino. Both have generally backed Mr. Badillo, but are seen as being somewhat independent.
With the board in flux, CUNY faces several important actions.
One is the release of a yearlong investigation of the university commissioned by Mayor Giuliani to advise him on how to restructure it and how to privatize remedial education. Mr. Badillo, a member of that panel, said that the commission report "will set our goalposts of what to do," and that he would take its recommendations to the other trustees.
Mr. Badillo was first appointed to CUNY's board by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in the early 1980's and was later reappointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. But it was not until Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki appointed trustees to the board three years ago that he had enough allies to press his agenda for change.
Other areas that Mr. Badillo would like to see changed are CUNY's curriculum -- he sees the new core curriculum adopted by the State University in December as an attractive model -- and its grading policy. He has accused CUNY's colleges of widespread grade inflation and setting the bar too low for graduation with honors.
But he said his first task was to reopen the search for a chancellor. The post has been filled by an interim chancellor, Christoph M. Kimmich, since the 1997 resignation of W. Ann Reynolds, who had battled with Dr. Paolucci and other trustees.
"That is the most important thing we have to do," Mr. Badillo said. "I want a strong personality, someone who is familiar with the problems of the City University, and someone who will move decisively."

A New Sort of Company Invests in Community Papers

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: CULLMAN, Ala.

 BODY:
Before sound bites, before the press was called the media, before the talk of broadband communications, narrowcasting or dot-com Web portals, there was The Cullman Times.
The Times, which sells 10,358 copies daily, has been there for 43 years. And it is still there for big events: it was the first to tell many of its readers of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. More recently, it let them know when $13.50 worth of gasoline was stolen from the grocery-store pumps on Route 278. It went nuts over the state championship girls' basketball team from Cold Springs High School. It regularly notes who is admitted and discharged from the Cullman Regional Medical Center. 
 The Times is one of 940 daily newspapers around the country with circulations of 20,000 or less. Many such newspapers once had profit margins only a family could love. But recently, while attention was focused on cable and Internet companies, these far-flung atolls of the information age have been bought, sold and swapped like the most valuable properties in a manic Monopoly game.
In 1997 and 1998, more than 300 daily newspapers changed hands, according to Owen Van Essen, whose firm, Dirks, Van Essen & Associates in Santa Fe, N.M., brokers newspaper sales.
In the process, a new generation of companies is emerging with a different profile than earlier groups. The newcomers have borrowed the strategy -- favored by Thomson Newspapers and others -- of buying clusters of newspapers in one geographic area, sharing printing and accounting operations and offering big regional advertisers five or six papers in a single buy. But unlike the established publishing companies, which acquire large and small newspapers in both rural and urban settings, the newcomers have focused exclusively on community newspapers in out-of-the-way regions where the skies are truly dark at night.
Leading the new wave is a company in Birmingham, Ala., called Community Newspaper Holdings Inc., which bought The Times and 44 other newspapers late last year and, in the process, became the biggest little-newspaper company in the country with 95 dailies and 125 weeklies.
What's more, Community Newspaper Holdings is a rarity: its sole investor is a pension fund, which has provided all its working capital. The Retirement Systems of Alabama, which has $22 billion in assets, has loaned the company $1.13 billion to buy newspapers.
What would a pension fund want with small newspapers, the bottom end of a business that is, in the polite put-down of the financial world, mature? Small newspapers are suffering from the same problems as their larger brethren: declining circulation and limited growth potential for the ink-on-paper product. But Community Newspaper and others see gold in the steady if unspectacular cash flow of small businesses that often operate with little or no competition.
There are other incentives. Think synergy at its most basic. The director of the Alabama pension fund, David Bronner, wanted a solid return on his investment and a media platform from which to sing the virtues of his adopted state of Alabama. With Community Newspaper, he gets both.
John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst, set up the pension fund manager's calculation like this: "I can invest in the bond market and earn five or six percent -- or I can invest in all of these teeny cash-flow engines stuck all over the place" for double that return.
"Even if we have a national recession," Mr. Morton added, "these are pretty durable."
That durability, however, depends on putting the right combination of newspapers together. Not all regions fit Community Newspaper's vision. Ralph J. Martin, the company's top executive, is looking for areas with stable or growing populations, far enough away from large television markets that there are few competitors for local advertising dollars.
He has developed a rough formula. For long-term economic stability, Mr. Martin said, it helps if a newspaper is near a county seat (lawyers tend to be newspaper readers; governments take out legal advertising); near large educational and medical institutions (educated work force, recession-resistant employers); near large government operations (recession-resistant, stable employers), and near an Interstate highway (truck traffic and tourism keeps communities healthy).
He has selected Community Newspaper's newspapers with an eye to minimizing the effects of an economic downturn. Mr. Martin, the president and chief executive of Community Newspaper Holdings, said recessions tend to hit the country at large for 18 months to two years; in markets that fit his formula, he said, recessions have lasted eight months or less. To further reduce risk, he is diversifying. Community Newspaper's publications are based in a mixed basket of micro-economies in places from northern New York to Kentucky to Texas, reducing the risk that all the revenue streams would dry up simultaneously.
Even so, newspapers are not exactly a traditional investment for a pension fund, but then again, Mr.Bronner is not exactly a traditional pension fund manager. His investments have also included a Manhattan skyscraper -- 55 Water Street -- a steel mill in Birmingham, chemical plants in Mobile, Ala., a Wal-Mart distribution center in Cullman, and his favorite, a series of golf courses around his adopted state.
Norman Stein, a law professor and pension specialist at the University of Alabama, said some pension fund members regarded Mr. Bronner as "something of a genius."
"He does a lot of unorthodox things," Mr. Stein said. "He's an entrepreneur in an industry that is dominated by passive investors."
When Mr. Bronner took over the fund in 1973, Mr. Stein said, it had $500 million in assets -- "one dollar for every four dollars we owed." In 25 years, the assets have grown to $22 billion.
"There is a reason to be out on the cutting edge on some of the things I do," Mr. Bronner said. "But I think about it very hard."
Investment decisions, he said, are made for financial reasons first, and then are designed to meet one other unique criterion: "Can I change the image of Alabama?"
So when the state got a round of terrible publicity in 1990, when the Professional Golfers' Association held its tournament at an all-white country club, Mr. Bronner's response was to pour $120 million in Retirement Systems funds into a string of state-of-the-art golf courses, open to all. The Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail now has 324 holes to play in seven locations around the state.
Then Mr. Bronner wanted to spread the word. Which is where the newspapers come in. In addition to interest rates ranging from 9 to 10.4 percent, the Retirement Systems of Alabama requires, as a condition of its loans to Community Newspaper, that the company's papers provide free advertising space to the pension fund to promote the virtues of Alabama. (He made a similar deal when he invested in a small television company.)
Community Newspaper's creators had different, though complementary, agendas. Mr. Martin had worked for another large chain and wanted to run a company of his own. One of the company's other partners, Tom Lindley 3d, is a reporter turned editor turned publisher, who is living out old daydreams of running his hometown newspaper.
On paper, the company's financial goals fit Mr. Lindley's notion of the right balance between profit and investment in journalism. The interest payments to the pension fund consume 9 to 10 percent of Community Newspaper's profit; the overall margins expected from the newspapers, Mr. Martin said, range from 19 to 26 percent. That is well below the 30 percent-plus margins of some Wall Street favorites, like the Gannett Company. But Mr. Martin said he preferred to reinvest the difference in presses, computer technology and journalists.
"When the first generation of chaining was going on," Mr. Martin, a former executive at Thomson Newspapers, said, "there was so much opportunity from a consolidation standpoint" that executives focused on efficiency. "I don't think there was an attack on news," he added. "It just fell through the cracks."
He added that he wanted local editorial autonomy, and said he offered only a few guidelines. Editors and publishers may not double as local political leaders and no article may be run unless the subject of the piece has had a fair chance to present his or her side.
Mr. Martin has encouraged the 53 Community Newspaper publications in Oklahoma to create a common statehouse bureau that none could have afforded on its own; the bureau opened four months ago.
There is a question as to whether the state of Alabama, through its pension fund, could have a financial interest in a paper like The Cullman Times without tainting its journalism. Will Alabama get kid-glove treatment from Community Newspaper? "No," Mr. Bronner said, "because I know we will drag one foot forward and shoot it off every once in a while." All he wants, he said, is to make clear that "there are some positive aspects along with the negative aspects."
That philosophy did not work well at one twice-weekly newspaper, The Floyd County Times in eastern Kentucky, which Community Newspaper bought last year. The newspaper lost two senior reporters after a dispute with the publisher installed last year -- Mr. Martin's brother Ed. As described in the current issue of American Journalism Review, the reporters covering the corruption-ridden, economically depressed community balked at Ed Martin's insistence that, when it comes to news, "good and bad have the same weight."
Edward C. Dowling Jr., editor and publisher of The Cullman Times, said in a recent interview that a classic newspaper company mistake "is to think that all markets are the same and can be approached in a cookie-cutter fashion." He wants the latitude to earn his community's respect.
Mr. Lindley, who is also editor and publisher of The Evening News in Jeffersonville, Ala., has similar aims.
In fact, Mr. Lindley was the matchmaker between the two key players in Community Newspaper. He introduced Ralph Martin to David Bronner in late 1996. One of Mr. Bronner's conditions, on making the initial loan, was that Mr. Lindley would be one of the company's owners.
Mr. Lindley had first-hand experience of what small-town newspapers can go through. When he arrived at The Evening News (circulation 10,305) in August 1995, he said that he found a demoralized staff. Starting salaries for reporters were $265 a week. Just a few months before, a feature writer had been living in a homeless shelter. When Mr. Lindley asked the dean of Indiana University's journalism school to give him the names of prospective reporters, he said, he was told, "We don't recommend your newspaper."
He started to make changes. Then in mid-1997, the owners of Park Communications Inc., who had hired him, sold their newspapers to Media General Inc., now part of Cox Communications Inc. When Mr. Martin, who was running Park's newspaper division, called to tell him of the sale, Mr. Lindley urged Mr. Martin to form his own company and buy some of those properties -- like The Evening News -- back from Media General.
Mr. Martin had long thought about running his own chain, but was not sure where to get the capital. So Mr. Lindley introduced him to Mr. Bronner, whom he had covered as a statehouse reporter for The Birmingham News.
Mr. Martin and Mr. Bronner hit it off, and Mr. Bronner agreed to provide the company with working capital. In January 1997, Community Newspaper Holdings was formed with 13 former Park Communications newspapers. Then Mr. Martin went looking for more. Community Newspaper's most recent big deals brought it 28 newspapers from Donrey Media Group last September and 45 more from Hollinger Inc. in December.
For the moment, Mr. Martin said, Community Newspaper is resting on its laurels. Some future acquisitions and adjustments may be made, but none are on the immediate horizon.
Mr. Lindley now worries about both profit and news, but more about news. "If we don't do a good job in that regard, then the money will never come," he said. He has hired a city editor and a photographer, neither of which the paper had. As of now, he said, "It's not great yet, but it's gotten better."
The news staff is up from 9 to 11 and starting salaries are up 35 percent, to about $360. And letters to the editor are pouring in; at the end of last month's mayoral race, Mr. Lindley found the angry incumbent mayor banging on his door on a Saturday night, "scorched" in Mr. Lindley's word, by letters he didn't like.
At The Cullman Times, Mr. Dowling is still getting to know his new bosses. He said he had not lost "the local autonomy to do what we need to do."
"We want to be heavily involved in this community," he said. "We want to be a cheerleader when people deserve it, and we want to scold people that need scolding."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Monday about companies that own small newspapers misstated the ownership of Media General. It is independent, not part of Cox Communications.
An article and a picture caption in Business Day last Monday about companies that own small newspapers misstated the location of The Evening News, owned by Community Newspaper Holdings. It is in Jefferson, Ind., not in Alabama. The article also misstated the surname of the editor and publisher of The Cullman (Ala.) Times. He is Edward C. Darling Jr., not Dowling.

Chart: "Strength in Numbers"
Community Newspaper Holdings buys newspapers in areas that the company believes are resistant to recession because they are near one or more of the following: a county seat; a large educational or medical institution; an Interstate highway; or a large government operation. The company also looks for papers close enough to one another to share services like printing, and to entice advertisers by offering multiple ad placements. One cluster of papers that the company owns is in Oklahoma:
 
Checotah
PAPER -- McIntosh County Democrat (weekly)
ATTRACTION -- Intersection of two major highways
 
Eufaula
PAPERS -- Indian Journal (weekly), Lake Eufaula World (weekly)
